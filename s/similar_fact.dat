25|$|Prior to Bracton, {{there was}} little use of stare decisis. This was because the rolls {{containing}} the court records were largely unavailable for scrutiny, even by judges sitting on the bench.

The availability of previous decisions, even if 20 or more years old proved to be of great interest to nearly all practitioners of the law. This led directly to the Year Books.

[...] Three male slaves: [...] Jupiter, Tom Boiler and his brother Simon Boiler, were whipped to death. Slaves Margaret and Else died after boiling water was poured down their throats. Evidence was presented that Hodge was cruel to child slaves, including his own offspring: [...] Bella, a small mulatto girl of about 8 years of age, who was his offspring by his slave, Peggy; and that he held the heads of several mulatto children, possibly also sired by him, under water until they lost consciousness, then revived them, and repeated the process.

6000|$|... 3d. Muscular exercise, {{prolonged}} to exhaustion, {{diminishes the}} muscular irritability. This {{is a well-known}} truth, dependent on the most general laws of muscular action, and proved by experiments under the Method of Difference, constantly repeated. Now, {{it has been shown}} by observation that overdriven cattle, if killed before recovery from their fatigue, become rigid and putrefy in a surprisingly short time. A <b>similar</b> <b>fact</b> has been observed in the case of animals hunted to death; cocks killed during or shortly after a fight; and soldiers slain in the field of battle. These various cases agree in no circumstance, directly connected with the muscles, except that these have just been subjected to exhausting exercise. Under the canon, therefore, of the Method of Agreement, it may be inferred that there is a connection between the two facts. The Method of Agreement, indeed, as has been shown, is not competent to prove causation. The present case, however, is already known to be a case of causation, it being certain that the state of the body after death must somehow depend upon its state at the time of death. We are, therefore, warranted in concluding that the single circumstance in which all the instances agree, is the part of the antecedent which is the cause of that particular consequent.|$|E
6000|$|Species of {{different}} genera and classes {{have not changed}} at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still {{be found in the}} midst of a multitude of extinct forms. Falconer has given a striking instance of a <b>similar</b> <b>fact,</b> in an existing crocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian Molluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions of the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking instance has lately been observed in Switzerland. There is some reason to believe that organisms, considered high in the scale of nature, change more quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, does not strictly correspond with the succession of our geological formations; so that between each two consecutive formations, the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree. Yet if we compare any but the most closely related formations, all the species will be found to have undergone some change. When a species has once disappeared from the face of the earth, we have reason to believe that the same identical form never reappears. The strongest apparent exception to this latter rule, is that of the so-called [...] "colonies" [...] of M. Barrande, which intrude for a period {{in the midst of a}}n older formation, and then allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell's explanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical province, seems to me satisfactory. {314} ...|$|E
60|$|The {{examples}} now quoted, besides illustrating {{and enforcing}} the general fact of evolution, throw {{some light on}} the usual character of the modification and progression of animal forms. In the cases where the geological record is tolerably complete, we find a continuous development of some kind--either in complexity of ornamentation, as in the fossil Paludinas of the Hungarian lake-basins; in size and in the specialisation of the feet and teeth, as in the American fossil horses; or in the increased development of the branching horns, as in the true deer. In each of these cases specialisation and adaptation to the conditions of the environment appear to have reached their limits, and any change of these conditions, especially if it be at all rapid or accompanied by the competition of less developed but more adaptable forms, is liable to cause the extinction of the most highly developed groups. Such we know {{was the case with the}} horse tribe in America, which totally disappeared in that continent at an epoch so recent that we cannot be sure that the disappearance was not witnessed, perhaps caused, by man; while even in the Eastern hemisphere it is the smaller species--the asses and the zebras--that have persisted, while the larger and more highly developed true horses have almost, if not quite, disappeared in a state of nature. So we find, both in Australia and South America, that in a quite recent period many of the largest and most specialised forms have become extinct, while only the smaller types have survived to our day; and a <b>similar</b> <b>fact</b> is to be observed in many of the earlier geological epochs, a group progressing and reaching a maximum of size or complexity and then dying out, or leaving at most but few and pigmy representatives.|$|E

60|$|General Remarks.--As {{there are}} only two species as yet known, and as these {{resemble}} each other in every respect most closely, a generic description would be a useless repetition of the full details given under Ibla Cumingii. I have taken this latter species as the type, from having, owing to the kindness of Mr. Cuming, better and more numerous specimens. Ibla and Lithotrya are the only two recent genera in which the body of the animal is lodged within the peduncle; but there is no distinction of any importance, though useful for classification, between the capitulum and peduncle; and these two parts, as we have seen, tend to blend together in some species of Conchoderma and Alepas. The entire absence of calcareous matter in the valves and spines of the peduncle, at first appears very remarkable; but we have seen a <b>similar</b> <b>fact</b> in Alepas, and there is an approach to it in some varieties of Conchoderma aurita and C. virgata. In all four valves of Ibla, the umbones, or centres of growth, are at their upper points. The horny spines on the peduncle, are the analogues of the calcareous scales in Scalpellum and Pollicipes; and in this latter genus, two of the species have their scales, almost cylindrical, placed irregularly, with new ones forming over all parts of the surface, and not exclusively at the summit,--in which several respects there is an agreement with Ibla. The shape of the body (i. e. thorax and prosoma, Pl. IV, fig. 8 a´) is peculiar; but it is only a slight exaggeration of what we have seen in several genera, and shall meet again in some species of Scalpellum. The presence of hairs on the outer membrane of the prosoma is a peculiarity confined to this genus amongst the Lepadidæ, though observed in the sessile genus, Chthamalus. The caudal appendages in the I. quadrivalvis attain a greater length than in any other species of the family, being four times the length of the pedicels of the sixth cirrus. A far more important peculiarity is the fact of the oesophagus, in both species, running over or exteriorly to the adductor scutorum muscle, instead of, as in every other species, close under this muscle. I took great pains in ascertaining the truth of this singular anomaly: the course of the oesophagus is approximately represented in Pl. IV, fig. 8 a´ by faint dotted lines. The stomach has no cæca; the biliary folds are longitudinal; there is a marked constriction at the line corresponding with the junction of the thorax and prosoma. There are no filamentary appendages.|$|E
