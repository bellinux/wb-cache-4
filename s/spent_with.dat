5|$|Few {{people in}} London {{other than their}} close friends knew that the couple were not married. Hogg's family had heard rumours that he was {{planning}} to marry, and had been curious to know whom he had chosen. They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane.

Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had <b>spent</b> <b>with</b> Jane.|$|E
