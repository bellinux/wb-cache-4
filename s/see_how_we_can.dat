[...] Taylor's deputy, U. Alexis Johnson felt the discussion had become counterproductive and was increasing the problem. He suggested that should the generals feel unwilling to alter their position immediately, they should refrain from actions that would preclude a later change of heart. He proposed they merely announce the removal of certain members of the HNC rather than the dissolution of the entire body, hoping the HNC could be reconstituted with figures they deemed to be more satisfactory. The four officers did not give a clear answer to Johnson's idea, indicating they had not made a concrete decision by saying [...] "the door is not closed".|$|E

Kỳ explained that the situation mandated {{the dissolution of the}} council, saying [...] "We know you want stability, but you cannot have stability until you have unity". He claimed that some HNC members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population and that [...] "both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence". Kỳ then promised that he would explain the decision at a media conference and that he and his colleagues would return to their military roles in the near future. Thiệu said [...] "I do not see how our action has hurt the Hương government ... Hương now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated".

We will program in simulink to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> simulate a sine wave and obtain a optimized wave. Also <b>we</b> will <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>can</b> <b>we</b> change the initial conditions of our parameters in simulation on the run. Secondly we will build a finite state machine that will show a tradeoff between position and velocity using sine wave. It is encountered with many usual problems. We will fix those problems using simulation in simulink at small intervals of time...|$|R
