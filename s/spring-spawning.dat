40|$|Shallow coastal ocean environments may {{function}} as important nursery habitats for juvenile bluefish, yet little ecological {{research has been}} conducted in ocean habitats. This thesis examines seasonal production, growth rates, and diet composition of juveniles in Maryland's coastal ocean environment and the Chesapeake Bay estuary. Summer-spawned juveniles dominated in ocean habitats and exhibited rapid growth rates, 2. 0 - 2. 4 mm d - 1, which were likely fueled by an abundant forage base of young-of-the-year bay anchovy present in ocean environments during late summer/early fall. This summer cohort was rare in the Chesapeake Bay, where <b>spring-spawned</b> juveniles dominated. These results suggest ocean habitats provide principal nurseries for summer-spawned bluefish, and that the Chesapeake Bay and other estuaries are principal nurseries for <b>spring-spawned</b> juveniles. Accordingly, year class strength is likely shaped by contributions of juveniles from both oceanic and estuarine nursery habitats...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —Previous {{field studies}} of {{bluefish}} Pomatomus saltatrix have documented variation in young-of-the-year (age- 0) growth rates among years and between spring- and summer-spawned cohorts. However, the potential factors responsible for generating variable growth in age- 0 bluefish {{have not been}} investigated. We constructed an individual-based model that combined size-dependent bluefish foraging with a bioenergetics model to quantify the potential effects of variable prey fish dynamics on first-summer growth of juvenile bluefish. We used long-term monitoring data to define baseline conditions and calibrate the model. We then performed three simulation experiments designed to assess the effects of initial density and arrival timing of prey species and bluefish cohorts on bluefish length distributions on October 1. Simulation experiments indicated that <b>spring-spawned</b> bluefish were robust to fluctuations in prey dynamics because of a spawning strategy that ensures temporal overlap with a diversity of prey fish species. In contrast, summer-spawned bluefish were sensitive to variation in prey fish dynamics because of their dependence on a single prey species. Model results also revealed {{the potential for the}} time of arrival and the initial density of the <b>spring-spawned</b> cohort to affect the growth of the summer-spawned cohort. Our findings demonstrate that population-level interactions between bluefish and their prey can be complex and have a considerable influence on the early growth rates of the summer-spawned cohort...|$|R

Temperature was lowered from 20 ° to 15 °C, then returned to 20 °C to match the seasonal cycle. The fish grew from a mean 198 mm to 320 mm (n= 67). Bluefish swam faster and in a more organized school during day (overall mean 47 cm/s) than at night (31 cm/s). Swimming speed declined in fall as temperature declined and accelerated in spring in response to change in photoperiod. Besides powered swimming, bluefish used a gliding-upswimming mode, {{which has not been}} previously described for this species. To glide, a bluefish rolled onto its side, ceased body and tail beating, and coasted diagonally downward. Bluefish glided in all months of the study, usually in the dark, and most intensely in winter. Energy savings while the fish is gliding and upswimming may be as much as 20...|$|R
5000|$|Coregonus trybomi is a {{freshwater}} whitefish in the Salmonidae family.

Polymorphism was screened at six micro-satellite loci and mtDNA for a total of 247 and 94 ciscoes, respectively. Microsatellite data showed a weak differentiation between <b>spring-spawning</b> Coregonus fontanae and sympatric C. albula in Lake Stechlin (FST 0 – 0008), whereas a significant differentiation was observed between <b>spring-spawning</b> Coregonus lucinensis and sympatric C. albula in Lake Breiter Luzin (FST 0013 – 0039). A more pronounced genetic difference was observed between both <b>spring-spawning</b> species (FST 005 – 0128). Shared mtDNA haplotypes among sympa-tric species within both Lake Stechlin and Lake Breiter Luzin were observed, whereas no haplotype was shared between C. fontanae and C. lucinensis.

40|$|Our {{objectives}} were {{to investigate the}} seasonal occurrence of photoidentified killer whale pods {{in relation to the}} distribution of Norwegian <b>spring-spawning</b> herring and whether or not pod-specific differences in the occurrence or diet of killer whales could be demonstrated. In a 4 -year study, the killer whales occurred in different areas during the summer and the fall–winter, and these areas coincided with the distribution areas of herring. Killer whales were encountered most frequently during October–January when the whole adult and part of the adolescent stock of <b>spring-spawning</b> herring wintered in the study area. Thirty-nine killer whale pods were identified, and generally the same pods were encountered each year of the study. Differences in the timing and areas of occurrence of pods could be demonstrated. Adult and adolescent herring seemed to be the main prey of the killer whales during both fall–winter and summer. Six new species were added to the list of known prey species of Norwegian killer whales.

Grouper larvae were collected from a transect across the Straits of Florida in 2003 and 2004 and during the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program spring and fall surveys from 1982 through 2005. Analysis of these larval data provided information on location and timing of spawning, larval distribution patterns, and interannual occurrence for a group of species not easily studied as adults. Our analyses indicated that shelf-edge habitat is important for spawning of many species of grouper—some species for which data were not previously available. Spawning for some species may occur year-round, but two peak seasons are evident: late winter and late summer through early fall. Interannual variability in the use of three important subregions by species or groups of species was partially explained by environmental factors (surface temperature, surface salinity, and water depth). A shift in species dominance over the last three decades from <b>spring-spawned</b> species (most of the commercial species) to fall-spawned species also was documented.

In this paper, we compare three different har-vesting strategies (proportional harvesting, threshold harvesting, and proportional threshold harvesting) in an autocorrelated and heavily fluctuating fishery — the Norwegian <b>spring-spawning</b> herring (Clupea harengus) — in terms of risk of quasi-extinction, average annual yield, and coefficient of varia-tion of the yield. Contrary to general expectations, {{we found that the}} three strategies produce comparable yields and risks of quasi-extinction.

40|$|In this paper, a three-country dynamic bio-economic {{simulation}} model is presented for the <b>spring-spawning</b> herring fishery. The international <b>spring-spawning</b> herring fishery, based on potentially {{one of the}} most valuable fish stocks in the world, is currently recovering from a severe depletion of the stock and subsequent harvesting moratorium. Management of the herring fishery is complicated by its multi-nation exploitation, due to the highly migratory behaviour of the species moving between several coastal state zones (exclusive economic zones, EEZ’s) and the high seas (Ocean Loop). Based on extensive work invested on analysing both the biology of the herring stock and the fisheries economics around its exploitation we study here the profiles of different multi-agent management schemes, simulating catch levels, stock size and profit potentials of alternative management strategies. The stock dynamics are described by a linear discrete-time age-structured population model and the economics are presented by a rent maximising model with constant price of herring catch and different costs of harvesting and efficiency levels for the different national fleets. The simulations, carried out over several decades, show that the benefits of international co-operation far exceed the returns of a competitive open access fishery.

The aim of this study was to survey the lower kilometer stretch of Hammerstaån in Stockholm, to investigate the extent to which the stream is used by <b>spring-spawning</b> fish. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate a new type of survey fishing gill net called strömöversiktsnät (SÖN). This was done by comparing the catch of fish by SÖN with that of fyke nets. The comparison of the types of gear included number of fish caught, on a catch per unit effort (CPUE) basis, number of species and the size distributions. The study included 14 days with one gill net and one fyke net at two sites, in total 28 net-days. The inventory yielded in total seventeen species among which only trout (Salmo trutta), perch (Perca fluvitalis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), burbot (Lota lota), eel (Anguilla anguilla) and pike (Esox lucius) were previously known to occur. Six spawning species, smelt (Osmerus eperlanus), vimba bream (Vimba vimba), perch (Perca fluvitalis), roach (Rutilus rutilus), bream (Abramis brama) and white bream (Blicka bjoerkna) were caught in more than 60 individuals, which was set as a limit for comparisons of size distributions.
