40|$|As {{with many}} shrimp fisheries, the North Sea brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) fishery has been characterised by {{by-catch}} and discarding of juvenile fish {{species that are}} of value to other fleet segments. To offset this externality, the mandatory use of veil nets or <b>separator</b> <b>panels</b> was introduced in 2003 for all vessels using an aggregate beam length of more than 8 [*]m. Sea trials prior to this date suggested that retained catch might be reduced by between 8 % and 35 %, depending on the area and season. These studies, however, do not consider the behavioural response by fishers to reduce this impact. In this study, the actual impact of the restrictions on the productivity of UK Crangon vessels was estimated using a production frontier approach. The ex post analysis suggests that a productivity decline of around 14 % has been experienced by UK vessels adopting this gear. Copyright (c) 2008 The Authors.

40|$|Tese de dout., Ciências e Tecnologias das Pescas, Faculdade de Ciências do Mar e do Ambiente, Univ. do Algarve, 2003 Scientific {{evidence}} {{points to}} the overfishing {{of some of the}} most important commercial stocks exploited in Portuguese waters (ICES sub-area IXa) by the bottom trawling fleets targeting fish and crustaceans. While temporary fishing interdiction has been implemented in specific areas off the south-west coast, in an attempt to reduce the fishing effort upon juvenile fish, there has been considerable resistance to the introduction of gear modifications, including the increase in cod end mesh sizes. The small cod end mesh sizes currently in use, particularly in crustacean trawling, largely contribute to catch discarding or misreporting, causing increasing conflicts between trawl fishermen and fishermen from other métiers competing for common resources. Recent studies have shown that discard rates can attain very high levels, up to 70 % on board of both crustacean and fish trawlers off the Portuguese south coast, with a high number of low-valued species, especially small pelagics, being discarded in large amounts. A number of gear modifications were tested in crustacean and fish trawls, aiming at reducing the amount of undersized fish from the target species and allowing for the escapement of a significant fraction of non-commercial by-catch. Their usefulness is discussed in a review, six papers and an overview of the thesis. The improvement of size-selectivity, by increasing cod end mesh size and changing mesh configuration was addressed for the deep groundfish assemblage off the south coast exploited by crustacean trawlers (Papers I and II), and for the shallow and deep groundfish assemblages off the south west coast, where a number of fish trawlers usually operate (Papers III and IV). Cod end selectivity parameters for three different mesh sizes and two mesh configurations, diamond and square mesh, were estimated for a large number of target and by-catch species. In a number of cases, the data structure allowed for the analysis of between-haul variation, and selectivity models were proposed which relate the estimated parameters to the variables under test and also to external variables such as cod end catch and trawling depth, giving a first insight into the mechanisms involved in cod end size selectivity. By-catch reducing devices (BRD’s) placed in the rear part of the trawls or in the cod end, comprising different combinations of oblique <b>separator</b> <b>panels</b> in association with square mesh windows, and square mesh windows alone, were tested in crustacean fishing grounds off the south coast (Papers V and VI), with the purpose of excluding the non-commercial by-catch. The effectiveness of the different BRD’s was separately evaluated for the most captured species. Between-species differences in behaviour towards the sorting devices are discussed. Sizedependence in escapement through the square mesh windows was recorded for a number of species, and the window selectivity could then be separately estimated. The cod end selectivity experiments carried out for crustacean trawling suggested that an increase in cod end mesh size from the current 55 mm to 70 mm diamond mesh, without changing cod end design or material, would be advisable in order to reduce the amount of undersized catch. Such an increase would simultaneously allow for the exclusion of a large fraction of non-commercial by-catch. The results obtained for fish trawling provide, on the other hand, evidence of the difficulty in managing a number of target species of different shapes and sizes based only on mesh size or mesh configuration regulations. The use of BRD’s greatly contributed to the exclusion of non-commercial by-catch. While evidence of active escape behaviour through the square mesh windows was found for some by-catch species, for others the exclusion from the trawl relied on previous guidance to upper trawl areas by the <b>separator</b> <b>panels</b> used. Overall, the results suggest a significant potential for the use of by-catch reducing devices in this fishery. Comissão Europeia.

40|$|The discard of finfish bycatch in the Gulf of Maine, {{northern}} shrimp trawl fishery {{is considered a}} serious problem. The species specific discard rate varied from 17 % for winter flounder to 95 % for silver hake in fifty tows made by commercial trawlers during the period 1985 - 1989 (Howell and Langan, 1990). Studies by Jean (1963) and Howell and Langan (1987) suggest a very high mortality for discarded finfish in the Western North Atlantic fisheries. The discard problem has two major facets: direct wastage in throwing back fish into the sea and loss of future catches of larger animals through the mortality of small individuals (Saila 1983). Given the perceived problem of discarded bycatch in the Gulf of Maine shrimp fishery, {{the objective of this}} project was to experiment with several design modifications to existing traditional trawls that would reduce the juvenile finfish bycatch. The concept of selective shrimp trawls is not novel. Trawl design modifications have been evaluated in shrimp fisheries to separate the finfish from the shrimp with varying success. The techniques utilize behavioral and size differences between shrimp and finfish, and include horizontal <b>separator</b> twine <b>panels,</b> large mesh escape panels, deflecting grids, accelerator funnels, and others. In this project, the northern style shrimp trawls served as the control nets. The basic modifications evaluated were: large mesh in belly area and a funnel accelerator ahead of the trawl cod-end...|$|R
40|$|By-catch and {{discards}} are {{a common}} problem to all fisheries. Recent studies of the Portuguese crustacean-trawl fishery show that discards average 70 % of the total catch. This situation poses a threat {{not only to the}} management of target and commercial fish by-catch species stocks, but also in terms of the ecosystem impact of the discarded species whose survival is generally low. Previous attempts to address this problem by using oblique <b>separator</b> mesh <b>panels</b> associated with square-mesh windows, or square-mesh windows alone, provided encouraging results, but these are unlikely to have commercial applicability at present. Therefore, we tested the efficiency of a modified Nordmore grid in excluding some of the most captured non-commercial by-catch species, such as the blue whiting, Micromesistius poutassou, and the boarfish, Capros aper, evaluating simultaneously the losses of the crustacean target species (rose shrimp, Parapenaeus longirostris, Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus and red shrimp, Aristeus antennatus) and commercially valuable fish by-catch. A total of 41 valid hauls were carried out during 2001, and 15 in 2002 on board the R/V "Noruega". Results from both years varied considerably, with higher by-catch exclusion rates, in weight, registered in the second survey (73 - 74 and 48 - 63 % for blue whiting and boarfish, respectively). The corresponding percentage reduction for target species was 8 - 15 % for the Norway lobster, 4 - 9 % for rose shrimp and 7 - 10 % for red shrimp. The level of exclusion of the non-commercial by-catch is encouraging, although short-term loss of Norway lobster, where the escapees comprised larger individuals, raises some concern with regards to fishers' acceptance of mandatory use of grids.
