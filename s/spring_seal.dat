40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{bones of}} bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus) {{were used by}} Mackenzie Inuit groups in {{producing}} a number of items essential to transportation and procurement. However, the whale bone industry, {{and its relationship to}} Mackenzie Inuit economic and social systems, is poorly understood. A recently excavated archaeological assemblage from McKinley Bay, Northwest Territories, provides a record of intensive Nuvugarmiut whale bone tool manufacture, which can be used to reconstruct a reduction sequence. Bowhead bone reduction at McKinley Bay focused on ribs, which were transversely worked into large sections. Cortical blanks were isolated from central rib sections, but proximal and distal rib sections were treated directly as blanks and preforms for the production of large durable tools, such as harpoon heads, adze sockets, mattock blades, and picks. The intensive whale bone reduction at McKinley Bay was part of a broader gearing-up strategy focused on the manufacture and repair of sleds and harpoons needed for the late winter migration and <b>spring</b> <b>seal</b> hunt. More generally, because the whale bone industry was intimately related to the bowhead hunt and its proceeds, it may provide fundamental insights about key aspects of coastal whaling societies, such as social organization, redistribution, and inter-territorial trade.

40|$|The Labrador fishery {{carried out}} from Brigus, {{which was to}} a great extent, {{representative}} of the Conception Bay Labrador fishery as a whole, was both an extension and successor of the resident Newfoundland fishery. The resident fishery, in turn, was at first an extension and then a successor of the British migratory fishery at Newfoundland. The socio-economic relations of the Brigus Labrador fishery were, as its predecessors had been, essentially capitalist in nature and remained so through to, at least, {{the beginning of the}} Second World War. [...] The British fishery at Newfoundland was initially a migratory fishery organized along capitalist lines. Under the conditions of the migratory fishery the economic relations which existed between capitalists and between capitalists and workers were governed by British maritime law, in particular the different applications of the concept of maritime lien. After 1610 the fishery at Newfoundland took on an increasingly settled character. In the seventeenth century the production of dried cod was increasingly carried out by inhabitants or planters and bye boat keepers, while the trade in fish at Newfoundland (i. e. export),. was conducted by Sack ships, fishing ships, traders from the American colonies of Britain, along with a growing population of resident merchants; the suppliers of the trade were merchants in England, fishing ships operating as migratory merchants, and resident merchants. By {{the first quarter of the}} eighteenth century the traditional ship fishery had virtually died out. [...] Conception Bay and Brigus were the site of the earliest English settlement at Newfoundland and their pattern of settlement and growth are nearly synonymous with the English settlement at Newfoundland. The period from 1750 to 1870 was one marked by growth and prosperity for Newfoundland and Conception Bay. In this period the resident fishery came to dominate the fishery while the cod and seal fisheries were the central and predominant activities for virtually all of the island. For much of the period, in particular from 1750 to 1830, Conception Bay was the centre of the island's economic growth and in the early part of the nineteenth century it even surpassed St. John's in economic importance and population. The steady rise in population around Conception Bay, which continued past the mid-point of the nineteenth century, began in five years from 1750 to 1755. The initial resource base upon which this growth was based was the cod fishery on the French Shore latter to be supplanted by the migratory Labrador fishery. At the end of the eighteenth century a <b>spring</b> <b>seal</b> fishery developed around Conception Bay. The seal fishery complemented the Labrador fishery and by the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century had risen to at least equal importance to the cod fishery. [...] The growth in population involved a continuing shift from a migratory to year-round use of the island's resources by merchants and labourers and a general rise in the number, power, and importance of the planters. One cause of the growth in the resident fishery was an increase in the availability and a decrease in the price of supplies supplied from south-west of Ireland and, especially, from New England. These new sources of provisions, combined with famine and economic recession in Ireland, the prime source of labourers since the seventeenth century, made it easier for the planters to obtain labour and made Newfoundland a more attractive place for permanent settlement. The increasing number of resident labourers also allowed the planters to extend their fishery beyond that of the migratory fishers and to expand their activities into the <b>spring</b> <b>seal</b> fishery. The shift to residency was made easier because the difference between resident and migratory fisheries had always been one of different economic strategies within essentially capitalist relations of production and not an essential change in those relations. The legal framework regulating the relations of production in the fishery continued to be derived from maritime custom and law, virtually unchanged from those which had prevailed in the previous century. [...] The three classes which dominated the resident Newfoundland fishery economy, at least during this period, were merchants, labourers, and planters. Most of those fishing were labourers, workers owning little more in the production process than their personal effects. The merchants were merchant capitalists involved primarily in trade in supplies and fish rather than being capitalists directly involved in producing dried cod. Planters, it is the argument of this thesis, are best classified as small capitalist. [...] This fishery, commonly referred to as the planter fishery, was essentially capitalist has been accepted as being the dominant set of relations of production up through the first third of the nineteenth century. A number of authorities have argued, however, that the planter fishery disappeared from Newfoundland around the year 1840. It is the argument of this thesis that such was not the case and that the planters' fishery remained the dominant fishery, at least around Conception Bay, throughput the period until, at least, the Second World War. [...] Brigus was involved in the Labrador and <b>spring</b> <b>seal</b> fishery from those fisheries beginnings and those fisheries were the economic bases for the growth in Brigus in the nineteenth century. The social and economic character of Brigus was that of a relatively prosperous community, dominated by a class of independent planters and with considerable competition among merchants. These characteristics were shared with a number of other communities of similar size around Conception Bay. The period from about 1820 to about 1860 was the height of Brigus's prosperity with the community being probably the most important sealing port in Conception Bay if not in all of Newfoundland. The period from 1880 to 1945 was marked by a decline in the population, economic activity, and prosperity of Brigus. The direct cause of this fall in population was the rapid collapse of the seal fishery in Brigus...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum seals {{are very}} {{important}} to ensure that the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) Linac has an optimum vacuum system. The vacuum joints between flanges must have reliable seals to minimize the leak rate and meet vacuum and electrical requirements. In addition, it is desirable to simplify the installation and thereby also simplify the maintenance required. This report summarizes an investigation of the metal vacuum seals that include the metal C-seal, Energized <b>Spring</b> <b>seal,</b> Helcoflex Copper Delta seal, Aluminum Delta seal, delta seal with limiting ring, and the prototype of the copper diamond seals. The report also contains the material certifications, design, finite element analysis, and testing for all of these seals. It is a valuable reference for any vacuum system design. To evaluate the suitability of several types of metal seals for use in the SNS Linac and to determine the torque applied on the bolts, a series of vacuum leak rate tests on the metal seals have been completed at Los Alamos Laboratory. A copper plated flange, using the same type of delta seal that was used for testing with the stainless steel flange, has also been studied and tested. A vacuum seal is desired that requires significantly less loading than a standard ConFlat flange with a copper gasket for the coupling cavity assembly. To save the intersegment space the authors use thinner flanges in the design. The leak rate of the thin ConFlat flange with a copper gasket is a baseline for the vacuum test on all seals and thin flanges. A finite element analysis of a long coupling cavity flange with a copper delta seal has been performed in order to confirm the design of the long coupling cavity flange and the welded area of a cavity body with the flange. This analysis is also necessary to predict a potential deformation of the cavity under the combined force of atmospheric pressure and the seating load of the seal. Modeling of this assembly has been achieved using both HKS/Abaqus and COSMOS/M, which are finite element packages for analysis of coupled, nonlinear problems. From these studies, the appropriate seals that are reliable for SNS long coupling cavities and beamline joints were determined...|$|E

Previous investigations have demonstrated limited usage temperatures, as evidenced by a decreased ability to maintain sealing effectiveness at high temperatures (i. e., inadequate resiliency). In order to improve resiliency at elevated temperatures, Rene 41 (Allvac) was substituted for Inconel X- 750 (Special Metals Corp.) as the spring tube material in the existing seal design. A seal construction incorporating the Rene 41 spring tube was fabricated and tested against the baseline Inconel X- 750 <b>spring</b> tube <b>seal.</b> Although resiliency improvements were not as dramatic as in previous tests with the <b>spring</b> tubes alone, <b>seals</b> incorporating the Rene 41 spring tube exhibited an average 20 percent resiliency enhancement up to 1750 F when compared to seals containing the Inconel spring tube. In addition, the seals with the Rene 41 spring tubes showed less reduction in resiliency as temperatures increased above 1200 F. Results also indicated the Saffil (Saffil Ltd.) insulation in the core of the seal contributed more to resiliency than previously thought. Leakage data did not demonstrate an improvement with the seal containing the Rene 41 spring tube. However, based upon resiliency results, one could reasonably expect the Rene 41 version of the seal to track gap openings over a wider range. Therefore it would exhibit lower leakage than the Inconel X- 750 version as the seal gap opens during a typical mission...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{acoustic}} repertoires of ringed, bearded, and ribbon seals are described, {{along with}} their seasonal occurrence and relationship to sea ice concentration. Acoustic recordings were made between September and June over three years (2006 – 09) along the continental slope break in the Chukchi Sea, 120 km north-northwest of Barrow, Alaska. Vocalizations of ringed and bearded seals occurred in winter and during periods of 80 % – 100 % ice cover but were mostly absent during open water periods. The presence of ringed and bearded seal calls throughout winter and spring suggests that some portion of their population is overwintering. Analysis of the repertoire of ringed and bearded seal calls shows seasonal variation. Ringed seal calls are primarily barks in winter and yelps in <b>spring,</b> while bearded <b>seal</b> moans increase during <b>spring.</b> Ribbon <b>seal</b> calls were detected only {{in the fall of}} 2008 during the open water period. The repertoire of known ribbon seal vocalizations was expanded to include three additional calls, and two stereotyped call sequences were common.
