5|$|The Hampden Roar {{was first}} noticed {{in a game}} against England in 1929. Scotland, who had played the second half with ten players due to an injury to Alex Jackson, {{equalised}} in the final minute with a goal from Alec Cheyne direct from a corner kick. The roar that followed the goal was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> Jackson, who was a mile away in the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, could tell that Scotland had scored.|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of the}} mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5|$|Titan's {{components}} are air-cooled by heat sinks, {{but the air}} is chilled before being pumped through the cabinets. Fan noise is <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> hearing protection is required for people spending more than 15 minutes in the machine room. The system has a cooling capacity of 23.2 MW (6600 tons) and works by chilling water to 5.5 °C (42 °F), which in turn cools recirculated air.|$|E

60|$|Marika's first sad glance {{changed into}} a stare of wild surprise, then the {{building}} rang with a cry of joy <b>so</b> <b>loud,</b> <b>so</b> jubilant, <b>that</b> even those whose blood had almost ceased to flow were roused by it.|$|R
25|$|The surface caller {{should also}} give the diver {{a chance to}} {{temporarily}} suspend or slow down breathing, or stop using noisy equipment, as breathing noise is often <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> the message can not be heard over it.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial for}} Haywood Patterson {{occurred}} while the Norris and Weems cases were still under consideration by the jury. When the jury returned its verdict {{from the first}} trial, the jury from the second trial {{was taken out of}} the courtroom. When the verdicts of guilty were announced, the courtroom erupted in cheers, as did the crowd outside. A band, there to play for a show of Ford Motor Company cars outside, began playing Hail, Hail the Gang's All Here and There'll be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight. The celebration was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> it was most likely heard by the second jury waiting inside.|$|E
25|$|On 26 August 1978 at 6:24p.m. {{local time}} (4:24p.m. UTC), {{the first signs}} of smokewhose color signifies {{the success or failure of}} an electionfrom the chimney of the Sistine Chapel appeared. However, it was unclear which color the smoke was for over an hour; some of the {{cardinals}} had personally deposited their notes and tally sheets in the stove, causing black smoke after white had already appeared. Pericle Felici, as the ranking Cardinal Deacon, then stepped onto the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and delivered the Habemus Papam announcement in Latin, declaring Luciani's election. John Paul I then appeared on the balcony; shortly after his withdrawal, the crowd's applause remained <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> he was compelled to appear again.|$|E

It's got to be attack-style." [...] He {{explains}} this method by saying [...] "... I put on the headphones and stand one foot away from the amp. I turn the amp up <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> I literally have to play harder than the feedback, because if I stop playing even for an instant, the whole thing explodes." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the boat}} deck, as the crew began {{preparing}} the lifeboats, {{it was difficult}} to hear anything over the noise of high-pressure steam being vented from the boilers and escaping via the valves on the funnels above. Lawrence Beesley described the sound as [...] "a harsh, deafening boom that made conversation difficult; if one imagines 20 locomotives blowing off steam in a low key it would give some idea of the unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed out on the top deck." [...] The noise was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> the crew had to use hand signals to communicate.|$|E

Their performance of Danny & the Juniors' [...] "Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay" [...] at {{their high school}} talent show was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> the principal cut the microphone. On January 31, 1959, three days before his death, Buddy Holly performed at the Duluth Armory. Seventeen year old Zimmerman was in the audience; in his Nobel Prize lecture, Dylan remembered: [...] "He looked me right straight dead in the eye, and he transmitted something. Something I didn’t know what. And it gave me the chills." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris Beaumont of Blogcritics {{recommended}} the DVD to consumers, giving it {{three and a}} half out of five stars. He noted that the audio quality was [...] "pretty strong," [...] and allows listeners to clearly hear every chord, note, and word that the band outputs, while the crowd noise proves that it is a live video, but is not <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> it distracts viewers. Beamount also said that the video's quality [...] "lacks a lot of the polish that more recent recordings have," [...] but he later said that he would rather see it in low quality rather than high quality. Chad Bowar of About.com also gave the DVD {{three and a half}} out of five stars. He noted that the video is in decent quality, but, due to poor lighting and shaky camera work, he considered the DVD to be [...] "." ...|$|E
500|$|Between January 12 and February 2, 1967, the Experience took a {{break from}} {{recording}} while they played 20 dates in England, including a second appearance on Top of the Pops, on January 18. Chandler was dissatisfied with the sound quality of the January 11 recordings and frustrated by {{the large number of}} noise complaints that they had received from people living and working near De Lane Lea. He explained: [...] "There was a bank above the studio... and it was at the time when computers were just coming in... we would play <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> it would foul up the computers upstairs." [...] Brian Jones and Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones encouraged Chandler to try Olympic Studios, which was considered the top independent London studio. Despite the growing chart success of their first single, Chandler's money problems persisted. Olympic required advance payment for studio time, but Polydor had not yet released any funds to Track for disbursement. When Chandler went to Polydor asking for relief they responded by guaranteeing him a line of credit at Olympic.|$|E
500|$|She {{performed}} {{more frequently}} in African countries, and as countries became independent of European colonial powers, was invited to sing at independence ceremonies, including in Kenya, Angola, Zambia, Tanganyika, and Mozambique. She also became a diplomat for Ghana, and was appointed Guinea's official delegate to the UN in 1975; that year, she addressed the United Nations General Assembly. She continued to perform in Europe and Asia, {{as well as her}} African concerts, but not in the US, where a de facto boycott was in effect. Her performances in Africa were immensely popular: she was described as the highlight of FESTAC 77, a Pan-African arts festival in Nigeria in 1977, and during a Liberian performance of [...] "Pata Pata", the stadium proved <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> she was unable to complete the song. [...] "Pata Pata", like her other songs, had been banned in South Africa. Another song she sang frequently in this period was [...] "Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika", though she never recorded it. Makeba later stated that it was during this period that she accepted the label [...] "Mama Africa".|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Braidwood {{and his men}} had arrived on the scene, the House of Lords had been destroyed. A strong south-westerly breeze had fanned the flames along the wood-panelled and narrow {{corridors}} into St Stephen's Chapel. Shortly after his arrival {{the roof of the}} chapel collapsed; the resultant noise was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> the watching crowds thought there had been a Gunpowder Plot-style explosion. According to The Manchester Guardian, [...] "By half-past seven o'clock the engines were brought to play upon the building both from the river and the land side, but the flames had by this time acquired such a predominance that the quantity of water thrown upon them produced no visible effect." [...] Braidwood saw {{it was too late to}} save most of the palace, so elected to focus his efforts on saving Westminster Hall, and he had his firemen cut away the part of the roof that connected the hall to the already burning Speaker's House, and then soak the hall's roof to prevent it catching fire. In doing so he saved the medieval structure at the expense of those parts of the complex already ablaze.|$|E
500|$|Louis XVIII {{returned}} to France promptly after Napoleon's defeat to ensure his second restoration [...] "in baggage train of the enemy", i.e. with Wellington's troops. The Duke of Wellington used King Louis's person {{to open up}} the route to Paris, as some fortresses refused to surrender to the Allies, but agreed to do so for their king. King Louis arrived at Cambrai on 26 June, where he released [...] stating that those who served the Emperor in the Hundred Days would not be persecuted, except for the [...] "instigators". It was also acknowledged that Louis XVIII's government might have made mistakes during the First Restoration. On 29 June, a deputation of five from the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers approached Wellington about putting a foreign prince on the throne of France. Wellington rejected their pleas outright, declaring that [...] " [...] the best way to preserve the integrity of France". Wellington ordered the deputies to espouse King Louis's cause. Louis XVIII entered Paris on 8 July to a boisterous reception: the Tuileries Palace gardens were thronged with bystanders, and, according to the Duke of Wellington, the acclamation of the crowds there were <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> evening that he could not converse with the king.|$|E
500|$|Following the album's low-budget release, Shields boasted, [...] "We {{know more}} about how the record {{industry}} works than our record company half the time. We do. I'm not joking." [...] That winter the band toured Europe, an event music critic David Cavanagh described as a [...] "unique chapter in live music". To recreate the higher tones from Loveless, Shields employed American flautist Anna Quimby. According {{to a friend of}} the band, [...] "She had a little skirt on, black tights...she was a little indie girl. But when she blew into the flute, it was like fucking Woodstock". NME editor Danny Kelly attended a show he described as [...] "more like torture than entertainment, I had a half pint of lager; they hit their first note and it was <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> it sent the glass hurtling". A US spring tour followed, during which Shields and Butcher tested their audiences' ability to sustain noise played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the American tour, [...] "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take deep breaths. After four minutes, a calm takes over." [...] The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press, who took exception to the long period of extreme noise played during [...] "You Made Me Realise", referring to it as [...] "the holocaust". In December 2000 Mojo magazine rated the tour as the second loudest in history.|$|E

In this story, the narrator, Randall Napier, recounts his exhausting fight with his wife Hope over his alleged snoring, which she claims has been <b>so</b> <b>loud</b> <b>that</b> it keeps her awake at night. Randall protests, maintaining that he was awake and consequently unable to snore, while his wife was actually asleep. Eventually they travel to a Sleep Clinic in order to monitor their behaviors and determine for certain who is right.|$|E
