40|$|A major {{obstacle}} to Grid usability today is that Grid applications are prone to failures and performance bottlenecks. Writing “better” Grid software cannot really solve this problem: to a certain extent, this an inherent property of a large and multi-layered system. Thus, troubleshooting is an essential Grid component. However, the very layers of middleware designed to <b>shield</b> <b>Grid</b> users from the varia-tion in underlying systems can also hide the feedback needed to diagnose and troubleshoot poor performance or failure. This paper proposes two new Grid monitoring elements, Grid workflow identi-fiers and consistent component lifecycle events, that will make Grid failures easier to diagnose and troubleshoot. One of the central challenges of Grid computing today is that, in practice, Grid applications are prone to frequent failures and performance bottlenecks. This is an unavoidable property of a large and multi-layered system. The large numbers of components involved make failure more likely...|$|E

40|$|A {{one-dimensional}} test detector on {{the principle}} of a highly segmented ionization chamber with <b>shielding</b> <b>grid</b> (Frisch grid) was developed to evaluate if this kind of detector is suitable for advanced small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. At present it consists of 128 pixels which can be read out within 0. 2 ms with a noise ßoor of 2000 e-ENC. A quantum eƒciency of 80 % for a photon energy of 8 keV was achieved. This leads to DQE values of 80 % for photon ßuxes above 1000 photons/pixel and integration time. The <b>shielding</b> <b>grid</b> is based {{on the principle}}s of the recently invented MCAT structure and the GEM structure which also allows electron ampliÞcation in the gas. In the case of the MCAT structure, an energy resolution of 20 % at 5. 9 keV was observed. The gas ampliÞcation mode enables imaging with this integrating detector on a subphoton noise level with respect to the integration time. Preliminary experiments of saturation behavior show that this kind of detector digests a photon ßux density up to 1012 photons/mm 2 s and operates linearly. A spatial resolution of at least three line pairs/mm was obtained. All these features show that this type of detector is well suited for time-resolved SAXS experiments as well as high ßux imaging applications. (1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Here we show that cylindrical liquid jets have interesting advantages for creating <b>shielding</b> <b>grids</b> for heavy-ion beam lines. A cylindrical nozzle design with a very low convergence ratio was developed, and the fabrication methods needed for inexpensive numerically-controlled machining of large nozzle arrays demonstrated. Cylindrical jets were studied because they give the highest surface smoothness for a given degree of turbulence suppression, allow flow control to individual nozzles for control of jet pointing, and attenuate target-induced shocks effectively. Improved control of the grid geometry allows the driver energy to be delivered by a larger number of beams. These smaller beams—up to 160 in the example here—improve focusing and reduce neutron collimation up beam lines. I...|$|R

40|$|An X-ray {{detector}} will {{be presented}} that is {{the combination of a}} segmented ionization chamber featuring one-dimensional spatial resolution integrated with an intelligent ADC front-end, multi DSP processing and embedded PC platform. This detector is optimized to fan beam geometry with an active area of 192 mm (horizontal) and a vertical acceptance of 6 mm. Spatial resolution is obtained by subdividing the anode into readout strips, having pitch of 150 micrometers, which are connected to 20 custom made integrating VLSI chips (each capable of 64 -channel read-out and multiplexing) and read out by 14 bits 10 MHz ADCs and fast adaptive PGAs into DSP boards. A bandwidth reaching 3. 2 Gbit/s of raw data, generated from the real time sampling of the 1280 micro strips, is cascaded processed with FPGA and DSP to allow data compression resulting in several days of uninterrupted acquisition capability. Fast acquisition rates reaching 10 kHz are allowed due to the MicroCAT structure utilized not only as a <b>shielding</b> <b>grid</b> in ionization chamber mode but also to provide active electron amplification in the gas.

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{combination}} of an ionization chamber with one-dimensional spatial resolution and a MicroCAT structure will be presented. The combination between gas gain operations and integrating front-end electronics yields a dynamic range as high as eight to nine orders of magnitude. Therefore this device is well suitable for medical imaging or applications such as small angle x-ray scattering, where the requirements on the dynamic of the detector are exceptional high. Basically the described detector is an ionization chamber adapted to fan beam geometry with an active area of 192 cm and a pitch of the anode strips of 150 micrometer. In the vertical direction beams as high as 10 mm can be accepted. Every read-out strip is connected to an analogue integrating electronics channel realized in a custom made VLSI chip. A MicroCAT structure utilized as a <b>shielding</b> <b>grid</b> enables frame rates as high as 10 kHz. The high dynamic range observed {{stems from the fact}} that the MicroCAT enables active electron amplification in the gas. Thus a single photon resolution can be obtained for low photon fluxes even with the integrating electronics. The specialty of this device is that for each photon flux the gas amplification can be adjusted in such a fashion that the maximum DQE value is achieved.

40|$|Special {{microscopic}} {{technologies are}} necessary to characterize the sample in all three dimensions. Ion beam sputtering is a versatile tool for various purposes. Depending on the ion beam operation conditions and parameters selected tasks can be solved, e. g. cleaning, smoothing, thinning, selec-tive etching, sputter coating and ion beam cutting. Ion beam slope cutting (IBSC) [1] can reveal the internal microstructure by a representat ive cut through the sample along selected surface lines. The cut area is free of deformations and smooth also in very inhomogeneous materials concerning composition, hardness, porosity etc. By IBSC 10000 times larger analysing areas can be produced compared with the focused ion beam (FIB) technology. A modificat ion of IBSC leads to the ion beam grid cutting technology. This technology has been introduced with laboratory equipment [2]. Here its application and further development is carried out with the available ion beam apparatus Gatan Precision Etching Coating System (PECS). The principle is drawn in FIG. 1. A parallel beam of inert gas ions is directed onto the sample through a <b>shielding</b> <b>grid</b> and removes material in selected regions with a resulting network of bars.

40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} uses virtualization {{technologies to}} offer a non-shared use rental of computer resources with publicly accessible worker nodes. However, unlike Grid computing, Cloud computing as implemented by Amazon, IBM, Google and Microsoft only offers compute and storage resources from a single organization. Many of the cross-site and cross-organizational advantages offered by Grid computing are lost. In this paper, we present a novel infrastructure that combines the benefits of Grid and Cloud computing: Cheap multi-organizational resources and private compute nodes with root access reachable from the Internet. Our previously introduced virtualization of Grid resources is extended by an approach to offer the same freedom of network access Cloud computing offers, but in a multiorganizational and shared use environment without endangering existing users or resources. An approach is presented for the dynamic network isolation of Grid users from each other {{as well as a}} mechanism for <b>shielding</b> the <b>Grid</b> infrastructure from malicious users and attacks from the Internet.

40|$|W-containing {{polycrystalline}} diamond {{films were}} {{produced by a}} hybrid chemical vapor deposition-powder flowing technique, {{in order to test}} the feasibility of using composite diamond-based materials as protective coatings for acceleration grids subjected to ion bombardment. The morphology and structure of the composite layers, deposited on Mo substrates, were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and reflection high-energy electron diffraction. It is found that W insertion substantially lowers the resistivity of the diamond-based layers (around 10 (- 2) Omega cm) but does not modify the lattice parameters of the host diamond matrix. The performance of such coatings for <b>shielding</b> Mo <b>grids</b> from ion-induced sputtering was tested using 1 keV Ar+ beams.

40|$|Recently a new {{emphasis}} {{has been placed}} on engineering applications of space radiation analyses and thus a systematic effort of Verification, Validation and Uncertainty Quantification (VV&UQ) of the tools commonly used for radiation analysis for vehicle design and mission planning has begun. There are two sources of uncertainty in geometric discretization addressed in this paper that need to be quantified {{in order to understand the}} total uncertainty in estimating space radiation exposures. One source of uncertainty is in ray tracing, as the number of rays increase the associated uncertainty decreases, but the computational expense increases. Thus, a cost benefit analysis optimizing computational time versus uncertainty is needed and is addressed in this paper. The second source of uncertainty results from the interpolation over the dose vs. depth curves that is needed to determine the radiation exposure. The question, then, is what is the number of thicknesses that is needed to get an accurate result.

Megatron mobilizes the chaos-bringer, and pursues the Autobots through their space bridge, emerging in the vicinity of Cybertron. The Transformers' homeworld riddled with Energon towers, fired, leaving Unicron badly damaged. The Autobots form an alliance with Alpha Q, who is already working with Rodimus and his crew, and learn his origin and his motives for stealing Energon: he seeks to use it to recreate that which Unicron has destroyed. Meanwhile, Megatron's forces attack Cybertron, and the Decepticon criminal Shockblast is inducted into their ranks. In the course of Shockblast's escape from prison, guard Wing Dagger swears revenge for the death of his partner, Padlock, and when an Energon tower collapses on him and Tidal Wave, Megatron reconstructs his minion as Mirage, while Primus recreates Wing Dagger as the mighty Wing Saber, who joins the battle alongside Optimus Prime within Unicron. As the battle rages, Kicker arranges to channel all of Earth's Energon into Unicron's head, which Alpha Q then rams into Unicron's body. The resultant reaction with the negatively charged Energon within the body causes a fissure in reality, through which all the combatants are sucked.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally {{embroidery}} {{is known}} as a conventional technique of textile decoration. Since the niche of technical textiles is rapidly expanding and is the main field of innovation and research in textile and apparel industry, embroidery is found in a variety of new functional applications due to the unique opportunity of creating three-dimensional light-weight structures and laying threads on the base material in all directions. As the field of smart textiles is vast per se and is associated with technical textiles and wearable technologies, the main applications of the embroidery may be described accordingly as ones for technical applications. In the sphere of medical textiles, embroidery is a relatively new technique, but is successfully used for wound-dressing development and innovative solutions for tissue engineering due to the opportunity of creating three-dimensional structures from fine polymer materials. Another advantageous characteristic of goods developed by embroidery is dimensional stability of manufactured textile structures. Due to these particularities embroidery is used widely also for such technical applications as development of heating <b>grids,</b> <b>shielding,</b> conductive interconnections, intelligent textile sensors and interfaces etc. Moreover, a large variety of materials and threads can be used in prototyping by the technique, e. g., conductive threads, metal wires, laminated polymer and carbon fibers.

40|$|To {{ensure that}} an {{electronic}} system will work properly under all conditions, its designer must control {{the flow of}} electromagnetic (EM) fields {{to and from the}} system. The principal method of control is the use of a metallic enclosure or shield. In many cases, the effectiveness of the shield is determined, not by the bulk material properties, but by apertures that exist in the shield. These apertures may be introduced intentionally, {{as in the case of}} windows in the skin of an aircraft, or unintentionally, as in the case of an improperly welded seam of poorly gasketed door. To minimize the penetration of EM fields through a large aperture, the aperture is sometimes loaded with a conductive material. Previous workers have shown that the penetration of EM fields through open or loaded apertures can be calculated by determining the equivalent magnetic surface currents, M⃗s, that exist over the surface of the aperture. For small apertures, the equivalent magnetic and electric dipole moments (and polarizabilities) are related to the irrotational and solenoidal components of M⃗ s respectively. In this thesis, the relevant integro-differential equations are solved using the Method of Moments to determine M⃗s and to calculate the equivalent polarizabilities and shielding effectiveness of a small, square aperture loaded with an impedance sheet. Results of measurements of the penetration of EM fields through an aperture loaded with conductive material made using a dual transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell over a frequency range of 2 to 200 MHz are presented and compared with the numerical results.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that an intense neutron source {{can be produced}} in a suitable target by spallation neutrons generated by a high-current high-energy proton beam. Typical beam energy for such an accelerator is 400 to 2000 MeV. A conventional critical reactor can readily {{be replaced by a}} ''sub-critical reactor'' driven by this source. A 5 MW proton beam at 600 MeV can drive a sub-critical reactor to 100 MWt. The accelerator and the associated plant support equipment at these design specifications are complex systems, but they are well within recent technology. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine core design and shielding design issues for a 100 MWt sodium-cooled fast-spectrum Sub-Critical Multiplier (SCM- 100) based on LMFBR technology, but driven by an intense neutron source created by spallation reactions. SCM- 100 is a component of the Accelerator Driven Test Facility. In this report we provide an overview of the SCM- 100 concept. Two designs were investigated: (1) a vertical entry for the beam on the axial centerline; and (2) an inclined entry design where the core is ''C'' shaped and the beam enters the side of the target at an angle of 32 degrees. A brief overview of relevant shielding design data from EBR-II is also provided. The key result of this report is that the inclined entry design cannot achieve design objectives for radial power peaking. Consequently it cannot achieve design objectives for peak neutron flux. Axial power peaking factors are controlled by the axial fuel height and the axial reflector properties. These dimensions and compositions are very similar in SCM- 100 to those of EBR-II. EBR-II had an axial power peaking factor of 1. 093, and a radial power peaking factor of about 1. 46. The radial power peaking of SCM- 100 with the inclined entry is too extreme at 2. 15, and cannot be made acceptable by modifying the size and detailed shape of the ''C'' shaped core and reflector. The axial power peaking of SCM- 100 is very close to that of EBR-II. Although these conclusions were obtained using EBR-II Mark-IIIA fuel elements of a single enrichment, they are expected to be true for any single-enrichment fuel design with a similar active fuel height and similar k-infinity. <b>Shielding</b> of the <b>grid</b> plate was also investigated.
