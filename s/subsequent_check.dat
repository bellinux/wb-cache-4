40|$|In {{studies of}} data from the Mariner 4 and Mariner 5 magnetometers {{evidence}} {{has been found that}} during the flights, negative (toward the sun) polarity dominated at latitudes above the solar equatorial plane and positive polarity dominated at latitudes below this plane. A <b>subsequent</b> <b>check</b> of data taken with other spacecraft during 1964 through 1967 provided additional evidence of this effect. It is suggested that the dominant polarity of the interplanetary magnetic field follows the hemisphere-dependent dipolar field of the sun. Thus, the photospheric dipolar field may be an important source of the interplanetary magnetic field, especially at quiet times. It has also been found that, for an interplanetary magnetic field of a given polarity, the north-south component has a nonzero mean value in regions above and below the solar equatorial plane...|$|E

30|$|Comparing with three-line rice hybrid {{production}} system, two-line {{system with}} TGMS has some advantages: (1) The male sterility were controlled by recessive nuclear genes. Any genotype with good combining ability {{can be used}} as a male parent. The frequency of obtaining heterotic hybrids in testcrosses is relatively higher than three-line system. (2) It can be used to develop hybrids of japonica or basmati in which there are very low frequency of cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) restorers. (3) It is especially suited for developing sub specific hybrid (indica/japonica) because there is no restriction of restoring-maintaining relationship in TGMS system. (4) The cost for hybrid seed production is lower as compared to the three-line system. Two-line hybrid breeding has been widely used in China as an effective approach to the improvement of rice grain yield and quality. However, there is an urgent need to enhance its blast disease resistant.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} impact of single {{instillation}} of 40 mg Mitomycin C (MMC- 40) within first hour of transurethral resection (TUR), on first year recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Methods: In this study of two groups of patients with similar demographics and tumour profile were compared to assess first year tumour recurrence pattern. Group A received MMC- 40 within 30 minutes of TUR. Group B patients only had TUR of bladder tumour. Patients ’ charts were reviewed for demographic profile, preoperative diagnosis and imaging used, cytological work up, tumour profile both during cystoscopy and imaging used, patients records were also reviewed for all <b>subsequent</b> <b>check</b> cystoscopies for recurrence. Any adjuvant treatments like intravesical chemo/immunotherapy etc. were also noted. The results were analysed using a commercially available statistical package, SPSS™. The level of significance was 0. 05. Results: There were 29 and 46 patients in group A and B respectively. The demographic profile in terms of age, gender distribution, tumour characteristics (size, site, multiplicity) and pathological evaluation including, tumour grade and presence of carcinoma in situ were similar (p< 0. 4 and p< 0. 5) respectively. The first year recurrence rate in group A was 15 % whereas it was 37. 4 % in group B (p< 0. 04). Conclusions: The first year recurrence rate is significantly decreased if MMC- 40 is instilled following TUR. MMC- 40 is safe and cost effective. Most low grade, low volume tumours would not require any further treatment if MMC- 40 is given immediately following TUR.

40|$|Introduction: Iloprost is {{a potent}} {{prostacyclin}} (PGI 2) analogue that is effective {{in the treatment of}} peripheral arterial disease, vasculitis, pulmonary hypertension, and secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon. Intravenous infusions are generally administered {{with the aid of a}} peristaltic pump to reduce the risk of adverse reactions caused by unintentional increases in the infusion rate. This increases the cost of care in terms of equipment and personnel and may limit the use of this drug. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 18, 432 iloprost infusions administered between 1999 and 2009 to 272 patients with systemic sclerosis (n = 253) and 19 with peripheral arterial disease (n = 19). All infusions were administered in the day hospital over 6 h with a normal IV set-up with a roller flow regulator. Flow rates were set to deliver iloprost at 1 - 2 ng/kg/min. Rates were verified by direct drop counts during the first 15 - 20 minutes of the infusion and at each <b>subsequent</b> <b>check.</b> Results: There were no adverse events that were fatal, life-threatening, or associated with prolongation of hospitalization and very few events requiring intensive care or continuous monitoring. The latter included 4 cases of tachycardia/arrhythmia (extrasystoles in most cases), 3 cases of hypotension (systolic pressure 170 / 100 mmHg). All other adverse reactions were mild, reversible, and similar to those seen with iloprost infusion with peristaltic pump. Only one patient had to be switched to another prostanoid (due to intolerance). Discussion: Iloprost infusion administered with a normal IV flow regulator appears to be as safe, well tolerated, and effective as traditional infusion with a peristaltic pump...|$|E

30|$|To {{analyze the}} {{relationship}} between CEO succession and CSQ, we introduced a dummy variable, CEO succession, which took the value 1 {{in the case of}} CEO turnover and 0 in all other cases. Next, years with CEO succession were separated into the dimensions of successor and reason. Consistent with earlier research (Lubatkin et al. 1989; Reinganum 1985), successor was divided into inside successor and outside successor based on an analysis of annual reports and press articles. We considered successors internal if they had been members of the executive board or the supervisory board before appointment as CEO. If new CEOs had no such relation to the firm, they were treated as outside successors. This very strict definition of the inside successor category fits our theoretical reasoning that inside successors are assumed to identify themselves with prior board decisions. A <b>subsequent</b> <b>check</b> of our data set showed, however, that all firm-related successors were also inside successors in the sense of our definition; that is, the “critical” case did not occur of a firm-related successor with any relation to the firm other than a board mandate. We created the dummy variables inside successor, which took the value 1 in cases of inside successors and 0 otherwise, and outsider successor, taking the value 1 in cases of outside successors and 0 otherwise. Regarding the reason for CEO succession, we distinguished between forced and voluntary events. Determining whether a succession is voluntary has challenged researchers, who have addressed the question in different ways. For instance, some scholars have relied on age-based classification, which assumes that turnover is voluntary or routine if the departing CEO is older than a certain threshold, such as age 63 (Wiersema 1995; Shen and Cannella 2002). In our study, we relied on information collected from firms’ annual reports and press releases. Unfortunately, firms usually discuss dismissals euphemistically and report forced turnovers as voluntary retirements (Denis and Denis 1995; Weisbach 1995; Pitcher et al. 2000). Therefore, we also considered independent press articles. If press articles indicated that a CEO turnover was a dismissal instead of a voluntary retirement, we coded it as such. Again, we specified a dummy variable, voluntary succession, with a value of 1 for voluntary turnovers and 0 for forced dismissals.|$|E
