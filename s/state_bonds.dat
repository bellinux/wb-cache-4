5|$|The state faced a $400million revenue {{shortfall}} when Jones took office. Shortly after his election, Jones created the Quality and Efficiency Commission to study ways to streamline state government. Among the enacted recommendations were refinancing <b>state</b> <b>bonds</b> at lower interest rates, cutting the state workforce by 2,000 employees (mostly through attrition), and spurring local economic growth through tax incentives. By {{the end of}} Jones' term, the state enjoyed a $300million budget surplus.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} the part of SR905 between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road in April 2008, and from Brittania Boulevard to I-805 in July 2009. Efforts were made to keep {{construction}} going despite a shortfall in funding from <b>state</b> <b>bonds</b> in 2009. The part between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road opened in December 2010. The interchange with I-805 began to be upgraded in April 2011, and the construction, which used $20million in federal funding, finished in February 2012. The final freeway segment of SR905 between I-805 and Britannia Boulevard opened on July 30, 2012. The entire cost of the project connecting I-805 to the border crossing was $441million.|$|E
5|$|The state {{suffered}} from financial difficulties {{during its first}} three decades. Jonathan Jennings attempted to begin a period of internal improvements. Among his projects, the Indiana Canal Company was reestablished to build a canal around the Falls of the Ohio. The Panic of 1819 caused the state's only two banks to fold. This hurt Indiana's credit, halted the projects, and hampered the start of new projects until the 1830s, after the repair of the state's finances during the terms of William Hendricks and Noah Noble. Beginning in 1831, large scale plans for statewide improvements were set into motion. Overspending on the internal improvements led to a large deficit {{that had to be}} funded by <b>state</b> <b>bonds</b> through the newly created Bank of Indiana and sale of over nine million acres (36,000km²) of public land. By 1841 the debt had become unmanageable. Having borrowed over $13million, the equivalent to the state's first fifteen years of tax revenue, the government could not even pay interest on the debt. The state narrowly avoided bankruptcy by negotiating the liquidation of the public works, transferring them to the state's creditors in exchange for a 50% reduction in the state's debt. The internal improvements began under Jennings paid off as the state began to experience rapid population growth that slowly remedied the state's funding problems. The improvements led to a fourfold increase in land value, and an even larger increase in farm produce.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we re-examine the impact of credit ratings and {{economic}} factors on <b>state</b> <b>bond</b> yields using a two-step model. In the first step, we adopt an ordered probit technique to obtain consistent estimates of <b>state</b> <b>bond</b> default risk. In the second step, we estimate <b>state</b> <b>bond</b> risk premiums using a regression analysis with a categorized risk variable obtained from the first step. Similar to Terza (1987) and Hsiao (1983), the model involves a categorized ordinal explanatory (rating) variable. However, our two-step model deals with a case where category thresholds are unknown and dependent on economic factors. The model provides consistent estimates {{for the effects of}} ratings and economic factors on <b>state</b> <b>bond</b> yields. Contrary to previous findings, we find that <b>state</b> <b>bond</b> yields are mainly affected by fundamental economic variables...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{works were}} carried out to study the {{feasibility}} of solid <b>state</b> <b>bonding</b> of superplastic aluminum 7475 sheet. Amount of deformation, bonding time, surface cleaning method and intermediate layer were the process parameters investigated. Other parameters, held constant by the superplastic forming condition which is required to obtain a concurrent solid <b>state</b> <b>bonding,</b> are bonding temperature, bonding pressure and atmosphere. Bond integrity was evaluated through metallographic examination, X-ray line scan analysis, SEM fractographic analysis and lap shear tests. The early results of the development program indicated that sound solid <b>state</b> <b>bonding</b> was accomplished for this high strength 7475 alloy with significant amounts of deformation. A thin intermediate layer of the soft 5052 aluminum alloy aided in achieving a solid <b>state</b> <b>bonding</b> by reducing the required amount of plastic deformation at the interface. Bond strength was substantially increased by a post bond heat treatment...|$|R

25|$|After the October Revolution of 1917, {{the state}} savings banks system {{continued}} its activity and growth under {{the management of}} the Finance Ministry of the USSR as the State Labour Savings Banks System. From 1926, the saving bank outlets were used to pay wages to blue- and white-collar workers. The savings banks were used to distribute state lottery tickets and for the placement of <b>state</b> <b>bonds</b> with the population. The savings banks introduced wider services such as money transfers.|$|E
25|$|A 2002 study {{suggested}} that if a new College of Law structure was to be constructed, it should relocate closer to downtown Lexington. The suggested site was a block or two north, on Scott Street near the College of Education. A plan for five structures and two courtyards was abandoned because of funding difficulties. Now the school will renovate and expand its current building, a $56 million project, with <b>state</b> <b>bonds</b> paying $35 million {{on the condition that}} tuition not go up as a result.

25|$|The {{rail system}} and its {{planning}} was estimated to cost $7–$8 billion. The Florida HSRA and the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) reached an agreement with a consortium that included the Fluor Corporation and Bombardier Transportation. The consortium agreed to invest $300 million and utilize the DBOM functionality. The state of Florida would float <b>state</b> <b>bonds,</b> and FDOT would commit $70 million annually (increasing three percent yearly to account for inflation) to service the bonds for the next thirty years. Federal monies {{would pay for the}} interest on the bonds, and the state monies would satisfy the principal. When the high-speed railroad was running, operating surpluses would also be applied to the debt.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, Geary {{decided to}} run for {{re-election}} in District 32. Geary and Fred Peterson won the Republican nominations in the primary while Henry Semon, the other District 32 incumbent, and Jesse Z. Smith won Democratic nominations. In November, Geary and Semon once again won the two District 32 seats. This allowed Geary to serve in the 1951 regular legislative session which opened on January 8 and lasted into early May. During the session, he was appointed chairman of highways committee and also served as a members of the taxation committee. As chairman of the highways committee, he introduced bills to significantly increase highway taxes on trucks and issue <b>state</b> <b>bonds</b> for highway construction and maintenance.|$|E
25|$|The Nazi regime never {{attempted}} {{to convince the}} general populace to buy long-term war bonds as had been done during the First World War. The Reich government {{did not want to}} present any perceived form of public referendum on the war, which would be the indirect result if a bond drive did poorly. Rather, the regime financed its war efforts by borrowing directly from financial institutions, using short-term war bonds as collateral. German bankers, with no demonstration of resistance, agreed to taking <b>state</b> <b>bonds</b> into their portfolios. Financial institutions transferred their money to the Finance Department in exchange for promissory notes. Through this strategy, 40 million bank and investment accounts were quietly converted into war bonds, providing the Reich government with a continuous supply of money. Likewise, German bank commissioners compelled occupied Czechoslovakia to buy up German war bonds. By the end of the war, German war bonds accounted for 70% of investments held by Czechoslovakian banks.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The surface {{oxidation}} behavior was investigated over {{a range of}} solid <b>state</b> <b>bonding</b> condition of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ELI alloy. Since the oxides at the bonding interface may prevent the materials from complete bonding, {{it is important to}} understand the oxidation behavior at solid <b>state</b> <b>bonding</b> condition. The activation energy of oxidation of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ELI is estimated to be 318 KJ/mol in an environment of solid <b>state</b> <b>bonding</b> process. For Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ELI alloy, strucutral integrity of bonding interface without oxides have been obtained at 850 ˚C applying pressure of 3 MPa for 1 hour.

25|$|In 1836, Brown {{moved his}} family to Franklin Mills, Ohio (now known as Kent). There he {{borrowed}} money to buy land in the area, building and operating a tannery along the Cuyahoga River in partnership with Zenas Kent. He suffered great financial losses in the economic crisis of 1839, which struck the western states more severely than had the Panic of 1837. Following the heavy borrowing trends of Ohio, many businessmen like Brown trusted too heavily in credit and <b>state</b> <b>bonds</b> and paid dearly for it. In one episode of property loss, Brown was even jailed when he attempted to retain ownership of a farm by occupying it against {{the claims of the}} new owner. Like other determined men of his time and background, he tried many different business efforts in an attempt to get out of debt. Along with tanning hides and cattle trading, he also undertook horse and sheep breeding, the last of which was to become a notable aspect of his pre-public vocation.|$|E
25|$|By early 1931 {{unemployment}} {{stood at}} 19.2%. Governor Albert C. Ritchie was a stalwart opponent of federal intervention in local affairs, {{and continued to}} urge programs sponsored by the business community itself. Social welfare agencies based on state support expanded services as much as possible, but beyond pushing ahead with all feasible public works projects the state did little. Baltimore established a Commission on Employment Stabilization but found work for only one-fifth of the job-seekers. Baltimore relief agencies were soon overwhelmed and the election of Mayor Howard W. Jackson, although bringing about municipal loans to the Citizens' Emergency Relief Committee, showed that local aid was simply inadequate. Ritchie agreed to issue <b>state</b> <b>bonds</b> to aid Baltimore, but would not borrow from President Herbert Hoover's new Reconstruction Finance Corporation until mid-1933, and his luxury tax program met stiff opposition from county representatives opposed to new tobacco taxes. Originally planned for $8 million, the Baltimore bond issue had to be $12 million as the state economy floundered. Only reluctantly was federal assistance finally accepted.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the sense}} of the Constitution, bills of credit signify a paper medium of {{exchange}} intended to circulate between individuals, and between the Government and individuals, for the ordinary purposes of society. It is immaterial whether the quality of legal tender is imparted to such paper. Interest-bearing certificates in denominations up to ten dollars that were issued by loan offices established by the State of Missouri and made receivable in payment of taxes or other moneys due to the State, and in payment of the fees and salaries of state officers, were held to be bills of credit whose issuance was banned by this section. The States are not forbidden, however, to issue coupons receivable for taxes, nor to execute instruments binding themselves to pay money at a future day for services rendered or money borrowed. Bills issued by state banks are not bills of credit; it is immaterial that the State is the sole stockholder of the bank, that the officers of the bank were elected by the state legislature, or that the capital of the bank was raised by the sale of <b>state</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|E

A dissenting faction of the Democratic party, led by former governor J. C. W. Beckham, political boss Percy Haly, and Louisville Courier-Journal publisher Robert Worth Bingham, voiced strong opposition to Fields' proposals, especially the bond issue.
