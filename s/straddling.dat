5000|$|A Mississippi <b>straddle</b> {{is similar}} to a live <b>straddle,</b> but instead of being made by the player [...] "under the gun", it can be made by any player, {{depending}} on house rules (one common variation is to allow this left of big blind or on the button). House rules permitting Mississippi <b>straddles</b> are common in the southern United States. Like a live <b>straddle,</b> a Mississippi <b>straddle</b> must be at least the minimum raise. Action begins with the player {{to the left of the}} <b>straddle</b> (in a common variation, action starts left of the big blind, skips over the <b>straddle</b> who is last). If, for example (in a game with $10-25 blinds), the button puts a live $50 on it, the first player to act would be the small blind, followed by the big blind, and so on. If action gets back to the <b>straddle</b> with no raise, the <b>straddle</b> has the option of raising. The player to the left of a Mississippi <b>straddle</b> may re-straddle by placing a blind bet raising the original <b>straddle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Action {{begins with}} the player {{to the left of}} the <b>straddle.</b> If action returns to the <b>straddle</b> without a raise, the <b>straddle</b> has the option to raise. (This is part of what makes a <b>straddle</b> {{different}} from a sleeper because a sleeper does not have the option to raise if everyone folds or calls around to him.) Some casinos permit the player to the left of a live <b>straddle</b> to re-straddle by placing a blind bet raising the original <b>straddle.</b> Most public cardrooms do not permit more than one re-straddle. Depending on house rules, each re-straddle is often required to be double the previous <b>straddle,</b> so as to limit the number of feasible re-straddles.|$|R

5|$|Cal Neva Resort & Casino, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Calneva Resort, Cal-Neva Lodge, is a resort and casino <b>straddling</b> the border between Nevada and California {{on the shores of}} Lake Tahoe. The original building was constructed in 1926, and became famous when the national media picked up a story about actress Clara Bow cancelling checks she owed to the Cal Neva worth $13,000 in 1930. After a fire, the building burnt down in 1937 and was rebuilt over the course of 30 days. In 1960, entertainer Frank Sinatra purchased the Resort alongside Dean Martin and Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.|$|E
5|$|E.J.H.

The variety kinabaluensis (named after its type locality, Kinabalu) has a cap margin that is not scalloped, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the dead wood of Lithocarpus havilandii, a stone oak tree in the beech family. Variety subglobospora, found in Sabah, has spores that are almost spherical.|$|E
5000|$|The player {{immediately}} {{to the left of}} the big blind ("under the gun", UTG) may place a live <b>straddle</b> blind bet. The <b>straddle</b> must be the size of a normal raise over the big blind. A <b>straddle</b> is a live bet; but does not become a [...] "bigger blind". The <b>straddle</b> acts as a minimum raise but with the difference being that the straddler still gets their option of acting when the action returns to them. In a No-Limit game if any other player wants to make a raise with a <b>straddle</b> on board, the minimum raise will be the difference between the big blind and the <b>straddle.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>straddle</b> bet is an {{optional}} and voluntary blind bet {{made by a}} player after the posting of the small and big blinds, but before cards are dealt. <b>Straddles</b> are typically used only in cash games played with fixed blind structures. Some jurisdictions and casinos prohibit live <b>straddles.</b> <b>Straddles</b> are normally not permitted in tournament formats and are rarely allowed online.|$|R

5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by <b>straddling</b> lanes or by spreading grit or de-icer. In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|E

The Chesapeake Regional Airport provides general aviation services and is located five miles (8km) outside the city limits.|$|E
5000|$|A short <b>straddle</b> is a {{non-directional}} options trading {{strategy that}} involves simultaneously selling a put and a {{call of the}} same underlying security, strike price and expiration date. The profit {{is limited to the}} premium received from the sale of put and call. The risk is virtually unlimited as large moves of the underlying security's price either up or down will cause losses proportional to the magnitude of the price move. A maximum profit upon expiration is achieved if the underlying security trades exactly at the strike price of the <b>straddle.</b> In that case both puts and calls comprising the <b>straddle</b> expire worthless allowing <b>straddle</b> owner to keep full credit received as their profit. This strategy is called [...] "nondirectional" [...] because the short <b>straddle</b> profits when the underlying security changes little in price before the expiration of the <b>straddle.</b> The short <b>straddle</b> can also be classified as a credit spread because the sale of the short <b>straddle</b> results in a credit of the premiums of the put and call.|$|R

5|$|Sangay (also {{known as}} Macas, Sanagay, or Sangai) {{is an active}} {{stratovolcano}} in central Ecuador. It is the most active volcano in Ecuador, despite erupting only three times in recorded history, because the eruption that started in 1934 is still ongoing. It exhibits mostly strombolian activity. Geologically, Sangay marks the southern boundary of the Northern Volcanic Zone, and its position <b>straddling</b> two major pieces of crust accounts for its high level of activity. Sangay's approximately 500,000-year-old history is one of instability; two previous versions of the mountain were destroyed in massive flank collapses, evidence of which still litters its surroundings today.|$|E

However, Kiribati officials were not reluctant to attempt {{to capitalize on the}} nation's new status as owners of the first land to see sunrise in 2000. Other Pacific nations, including Tonga and New Zealand's Chatham Islands, protested the move, objecting that it infringed on their claims to be the first land to see dawn in the year 2000.|$|E

5|$|Continuing into Onondaga County and {{the village}} of Jordan, NY31 begins to make a turn northward while {{connecting}} to {{the northern end of}} NY317 (the former northern terminus of NY31C) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment {{in the shadow of the}} Thruway. Once inside the limits of Van Buren, NY31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of NY173 in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of Baldwinsville, where NY31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the Seneca River to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY31 merges with NY690 northward, traversing the Seneca River and <b>straddling</b> the western edge of Baldwinsville.|$|E
5|$|From Gallery Place – Chinatown through Judiciary Square, {{the line}} runs southeast, turning east again at D Street to reach Union Station. There it turns north and {{surfaces}} adjacent to Union Station's platforms, follows the Washington Terminal yard tracks north to Brentwood {{where the line}} turns northwestward and again joins CSX Transportation's Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, running in a unique gauntlet arrangement with the freight railroad tracks <b>straddling</b> the Metro tracks. The Red Line continues in this manner northwest across the District-Maryland line, through Takoma and past Silver Spring. It reenters a tunnel at 16th Street and heads north under Georgia Avenue to the end at Glenmont. There is a maintenance yard between the NoMa and Rhode Island Avenue stops.|$|E

5|$|North of Artesia Boulevard, {{the rail}} line descends into the 10-mile (16km) Mid-Corridor Trench, with two streets <b>straddling</b> it at ground level: Alameda Street {{to the west}} and a local {{frontage}} road to the east. All cross streets are thus grade-separated from the rail line while intersecting the streets at grade, except for Rosecrans Avenue, which bridges over all three. Crossings along this segment include the Century Freeway (I-105, no access), Imperial Highway, Firestone Boulevard (former SR 42), and Slauson Avenue. Just south of 25th Street, the rail line curves northeast out of the trench, and the two roadways join to become a single Alameda Street, which soon interchanges with the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10), {{at the north end of}} what is legislated as Route 47. The street continues north through the east side of downtown Los Angeles, crossing the Santa Ana Freeway (US 101) just west of Union Station, and ending soon after at Elmyra Street, where it becomes Spring Street.|$|E
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, <b>straddling</b> {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, <b>straddling</b> the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on Sheffield, killing {{three men and}} wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} the economy that splits investors into two groups. One group (the reference traders) trades an underlying asset according to the difference in realized returns between that asset and some evolving consensus estimate of those returns; the other group (hedgers) hedge options, namely <b>straddles,</b> on the underlying asset. We consider the cases when hedgers are long the <b>straddle</b> and when the hedgers are short the <b>straddle.</b> We numerically simulate the terminal distribution of the underlying asset price and find that hedgers that are long the <b>straddle</b> tend to push the underlying toward the strike, while hedgers that are short the <b>straddle</b> cause the underlying security to have a bimodal terminal probability distribution with a local minimum at the strike.
