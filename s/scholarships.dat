40|$|Publisher東京論文This paper {{examines}} how concepts of <b>scholarship,</b> especially <b>scholarship</b> {{of teaching and}} learning (SoTL) and <b>scholarship</b> of engagement (SoE), have developed among academic theorists based on Ernest L. Boyer's <b>Scholarship</b> Reconsidered (1990). To break out of the monotonous old debate of teaching versus research, Boyer attempted to redefine the meaning of <b>scholarship.</b> He proposed four types of <b>scholarship</b> -discovery, integration, application, and teaching— and insisted that they be equally respected. Since Boyer's proposition, many scholars have actively debated what <b>scholarship</b> is, and new concepts of <b>scholarship,</b> such as SoTL and SoE, have been developed. Recently, American <b>scholarship</b> has had two important tendencies: one is disaggregated, specific, and concrete; the other is aggregated, holistic, and abstract. Advocates of the former regard the new types of <b>scholarship,</b> such as SoTL and SoE, as extensions of one of Boyer's original four types. Hence, these advocates believe SoTL to be an extension of <b>scholarship</b> of teaching and SoE to be an extension of <b>scholarship</b> of application. These arguments provide concrete representations of <b>scholarship,</b> something that Boyer did not provide, and this helps people recognize the significance {{of teaching and learning}} or service and outreach. SoTL and SoE programs are useful in helping convince people that the work of teaching and learning should be evaluated. Because the call for accountability is strong today and certain specialized appointees typically focus their energies on only one of the traditionally integrated faculty functions, administrators and scholars are likely to welcome new types of <b>scholarship.</b> This specific and concrete concept has succeeded in appropriately evaluating work that Boyer had earmarked for evaluation. However, this concept of <b>scholarship</b> contains a weakness that disregards Boyer's principles. If one sees SoTL and SoE as merely developmental ideas of the <b>scholarship</b> of teaching and the <b>scholarship</b> of application, and as programs or activities concerning them, the possibility of conflict among research, teaching, and service arises anew. Hence, another conceptual type of <b>scholarship</b> has emerged: the comprehensive type, which advocates regard as a construction of Boyer's four forms of <b>scholarship</b> or a principle for constructing them. In this way, scholars regard SoTL as <b>scholarship</b> that emphasizes teaching and learning and SoE as a form that emphasizes service. This new, comprehensive type of <b>scholarship</b> yields a critical perspective on specific types. Boyer offers the four types of <b>scholarship</b> as a common ground concept that all academic professions must share, and comprehensive <b>scholarship</b> advocates the importance of the types of thinking inherent in those four original types. Advocates of comprehensive <b>scholarship</b> attempt to reconstruct Boyer's four types flexibly, so that American academic professions can foster diversity and share common ground...|$|R

Specifically. Boyer asserts that in his broader definition of <b>scholarship,</b> the <b>scholarship</b> of teaching entails assuring that “the work of the professor be-comes consequential because it is understood by others. As a scholarly endeavor, teaching both educates and entices future scholars. The <b>scholarship</b> of leaching demands that the teacher be informed and fully conversant with the knowledge of his or her field.
