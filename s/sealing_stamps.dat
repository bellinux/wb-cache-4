50|$|Two main {{types of}} seals {{were used in}} the Ancient Near East, the <b>stamp</b> <b>seal</b> and the {{cylinder}} <b>seal.</b> <b>Stamp</b> <b>seals</b> first appeared in ‘administrative’ contexts in central and northern Mesopotamia in the seventh millennium and were used exclusively until the fifth millennium. Cylinder seals appeared first around 3600 bc in southern Mesopotamia and south-western Iran (Middle Uruk Period). They gradually replaced <b>stamp</b> <b>seals,</b> becoming the tool of a rising class of bureaucrats {{in the early stages of}} state formation. Even though <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> were still produced in the third and second millennia, cylinder seals predominated. In the first millennium, <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> made a strong comeback and eventually replaced cylinder seals entirely.|$|R

If a <b>seal</b> or <b>stamp</b> is used, it is required to have the name of the notary as listed on their commission as well as their full title of office (Notary Public: State at Large or Notary Public: Special Commission).

50|$|The inescutcheon - {{the smaller}} shield within the bigger one - which already {{appeared}} on Brakel's coins in 1227, is {{the arms of}} the Lords of Brakel, who were the town's overlords until their male line died out in 1268. On {{the south side of the}} Town Hall is found an armorial stone, believed to be from the 16th century, that only shows the Lords' arms. Even written records from Paderborn in the 18th century contain only this inner shield as Brakel's coat of arms. From the late 13th century, the town of Brakel used a seal whose composition matches the blazon given above. A <b>seal</b> <b>stamp</b> used beginning in 1316 is still kept in the town archive today. When the coat of arms was newly adopted in 1907, the town chose to have the 1316 <b>seal</b> <b>stamp</b> composition in its arms. The colours seen in the inescutcheon are simply the town's colours, as the old Lords' armorial colours are unknown. In this form, the coat of arms was given Royal approval on 18 March 1908.|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that ancient Egyptian <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> dated between the late Old Kingdom {{and the early}} Middle Kingdom are associated with burials of women and children, although the actual women-children ratio of the pertinent tombs has not been sufficiently substantiated. In order to test the hypothesis, this study will statistically examine the distribution of <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> in burials at the cemeteries of Qāw and Balāṭ. It will be argued that <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> were significantly more frequently found in tombs of women, as opposed to tombs of both men and children. Modern Western European classification {{may have led to}} some burials being classified as those of ‘children’, while they could have been defined differently in their own society. A good part of the‘child burials’ with <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> therefore probably belong to persons that were considered ‘full-grown’ in ancient Egypt or that imitated adult behaviour. Consequently, it is argued that a considerable number of ‘children’ with <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> had a female sex. As a result, <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> in tombs are likely to have been typically female attributes and should mainly be related to female concerns, such as fertility and protection during child delivery. The few <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> found in male tombs could have had an administrative function or also a protective usage,because these objects were sometimes found in combination with amulets and beads. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{cylinder}} <b>seals,</b> <b>stamp</b> <b>seals</b> and cylinder seal impressions on the clay tablets {{have been found}} at Jemdet Nasr. Stylistically, these seals are {{a continuation of the}} preceding Uruk period. The cylinder seals display humans as well as animals in a very crude style. Over 80 of the clay tablets bore a sealing, showing humans, animals, buildings, containers and more abstract designs. Interestingly, none of the sealings on the tablets was made by the seals that were found at the site, indicating that sealing either occurred outside Jemdet Nasr or that seals could also be made of perishable materials. One sealing, found on thirteen tablets, lists the names of a number of cities surrounding Jemdet Nasr, including Larsa, Nippur, Ur and Uruk.|$|R
