One of {{the most}} important and difficult steps in the production of seed corn is drying and conditioning it, especially when seed production is done in ecological areas with limited temperature. Four inbred lines and four <b>simple</b> <b>hybrids</b> of maize (parental forms of maize hybrids developed at Agricultural Research Station Turda) were tested in five methods for drying seeds: three by harvesting ears at different humidity (between 38 % and 24 %) and artificial drying at 350 C and two by taking the humidity between 38 % and 26 % and natural drying. Both the <b>simple</b> <b>hybrids</b> and inbred lines of corn to artificial drying 350 C had a favorable effect on corn seedlings characters.

Randomized-blocks design was used with 57 treatments (45 experimental hybrids, 10 lines and 2 checks treatments) with 3 replications. A complete diallel among 10 tomato lines for processing was used.

Diallel crosses allowed synthesizing experimental hybrids with superior traits when compared to commercial hybrids. Non-additive effects prevailed over the expression of YT, YC, YP and TSS, whereas additive effects prevailed for MM.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the adaptability and stability of corn hybrids for grain yield in environments with high crop management standards. Ten corn hybrids were evaluated for grain yield in 48 environments, consisting of 12 locations over a period of four years in South Brazil.

Adaptability and stability were analyzed according to the bi-segmented discontinuous model with measurement errors in the variables. The behavior of hybrids was studied as a function of the average yield in the inferior and/or superior environments, the estimates of the parameters of the equation, and the quality of the fit. The 30 F 36 hybrid behaved better in the superior environments and it is indicated for farmers who adopt the highest technological standards for crop management, whereas the 30 F 53 hybrid was classified as close to ideal; that is, it is indicated for cultivation under various environmental conditions.

Historic heritability scenarios of five traits and other genetic architecture settings were used to compare models, evaluating the predictive ability and estimation of variance components. Marginal differences were detected between the multivariate and univariate models. The main explanation for the small discrepancy between models is the low- to moderate-magnitude correlations between the traits studied and moderate heritabilities.

40|$|A cost {{analysis}} reveals that hybridisation of electrodialysis with reverse osmosis is only justified if {{the cost of}} water from the reverse osmosis unit is less than 40 % of that from a stand-alone electrodialysis system. In such cases the additional reverse osmosis costs justify the electrodialysis cost savings brought about by shifting salt removal to higher salinity, where current densities are higher and equipment costs lower. Furthermore, the analysis suggests that a <b>simple</b> <b>hybrid</b> configuration is more cost effective than a recirculated <b>hybrid,</b> a <b>simple</b> <b>hybrid</b> being one where the reverse osmosis concentrate is fed to the electrodialysis stack and the products from both units are blended, and a recirculated being one hybrid involving recirculation of the electrodialysis product back to the reverse osmosis unit. The underlying rationale is that simple hybridisation shifts salt removal away from the lowest salinity zone of operation, where salt removal is most expensive. Further shifts in the salinity at which salt is removed, brought about by recirculation, do not justify the associated increased costs of reverse osmosis.

40|$|Abstract- <b>Simple</b> <b>hybrid</b> photovoltaic/thermal or PV/T solar {{water systems}} are commercially unattractive {{due to its}} less {{combined}} efficiency, low concentration ratios, long payback period etc. The augmentation of solar radiation on module surface is the easy and cost effective method to increase concentration ratio and combined PV/T efficiency of <b>simple</b> <b>hybrid</b> solar system. This can be accomplishing by design, fabricating and attaching the aluminum reflectors to module sides of hybrid solar system. This paper offers design and performance analysis of oscillatory flow heat exchanger used in hybrid system fitted with aluminum reflectors. The investigational results such as performance efficiencies of photovoltaic, thermal, and combined PV/T system over a range of operating conditions are determined and assessed for latitude of Mumbai. At solar radiation of 929 W/m 2 and water flow rate of 0. 042 kg/sec, the present hybrid system has generated combined PV/T efficiency of 65. 10 % with PV efficiency of 12. 50 %. Recommendations for enhancing performance of hybrid system with reflectors have discussed in the paper.

40|$|A simple {{tapered fiber}} based photonic-plasmonic hybrid {{nanostructure}} {{composed of a}} thin tapered fiber and a pseudoisocyanine (PIC) -attached Au-coated tip was demonstrated. Using this <b>simple</b> <b>hybrid</b> nanostructure, we succeeded in observing two-photon excited fluorescence from the PIC dye molecules under a weak continuous wave excitation condition. From {{the results of the}} tip-fiber distance dependence and excitation polarization dependence, we found that using a thin tapered fiber and an Au-coated tip realized efficient coupling of the incident light (similar to 95 %) and LSP excitation at the Au-coated tip, suggesting the possibility of efficiently inducing two-photon excited fluorescence from the PIC dye molecules attached on the Au-coated tip. This <b>simple</b> photonic-plasmonic <b>hybrid</b> system is one of the promising tools for single photon sources, highly efficient plasmonic sensors, and integrated nonlinear plasmonic devices.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to identify salt tolerant potato genotypes in vitro among 131 tetraploid potato cultivars (Solanum tuberosum), 9 diploid <b>simple</b> <b>hybrid</b> clones (4 clones of S. chacoense $ times$ S. tuberosum, 4 clones of S. phureja/S. stenotomum $ times$ S. tuberosum, and 1 clone of S. tuberosum $ times$ S. tuberosum), 1 primitive cultivated diploid S. phureja/S. stenotomum accession, 12 tetraploid complex hybrids, and 13 diploid S. chacoense accessions. Four levels of NaCl (0, 40, 80, and 120 mM) were used. The cultivars, and the <b>simple</b> and complex <b>hybrids</b> were tested for salt tolerance at the vegetative stage in the nodal cutting bioassay. The thirteen S. chacoense accessions were tested for salt tolerance at the germination and early seedling growth stage, in a seedling bioassay. Eleven of these S. chacoense accessions were further tested at the vegetative stage, in the nodal cutting bioassay. There was a progressive decline in the morphological parameters measured, with increased salt levels, in the nodal cutting bioassay. The parameters were used collectively in ranking the different genotypes, averaged over three NaCl levels (40, 80, and 120 mM). Twenty potato cultivars, two clones of the <b>simple</b> <b>hybrid</b> S. chacoense $ times$ S. tuberosum, and one complex hybrid were all considered salt tolerant at the vegetative stage. Ranking of seven S. chacoense accessions was similar between early seedling growth and later vegetative stage. Two of these accessions were promising as sources of salt tolerance...|$|R
