5|$|Aspasia {{appears in}} the {{philosophical}} writings of Plato, Xenophon, Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes.

According to Charles Kahn, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, Diotima is in many respects Plato's response to Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, NASA held a <b>symposium</b> <b>on</b> project costs which {{presented}} {{an estimate of}} the Apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly $170 billion. This included all research and development costs; the procurement of 15 Saturn V rockets, 16 Command/Service Modules, 12 Lunar Modules, plus program support and management costs; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading, and costs for flight operations. This was based on a Congressional Budget Office report, A Budgetary Analysis of NASA's New Vision for Space, September 2004. The Space Review estimated in 2010 the cost of Apollo from 1959 to 1973 as $20.4 billion, or $109 billion in 2010 dollars.|$|E
5|$|Launch and Early Orbit Phase {{operations}} were {{completed in the}} morning of 11 April 2010, and SIRAL-2 was activated later the same day. At 14:40 UTC, the spacecraft returned its first scientific data. Initial data on ice thickness was presented by the mission's Lead Investigator, Duncan Wingham, at the 2010 Living Planet <b>Symposium</b> <b>on</b> 1 July. Later the same month, data was made available to scientists for the first time. The spacecraft underwent six months of on-orbit testing and commissioning, which concluded with a review on 22 October 2010 that found the spacecraft was operating as expected, and that it was ready to begin operations.|$|E
5|$|The sixth mission {{began in}} 2010 as an {{extension}} of the fifth Mission theme of autonomous indoor flight behavior, however the sixth mission demanded more advanced behaviors than were currently possible by any aerial robot extant in 2010. This espionage mission involved covertly stealing a flash drive from a particular room in a building, for which there was no a priori knowledge of the floor plan, and depositing an identical drive to avoid detection of the theft. The 2010 <b>Symposium</b> <b>on</b> Indoor Flight Issues was held concurrently at the University of Puerto Rico - Mayag√ºez during the 20th anniversary competition. The Official Rules for the 6th Mission are available at the Competition web site.|$|E
