40|$|CI-FLOW {{is a new}} {{technology}} being utilized to identify flood hazards. CI-FLOW stands for the Coastal and Inland Flooding Observation and Warning project. CI-FLOW was implemented ten {{years ago by the}} directors of Sea Grant and NOAA, along with other North Carolina partners and state agencies. The National Weather Service has one forecast point in Louisburg, NC, on the Tar River. The addition of additional USGS gauges is important for effective identification of flood hazards. The accurate and timely identification of flood hazards is important given the growing and seasonally fluctuating population of Dare County. Approximately one-half of the housing in Dare County is seasonal, and emergency mangers must account for this. For instance, it is estimated that in 2030, if a category three hurricane hit during a time of peak tourism, emergency managers would need to clear 30, 000 vehicles in 31 hours. Given the importance flood identification, an integrated approach is needed for accurate and timely identification. The utilization of storm surge models and observations of weather and river levels, is key in flood identification. Three-dimensional images linked with real-time data can help assess the dangers of a flood and aid in emergency management decisions. CI-FLOW is being used to time crests and discharges along with a coupled model which links water and storm <b>surge</b> <b>discharge.</b> In conclusion, the CI-FLOW project is a multi-agency evaluation of new technologies to better identify floods in the Tar-Pamlico and Neuse river basins...|$|E

40|$|In {{the tidal}} rivers, {{determination}} of salinity concentration {{is a complex}} problem. Tidal surges and fresh water influence the tidal river. These factors are two independent phenomena. These phenomena are combined by joint probability method. Salinity concentration depends on tidal height {{in the mouth of}} the tidal rivers and discharge of fresh water in the upstream of the tidal rivers. Distribution coefficient of no tidal rivers depends on velocity of current, radius of hydraulic and Manning`s coefficient. In addition to above factors, distribution coefficient of tidal rivers depends on domain of tidal surge, period tidal <b>surge</b> and the <b>discharge</b> of fresh water. The Karun River in Iran was selected for case study. This river is the most important tidal river in Iran.

40|$|The low-lying Netherlands is at {{risk from}} {{multiple}} threats of sea level rise, storm surges and extreme river discharges. Should these occur simultaneously, a catastrophe will be at hand. Knowledge about the likelihood of simultaneous occurrence or the so-called "compound effect" of such threats is essential to provide guidance on legislation for dike heights, flood barrier design and water management in general. In this study, we explore the simultaneous threats of North Sea storm surges and extreme Rhine river discharge for the current and future climate in a large 17 -member global climate model ensemble. We use a simple approach, taking proxies of north-northwesterly winds over the North Sea and multiple~day precipitation averaged over the Rhine basin for storm <b>surge</b> and <b>discharge</b> respectively, so that a sensitivity analysis is straightforward to apply. By investigating soft extremes, we circumvent the need to extrapolate the data and thereby permit the model's synoptic development of the extreme events to be inspected. Our principle finding based on the climate model data is that, for the current climate, the probability of extreme surge conditions following extreme 20 -day precipitation sums is around 3 times higher than that estimated from treating extreme <b>surge</b> and <b>discharge</b> probabilities as independent, as previously assumed. For the future climate (2070 – 2100), the assumption of independence cannot be rejected, {{at least not for}} precipitation sums exceeding 7 days...|$|R
30|$|A {{storm surge}} {{therefore}} represents an ideal event for sediment input in a marsh (e.g., Cahoon 2006; Reed 1989; Turner et al. 2006): the strong wind {{associated with the}} storm produces waves that resuspend fine sediments in front of marshes, and the wind and wave setup increases the maximum tide level and thereby the water discharge during flood in the channels (by increasing the tidal prism; see Equations 1, 2). Therefore during a storm <b>surge</b> both <b>discharge</b> and sediment concentrations of the entering water are magnified, augmenting the total volume of sediment imported in the marsh (Equation 4).|$|R

Flood risk analysis of river deltas is complex, because both storm <b>surges</b> and river <b>discharges</b> may cause flooding {{and the effect}} of upstream breaches on downstream water levels and flood risk must be taken into account.

40|$|Low-lying {{coastal regions}} and their populations {{are at risk}} during storm surge events and high {{freshwater}} discharges from upriver. An integrated storm surge and flood inundation modeling system was used to simulate storm surge and inundation in the Tsengwen River basin and the adjacent coastal area in southern Taiwan. A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model with an unstructured grid was used, which was driven by the tidal elevation at the open boundaries and freshwater discharge at the upriver boundary. The model was validated against the observed water levels for three typhoon events. The simulation results for the model were in reasonable agreement with the observational data. The model was then applied to investigate {{the effects of a}} storm <b>surge,</b> freshwater <b>discharge,</b> and a storm surge combined with freshwater discharge during an extreme typhoon event. The super Typhoon Haiyan (2013) was artificially shifted to hit Taiwan: the modeling results showed that the inundation area and depth would cause severe overbank flow and coastal flooding for a 200 year return period flow. A high-resolution grid model is essential for the accurate simulation of storm surges and inundation...|$|R
40|$|Submerged {{granular}} hoppers exhibit {{an unexpected}} <b>surge</b> in <b>discharge</b> rate as they empty [Wilson et al. 2015]. With a more sensitive apparatus, {{we find that}} this surge depends on hopper diameter and also happens in air [...] - though the effect is smaller and previously unnoticed. We also find that the surge may be turned off by fixing the rate of fluid flow through the granular packing. With no flow control, dye injected {{on top of the}} packing gets drawn into the grains, at a rate that increases as the hopper empties. Thus we conclude that the surge is caused by a self-generated pumping of fluid through the packing. We successfully model this effect via a driving pressure set by the dilation of grains as they exit. This highlights a surprising and unrecognized role that interstitial fluid plays in setting the discharge rate, and likely also in controlling clog formation, for granular hoppers whether in air or under water.

30|$|This {{equation}} {{is defined as}} the static model (tub model) and was first presented by Boon (1975). Since then it has been extensively used in salt marsh hydrodynamics (e.g., D’Alpaos et al. 2006, 2007, 2010; Lawrence et al. 2004). This model implies that when there is a sharp increase in flooded area A, the <b>discharge</b> <b>surges</b> because more water is needed to flood a larger surface (or more water must be removed to drain it; see Figure  1 B,C). As a result, two distinct surges are occurring in the channels, one when the marsh platform is first flooded and one when the marsh platform is drained. These surges have been measured in salt marsh channels by several authors (Myrick and Leopold 1963; Bayliss-Smith et al. 1978; Healey et al. 1981; French and Stoddart 1992).|$|R
40|$|In this Report, the {{possibility}} of utilizing joint probability methods in coastal flood hazard component calculations is investigated, since flood risk is rarely a function of just one source variable but usually more {{of two or three}} variables such as river <b>discharge,</b> storm <b>surge,</b> wave etc. Joint probability values provide the likelihood of source variables taking high values simultaneously and resulting to a situation where flooding may occur. This report focuses on data preparation, parameter selection and methodology application. The source variable-pairs presented here, which include enough information for calculations, are: (i) surge & wave, (ii) <b>surge</b> & <b>discharge</b> and (iii) wave & discharge. The analysis is focused over 32 river ending (RIEN) points that have been selected to cover a variety of coastal environments along European riverine and estuary areas. In the absence of coincident long-term measurements, the methodology of simulating data observations by modelling was adapted resulting to a set of hindcasts for the three source variables (surge, wave height and <b>discharge).</b> Storm <b>surge</b> hindcasts were performed by utilising the hydrodynamic model Delft 3 D-Flow that was forced by wind and pressure terms from ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. In a similar way, wave hindcasts were generated by utilizing the latest version of ECMWF ECWAM wave (stand-alone) model, forced by neutral wind terms from ERA-Interim. For the construction of river discharge hindcasts the LISFLOOD model – developed by the floods group of the Natural Hazards Project of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) – was employed. Validation of hindcasts was made over the RIEN point of river Rhine (NL) where coincident observations were available. Considering the physical driver complexity behind interactions among surge, wave height and discharge variables, hindcasts were found to perform quite well, not only simulating observation values over the common interval of interest, but also in resolving the right type and strength of both correlations and statistical dependencies. Results are presented by means of analytical tables and detailed maps referring to both correlation and dependence (chi) values being estimated over RIEN points. In particular, dependencies coming from such analytical tables can be used in an easy way to calculate the joint return period for any combined event by inserting chi in a simple formula containing the individual return periods of source variables. It is then straightforward to estimate the joint probability value as the inverse of the joint return period. Overall, the highest values of (strong / very strong) correlations and dependencies were found between surges and waves mainly over North Sea and English Channel with (such combined) events to take place on the same day (zero-lag mode). Moderate to well category dependencies were found for most sea areas, also on a zero-lag mode. In the case of <b>surge</b> and river <b>discharge,</b> moderate to well category values were found in most cases but not in a zero-lag mode as in surge & wave case. It became clear that in order to achieve such (relatively high) values, a considerable lag time interval of a few days was required with <b>surge</b> clearly leading <b>discharge</b> values. For the case of wave and river discharge, well to strong category values were found but once more mostly in non-zero lag mode indicating the necessity of a considerable lag time interval for dependence to reach such (well / strong) values with wave distinctly leading discharge values.

40|$|A {{finite volume}} model (FVCOM) {{was used to}} {{investigate}} the combined influence of storm surge and river flow on floodplain inundation {{on the basis of}} idealized estuary test cases. The combined influence of storm <b>surge</b> and river <b>discharge</b> typical of extremes in estuary systems in Britain (up to 2 m and 1500 m 3 s− 1) was found to induce interactions that lead to increases in the nontidal residual elevation of up to 0. 35 m. However, the extent of the inundation was found to be mainly controlled by the surge elevation. Exceeding the threshold of the up-estuary channel capacity was found to cause a nonlinear increase {{in the area of the}} nontidal inundation for any given peak river discharge, after which the rate of increase in inundation area as the surge height increases declines and is determined by the slope of the floodplain. This threshold is determined by the surge elevation with exception of the highest peak river <b>discharges,</b> where the <b>surge</b> elevation threshold is lowered. It was also found that the extent of the interactions and inundation were highly dependent on the geometry of the estuary and the timing of the surge with respect to peak river discharge, in particular the slope of the floodplain and at such times where the river discharge was similar in magnitude to that of the surge and the tide. After calibration an idealized estuary based in the LISFLOOD-FP code, using a simplified form of the two-dimensional (2 D) shallow-water equations, was found to simulate the area of maximum inundation to a similar extent as the FVCOM model (based on the full 2 D shallow-water equations) with a much reduced computation time. This paper highlights the potential advantages that simplified 2 D inundation models may have for simulating estuarine flooding due to combined <b>surge</b> and river <b>discharge,</b> where surge–river interaction due to momentum exchange is insignificant in determining the flood extent and simplified equations capture the dominant hydrological drivers of coastal inundation...|$|R

From the reconstruction of their transport pathways, we deduce the mechanisms that explain their distributions. The main source regions are the Canadian shield (mostly the area of Baffin Bay and western Greenland), the Scandinavian shield, the European region (British Isles and Bay of Biscay), and Iceland. We observe a significant glacial/interglacial contrast, characterized by a dominant Icelandic input via near-bottom transport by North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) during the interglacials and a largely continent-derived contribution of surface-transported, ice-rafted detritus (IRD) during the glacial period. During the last glacial period, the Heinrich events (abrupt, massive discharges of IRD) originated not only from the Laurentide ice sheet as heretofore envisioned but also from other sources. Three other major North Atlantic ice sheets (Fennoscandian, British Isles, and Icelandic) probably <b>surged</b> simultaneously, <b>discharging</b> ice and IRD into the North Atlantic. As opposed to theories implying a unique, Laurentide origin [Gwiazda et al., 1996 doi: 10. 1029 / 95 PA 03135] driven by an internal mechanism [MacAyeal, 1993 doi: 10. 1029 / 93 PA 02200], we confirm that the Icelandic and the Fennoscandian ice sheets also surged as recently proposed by other authors, and we here also distinguish a possible detrital contribution from the British Isles ice sheet.

40|$|AbstractUK estuarine environments are {{regulated}} by inter-acting physical processes, including tidal, wave, <b>surge,</b> river <b>discharge</b> and sediment supply. They regulate the fluxes of nutrients, pollutants, pathogens and viruses that determine whether coastlines achieve the Good Environmental Status (GEnS) {{required by the}} EU's Marine Strategy Directive. We review 20 th century trends and 21 st century projections of changes to climatic drivers, and their potential for altering estuarine bio-physical processes. Sea-level rise will cause some marine habitats to expand, and others diminish in area extent. The overall consequences of estuarine morphodynamics to these habitat shifts, and vice-versa, are unknown. Increased temperatures could intensify microbial pathogen concentrations and increase public health risk. The patterns of change of other climatic drivers are difficult to predict (e. g., river flows and storm surges). Projected increased winter river flows throughout UK catchments will enhance the risks of coastal eutrophication, harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in some contexts, although there are spatial variabilities in river flow projections. The reproductive success of estuarine biota is sensitive to saline intrusion and corresponding turbidity maxima, which are projected to gradually shift landwards {{as a result of}} sea-level rise. Although more-frequent flushing events in winter and longer periods of drought in summer are predicted, whereby the subsequent estuarine mixing and recovery rates are poorly understood. With rising estuarine salinities, subtidal species can penetrate deeper into estuaries, although this will depend on the resilience/adaptation of the species. Many climate and impact predictions lack resolution and spatial cover.

40|$|Inflation {{of narrow}} tube-fed basaltic lava flows (tens of meters across), {{such as those}} {{confined}} by topography, can be focused predominantly along {{the roof of a}} lava tube. This can lead to the development of an unusually long tumulus, its shape matching the sinuosity of the underlying lava tube. Such a situation occurred during Klauea Volcanos (Hawaii, USA) ongoing East Rift Zone eruption on a lava tube active from July through November 2010. Short-lived breakouts from the tube buried the flanks of the sinuous, ridge-like tumulus, while the tumulus crest, its surface composed of lava formed very early in the flows emplacement history, remained poised above the surrounding younger flows. At least several of these breakouts resulted in irrecoverable uplift of the tube roof. Confined sections of the prehistoric Carrizozo and McCartys flows (New Mexico, USA) display similar sinuous, ridge-like features with comparable surface age relationships. We contend that these distinct features formed in a fashion equivalent to that of the sinuous tumulus that formed at Klauea in 2010. Moreover, these sinuous tumuli may be analogs for some sinuous ridges evident in orbital images of the Tharsis volcanic province on Mars. The short-lived breakouts from the sinuous tumulus at Klauea were caused by <b>surges</b> in <b>discharge</b> through the lava tube, in response to cycles of deflation and inflation (DI events) at Klauea's summit. The correlation between DI events and subsequent breakouts aided in lava flow forecasting. Breakouts from the sinuous tumulus advanced repeatedly toward the sparsely populated Kalapana Gardens subdivision, destroying two homes and threatening others. Hazard assessments, including flow occurrence and advance forecasts, were relayed regularly to the Hawaii County Civil Defense to aid their lava flow hazard mitigation efforts while this lava tube was active...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{developments}} in coastal zones are often exposed to natural hazards such as flooding. In this research, a state-of-the-art, multi-scale nested flood (MSN_Flood) model {{is applied to}} simulate complex coastal-fluvial urban flooding due to combined effects of tides, <b>surges</b> and river <b>discharges.</b> Cork city on Ireland's southwest coast is a study case. The flood modelling system comprises a cascade of four dynamically linked models that resolve the hydrodynamics of Cork Harbour and/or its sub-region at four scales: 90, 30, 6 and 2  m. Results demonstrate that the internalization of the nested boundary {{through the use of}} ghost cells combined with a tailored adaptive interpolation technique creates a highly dynamic moving boundary that permits flooding and drying of the nested boundary. This novel feature of MSN_Flood provides a high degree of choice regarding the location of the boundaries to the nested domain and therefore flexibility in model application.

40|$|A {{flexible}} mesh {{hydrodynamic model}} {{was developed to}} simulate flooding of the LaHave River watershed in Nova Scotia, Canada, from the combined effects of fluvial discharge and ocean tide and surge conditions. The analysis incorporated high-resolution lidar elevation data, bathymetric river and coastal chart data, and river cross-section information. These data were merged to generate a seamless digital elevation model which was used, along with river discharge and tidal elevation data, to run a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model to produce flood risk predictions for the watershed. Fine resolution topography data were integrated seamlessly with coarse resolution bathymetry using a series of GIS tools. Model simulations were carried out using DHI Mike 21 Flexible Mesh {{under a variety of}} combinations of discharge events and storm <b>surge</b> levels. <b>Discharge</b> events were simulated for events that represent a typical annual maximum runoff and extreme events, while tide and storm surge events were simulated by using the predicted tidal time series and adding 2 and 3 m storm surge events to the ocean level seaward of the mouth of the river. Model output was examined and the maximum water level for the duration of each simulation was extracted and merged into one file that was used in a GIS to map the maximum flood extent and water depth. Upstream areas were most vulnerable to fluvial discharge events, the lower estuary was most vulnerable to the effect of storm surge and sea-level rise, and the Town of Bridgewater was influenced by the combined effects of <b>discharge</b> and storm <b>surge.</b> To facilitate the use of the results for planning officials, GIS flood risk layers were intersected with critical infrastructure, identifying the roads, buildings, and municipal sewage infrastructure at risk under each flood scenario.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{seasonal}} and spatial distribution of phytoplankters in relation to physio-chemical parameters and discharge regime was conducted in Barren Lake, Kentucky, a flood control reservoir with a dam equipped with a multilevel outlet, from February, 1970, through January, 1971. Paired samples were collected every two weeks from April through October and every three weeks from November through March. Samples were obtained from eight depths in the main pool area of the reservoir and from the tailwater. Reservoir discharge was primarily from the upper 3 m from April through September. At other times, discharge incorporated lower levels to reach and maintain lower winter pool levels. Based upon chemical and biological characteristics, Barren Lake may {{be considered to be}} mesotrophic. The alkalinity levels of the lake (range: 44 - 129 mg/ 1) averaged 91 mg/ 1 over the study period. An anaerobic hypolimnion developed in the late summer, and pH was consistently slightly alkaline. The phytoplankton community was dominated by taxa considered to be characteristic of both eutrophic and oligotrophic waters, but maxima were relatively low (77000 - 155000 cells/ 1). During the study, five major phytoplankton populations were present: March-April, Melosira italica; June, Ceratium hirundinella; July, Asterionella formosa and Dinobryon sertularia; August, Fragilaria crotonensis; and December, Melosira granulata. Two distinct minima occurred in February and May. The main controlling factors for seasonal and spatial succession were concluded to be the physical effects of changing light, temperature, turbidity, turbulence, and discharge. Nutrients, which fluctuated with plankton populations, were always above reported limiting values. Zooplankton, although inversely correlated with phytoplankton populations in the spring, were not felt to affect significantly the phytoplankton populations due to the species composition of the phytoplankton community. The February minimum of 2159 cells/ 1 coincided with high discharge (3600 cfs), high turbidity (123. 8 mg/ 1), and low temperature (3. 3 C). The March-April pulse coincided with the spring increases of light, temperature, and nutrients. The main factors contributing to the pulse was a reduction in discharge (500 cfs), high turbulence, and the improvement in general growing conditions. During May, increasing effects of stratification on turbulence and the rise of discharge rate to 3600 cfs contributed to the spring minimum. In June, Ceratium hirundinella pulsed during high alkalinity (118. 8 mg/ 1) and high temperature (22 - 24 C). It declined as alkalinity decreased to a seasonal low (72. 9 mg/ 1) and disappeared in the fall when temperature dropped below 7. 5 C. Asterionella formosa achieved dominance (2384 cells/ 1) in July below the 6 m level, being restricted there due to its inability to tolerate the high temperature (24 - 29 C) and light intensity (35000 lux @ 0. 5 m) in more shallow waters. Its occurrence so late in the year was attributed to its inability to compete with the Melosira populations of early spring. The decline of A. formosa correlated with increases in temperature and decreases in light at the lower depths. Dinobryon sertularia was associated seasonally and spatially with the populations of A. formosa. Fragilari a crotonens is dominated the phytoplankton maximum of 155754 cells/ 1 in August. It succeeded A_. formosa due to its ability to tolerate higher temperatures (24 - 29 C) and to utilize nutrients, particularly silica, more efficiently. Its subsequent decline corresponded to decreases in temperature, an increase in discharge (1000 cfs), and a decrease in light in late September. Following the decline of F. crotonensis, Melosira granulata produced a maximum of 45062 cells/ 1 in December. Its succession was attributed to the return of homothermy and the resulting increases in turbulence and nutrients at fall overturn. The size of the population may have been influenced by the <b>surge</b> in <b>discharge</b> (3600 cfs) in November. In January, a sharp decline in the population coincided with a <b>surge</b> in <b>discharge</b> (3600 cfs) and decreases of temperature and light to seasonal lows. Tailwater plankton populations generally correlated with main pool populations. Tailwater phytoplankton populations tended to be somewhat lower than those of the main pool. Discrepancies, when they occurred, were attributed to difficulties with sampling equipment, high discharge (3600 cfs), and stratification of plankton populations when discharge occurred from levels not associated with those populations...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to assess}} the causes of inefficient and unstable operation of centrifugal compressors and turboexpanders in process gas applications {{in order to provide}} a solution for performance restoration and enhancement. It encompasses thermodynamic and flow evaluations to examine the efficiency and operating range improvement options of new units. Besides, this work is complemented by a technoeconomic analysis to provide a rounded outcome from these studies. In order to achieve the desired objectives, a novel integrated approach has been developed {{to assess the}} design and performance of multi-stage centrifugal compressors. The proposed systematic methodology involves five basic elements including evaluation of compressor selection, compressor sizing and casing structure, performance prediction at the design and off-design conditions, modelling of efficiency and head deterioration causes; and stage design evaluation. This will contribute towards evaluating the geometrical parameters of the new units’ designs at the early preliminary design phase, and thus, will be useful to identify the options for efficiency and operating range enhancements. For installed units, this approach can be implemented to assess the cause of inefficient and unstable operation by assessing the available operation data. A method was developed to predict the performance curve of multi-stage centrifugal compressor based on a stage stacking technique. This approach considers the advantages of Lüdtke and Casey-Robinson methods with an incorporation of a methodology for compressor selection and sizing to generate more accurate results. To emphasize the validity of the developed model, it has been evaluated for both low and high flow coefficient applications. The obtained results show a significant improvement in the estimated efficiency, pressure ratio, shaft power and operating range as compared with the existing methods. The centrifugal compressor is designed to run under various operating conditions and different gas compositions with the primary objective of high efficiency and reliability. Therefore, a new iterative method has been developed to predict the equivalent compressor performance at off-design conditions. This technique uses the performance parameters at design conditions as a reference point to derive the corresponding performance characteristics at numerous suction conditions with less dependency on the geometrical features. Through a case study on a gas transport centrifugal compressor, {{it was found that the}} developed approach can be applied for design evaluation on the expected variation of working conditions, and for the operation diagnosis of installed units as well. Furthermore, a parametric study has been conducted to investigate the effect of gas properties on the stage efficiency, surge margin, and compressor structure. The obtained results support the need for considering the gas properties variation when the off-design performance is derived. To evaluate the impact of internal blockage on the performance parameters, this study proposed an approach to model the effect of non-reactive deposits, which has been qualified using four operation cases and the obtained results are compared with the internal inspection findings from the stage overhauling process. This also covers the influential aspects of flow blockage on the technical and economic values. Since the main challenge here is to analyze the process gas composition in real time, the influences of the non-reactive deposits have been compared with the effect of the unanticipated gas composition change. Subsequently, it has turned out that the pressureratio parameter is not enough to assess the possibility of flow blockage and unexpected gas properties change. Moreover, it was observed that the stage discharge pressure was more sensitive to the fouled aftercooler comparing with suction and internal blockage. However, the effect of contaminated aftercooler on the <b>surge</b> point and <b>discharge</b> pressure and temperature of the upstream stage was found greater than its impact on the shaft power. Thus, a substantial surge margin reduction was detected when the first stage was operating with a fouled aftercooler comparing with the measured reduction as a result of unanticipated gas properties change. Furthermore, a larger pressure ratio drop was measured in the case of liquid carryover which revealed a more significant impact of the two phases densities difference comparing with the gas volume fraction (GVF) effect. The possibility of hydrate formation has been assessed using hydrate formation temperature (HFT) criteria. Additionally, this research highlights a number of challenges facing the selection of typical centrifugal stage design by assessing the contribution of design characteristics on the operating efficiency and stable flow range. Besides, an empirical-based-model was established to select the optimum impeller and diffuser configurations in order to make a compromise decision based on technical and economic perspective. It was concluded that there is no absolute answer to the question of optimum rotor and stator configuration. The preliminary aerothermodynamic evaluation exposed that the selection of the optimum impeller structure is governed by several variables: stage efficiency, pressure loss coefficient, manufacturing cost, required power cost, resonance frequency and stable operating range. Hence, an evaluation is required to compromise between these parameters to ensure better performance. Furthermore, it was argued throughout this study that the decision-making process of the typical stage geometrical features has to be based upon the long-term economic performance optimization. Thus, for higher long-term economic performance, it is not sufficient to select the characteristics of the impeller and diffuser geometry based on the low manufacturing cost or efficiency improvement criterion only. For turboexpanders, a simple and low cost tool has been developed to determine the optimum turboexpander characteristics by analysing the generated design alternatives. This approach was used in designing a turboexpander for hydrocarbon liquefaction process. Moreover, since the turboexpanders are expected to run continuously at severe gas conditions, the performance of the selected turboexpander was evaluated at different inlet flow rates and gas temperatures. It has turned out that designing a turboexpander with the maximum isentropic efficiency is not always possible due to the limitations of the aerodynamic parameters for each component. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the stage geometrical features prior the construction process to compromise between the high capital cost and the high energetic efficiency...|$|R
