The thermally unstable bis-alkyl yttrium compound, Y{i}(CH 2 SiMe 3) 2 was isolated as the bis-adduct (4) and the bis-aryloxide Y{i}(OAr) 2 (5) was synthesized by elimination of LiOAr from Y(OAr) 3. The bis-amide complex Y{i} 2 Cl (6) and conversion to a rare example of an yttrium benzyl compound Y{i} 2 (CH 2 Ph) (7) are described. The yttrium cation, [Y{i} 2]+, was synthesized by benzyl abstraction from 7 using B(C 6 F 5) 3.

40|$|A {{series of}} ternary <b>scandium</b> {{chlorides}} <b>compounds</b> that contain an interstitial atom {{in the center}} of a distorted octahedron of scan- dium atoms have been synthesized in high yield with high tempera- ture techniques. The compounds characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction have the stoichiometries Sc(, 7) Cl(, 12) X, Sc(, 4) Cl(, 6) X, Sc(, 5) Cl(, 8) Y, Sc(, 7) Cl(, 10) C(, 2), 1 T-Sc(, 2) Cl(, 2) Y, and 3 R-Sc(, 2) Cl(, 2) C (X = B or N; Y = C or N). The respective metal arrays in these compounds can be viewed as fragments of scandium metal ranging from discrete Sc(, 6) cluster species Sc Sc(, 6) (X) Cl(, 6), through intermediate single and double infinite chain configurations Sc(, 4) (X) Cl(, 6), (ScCl(, 2)) Sc(, 4) (Y) Cl(, 6), and (ScCl(, 2)) Sc(, 6) (C) (, 2) Cl(, 8) to double metal close-packed sheets Sc(, 2) (Y) Cl(, 2), respectively;The stabilizing effect of scandium-interstitial bond formation was studied. Extended Huckel calculations on nonmetal-centered clusters demonstrate that the valence s and p orbitals of the inter- stitial atom interact with four orbitals primarily involved in Sc-Sc bonding to give four low-lying scandium-interstitial bonding orbitals. Other cluster orbitals obtain mainly Sc-Sc bonding character. Band calculation and photoelectron spectroscopy on 1 T-Sc(, 2) Cl(, 2) C suggest the Sc-C covalent bonding. The magnetic susceptibility data of Sc(, 7) Cl(, 12) B, Sc(, 5) Cl(, 8) C, and Sc(, 7) Cl(, 10) C(, 2) reveal interesting but complicated magnetic properties;Another series of scandium monochloride hydrides have also been quantitatively synthesized at high temperatures.

The experimental work combines solvent extraction with advanced ion exchange methodology in a pilot facility capable of treating 5 m 3 solution per hour. Currently, the plant produces cerium carbonate, lanthanum oxide, neodymium oxide and concentrate of heavy rare earth metals. A batch of 45 t solids has been processed with the gain of 100 kg’s of REM concentrate. A mini-pilot plant with productivity above 50 liters per hour has been applied to recover scandium oxide and REE concentrates from the uranium ISL solution. As the preliminary product contains radioactivity (mainly strontium), an additional decontamination and cleaning of both concentrates by extraction has rendered a necessity.

40|$|International {{audience}} 45 Sc {{solid state}} NMR {{is a useful}} complementary tool to x-ray crystallographyfor structure determination. The recent developments {{in the field of}} intermetallic <b>scandium</b> <b>compounds</b> are reviewed. The structural topics concern defect formation, structural disorder, superstructure formation, as well as the detection of multiple scandium sites. To address questions of this kind, high-resolution 45 Sc NMR techniques have been established as a new structural tool for the quantification of the local coordination scan-dium environments and the detailed characterization of their internal NMR interaction parameters. Owing to the moderately sized nuclear electric quadrupole moment of 45 Sc, the magic-angle spinning spectra are affected both by first- and second-order quadrupo-lar perturbations, which can be analyzed and quantified by fast magic angle spinning, assisted by lineshape simulations. The resolution can be further improved by correlating triple quantum (TQ) with single quantum coherences. Using this 2 D NMR methodol-ogy, the effects of magnetic shielding and second-order quadrupolar perturbations on the MAS NMR lineshape cn be separated, enabling a more precise experimental characteri-zation of electric field gradients present at the 45 Sc nuclei. Structure validation includes the precise measurement of these parameters and comparison with quantum mechani-cally calculated values based on the atomic positions. In this regard, satisfactory results have been obtained using the WIEN 2 k programme...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of <b>scandium</b> <b>compounds.</b> One goal {{was to investigate the}} solution reactivity of {CSc 6 }I 12 Sc, which resulted in the isolation of a molecular scandium nitride, [(C 5 H 5) 2 ScNSc(C 5 H 5) (THF) ] 2, and a scandium propoxide complex, [(C 5 H 5) 2 Sc(µ-OPr) ] 2. Besides this, priority was given to the synthesis and characterization of the first scandium dinitrogen complex, [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 (µ-η 2 :η 2 -N 2), along with its precursor compounds: (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScCl(THF), (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(η 3 -C 3 H 5) and [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 [(µ-Ph) BPh 3]. The reduction of the latter complex with KC 8 under N 2 gave the elusive [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 (µ-η 2 :η 2 -N 2). Structure determination supported by DFT calculations revealed a coplanar arrangement of a bridging side-on bound dinitrogen unit and two scandium atoms. In one reaction, the dinitrogen complex co-crystallized with an oxide impurity as {[(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 (µ-η 2 :η 2 -N 2) [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 (µ-O) }. Additionally, the borohydride complexes (C 5 Me 4 R) 2 M(BH 4) (THF) x (M = Sc, Y; R = H, Me; x = 0, 1) were prepared. Yttrium borohydride complexes were investigated with respect to their dinitrogen activation capability, but were found to be inactive. Ligand based reactivity of (C 5 Me 4 R) 2 Sc(η 3 -C 3 H 5) (R = H, Me) occured with 9 -BBN (9 -borabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane) to form the corresponding (C 5 Me 4 R) 2 Sc(µ-H) 2 BC 8 H 14 complexes, from which oxygen exposure (R = H) yielded (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(µ-O) BC 8 H 14. Subsequent investigations focused on the reaction of [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 [(µ-Ph) BPh 3] with KC 5 Me 4 H and gave (&# 61544; 5 -C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(&# 61544; 1 -C 5 Me 4 H), which was structurally characterized and is the first example of an &# 61544; 1 -coordination mode for a (C 5 Me 4 H) - ligand bound to a rare-earth metal. This complex undergoes Sigma Bond Metathesis (SBM) reactivity towards diphenyldichalcogenides, PhEEPh (E = S, Se, Te), to produce [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScSPh] 2 and (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScEPh (E = Se, Te) complexes. The analogous products could be isolated and were fully characterized through the ligand based reactivity of (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(η 3 -C 3 H 5) and PhEEPh reagents. These reactions also worked in the presence of THF to yield the solvated complexes (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScEPh(THF) (E = S, Se, Te). The reaction of (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(η 3 -C 3 H 5) with pySSpy produced the analogous (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScSpy complex. In addition, the formation of a scandium selenium cluster complex [(C 5 Me 4 H) Sc] 3 [SePh] 6 was identified and reactivity studies with PhTeTePh additionally resulted in the isolation of a scandium tellurium cluster compound, {[(C 5 Me 5) Sc] 4 (μ 3 -Te) 4 }. The functionalization of N 2 O via insertion into the metal carbon bond of allyl compounds, (C 5 Me 4 R) 2 M(η 3 -C 3 H 5) (M = Sc, Y, La, Sm; R = H, Me) formed [(C 5 Me 4 R) 2 M(µ-&# 61544; 1 :&# 61544; 2 -ON=NC 3 H 5) ] 2 complexes. The insertion of iPrN=C=NiPr into the Sc-C bond of (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(&# 61544; 3 -C 3 H 5) gave (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc[(iPr) NC(CH 2 CH=CH 2) N(iPr) -κ 2 N,N']. Finally, although the desired products were not isolated from an attempted reaction of (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(&# 61544; 3 -C 3 H 5) with diphenylhydrazine, a scandium hydroxo cluster complex (C 5 Me 4 H) 5 Sc 5 (µ 5 -O) (µ 3 -OH) 4 (µ 2 -OH) 4 &# 8729;[(C 6 H 5) NH] 2 was isolated...|$|E
