25|$|When Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were casting {{their new}} {{television}} sitcom I Love Lucy in 1951, director Marc Daniels, {{who had previously}} worked with Vance in a theater production, suggested her {{for the role of}} landlady Ethel Mertz. Lucille Ball had wanted either Bea Benaderet or Barbara Pepper, both close friends, to play the role. CBS refused Pepper on the grounds that she had a drinking problem, and Benaderet was already playing Blanche Morton on The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. Arnaz then began searching for another actress and Daniels took him and producer Jess Oppenheimer to the La Jolla Playhouse to see Vance in the John Van Druten play The Voice of the Turtle. Watching her perform, Arnaz was convinced he had found the ideal actress to play Ethel Mertz. Ball was less <b>sure.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> envisioned Ethel to be much older and less attractive; Vance was closer to Ball's age and attractive. Also, Ball, firmly entrenched in film and radio, had never heard of Vance, who was primarily a theater actress.|$|E
500|$|Regarding Madonna's {{influence}} on the record industry and younger artists, Debbie Gibson's then manager Doug Breitbart commented: [...] "Madonna has brought back a really strong, melodic component to pop music. She has a very youth-oriented, up, bubbly, fun sound." [...] Slant Magazine listed the album at number 60 on their list of [...] "The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] and stated that [...] "True Blue was the album on which it became readily apparent that Madonna {{was more than just}} a flash-in-the-pan pop star." [...] They added, [...] "It's when she began manipulating her image—and her audience—with a real sense of clarity and purpose and made <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> quality songs to back up her calculation and world-dominating ambition." ...|$|E
500|$|With her father's encouragement, Cooper {{first started}} {{swimming}} in her backyard pool {{when she was}} six years old. Her first swimsuit was a bikini. Her father taught her to swim while making her wear big yellow floaties. She started competitive swimming at school carnivals. In the first carnival she competed in, she finished sixth in the F-division 50 m butterfly. She was informed about disabled athletes by a teacher at school. Her initial reaction to learning about disabled sport was to question if she was [...] "disabled enough" [...] to compete. She made her first national team appearance {{when she was in}} year 12 in school, after winning twelve gold medals in national swimming meets. By that time, Cooper had already begun serious training, waking up at 4 a.m. to make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> time in the pool.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the High School Musical series, Hudgens confirmed that she was taking a break from her music career to focus more on acting. She played a supporting role in a musical comedy Bandslam, which was released theatrically on August14, 2009. Hudgens plays [...] "Sa5m", a 15-year-old awkward freshman with untapped talents. Although Bandslam was commercially unsuccessful, Hudgens's performance received praise from critics. David Waddington of the North Wales Pioneer noted that Hudgens [...] "outshines the rest of the cast, failing to fit in with the outcast narrative and making the inevitable climactic ending all the more expected", and Philip French of The Guardian compared her acting to Thandie Newton and Dorothy Parker. Hudgens made a return to theater productions and starred in the musical Rent as Mimi. The stage production ran from August6–8, 2010 at the Hollywood Bowl. Her involvement in the production drew negative comments, but director Neil Patrick Harris defended his decision with casting Hudgens by saying, [...] "Vanessa [...] is awesome. She's a friend. I asked her to come in and sing to make <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> the chops for it. And she was very committed and seemed great." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1968, Vyjayanthimala {{appeared}} in three big budget films with high-profile actors such as Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand and Rajendra Kumar. Her first {{release of the}} year was Sunghursh, directed by Mere Mehboob (1963) directed by Harnam Singh Rawail. She co-starred with Dilip Kumar for the seventh and last time in her career, with Balraj Sahni and Sanjeev Kumar in key roles. Originally offered to actress Sadhana, the role later went to Vyjayanthimala as the former suffered with her thyroid problem. Reportedly she did not exchange a word with Kumar while filming, since their relationship broke up. For Vyjayanthimala's enactment of a courtesan, Laila-e-Aasma, she received positive feedback from the critics. Anuj Kumar from The Hindu said that: [...] "Vyjayanthimala is graceful as ever. In a film dominated by men, Rawail made <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a substantial role. Her dances and Naushad’s lilting tunes come as a welcome break to the sinewy tone imparted by Abrar Alvi and Gulzar’s dialogues". The role fetched her the Best Hindi Actress Award at 25th Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards. Sunghursh was followed by Saathi, directed by C. V. Sridhar. A remake of the highly acclaimed Tamil film of 1961, Palum Pazhamum, the film had Rajendra Kumar and Simi Garewal replacing Sivaji Ganesan and Sowcar Janaki respectively from the Tamil version with Vyjyanthimala enacting the role originally portrayed by B. Saroja Devi. The same year she co-starred with Dev Anand for the third and last time in T. Prakash Rao's Duniya. Duniya, Saathi and Sunghursh were named as tenth, eleventh and twelfth highest-grossing film of 1968 respectively, with the first two labelled as average while the latter only managed to do above average business at the box office. On the other hand, Duniya is considered a hit film by some critics and often included in the hit film list of Dev Anand.|$|E
