Mecklin wrote afterwards that it [...] "was a remarkable assignment, to travel twenty-four thousand miles and assess a situation as complex as Vietnam and return in just four days. It was {{a symptom of the}} state the US Government was in". The mission was marked by the tension between its leaders. Mendenhall and Krulak intensely disliked one another, speaking to each other only when necessary. Mecklin and Krulak became embroiled in a dispute during the return flight. Krulak disapproved of Mecklin's decision to bring television footage that had been censored by the Diệm regime back to the US, believing the action was a violation of sovereignty. After a long and bitter argument aboard the aircraft, Krulak called upon Mecklin to leave the film in Alaska during a refueling stop at Elmendorf Air Force Base, further suggesting that the USIS director remain with the film in Alaska.|$|E

Kennedy was reported to have signed with Nonfiction Unlimited in May 2014. In September 2014, Last Days in Vietnam opened at the Nuart Theater in Los Angeles. Kennedy had difficulty getting some of the people featured in her film to get involved. Out of them, she believed Henry Kissinger had the most reluctance to the project. On their reluctance, Kennedy stated: [...] "I think a lot of those folks suffered post-traumatic stress from that moment. When I asked them to relive it, it really took a toll. Many of the people told me it took them a week to recover from the interviews. I've gotten tons of emails from people in Vietnam who can't see the film because it's too traumatic for them."

5000|$|Founded on February 6, 1869 at the St. Julien Hotel near Washington Square in New York City, Las Hijas de Cuba {{was created}} by de Villaverde as a {{political}} organization for women fighting for Cuban independence. During this time, membership in revolutionary and cultural clubs was restricted to males only, forcing women to form their own organizations. Fourteen Cuban and Puerto Rican women gathered at this initial meeting to discuss helping Cuban soldiers and to criticize the all-male independence organization, Junta Revolucionaria de Cuba y Puerto Rico. As president of Las Hijas de Cuba, Emilia Casanova de Villaverde condemned this all-male club for their [...] "annexationist maneuvers and betrayal of the independence movement." [...] The members of Las Hijas de Cuba, aware of the United States' growing interest in controlling Caribbean nations, disapproved {{of the fact that}} the Junta considered the United States an ally. They feared that this would move Cuba closer to annexation by the United States rather than emancipation. The collective power of these women's efforts gained attention and garnered further support for Villaverde. The leaders of Junta Revolucionaria de Cuba y Puerto Rico formed a new club called La Liga shortly after, which came to be dominated by annexationists. Villaverde used her platform as president of Las Hijas de Cuba to become a more recognizable force within the independence movement. The organization played an important role in raising funds for Cuban soldiers during the Ten Years' War. Additionally, as a representative of Las Hijas de Cuba, Emilia Casanova de Villaverde presented the merits of Cuban liberation before the U.S. Congress on numerous occasions. She was the first Cuban woman granted the right to address the United States Congress on this issue. When her father was imprisoned in Havana during the Ten Years' War, Villaverde <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> government officials, including President Ulysses S. Grant, asking for protection. Spain accused many members of the property-owning Creole class of [...] "infidelity" [...] during this contentious time, loosely defined as any actions disrupting the political order, and confiscated their property as punishment. President Grant agreed to protect her father from the Spanish government and soon after Villaverde's father was released. In 1871 and 1872, she again petitioned the United States Congress to support Cuban independence rather than Spanish colonial power. In 1871, Emilia Casanova de Villaverde pleaded the U.S. government for assistance after learning that eight medical school students at the University of Havana were being held hostage by Spanish authorities. In 1872, she informed Washington officials of Spain's hostile behavior on the island of Cuba and presented an extensive argument detailing the economic advantages of aiding Cuba over Spain. Despite de Villaverde’s efforts, the U.S. government decided it would be most strategic to side with a weak colonial power rather than a sovereign Cuba. [...] In order to increase the international visibility of the Cuban emancipation struggle, she wrote to prominent European figures such as Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Hugo. In an 1869 letter to Giuseppe Garibaldi, Villaverde stated her abolitionist views: “the beginning of our revolution means the freedom of our slaves, giving them arms and incorporating them in our patriotic ranks.” Garibaldi responded to her appeal by stating that he supported Cuba’s quest for freedom from colonial oppression, but he did not make any specific commitments to aid the movement.|$|E

40|$|This report {{sets out}} the {{findings}} of an exploratory qualitative research study that examined the attitudes and experiences of children, youth and parents relating to networked communications technologies. Using a semi‐structured interview guide, we conducted a total of 12 qualitative group sessions in Calgary, Toronto and Ottawa, with young people ages 11 ‐ 17 and with parents of children and youth ages 11 ‐ 17. A total of 66 young people and 21 parents participated in this research. Parenting in a Networked WorldThe parents we <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> were beleaguered by fear of danger and exhausted from the burden of constant vigilance. Although {{the exact nature of}} that danger is poorly defined, many parents told us that surveillance is now equated with good parenting, and that the days of trusting their children and providing them with space to explore the world and make mistakes are long gone. Many talked about spying on their children, both directly and through surveillance intermediaries. There were a handful of parents, however, who trusted their children and felt that this kind of invasive parenting was harmful. Even the parents who advocated spying on their kids were ambivalent about it and worried about the effect it would have on their relationships with their children. But in spite of their discomfort, they argued that they had no choice, especially because they could not rely on the school system or online corporations to help protect their children. From our participants’ perspective, schools were particularly problematic. They felt that schools were often requiring their children to use the Internet for assignments and homework, but were not necessarily doing enough to prepare them to deal with the pitfalls. The corporations that own the sites their children visit were also seen as untrustworthy because they were encouraging kids to disclose “everything” {{in order to make a}} profit. Life in the Fish Bowl – the Children’s View The young people we <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> told <b>us</b> that, from their perspective, the Internet is now a fully monitored space where parents, teachers and corporations keep them under constant surveillance.

40|$|In {{order to}} find out how their {{in-house}} technical expertise are organised, the organisational structures of eleven international development organisations and multinational agencies have been explored. Issues which cut across countries and sectors (thematic approaches) are also listed for each organisation, as this may affect the level/type of expertise available. Some organisations have re-organised their in-house structures or set up new programmes to account for low staff numbers (World Bank, USAID, DFAT) including re-assigning administration to technical positions or hiring external expertise/volunteers (UNDP, GIZ, FAO) when needed. However, this was not possible for other organisations (Sida, Danida). Thematic or cross-cutting approaches have resulted in reduced (Word Bank, UNDP, Global Affairs Canada) or increased (USAID) numbers of staff available for technical expertise. A number of organisations rely on technical staff working in multiple positions (UNDP, Sida, DFAT, Danida) because of low numbers in-house technical staff available. Due to the sensitive nature of this query, as well as other work-related issues, it is difficult to confirm the numbers and variety of staff expertise available for developmental work for some organisations using available online data. This report is based primarily on summarising information from public documents published by the agencies themselves. The amount of information available varies widely from agency to agency, and is not necessarily comparable across agencies. Some information included in this report was also obtained through informal personal communication with staff members of the agencies mentioned, who <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> on condition of anonymity...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Low {{and middle-income}} {{countries}} suffer an ongoing deficit of trained public health workers, yet optimizing postgraduate education to best address these training needs remains a challenge. Much international public health education literature {{has focused on}} global capacity building and/or the description of innovative programmes, but less on quality and appropriateness. CASE DESCRIPTION: The MSc in Global Health Science at the University of Oxford is a relatively new, full-time one year master's degree in international public health. The programme is intended for individuals with significant evidence of commitment to health in low and middle income countries. The intake is small, with only about 25 students each year, but they are from diverse professional and geographical backgrounds. Given the diversity of their backgrounds, we wanted {{to determine the extent}} to which student background influenced their perceptions of the quality of their learning experience and their learning outcomes. We conducted virtual or face-to-face semi-structured individual interviews with students who had graduated from the course at least one year previously. Of the 2005 to 2007 intake years, 52 of 63 graduates (83 %) were interviewed. We used thematic analysis to analyze the data, then linked results to student characteristics. DISCUSSION: The findings from the evaluation suggested that all MSc GHS graduates who <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> irrespective of background, appreciated the curriculum structure drawing on the strengths of a small, diverse student group, and the contribution the programme had made to their breadth of understanding and their careers. This evaluation also demonstrated the feasibility of an educational evaluation conducted several years after programme completion and when graduates were 'in the field'. This is important in ensuring international public health programmes are relevant to the day-to-day work of public health practitioners and researchers in low and middle-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Feedback from students, when they had either resumed their positions 'in the field' or pursued further training, was useful in identifying valuable and positive aspects of the programme and also in identifying areas for further action and development by the programme's management and by individual teaching staff...|$|E
