The test was conducted at Thiokol Corporation, Space Operations, M- 52 Inert Parts Preparation facility. The purpose of this testing sequence was to ensure the <b>spray</b> <b>booth</b> would produce flight qualified hardware. The testing sequence was conducted in two series. The first series was conducted under CTP- 0142, Revision 1. The second series was conducted in accordance with CTP- 0142, Revision 2. The test sequence started with CTP- 0142, Revision 1. The series consisted of the contamination removal test and the performance test. The contamination removal {{test was used to}} assess the Teflon level in the <b>spray</b> <b>booth.</b> The performance test consisted of painting and Chemloking a forward dome inside the <b>spray</b> <b>booth</b> per flight procedures. During the performance test, two sets of witness panels (case/insulation and steel/epoxy/steel) were prepared and pull tested. The CTP- 0142, Revision 2, series of testing consisted of re-testing the steel/epoxy/steel witness panels. The pull tests analysis indicates the results of the tensile tests were comparable to the systems tunnel witness panel database. The exposed panel set and the control panel set average tensile values were above the 1 -basis lower limits established on the systems tunnel witness panel database. It is recommended that the M- 52 <b>spray</b> <b>booth</b> be qualified for producing flight hardware...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} a more {{extensive}} project of developing a new finishing line at the Bolivian door manufacturer Tecno Carpinteria San Pedro this thesis presents the development process for a special designed <b>spray</b> <b>booth.</b> The thesis covers every phase from a product idea to a final concept design. Working with finishing of furniture and other wooden products can effect the workers health in a negative way and damage the environment. The final result of the manufactured door is also depending on the how well the ventilation system in the working area is.

50|$|A {{spray booth}} is a {{pressure-controlled}} closed environment, originally used to paint vehicles {{in a body}} shop. To ensure the ideal working conditions (temperature, air flow, and humidity), these environments are equipped with ventilation, consisting of mechanical fans driven by electric motors, and optionally burners to heat the air to speed paint drying. Toxic solvents and paint particles are exhausted outside, possibly after filtering and treatment to reduce air pollution. Prevention of fires and dust explosions is also a high priority. In order {{to assist in the}} removal of the over sprayed paint from the air and to provide efficient operation of the down-draft, water-washed paint <b>spray</b> <b>booths</b> utilize paint detackifying chemical agents.|$|E

50|$|Paint <b>spray</b> <b>booths</b> for {{vehicles}} are typically 100-300 {{feet in length}} and usually contain many robotic and manual spray zones. The temperature and humidity are rigorously controlled in these systems. As items are painted in these booths, {{a certain amount of}} paint does not contact the article being painted and forms a fine mist of paint in the air space surrounding the article. This paint must be removed from the air. To accomplish this, the contaminated air is pulled through the paint spray booth by exhaust fans. A curtain of circulating water is maintained across the path of the air {{in such a way that}} the air must pass through the water curtain to reach the exhaust fans. As the air passes through the water curtain, the paint mist is “scrubbed” from the air and carried to a sump basin (sludge pit), usually located below the paint spray booth. In this area, the paint particles are separated from the water so that the water may be recycled and the paint particles disposed of as paint sludge. The paint detackifiers commonly added to these systems are either melamine-formaldehyde based, based upon acrylic acid chemistry, or chitosan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{industries}} {{that are involved}} in the production of dangerous chemicals requires Local Exhaust Ventilation (LEV) for separating employees to hazards. LEV purpose is to separate contaminants from the source it generated. The objective {{of this paper is to}} look at a number of studies related to the LEV and its applications. The discussions are divided to several parts such as application in construction industries, buildings, manufacturing industries, workshops and paint manufacturers. Ongoing monitoring, maintenance and effective personal protective equipment (PPE) are necessary to ensure the <b>spray</b> <b>booths</b> can be managed properly and avoid employee exposure to contaminants. Ventilation design in buildings, equipment selection and use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is highly suggested in that application. There are no exposures to hazardous materials to the building users in the construction of hospitals and others. Use of push-pull ventilation method is an efficient. The future phase of ventilation system in airplanes and hawker centre will be the consumer's attention...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} and good reasons why powder coating {{is a popular}} coating process {{for a lot of}} {{industrial}} products: the wide range of design possibilities; robust surface finish; and the total avoidance of polluting solvents, to name but three. In conventional powder coating installations spray guns are used for powder application on the workpieces. This requires voluminous <b>spray</b> <b>booths</b> and powder recovery systems. Thus conventional powder coating technique causes high consumption of compressed air and of energy for the exhaust air as well as high costs for maintenance. In view of this, the Fraunhofer IPA has designed the "TransApp"-powder coating technique, which operates without spray guns and therefore is very compact, highly energy-efficient, and has low operating costs. The new technique makes use of the well-known electrostatic fluidized bed principle. Its previous process limitations such as poor application uniformity and poor decorative surface quality have been overcome by using computer simulation as well as by adopting innovative technologies to regulate the electric field. In this connection, using pulsed corona charging has been a very successful approach. The periodical interruption of the electric field and of the generation of ions {{turned out to be an}} effective method to minimize the unwanted parasitic electrostatic effects like insufficient coating of edge zones and Faraday cages...|$|E

40|$|Spray {{painters}} {{are potentially}} exposed to aerosols containing hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI) ] via inhalation of chromate-based paint sprays. Evaluating the {{particle size distribution}} of a paint spray aerosol, and the variables that may affect this distribution, is necessary to determine the site and degree of respiratory deposition and the damage that may result from inhaled Cr(VI) -containing paint particles. This study examined the effect of spray gun atomization pressure, aerosol generation source and aerosol aging on the size distribution of chromate-based paint overspray aerosols generated in a bench-scale paint <b>spray</b> <b>booth.</b> The study also determined the effect of particle bounce inside a Marple personal cascade impactor on measured size distribu-tions of paint spray aerosols. Marple personal cascade impactors with a modified inlet were used for sample collection. The data indicated that paint particle bounce did not occur inside the cascade impactors sufficiently to affect size distribution when using uncoated stainless steel or PVC substrate sampling media. A decrease in paint aerosol mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) from 8. 2 to 7. 0 mm was observed as gun atomization pressure increased from 6 to 10 psi.
