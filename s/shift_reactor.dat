50|$|The typical {{composition}} {{of a commercial}} LTS catalyst has been reported as 32-33% CuO, 34-53% ZnO, 15-33% Al2O3. The active catalytic species is CuO. The function of ZnO is to provide structural support as well as prevent the poisoning of copper by sulfur. The Al2O3 prevents dispersion and pellet shrinkage. The LTS <b>shift</b> <b>reactor</b> operates at a range of 200-250 °C. The upper temperature limit {{is due to the}} susceptibility of copper to thermal sintering. These lower temperatures also reduce the occurrence of side reactions that are observed {{in the case of the}} HTS. Noble metals such as platinum, supported on ceria, have also been used for LTS.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} take {{advantage}} of both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reaction, the industrial scale water gas shift reaction is conducted in multiple adiabatic stages consisting of a high temperature shift (HTS) followed by a low temperature shift (LTS) with intersystem cooling. [...] The initial HTS takes advantage of the high reaction rates, but is thermodynamically limited, which results in incomplete conversion of carbon monoxide and a 2-4% carbon monoxide exit composition. To shift the equilibrium toward hydrogen production, a subsequent low temperature <b>shift</b> <b>reactor</b> is employed to produce a carbon monoxide exit composition of less than 1%. The transition from the HTS to the LTS reactors necessitates intersystem cooling. Due to the different reaction conditions, different catalysts must be employed at each stage to ensure optimal activity. The commercial HTS catalyst is the iron oxide-chromium oxide catalyst and the LTS catalyst is a copper-based catalyst. The order proceeds from high to low temperature due to the susceptibility of the copper catalyst to poisoning by sulfur that may remain after the steam reformation process. [...] This necessitates the removal of the sulfur compounds prior to the LTS reactor by a guard bed {{in order to protect the}} copper catalyst. Conversely, the iron used in the HTS reaction is generally more robust and resistant toward poisoning by sulfur compounds. While both the HTS and LTS catalysts are commercially available, their specific composition varies based on vendor. An important limitation for the HTS is the H2O/CO ratio where low ratios may lead to side reactions such as the formation of metallic iron, methanation, carbon deposition, and Fischer-Tropsch reaction.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, the capture and storage {{of carbon dioxide}} from the fossil fuel power plant have been considered. The main {{objective}} was to analyze the thermodynamic performances and the technological aspects of two integrated gasification gas combined cycle plants (IGCC), {{as well as to}} give a forecast of the investment costs for the plants and the resulting energy consumptions. The first plant considered is an IGCC* plant (integrated gasification gas combined cycle plant with traditional <b>shift</b> <b>reactors)</b> characterized by the traditional water gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactors</b> and a CO 2 physical adsorption system followed by the power section. The second one is an IGCCM plant (integrated gasification gas combined cycle plant with membrane reactor) where the coal thermal input {{is the same as the}} first one, but the traditional <b>shift</b> <b>reactors</b> and the physical adsorption unit are replaced by catalytic palladium membrane reactors (CMR). In the present work, a mono-dimensional computational model of the membrane reactor was proposed to simulate and evaluate the capability of the IGCCM plant to capture carbon dioxide. The energetic performances, efficiency and net power of the IGCC* and IGCCM plants were, thus, compared, assuming as standard a traditional IGCC plant without carbon dioxide capture. The economical aspects of the three plants were compared through an economical analysis. Since the IGCC* and IGCCM plants have additional costs related to the capture and disposal of the carbon dioxide, a Carbon Tax (adopted in some countries like Sweden) proportional to the number of kilograms of carbon dioxide released in the environment was assumed. According to the economical analysis, the IGCCM plant proved to be more convenient than the IGCC* one. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 10. 1016 /j. enconman. 2007. 04. 02...|$|R
40|$|The cyclic water gas-shift reactor (CWGSR) is an {{alternative}} to the sequence of water gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactors</b> for the removal of carbon monoxide from reformate gases. It is based on the alternating reduction of a fixed bed of iron oxide using reformate gas and the subsequent re-oxidation of the iron with steam (Fig. 1).

Glycerol processing {{as one of the}} renewable fuel system is employed for hydrogen production. The hydrogen produced from glycerol processing is then fed to the PEMFC system to produce the desired electricity. Here, a PEMFC power generation system composed of two subsystems: fuel reforming and fuel cell stack. A fuel reforming is regarded as a suitable process to produce hydrogen for stationary application of fuel cells because of its high hydrogen yield which subsequently is used to generate electricity through the fuel cell stack by producing a desired power outcome. The system was simulated and optimized into 3 cases. The first one involves the high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (HT-PEMFC) and a glycerol reformer without water gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactor</b> whereas in the second case, a water gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactor</b> is included to improve its overall system efficiency. The third case involves low temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cell (LT-PEMFC) with a glycerol reformer, water gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactor</b> and preferential oxidation reactor. In this study, a direct comparison between the performance of HT-PEMFC and LT-PEMFC systems integrated with a glycerol steam reformer with and without a water gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactor</b> is shown. The target power output of both the HT-PEMFC and LT-PEMFC systems for stationary application is in the range of 1 - 8 kW, which is sufficient for small household application.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the {{analysis}} of an integrated reforming combined cycle (IRCC) with natural gas as fuel input. This IRCC consisted of a hydrogen-fired gas turbine (GT) with a single-pressure steam bottoming cycle for power production. The reforming process section consisted of a pre-reformer and an air-blown auto thermal reformer (ATR) followed by water-gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactors.</b> The air to the ATR was discharged from the GT compressor and boosted up to system pressure by an air booster compressor. For the CO[subscript 2] capture sub-system, a chemical absorption setup was modeled. The design case model was modeled in GT PRO by Thermoflow, and in Aspen Plus. The Aspen Plus simulations consisted of two separate models, one that included the reforming process and the water-gas <b>shift</b> <b>reactors.</b> In this model were also numerous heat exchangers including the whole pre-heating section. Air and CO[subscript 2] compression was also incorporated into the model. As a separate flow sheet the chemical absorption process was modeled as a hot potassium carbonate process. The models were linked by Microsoft Excel. For the CO[subscript 2] capture system the model was not directly linked to Excel but instead a simple separator model was included in the reforming flow sheet with inputs such as split ratios, temperatures, and pressures from the absorption model. Outputs from the potassium model also included pump work and reboiler duty. A main focal point of the study was off-design simulations. For these steady-state off-design simulations GT MASTER by Thermoflow in conjunction with Aspen Plus were used. Also, inputs such as heat exchanger areas, compressor design point, etc., were linked in from the Aspen Plus reforming design model. Results indicate a net plant efficiency of 43. 2 % with approximately a 2 %-point drop for an 80 % part load case.

As a result, the steam reforming of methanol is the leading candidate process for on-board generation of hydrogen for automotive propulsion. If methanol unavailability or a high price demands an alternative process, steam reforming appears preferable to partial oxidation for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|Recently, many reviews on {{pre-combustion}} CO 2 capture (CCS) in an IGCC plant {{have been}} focused on the techno-economic performance of palladium-based membrane reactor modules downstream of conventional steam reforming or <b>shift</b> <b>reactors.</b> Although the determination and minimisation of the amount of palladium necessary for a specific power production capacity has been the target of many research studies, surprisingly little attention has been paid in the open literature to the availability of this metal in the large quantities required for large scale applications. To fill this gap, the scope of this work was to compare the amount of palladium needed for pre-combustion CCS with Pd-membranes and the available production capacity of palladium. Two specific techno-economic studies with a different net IGCC power output were selected from the literature. In each case, the amount of palladium that is necessary for the plant to be in operation was compared with the world supply and demand for palladium. The results show that even for a power plant of 2 ̆ 2 only 2 ̆ 2 1 GWe net electricity production utilizing membranes with the best reported performance, a relatively large (0. 7...|$|R
