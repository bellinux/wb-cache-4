5|$|Both {{candidates}} received {{financial support}} from outside the district, some of which was used to buy votes or bribe voters to <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Breckinridge received several thousand dollars, with a substantial amount coming from Washington, D.C. banker William Wilson Corcoran; estimates of Letcher's support ranged from $30,000 to $100,000. Breckinridge won the canvass by 526 votes and received 71% {{of the vote in}} Owen County, which recorded 123 more votes than registered voters.|$|E
5|$|When winter storms hit, {{bringing}} with them combinations of precipitation that making driving difficult and sometimes dangerous, moviegoers often prefer to <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Non-essential travel is officially discouraged, and in severe enough weather all non-emergency driving can be banned {{in some areas}} until the situation improves. In anticipation of the February 2013 nor'easter, which struck on the month's first weekend, three large chains closed down many of their theaters in the Northeast.|$|E

5|$|After World War I, {{traveling}} {{was once}} again possible for the many young artists who {{had been forced to}} <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> during the six years of war. In 1920, Jolin went on a journey, first to Italy, North Africa and Spain for new international impressions, and then on to India, Africa and the West Indies. In the spring of 1924, Jolin went to Spain with his first wife, Britt von Zweigbergk. Like many other artists he painted the bullfights, but contrary to the strong, and sometimes bloody, bullfight painted by his colleague and close friend Gösta Adrian-Nilsson (GAN), Jolin's works were created in the calm and orderly manner that had earned him his second nickname: Eleganten Einar (Einar, the Elegant).|$|E
5|$|As in the First World War, white Rhodesians {{volunteered for}} the forces readily and in large numbers. Over 2,700 had come forward before the war was three weeks old. Somewhat ironically, the Southern Rhodesian recruiters' main problem was not {{sourcing}} manpower but rather persuading men in strategically important occupations such as mining to <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Manpower controls were introduced to keep certain men in their civilian jobs. The SRAF accepted 500 recruits {{in the days following}} the outbreak of war, prompting its commander Group Captain CW Meredith to contact the Air Ministry in London with an offer to run a flying school and train three squadrons. This was accepted. In January 1940 the Southern Rhodesian government announced the establishment of an independent Air Ministry to oversee the Rhodesian Air Training Group, Southern Rhodesia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS).|$|E
5|$|Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also added {{his voice to}} the growing chorus advocating the abolition of slavery. Several slaveholding states seceded after the election of Republican presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, and formed the Confederate States of America; even before {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Dow called for the rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> and tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, however, Dow felt compelled to join the Union cause. Governor Israel Washburn appointed him Colonel of the 13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, deHavilland {{made her}} debut in amateur theatre in Alice in Wonderland, a {{production}} of the Saratoga Community Players {{based on the novel}} by Lewis Carroll. She also appeared in several school plays, including The Merchant of Venice and Hansel and Gretel. Her passion for drama eventually led to a confrontation with her stepfather, who forbade her from participating in further extracurricular activities. When he learned that she had won the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet in a school fund-raising production of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, he gave her an ultimatum to either <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> or not return home. Not wanting to let her school and classmates down, she left home forever, moving in with a family friend.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of a large high pressure system and Jeanne produced rough seas over the northern Gulf of Mexico; wave heights reached 15feet (4.60m). On November 11, a ship reported sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h), although this reading was discarded and attributed to intense squalls. In Key West, the storm's outer fringes produced a record-breaking 24-hour rainfall total of 23.28inches (591mm); 13.58inches (345mm) fell within six hours. It remains the record 24-hour November rainfall total for the city as of 2012. The previous record was set in 1954. The heavy precipitation was attributed to a mesoscale feature; an inflow band intersected with an adjacent stationary front, which {{also contributed to the}} deluge. Schools and most businesses were closed, while flights were grounded at Key West International Airport; authorities urged residents to <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Telephone and power services were cut to some areas of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E

5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who get very ill <b>stay</b> <b>home,</b> and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E
5|$|In a California forest, a {{group of}} alien botanists land in a spacecraft, {{collecting}} flora samples. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, leaving {{one of their own}} behind in their haste. At a suburban home, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves Reese's Pieces candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its solar system and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead chrysanthemums.|$|E
5|$|In {{suburban}} Chicago, {{near the}} end of the high school year, senior Ferris Bueller fakes sickness to <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Throughout the film, Ferris frequently breaks the fourth wall to talk about his friends and give the audience advice on how to skip school. His parents believe him, though his sister Jeannie is not convinced. Dean of Students Edward R. Rooney suspects Ferris is being truant again and commits to catching him. Ferris convinces his friend Cameron Frye, who really is absent due to illness, to help get Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson out of school by reporting that her grandmother has died. To trick Rooney, Ferris sways Cameron to let them use his father's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder to collect Sloane. Cameron is dismayed when Ferris continues to use the car to drive them into downtown Chicago to spend the day, but Ferris promises they will return it as it was.|$|E

5|$|The record {{football}} {{attendance at}} the stadium not involving its host team Manchester City is 43,878, which was set at the 2008 UEFA Cup Final game between Zenit Saint Petersburg and Rangers on 14 May 2008. As is customary for such games, the then 47,715 maximum physical capacity of the stadium had been reduced by UEFA to around 44,000 for this final. However, neither limit {{would have been able}} to accommodate the vast number of supporters of the Scottish club, estimated to be in excess of 130,000, that travelled down from Glasgow to Manchester on the day of the game, despite the club's official ticket allocation being just 13,000 and police requests for fans without tickets to <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> This order of magnitude mismatch between the numbers of traveling fans and those holding tickets ultimately led to a serious public disorder incident in the centre of the city now inextricably associated with this final, despite the fact that the 44,000 or so crowd who watched the game inside the stadium were perfectly well-behaved.|$|E
5|$|The torrential {{rainfall}} in Florida flooded about 93,000homes, affecting 214,000residents in Miami-Dade County. An incomplete damage {{survey of}} Miami-Dade County indicated the flooding destroyed 1,005houses, severely damaged 1,358, and caused minor damage to 3,443. The flood waters, which were fourft (1.2m) deep in places, stranded many in their houses, {{forcing them to}} use canoes or inflatable rafts to move to higher grounds. All schools in the Miami area were closed, and all non-essential Miami-Dade County employees were asked to <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Numerous flights in Miami International Airport were canceled or delayed, although the airport remained opened. The flooding, which was greatest in Sweetwater, West Miami, Hialeah, Opa-locka, and Pembroke Park, lasted {{up to a week}} in areas. The extreme flooding damaged electrical stations, leaving more than 27,000 without power. The flooding indirectly killed three people, two from drowning as a result of driving vehicles into deep water, and one when a man fell from a tall building while trying to unclog a roof drain. Property damage totaled $450million.|$|E
5|$|Washington, D.C., mayor, Anthony Williams, {{declared}} a state of emergency for the district. In Washington, preparations began several days prior to the arrival of the hurricane, including placing sandbags in flood-prone areas. Many people, including non-emergency government personnel, were told to <b>stay</b> <b>home.</b> Most people in the district took shelter by the time the hurricane passed through the area, and the streets across the city were largely empty. President George W. Bush along with Abdullah II of Jordan were evacuated from the city to the presidential retreat at Camp David. Most United States Congress representatives and members of the Department of Defense also left the city. Many buildings, including some federal, were shut down. All three airports in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area were closed, with flights into the capital cancelled or diverted. Many train routes were canceled or delayed, and the Washington Metro and Metrobus systems were closed entirely. Workers at the National Zoo prepared by moving animals inside and lowering water levels.|$|E

5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E
