25|$|Thomas Thorp (1850–1914) was an English {{manufacturer}} of scientific instruments credited with inventing the first practical coin-in-the-slot gas meter, with innovations {{in the field}} of photography, including that involving colour, and for producing an early example of what has since been developed into the modern <b>spectrohelioscope.</b> He began his working life as an apprentice to a firm of architects and ended it as a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, having had a keen interest in astronomy since childhood.|$|E
2500|$|Thorp was a [...] "scientific and {{mechanical}} genius". In pursuit {{of his childhood}} interest in astronomy, he developed considerable skills {{in the manufacture of}} optical glass and both reflector and refractor telescopes. He also created celluloid diffraction grating replicas, polarising solar eyepieces and prominence spectroscopes that were widely used, as well as objective prisms. His high resolution diffracting grating replicas were significant advances of the ideas developed by Henry Rowland, whilst his multi-slit spectroscope was the first to enable the showing of both celestial and terrestrial objects and has formed the basis for the present day <b>spectrohelioscope.</b> Father Aloysius Cortie, of Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, was one whom achieved good results from an example of the objective prisms. Eventually owning houses in Whitefield and also in Prestatyn, North Wales, he constructed observatories at each of these and favoured the [...] Cooke equatorial telescope for his own observations. This device was fitted with a photo-visual objective, a spectroscope and other attachments that enabled it to be used for photography.|$|E

25|$|Sunspots are {{observed}} with land-based and Earth-orbiting solar telescopes. These telescopes use filtration and projection techniques for direct observation, {{in addition to}} various types of filtered cameras. Specialized tools such as spectroscopes and <b>spectrohelioscopes</b> are used to examine sunspots and sunspot areas. Artificial eclipses allow viewing of the circumference of the Sun as sunspots rotate through the horizon.|$|R
50|$|In {{the field}} of amateur {{astronomy}} there are many methods used to observe the sun. Amateurs use everything from simple systems to project the sun {{on a piece of}} white paper, light blocking filters, Herschel wedges which redirect 95% of the light away from the eyepiece, up to hydrogen-alpha filter systems and even home built <b>spectrohelioscopes.</b> In contrast to professional telescopes, amateur solar telescopes are usually much smaller.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spectrohelioscope</b> {{is a type}} {{of solar}} {{telescope}} designed by George Ellery Hale in 1924 to allow the Sun to be viewed in a selected wavelength of light. The name comes from three Latin-based words: Spectro, referring to the optical spectrum, Helio, referring to the Sun and Scope, as in telescope.|$|E
50|$|Ellison became senior science {{master at}} Sherborne School in Dorset, 1933, then married Patricia Herron in 1934. The couple had {{two daughters and}} a son. He also {{completed}} his own <b>spectrohelioscope</b> during this period, to study the Sun following the sunspot minimum. With {{the start of the}} world war, he organized an Air Cadet Training Corps, then joined the Operational Research Group at the Admiralty.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Schematic {{of typical}} <b>spectrohelioscope.</b> The two slits {{oscillate}} rapidly {{to allow a}} portion of the sun to be seen in monochromatic light. Many variations are possible: collimation can be done with concave mirrors, dispersion can be achieved with glass prisms, and scanning can be achieved with fixed slits and spinning square prisms. Because they are large (usually more than 3m long) and delicate, spectrohelioscopes are usually fixed, with moving mirrors to track the sun ...|$|E

50|$|The basic <b>spectrohelioscope</b> is {{a complex}} machine that uses a {{spectroscope}} to scan {{the surface of the}} sun. The image from the objective lens is focused on a narrow slit revealing only a thin portion of the suns surface. The light is then passed through a prism or diffraction grating to spread the light into a spectrum. The spectrum is then focused on another slit that allows only a narrow part of the spectrum (the desired wavelength of light for viewing) to pass. The light is finally focused on an eyepiece so the surface of the Sun can be seen. The view, however, would be only a narrow strip of the Sun's surface. The slits are moved in unison to scan across the whole surface of the sun giving a full image. Independently nodding mirrors can be used instead of moving slits to produce the same scan: the first mirror selects a slice of the sun, the second selects the desired wavelength.|$|E

The device {{has the ability to}} be used as a Telescope, spectroscope, spectrophotometer and <b>spectrohelioscope.</b> The results obtained from this device are used in the various field of research such as absorption spectra of the surface of the sun, transit of planets in front of the sun, Doppler effects, evaluation of the Fraunhofer lines, plot of intensity versus wavelength and studying of Solar Flares.

40|$|The <b>spectrohelioscope,</b> an {{instrument}} for observing the sun in monochromatic light, has been briefly described in a previous article. (1) The same optical parts employed in the preliminary work are now rigidly mounted in a vertical position in my new Solar Laboratory in Pasadena (a branch of the Mount Wilson Observatory). The second mirror of the coelostat, which stands at the summit of a low tower, sends the sun's rays vertically downward to a 30 -cm. objective (kindly loaned me by the Yerkes Observatory) which forms a 5 -cm. image of the sun on the slit of a spectroscope standing in a well excavated in the earth below the laboratory {{at the base of}} the tower...|$|E
40|$|Ken M. Harrison's {{latest book}} is a {{complete}} guide for amateur astronomers who want to obtain detailed narrowband images of the Sun using a digital spectroheliograph (SHG). The SHG allows the safe imaging of the Sun without the expense of commercial ‘etalon’ solar filters. As the supporting software continues to be refined, {{the use of the}} digital spectroheliograph will become more and more mainstream and has the potential to replace the expensive solar filters currently in use.  The early chapters briefly explain the concept of the SHG and how it can produce an image from the solar spectrum. A comparison of the currently available narrow band solar filters is followed by a detailed analysis of the critical design, construction and assembly features of the SHG. The design and optimum layout of the instrument is discussed to allow evaluation of performance. This information explains how to assemble a fully functional SHG using readily available components. The software required to process the images is explained and step by step examples provided, with various digital instruments around the world highlighted based on input from many experienced amateurs who have shared their experience in building and using their spectroheliographs.  The final chapters provide a historical overview of the traditional spectroheliograph and the later <b>spectrohelioscope,</b> from the initial G. E. Hale and Deslandres concepts of the 1890 ’s through to the later work by Veio and others. The construction and performance of various instruments is covered in detail, and provides a unique opportunity to record and appreciate the groundbreaking researches carried out by amateurs in the 20 th century.  This is an absolutely up to date book which fully addresses the watershed, game changing influence of the digital imaging revolution on the traditional spectroheliograph...|$|E
