5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set his <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess {{were the}} missing pieces the Celtics needed.

He set his <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> higher office, believing he could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained a relatively minor figure in the Democratic Party. In anticipation of a presidential campaign, {{he spent much of}} 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States; his compelling oratory increased his popularity in his party.|$|E

5|$|He {{attended}} New York's School of Industrial Art {{where he}} studied painting and music and would later appreciate their emphasis on proper technique.

5|$|In 1951, Evita set her <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> {{earning a}} place on the ballot as {{candidate}} for vice-president.

The possibility of Evita becoming president in the event of Juan Perón's death was not something the military could accept.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} postseason, Maryland {{declined}} {{an invitation to}} face Navy in the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. Instead, the Terps had their <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> the Champs Sports Bowl, to play Purdue in Orlando. According to Maryland athletic director Deborah Yow and coach Friedgen, the decision {{was based on the}} players' preference, a bigger school pay-out, warmer weather, a Big Ten opponent, and more media exposure. Also, the Champs Sports Bowl was deemed to be the fourth-most prestigious non-BCS bowl while the Meineke game was number-six.|$|E
5|$|Nikolai Volkoff competed at Survivor Series 1990 in a {{match that}} pitted {{him and his}} {{partners}} against Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and The Orient Express.

5|$|Shelby and Clarke elected not {{to pursue}} the British fleeing the Battle of Musgrove Mill. Instead, they set their <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> a British fort at Ninety Six, South Carolina, where they were sure they would find Ferguson. However, while en route, Shelby and his men were met with news of General Horatio Gates' defeat at the Battle of Camden. With the backing of General Cornwallis, Ferguson could ride to meet Shelby with his entire force, so Shelby retreated over the Appalachian Mountains into North Carolina.|$|E
