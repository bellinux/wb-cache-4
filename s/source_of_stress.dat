40|$|Background &amp; Objective: Nursing and Midwifery {{students}} experience {{different and}} numerous <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Stress {{is a complex}} phenomenon that may be experienced by all. Nursing and midwifery students have multiple <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> due to their work environment. In order to reduce their stress and prevent the complications, all <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> should be recognized. This study was carried out to compare <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> between midwifery and nursing students of Tehran universities of medical sciences. Methods &amp; Materials: This is a cross-sectional study. All senior midwifery and nursing students of Tehran and Shahid Beheshti Universities {{were invited to participate}} in the study (n= 380). Data were collected using a questionnaire including demographic section (15 questions) and <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> educational environment, clinical environment, and social-personal problems (54 items). Data were analyzed using SPSS and tested with chi-square test. Results: 363 students participated in the study. Research findings showed that the followings are the most cited <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> among the students: ambiguous professional view, incompetent professional knowledge after graduation, caring for terminally ill patients, discordance between theory and clinical education, concerns about employment. Also results showed that there were significant differences between some <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and the study programs. Conclusion: The nursing and midwifery students had numerous <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> in the educational, clinical, and social-personal domains of their life that can affect their physical and psychological health and cause learning problems.

With the re-entry of South Africa into the international sporting arena, {{little is known about}} South African coaches and what specific stresses they experience. Thus, the present study used a mixed-method approach in exploring the perceptions <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> among South African soccer coaches. More specifically, 12 South African coaches were interviewed (using semi-structured interview guides) on their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Furthermore, 112 soccer coaches (at the provincial level and higher) were approached to complete a 32 -item questionnaire on the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> related to their job as coaches. Content analysis was used to evaluate the qualitative data while the descriptive data analysis was completed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS â€“ version 16). The reliability was tested for the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> (a=. 817) for the 32 items. The <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> experienced by the coaches were evaluated. The results revealed the three main themes related to <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> were Resource Issues, External Pressure and Internal Capacity.

40|$|Background. Formal {{studies on}} stress in anaesthetists have usually {{measured}} stress through mental or physiological indicators. When using this approach, {{one must be}} careful not to confuse the effects <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> or outcome variables and the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> or antecedent variables. To date, it seems from the literature that there is no clear evidence of a common pattern of physiological effects <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> for all the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Furthermore, work characteristics such as job satisfaction, job control and job support may moderate the effects <b>of</b> <b>stress.</b> Methods. We measured the effects <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> together with the <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> and job characteristics, using self-reported questionnaires rather than physiological indicators in order to better diagnose stress in anaesthetists. Results. The mean stress level in anaesthetists was 50. 6 which is no higher than we found in other working populations.

40|$|Background: Stress {{is common}} in medical students. Medical school is {{recognized}} as a stressful environ-ment that often exerts {{a negative effect on}} the academic performance, physical health and psychological wellbeing of the students. Very few studies documenting the <b>sources</b> and levels <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> has been done in Indian medical students. Objectives: The current study was undertaken to assess the levels & <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> among second year undergraduate medical students. Methods: We did a cross-sectional study using Medical Student Stressor Questionnaire (MSSQ) to esti-mate the <b>sources,</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> & compared the stress levels between female and male undergraduate medical students. Totally 69 students participated in the study out of which 41 were females & 28 were males. Results: Upon analysis, the Academic Related Stress (2. 26), Intrapersonal & interpersonal related stress levels (2. 03) was high among the second year undergraduate students. So Academic Related & Intraper-sonal & interpersonal related were the major <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> among the students followed by Group ac-tivities related stress (1. 87), Social related stress (1. 82), Teaching and learning related stress (1. 55) and Drive and desire related stress (1. 43) in that order, in all <b>of</b> whom the <b>stress</b> levels was mild.

The top perceived stressors were compared with those of a previous study that examined the perceived <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> among undergraduate dental students at the University of Jordan in the year 2000. Psychological stress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). Perceived <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> were evaluated using the Dental Environment Stress questionnaire. In the study, 520 students completed the questionnaires, for a response rate of 74 percent. These students showed a high level <b>of</b> psychological <b>stress,</b> with 70 percent at the cutoff point of a score of more than 3 for the GHQ- 12. Women had a higher level <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> than men: 73 percent scored more than 3 on the GHQ- 12 vs. 63 percent for men, which was statistically significant at p= 0. 05. The top perceived <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> from the year 2000 were mostly unaltered in our study, despite a substantial increase in the number of students as well as changes in the curriculum.
