Data from a Midwestern manufacturing firm were used to test the hypotheses, drawing on social network methods to provide a fine-grained measurement of an individual's social contacts.

Specifically, he developed an optimality-based nonlinear control framework to synthesize robust globally stabilizing disturbance rejection controllers for nonlinear systems with structured nonlinear parametric uncertainty and uncertain exogenous disturbances. His results have been applied to combustion systems to suppress the effects of thermoacoustic instabilities in gas turbine engines as well as propulsion systems to control the aerodynamic instabilities of rotating stall and surge in jet engines. This research has demonstrated concrete improvements in compression system performance, robustness, reliability, and maintainability in highly visible United States Department of Defense projects under the support of National Science Foundation, AFOSR, ARO, and NASA.

40|$|Abstract. The linear parameter-varying (LPV) discrete-time model based {{design of}} a fuzzy <b>scheduling</b> <b>control</b> scheme is {{developed}} through incorporating the advantages of P 1 -TS theory, and applying the local pole placement method and interval analysis of closed-loop system polynomial coefficients. The synthesis of fuzzy <b>scheduling</b> <b>control</b> scheme is proposed {{in the form of}} iterative procedure, which enables to find the appropriate number of intervals of a fuzzy interpolator ensuring that a family of local linear controllers places closed-loop polynomial coefficients within a desired range. The computational complexity of multidimensional fuzzy <b>scheduling</b> <b>control</b> scheme synthesis is reduced using a fundamental matrix method and recursive procedure for fuzzy rule-based interpretation. The usability of the proposed method is illustrated by an implementation example and experimental results obtained on a laboratory scaled overhead crane.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} three main questions: 1) Are <b>schedule</b> <b>control</b> and job autonomy associated differently with the work-home interface? 2) Do <b>schedule</b> <b>control</b> and job autonomy interact with {{different forms of}} work-home role blurring to influence levels of work-to-home conflict? 3) Do any of these observed patterns of association differ for women and men? We apply and refine a gender view of border theory and propositions about resourceful versus demanding work conditions in the work-home interface. Analyses of the National Survey of the Changing Workforce (2002) reveal that <b>schedule</b> <b>control</b> and job autonomy are associated positively with work-home role blurring, although the effects are stronger among men. In addition, the association between work-home role blurring and work-to-home conflict is greater at higher levels of <b>schedule</b> <b>control.</b> The findings challenge the view that <b>schedule</b> <b>control</b> and job autonomy uniformly function as resources that help people avoid or manage trouble at the work-home border. Moreover, observed gender differences are inconsistent with egalitarian views about contemporary work-home role arrangements. We discuss the implications for border theory and outline future research directions on gender, work, and the work-home interface. ...|$|R
