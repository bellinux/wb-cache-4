40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} socio-economic phenomena of the last quartercentury has been the remarkable increase in the participation of women in the formal labor force. Particularly in the professions, and most notably in the newestone: public accounting. The advancement of women in organizations, especially in the high visibility jobs of the professions, has emerged as an important policy issue in America. Advancement in the professions is all the more interesting because, being service industries composed of knowledge workers, the professions represent the future of quality employment in the emerging Information Age. Because human capital is the most important resource of CPA firms, developing high commitment to quality client service, technical excellence, and professionalism among the <b>staff</b> <b>accountants</b> who make up the bulk of CPA firms??? work force is regarded as a key organizational success factor. Maintaining highlevels of job motivation is widely perceived to be an important goal in managing this resource, and to {{have a significant effect on}} advancement. This study surveys attitudes among <b>staff</b> <b>accountants</b> in large accounting firms to see if there are gender-correlated differences in job motivation. The results indicate that women generally have more favorable attitudes towards public accounting, suggesting that the profession need not focus on job motivation when crafting strategies to optimize the advancement of women in CPA firms...|$|R

40|$|Current {{economic}} conditions {{have changed the}} dynamics of all employment, including accounting, which traditionally has had a supply shortfall. CPA firms are beginning to lay off experienced people {{for the first time}} in ten years, while still hiring new <b>staff</b> <b>accountants.</b> The AICPA Vision 2011 Project has added soft skills to the list of core competencies that successful accountants should possess. Therefore, a case can be made that accounting educators have a responsibility to help prepare students to make the transition from unfocused high school seniors to contributing members of a professional service team. It is incumbent upon accounting educators to prepare students to be competitive in the unfolding economic future. In summary, technical skills are necessary but not sufficient for a successful accounting career that includes an individual’s selection, retention and advancement. An incremental laboratory experience was designed to create an environment for soft skill development that does not diminish the attention to accounting theory and technical development. The mandatory experience was added to two required accounting classes starting in the spring of sophomore year. The lab was based on an assessment of needs identified by the profession in a series of interviews and considerations of the professional development literature...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} examined {{whether a}} female applicant’s hair color {{and use of}} cosmetics might affect perceptions of her ability for a professional position. One hundred thirty six college students reviewed the identical professional resume of a female applicant for {{the position of a}} <b>staff</b> <b>accountant.</b> Attached to the resume was a photograph of the stimulus female applicant either wearing or not wearing cosmetics and depicted with brunette, red, or blonde hair color. The results demonstrated signifi-cant main effects of both hair color and cosmetic use. Specifically, the applicant was rated more capable and was assigned a higher salary both when depicted with brunette hair color and when depicted without cosmetics. There were no interactions between hair color and cosmetic use. The findings demonstrate that biases regarding personal appearance may affect judgments about a female applicant’s ability. Ideally, personnel actions such as hiring, setting salary, and judging the competence of employees are based on a rational model of decision mak-ing.

40|$|While the Department of Surgery {{is renowned}} for {{operating}} on people, Velvet Cain specializes in {{another type of}} “surgery”: analyzing and managing complex numbers. As the Department’s Senior Financial Analyst, she is instrumental in planning budgets, tracking expenses, generating reports and monitoring various components of compensation for faculty and nonfaculty staff. Velvet joined Jefferson in 1999 as a <b>staff</b> <b>accountant</b> in the Controller’s Office. She transferred to Jefferson University Physicians’ Finance Department in 2001 before assuming her current position in Surgery in 2007. While she has remained in the same role, her dayto- day work has changed dramatically over the past nine years. For starters, she says, the number of staff within the Department has grown tremendously. Faculty alone have increased from 25 to more than 50 —doubling her workload in terms of financial oversight and planning for all clinical and academic activities. The tools she uses have evolved, as well. Spreadsheets {{are no longer the}} preferred method for budgeting; instead, she now uses sophisticated software. Velvet notes that her favorite part of the job is budgeting, and she is proudest of her contributions to controlling costs: “The budget is very challenging,” she says. “As we face challenges in the healthcare environment, setting and sticking to our budgets is more important than ever. I work hard to make sure we stay within what we budgeted. ” While some of her friends have questioned how she doesn’t get “bored” looking at numbers all day, she asserts that her job is anything but dull. “Someone always needs a report, and everyone wants something simple—on a single page,” she explains, adding that those “simple” reports require a lot of work on her part. She thoroughly enjoys the process of extracting, analyzing and presenting data from multiple sources. And she takes seriously the opportunity to lessen the administrative burden for her colleagues who deliver patient care: “I know how important it is for them to focus on their patients. When they have a purchasing, accounts payable or other administrative issue, I am always available to help them— even if it means making a ‘house call’ to where they are. ...|$|E
