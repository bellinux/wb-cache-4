Boys are more at risk from physical violence than girls, while girls may face neglect and sexual violence. Patriarchal attitudes perpetuate women's inferior status and increase violence against women. Many of Ethiopia's different ethnic groups share a culture of patriarchal norms and values. Girls are <b>socialized</b> <b>to</b> be shy and obedient and not to speak in front of adults, particularly in front of men. The focus is on her future role as obedient wife and good mother.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{objectification}} {{has been}} studied based on the proposition that girls and women develop their primary view of their physical selves from observing others. These observations can {{take place in the}} media or through personal experience. Through a blend of expected and actual exposure, women are <b>socialized</b> <b>to</b> objectify their own physical characteristics from a third person perception, which is identified as self-objectification. Women and girls develop an expected physical appearance for themselves, based on observations of others; and are aware that others are likely to observe as well. The sexual objectification and self-objectification of women is believed to influence social gender roles and inequalities between the sexes.|$|E

2500|$|According to Shamus Khan, {{author of}} Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul's School and a {{sociologist}} {{who is a}} St. Paul's alumnus, students are <b>socialized</b> <b>to</b> function as privileged holders of power and status in an open society. Privilege in meritocracy is acquired through talent, hard work, and {{a wide variety of}} cultural and social experiences. Economic inequality and social inequality are explained by the lack of talent, hard work, and limited cultural and social experience of the less privileged. Thus high status is earned, not based on entitlement. According to Khan, [...] "Today what is distinct among the elite is not their exclusivity but their ease within and broad acceptance of a more open world." ...|$|E

2500|$|In her report, Abbey {{also argues}} that “men may be <b>socialized</b> <b>to</b> attend more {{carefully}} than women to potentially sexual cues and are, therefore, more likely to interpret a variety of stimuli {{as a sign of}} sexual intent.” Men tend to read into women’s actions more sexually than women would read into men’s actions. For example, men might find tickling to mean that the woman is very interested while to women it might just be a way of flirting or joking around. This can lead to some problems and possibly awkward encounters. Abbey also says that men tend to have a more sexual outlook and oftentimes perceive situations more sexually than women might; therefore, men could then feel that sexual advances are appropriate and justified whereas a woman may not be thinking so.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{critique}} of Walden Two, Harvey L.

Gamble writes, [...] "We find {{at the end of}} Walden Two that Frazier ... has sole control over the political system and its policies. It is he who regulates food, work, education, and sleep, and who sets the moral and economic agenda." [...] However, contrary to Gamble's critique, {{it should be noted that}} neither Frazier nor any other person has the sole power to amend the constitution of Walden Two. [...] See the [...] "Community governance" [...] section, above.|$|E
2500|$|Significant underreporting {{of sexual}} abuse of boys by {{both women and men}} is {{believed}} to occur due to sex stereotyping, social denial, the minimization of male victimization, and the relative lack of research on sexual abuse of boys. Sexual victimization of boys by their mothers or other female relatives is especially rarely researched or reported. Sexual abuse of girls by their mothers, and other related and/or unrelated adult females is beginning to be researched and reported despite the highly taboo nature of female–female child sex abuse. In studies where students are asked about sex offenses, they report higher levels of female sex offenders than found in adult reports. This underreporting has been attributed to cultural denial of female-perpetrated child sex abuse, because [...] "males have been <b>socialized</b> <b>to</b> believe they should be flattered or appreciative of sexual interest from a female." [...] Journalist Cathy Young writes that under-reporting is contributed to by the difficulty of people, including jurors, in seeing a male as a [...] "true victim".|$|E

2500|$|Poorly socialized or frightened Chihuahuas can {{be easily}} {{provoked}} to attack, and are therefore generally unsuitable for homes with small and undisciplined children. The breed tends to be fiercely loyal to one particular person {{and in some cases}} may become over protective of the person, especially around other people or animals. They are frequently not introduced to or socialized with dogs of other breeds, and as a result do not interact as well with them as other dogs who have been <b>socialized</b> <b>to</b> interact with different breed types and tend to have a [...] "clannish" [...] nature, often preferring the companionship of other Chihuahuas or Chihuahua mixes over other dogs. These traits generally make them unsuitable for households with children who are not patient and calm. If properly managed by older children, 13 and up, they can adapt to this kind of living with a dedicated owner. The temperament of its owner {{can make a difference in}} the temperament of the pup.|$|E
2500|$|The Papillon {{is a very}} {{intelligent}} and self-assured dog that has a very easy time learning new tricks. This dog can be sociable with children and strangers but is generally reserved around new people. [...] They can also be <b>socialized</b> <b>to</b> get along well with other pets, but care should be taken with rambunctious pets or cats with claws as they may injure it. If not properly socialized, Papillons can be distrustful and exhibit aggressive tendencies toward other dogs and people. Papillons may also be very playful and affectionate. Widely known as great companion dogs, they have the spirit and energy {{to keep up with}} active families, but can also be calm enough to be happy with sleeping in the arms of an equally affectionate owner. Due to their high energy level, they demand an augmented exercise routine, relative to the average companion breed. Papillons are known as excellent watchdogs as they will alert their owner to changes in their environment. They may be considered garrulous like many other toy dogs. The Papillon can withstand heat but is more sensitive to cold temperatures because of their single-coated fur, and should not be left outside unattended in cold weather.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{powerful}} argument hooks discusses is one {{in which}} she describes how starting from a very young age, boys and girls are constantly being knocked down and told to fit into the tiny boxes of characteristics that are expected of them. Hooks points out that the boy is denied his right to show, or even have, any true feelings. To further explain, she uses men in the American culture as an example, and describes how they have been <b>socialized</b> <b>to</b> mistrust the value and power of love. While the girl is taught {{that the most important thing}} she can do is change herself and her own feelings, with the hopes of attracting and pleasing everyone else. These unfair expectations lead boys and girls to grow up into men and women who are convinced that lies are the way to go, and no one should be showing their truest feelings to each other. This leads to the paradox hooks points out because in order to have a functional, and healthy loving relationship, honesty is a natural requirement. In bell hooks's own words, [...] "Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love" [...] (hooks). Another central argument in hooks's All About Love is the way in which it is almost impossible for women to find happiness in what she sees as a brutal culture where men are taught to worry more about sexual satisfaction and performance than actually loving someone. This reality pointed out by hooks, paired with the fact that women focus so strongly on obtaining themselves a partner, leads to most relationships being completely one sided. In this case, the men are emotionally satisfied, and the women are left without any true happiness. Hooks points out that despite these evident problems in modern-day love culture, love can be revived, and this is what she is arguing throughout her book.|$|E

5000|$|All About Love: New Visions {{is a book}} by bell hooks {{published}} in 2000.

50|$|Erich Fromm {{emphasizes}} the social necessities, {{which must be}} obeyed {{by the members of}} a society. So that a society functions adequately, their members must acquire a character structure which enables them to do {{what they need to do}} in order to prosper.

In peasant society, people are <b>socialized</b> <b>to</b> save and to work independently.

50|$|It is not {{uncommon}} for a team to concede a curling match after it believes it no longer has any hope of winning.

50|$|To see how {{temporal}} motivation {{theory can}} be applied in an example, consider a student given one month to study for a final exam.
