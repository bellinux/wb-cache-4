50|$|Iron gets {{close to}} the gasoline, Jake shoots, and he explodes. Pieces fly everywhere, {{knocking}} out Max, Earl, and Jake. A flamed piece lands {{on the hood of}} Jenny's car, and Claire barely escapes. Although a big explosion, the Pieces are still alive. Claire runs over to Max and tries to wake him up. Jake puts the beer into a <b>spray</b> <b>container,</b> and begins to spray the Pieces, killing the flames and the bacteria, while the others throw beer bottles. A little car engine makes its way to Max. Before it can infect him, Amanda appears and sprays it down. The mother and daughter are reunited. Max awakens and hugs Claire.|$|E

50|$|In {{the first}} season, Andrew must carry around aerosol <b>spray</b> <b>containers</b> {{and use them}} to move through the air, as his 'flying' ability is limited; he can make himself nearly weightless, and move up without any problems, but he cannot propel himself through the air or move down without some {{external}} force. However, he can jump quite high, and do impossible flips. In the second season, without explanation, Andrew gains the ability to move through the air without the use of aerosol cans. Later in that season, after being struck by the photon beam a second time, Andrew develops superhuman strength but loses his invulnerability.|$|R

Contrary to the Eastern approach of keeping males in solitary cells, keeping males together is acceptable: According to Amato, protein-rich diet reduces the males' drive to fight.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a flip-frame mechanism for shipping <b>container</b> <b>spray</b> painting production line. The idea of the flip-frame mechanism is to reduce, to a large extent, paint wastage during spray painting of the quadrangular exterior surfaces of the shipping container. Clamping of the shipping container on the flip-frame is achieved by hydraulic cylinders. A roller chain and a sprocket is used to drive the flip-frame because of their simplicity, strength, ability to work under harsh condition and require little lubrication...|$|R
30|$|The study {{compared}} a {{total of}} six treatments derived from three types of weed control (no weed control; herbicide, oxadiazon; mulching <b>spray)</b> applied in <b>containers</b> either filled only with the sterile substrate or filled with the sterile substrate and then artificially inoculated with seeds of the weed species [Sonchus asper (L.) Hill subsp. asper and Epilobium montanum L.]. The mulch controlled the weeds effectively for more than 2  months after its application even under severe weed infestation. The mulching spray controlled the emergence of S. asper more efficiently than E. montanum plants, probably because the latter has a stronger capacity to penetrate the mulch film during emergence.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. Our Institute has {{investigated}} the expressed needs of many severely disabled people. One requirement {{was for a}} portable bidet that would fit on a standard toilet, {{so that they could}} still have some of the advantages of their automatic washing/drying/flushing toilet when away from their own house. Potential users were consulted, from the specification stage through to final production model testing, to ensure that the desired device was produced. The Port-a-Bidet is a lightweight device, with its own water <b>container,</b> <b>spray</b> unit, pump and power supply. It allows a user with very weak arms to wash themselves with warm water, and a hands-free drying method is explained in the instruction booklet. The whole unit is transported in a discreet carrying bag, and can easily be set up by an unskilled person. The Port-a-Bidet can be controlled by commercially available single switch activators, so that any user can operate it...|$|R
40|$|Dengue {{continues}} to be the largest cause of arboviral human disease. Australia is no exception, with annual outbreaks in north Queensland. Until recently, we were restricted to measures, such as pesticide <b>sprays</b> and <b>container</b> removal, that reduce populations of the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus, 1762). However, the Eliminate Dengue research program, an international collaboration led by Professor Scott O'Neill of Monash University, uses the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis to block dengue virus replication in the mosquito and reduce dengue transmission. To date, releases of adult A. [*]aegypti infected with the wMel strain of Wolbachia have been made at seven different locations near Cairns Queensland. Wolbachia has successfully established in each release area, with some populations having persisted for three consecutive years. Success using wMel has come relatively easily, with fixation (> 90 % mosquitoes infected) obtained after 3 months of weekly releases of adult mosquitoes that required no concurrent vector control. We have not had success establishing wMelPop strain, due to the high fitness costs of this more virulent strain of Wolbachia to its mosquito host. New release strategies of wMel that allow us to simply place egg papers in rearing buckets in the field are also showing promise. Going forward, we hope to scale up the program so that large urban areas can be treated with a minimal number of releases and labour. Finally, what evidence is there that Wolbachia actually prevents dengue in human populations? The definitive studies will be taking place in dengue endemic countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam where sufficient transmission allows for carefully controlled trials, although dengue incidence in Wolbachia treated areas of Queensland will be watched with interest...|$|R
40|$|New corrosion-resistant, iron-based {{amorphous}} metals {{have been}} identified from published data or developed through combinatorial synthesis, and tested to determine their relative corrosion resistance. Many of these materials can be applied as coatings with advanced thermal spray technology. Two compositions have corrosion resistance superior to wrought nickel-based Alloy C- 22 (UNS No. N 06022) in some very aggressive environments, including concentrated calcium-chloride brines at elevated temperature. Two Fe-based amorphous metal formulations have been found that appear to have corrosion resistance comparable to, or better than that of Ni-based Alloy C- 22, based on breakdown potential and corrosion rate. Both Cr and Mo provide corrosion resistance, B enables glass formation, and Y lowers critical cooling rate (CCR). SAM 1651 has yttrium added, and has a nominal critical cooling rate of only 80 Kelvin per second, while SAM 2 X 7 (similar to SAM 2 X 5) has no yttrium, and a relatively high critical cooling rate of 610 Kelvin per second. Both amorphous metal formulations have strengths and weaknesses. SAM 1651 (yttrium added) has a low critical cooling rate (CCR), which enables it to be rendered as a completely amorphous thermal spray coating. Unfortunately, it is relatively difficult to atomize, with powders being irregular in shape. This causes the powder {{to be difficult to}} pneumatically convey during thermal spray deposition. Gas atomized SAM 1651 powder has required cryogenic milling to eliminate irregularities that make flow difficult. SAM 2 X 5 (no yttrium) has a high critical cooling rate, which has caused problems associated with devitrification. SAM 2 X 5 can be gas atomized to produce spherical powders of SAM 2 X 5, which enable more facile thermal spray deposition. The reference material, nickel-based Alloy C- 22, is an outstanding corrosion-resistant engineering material. Even so, crevice corrosion has been observed with C- 22 in hot sodium chloride environments without buffer or inhibitor. Comparable metallic alloys such as SAM 2 X 5 and SAM 1651 may also experience crevice corrosion under sufficiently harsh conditions. Accelerated crevice corrosion tests are now being conducted to intentionally induce crevice corrosion, and to determine those environmental conditions where such localized attack occurs. Such materials are extremely hard, and provide enhanced resistance to abrasion and gouges (stress risers) from backfill operations, and possibly even tunnel boring. The hardness of Type 316 L Stainless Steel is approximately 150 VHN, that of Alloy C- 22 is approximately 250 VHN, and that of HVOF SAM 2 X 5 ranges from 1100 - 1300 VHN. These new materials provide a viable coating option for repository engineers. SAM 2 X 5 and SAM 1651 coatings can be applied with thermal spray processes without any significant loss of corrosion resistance. Both Alloy C- 22 and Type 316 L stainless lose their resistance to corrosion during thermal <b>spraying.</b> <b>Containers</b> for the transportation, storage and disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) and high-level radioactive waste (HLW) with corrosion resistant coatings are envisioned. For example, an enhanced multi-purpose container (MPC) could be made with such coatings, leveraging existing experience in the fabrication of such containers. These coating materials could be used to protect the final closure weld on SNF/HLW disposal containers, eliminate need for stress mitigation. Integral drip shield could be produced by directly spraying it onto the disposal container, thereby eliminating the need for an expensive titanium drip shield. In specific areas where crevice corrosion is anticipated, such as the contact point between the disposal container and pallet, HVOF coatings could be used to buildup thickness, thereby selectively adding corrosion life where it is needed. Both SAM 2 X 5 & SAM 1651 have high boron content which enable them to absorb neutrons and therefore be used for criticality control in baskets. Alloy C- 22 and 316 L have no neutron absorber, and cannot be used for such functions. Borated stainless steel and...|$|R

40|$|Dengue (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, DENV) {{remains the}} leading arboviral cause of {{mortality}} in the tropics. Wolbachia pipientis {{has been shown}} to interrupt DENV transmission and is presently being trialled as a biological control. However, deployment issues have arisen on methods to temporarily suppress wild mosquito populations before Wolbachia-infected mosquito releases. By suppressing wild populations, fewer Ae. aegypti releases are required to achieve a sustainable Wolbachia density threshold. Furthermore, public distress is reduced. This study tests the application of domestic bleach (4 % NaClO) to temporarily "crash" immature Aedes populations in water-filled <b>containers.</b> <b>Spray</b> application NaClO (215 ppm) resulted in a mean 48 -h mortality of 100, 100, 97, and 88 % of eggs, second-instar larvae, fourth-instar larvae, and pupae, respectively. In the field, NaClO delayed ovipositing by 9 d in cooler months, and 11 d in hotter months, after which oviposition resumed in treated receptacles. We found bleach treatment of pot-plant bases did not cause wilting, yellowing, or dropping of leaves in two ornamental plants species. Domestically available NaClO could be adopted for a "crash and release" strategy to temporarily suppress wild populations of Ae. aegypti in containers before release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The "crash and release" strategy is also applicable to other mosquito species, e. g., Aedes albopictus (Skuse), in strategies using released mosquitoes...|$|R
