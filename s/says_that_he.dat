5|$|However, because Eusebius nowhere categorically {{asserts that}} he has read the letters (he only <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has {{compiled}} them) and as moderns are disinclined to take him at his word, some, like Pohlsander, posit that Eusebius {{did not get the}} tale from the letters, and drew it instead from oral rumors.

Jerome and the Latin Christian authors following him do not share his caution.|$|E
