5|$|Believing {{the attack}} was over, Giffen ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and {{continue}} towards Guadalcanal on the same course and at the <b>same</b> <b>speed.</b> Meanwhile, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft began dropping flares and floatlights to mark the course and speed of TF18 for the impending attack by Hagai's bombers.|$|E
5|$|Plinian eruptions {{are similar}} to both Vulcanian and Strombolian eruptions, except that rather than {{creating}} discrete explosive events, Plinian eruptions form sustained eruptive columns. They are also similar to Hawaiian lava fountains in that both eruptive types produce sustained eruption columns maintained by the growth of bubbles that move up at about the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> as the magma surrounding them.|$|E
5|$|The Wiesbaden {{class was}} the first German light cruiser design to mount 15cm guns, though the Pillau class was {{completed}} with guns of this caliber first. The Wiesbaden-class ships were otherwise {{very similar to the}} preceding Graudenz class; they were slightly larger, but had the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> and identical armor protection.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{high speed}} runs, {{with the car}} {{configured}} in production specification (catalytic converters connected, lower rev-limit of 7400rpm) achieved a maximum recorded speed of , the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> as previously reached at Fort Stockton during testing. Brundle reported that the car was hitting the rev limiter during the run.|$|E
5|$|The dipole is tilted roughly 10° from Jupiter's axis of rotation; {{the tilt}} {{is similar to}} that of the Earth (11.3°). Its {{equatorial}} field strength is about 776.6μT (7.766G), which corresponds to a dipole magnetic moment of about 2.83 T·m3. This makes Jupiter's magnetic field about 20 times stronger than Earth's, and its magnetic moment ~20,000times larger. Jupiter's magnetic field rotates at the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> as the region below its atmosphere, with a period of 9h55m. No changes in its strength or structure have been observed since the first measurements were taken by the Pioneer spacecraft in the mid-1970s.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5000|$|Effort: Alternatively, the <b>same</b> <b>speeds</b> can {{be reached}} with less effort. This means that a rider on a pedelec can sweat less if at all - {{particularly}} when going up hill or against the wind - so bicycle commuting in work clothes is less problematic, i.e. eliminating the need to change and/or shower upon getting to work.|$|R
50|$|With {{respect to}} the center of mass both {{velocities}} are reversed by the collision: in the case of particles of different mass, a heavy particle moves slowly toward the center of mass, and bounces back with the <b>same</b> low <b>speed,</b> and a light particle moves fast toward the center of mass, and bounces back with the <b>same</b> high <b>speed.</b>|$|R

5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual lean angle of the rear frame from the ideal lean angle {{described}} above. The actual lean angle between the frame and the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the <b>same</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The same update {{released}} {{alongside the}} Fury expansion pack introduced in-game advertisements, {{found in the}} loading screens before a race. This move was met with criticism from gaming news outlets, particularly as the advertisements almost doubled the loading time between levels, and while the game content loads at the <b>same</b> <b>speed,</b> the advert must finish playing before the race can begin. The adverts were removed soon after numerous complaints were made by players. In addition to the load time problems, there had been consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game {{that had already been}} paid for.|$|E
5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to other members of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to {{the other members of the}} group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem to}} be {{addressed}} is one of scheduling multiprocessor tasks, some of which require more than one processor at a time. We extend this model by introducing uniform duo-processor systems consisting of pairs of processors having the <b>same</b> <b>speeds.</b> A low order polynomial-time algorithm for preemptive scheduling of uni- and two-processor tasks is proposed, when schedule length is the performance measure...|$|R
50|$|Performance: Compared {{to other}} {{experimental}} aircraft the X-7 much more efficiently maximized its speed with its range.  While most experimental aircraft topped off at around 926 knots, the X-7 maximized its speed and range {{to be more}} than 200 percent more efficient than the rest.  Comparing the <b>same</b> <b>speeds</b> to that of Military aircraft the X-7 held a 633 percent margin.|$|R
5000|$|A 2005 study {{demonstrated}} that cars running on lithium-ion batteries out-perform both compressed-air and {{fuel cell vehicles}} more than threefold at <b>same</b> <b>speeds.</b> MDI has recently claimed that an air car {{will be able to}} travel 140 km in urban driving, and have a range of 80 km with a top speed of 110 km/h on highways, when operating on compressed air alone.|$|R
5|$|It is {{possible}} to calculate eigenvalues, {{one for each of}} the four state variables (lean angle, lean rate, steer angle, and steer rate), from the linearized equations in order to analyze the normal modes and self-stability of a particular bike design. In the plot to the right, eigenvalues of one particular bicycle are calculated for forward speeds of 0–10m/s (22mph). When the real parts of all eigenvalues (shown in dark blue) are negative, the bike is self-stable. When the imaginary parts of any eigenvalues (shown in cyan) are non-zero, the bike exhibits oscillation. The eigenvalues are point symmetric about the origin and so any bike design with a self-stable region in forward speeds will not be self-stable going backwards at the <b>same</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Leipzig and Nürnberg {{were the}} {{follow-on}} class {{to the three}} Königsberg-class ships. They were built to a modified design, which included returning the aft turrets to the centerline. Another major change was a new gear system that allowed the diesel and turbine engines to run at the same time, which permitted a lighter propulsion system to reach the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> of the earlier ships. They were also fitted with bulbous bows to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency. The two cruisers were not identical: Leipzig had a superstructure similar to the Königsbergs, while Nürnberg was built with a much larger structure. Nürnberg was also completed with a much stronger anti-aircraft battery.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{was stopped}} {{on their first}} drive due to an {{unsuccessful}} fourth down conversion. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's Michael Huff intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6–0 lead. Texas extended {{the lead in the}} secondquarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the thirdquarter and Quan Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourthtouchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> he was running and bounced right back up into his hands. Texas won the 2005game 62–0 making it the only shutout of the 2005season for the Longhorns.|$|E

50|$|The R182 and TR182 offer 10-15% {{improvement}} in climb and cruise speeds over their fixed gear counterparts or, alternatively, 10-15% better fuel economy at the <b>same</b> <b>speeds</b> {{at the expense}} of increased maintenance costs and decreased gear robustness. The 1978 R182 has a sea level climb rate of 1140 fpm and cruising speed (75% BHP) at 7500 ft of 156 KTAS at standard temperature.|$|R
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System's {{location}} in the Milky Way {{is a factor in}} the evolutionary history of life on Earth. Its orbit is close to circular, and orbits near the Sun are at roughly the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> as that of the spiral arms. Therefore, the Sun passes through arms only rarely. Because spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae, gravitational instabilities, and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System, this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve. The Solar System also lies well outside the star-crowded environs of the galactic centre. Near the centre, gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the Oort cloud and send many comets into the inner Solar System, producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth. The intense radiation of the galactic centre could also interfere with the development of complex life. Even at the Solar System's current location, some scientists have speculated that recent supernovae may have adversely affected life in the last 35,000 years, by flinging pieces of expelled stellar core towards the Sun, as radioactive dust grains and larger, comet-like bodies.|$|E

25|$|Two objects {{having the}} same {{reference}} area moving at the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> through a fluid will experience a drag force proportional to their respective drag coefficients. Coefficients for unstreamlined objects can be 1 or more, for streamlined objects much less.|$|E
25|$|Time is {{sometimes}} used (instead of angle) to express {{position within the}} cycle of an oscillation. A phase difference is analogous to two athletes running around a race track at the <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> and direction but starting at different positions on the track. They pass a point at different instants in time. But the time difference (phase difference) between them is a constant - same for every pass since {{they are at the}} <b>same</b> <b>speed</b> and in the same direction. If they were at different speeds (different frequencies), the phase difference is undefined and would only reflect different starting positions. Technically, phase difference between two entities at various frequencies is undefined and does not exist.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes, {{the sweep}} {{function}} is {{performed by a}} truck or other vehicle that may also have a trailer. This is usually for very long trips that cover many miles on the highway as on twisty backroads the pickup and trailer {{may not be able}} to maintain the <b>same</b> <b>speeds</b> as the motorcycles. When this is done, the term [...] "chase vehicle" [...] is usually the preferred term, though the function is essentially the same.|$|R

50|$|Since emitter and {{detector}} {{are traveling}} at the <b>same</b> <b>speeds,</b> Doppler effects cancel out, so the Sagnac effect {{does not involve}} the Doppler effect. In the case of ring laser interferometry, {{it is important to}} be aware of this. When the ring laser setup is rotating, the counterpropagating beams undergo frequency shifts in opposite directions. This frequency shift is not a Doppler shift, but is rather an optical cavity resonance effect, as explained below in Ring lasers.|$|R
