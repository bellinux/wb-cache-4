25|$|Claude Shannon's {{development}} of Information theory in 1948 {{gave rise to}} the entropy view of randomness. In this view, randomness is the opposite of determinism in a stochastic process. Hence if a <b>stochastic</b> <b>system</b> has entropy zero it has no randomness and any increase in entropy increases randomness. Shannon's formulation defaults to Boltzmann's 19th century formulation of entropy in case all probabilities are equal. Entropy is now widely used in diverse fields of science from thermodynamics to quantum chemistry.|$|E
25|$|Another {{class of}} methods assesses whether the {{inference}} {{was successful in}} light of the given observed data, for example, by comparing the posterior predictive distribution of summary statistics to the summary statistics observed. Beyond that, cross-validation techniques and predictive checks represent promising future strategies to evaluate the stability and out-of-sample predictive validity of ABC inferences. This is particularly important when modeling large data sets, because then the posterior support of a particular model can appear overwhelmingly conclusive, even if all proposed models in fact are poor representations of the <b>stochastic</b> <b>system</b> underlying the observation data. Out-of-sample predictive checks can reveal potential systematic biases within a model and provide clues on to how to improve its structure or parametrization.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop a model {{reduction}} theory for linear quantum <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems</b> that are commonly encountered in quantum optics and related fields, modeling devices such as optical cavities and optical parametric amplifiers, as well as quantum networks composed of such devices. It is shown that subsystem truncation preserves the physical realizability property of linear quantum <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems,</b> and that the property of complete passivity is invariant under subsystem truncation. However, generic linear quantum <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems</b> need not have a balanced realization under symplectic transformations. Therefore, alternative notions of balancing, including so-called quasi-balancing, are developed, and necessary and sufficient conditions are derived. A truncation error bound is derived for quasi-balanceable linear quantum <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems</b> and it is shown that all asymptotically stable completely passive linear quantum <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems</b> have a quasi-balanced realization. An example is provided to illustrate model reduction in the context of low-pass optical filtering of coherent light using a network of optical cavities. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R

30|$|Obviously, {{stochastic}} disturbance is {{considered as one}} of the unstable sources of control systems which usually exists in many practical systems [21 – 23]. So, for a deterministic nonlinear system, the control for <b>stochastic</b> nonlinear <b>system</b> is much more difficult. Therefore, the research on control design and stability analysis for nonlinear <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems</b> is a significant and challenging subject, and it has been a topic of great concern {{in the last few years}} [24 – 28]. Specifically, some control methods based on adaptive backstepping technique for deterministic nonlinear systems [29 – 32] have been successfully generalized to nonlinear <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems</b> [33 – 39]. For instance, an output-feedback backstepping controller was developed for a class of <b>stochastic</b> nonlinear <b>systems</b> in [40], the state feedback controller is designed for nonlinear <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems</b> with Markovian switching [41] and [42] presented the backstepping control design approaches. Nevertheless, these methods are only suitable for those nonlinear <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems</b> with known nonlinear dynamic models. Adaptive output-feedback control methods for a class of uncertain nonlinear <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems</b> were proposed by utilizing the fuzzy logic system (FLS) and the stability of the control systems was discussed in [35]. The results of [35] were extended to a class of uncertain large-scale nonlinear <b>stochastic</b> <b>systems.</b> The approaches [17, 20] decreased the adjustable parameters. The presented controller in [43] has a simple structure because the unknown virtual control signals were directly approximated via FLS. From the above, adaptive fuzzy control approach plays an important role in dealing with uncertain nonlinear systems.|$|R

50|$|Practical {{application}} of the numerical optimization results is difficult because any complex technical system is a <b>stochastic</b> <b>system</b> and the characteristics of this system have probabilistic nature. We would like to emphasize that, speaking about the stochastic properties of a technical system within the frame of optimization tasks, we imply that the important parameters of any system are stochastically spread.
