5|$|GO {{has always}} owned its {{locomotives}} and coaches, but its trackage {{used to be}} owned entirely by Canada's two major commercial railways: the large majority by the Canadian National Railway (CN) and the remainder (the current Milton line) by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP).

From 1998 until 2009, GO owned only 6% of the railway trackage on which it operated.
