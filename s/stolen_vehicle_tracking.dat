40|$|The motive of {{this paper}} is to design and {{implement}} “Intelligent Traffic with Emergency Control and <b>Stolen</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Tracking</b> System ” using Artificial Intelligence. Thus this system is capable to sense the density of vehicles for intelligent traffic management and also able to recognize emergency vehicles as ambulance to allow that signal for emergency control, as well as this system also recognizes the vehicles number for tracking stolen vehicles. It is significant to identify the density of traffic on real time mainly in metropolitan cities for signals control and active traffic management using traffic mass estimation using neural networks. In Density Control System we allow that signal first which has the highest density of vehicles, through which the congestion of traffics can be controlled then signals will get back to its original position or flow. In Emergency Control System we recognize the ambulance using pattern recognition among other vehicles from traffic and if system recognized emergency vehicle then that particular signal will be allowed and other signals will become red and an emergency alarm will be generated to indicate the activation of emergency signal. And in <b>Stolen</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Tracking</b> System, our system will recognize vehicles numbers from those vehicles which are waiting for green signal then it will verify the validation and authentication of that vehicles numbers and report the location of signal to the control room if any fraudulent information is found. This entire system is based on artificial intelligence that can make better control system...|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned applications, M 2 M communications in ITS support several operations such as tracking of a stolen vehicle, traffic reports and route planning, as well as infotainment services [5]. For instance, to recover a stolen vehicle, <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> (SVT), service providers request data about the location from Telematic Control Unit (TCU) located inside the vehicle. In addition, drivers are also updated by sending reports regarding traffic in a particular region {{so that they can}} change/plan new routes in case of a traffic jam or an emergency. Furthermore, infotainment services aim to provide news/information to drivers and passengers through mobile TV, web-browsing, etc.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> {{systems are}} also popular in {{consumer}} vehicles as a theft prevention, monitoring and retrieval device.

40|$|Lojack is a <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> {{technology}} that achieves extremely high recovery rates. Ayres and Levitt (1998) show that {{introduction of the}} system produced large reductions in vehicle thefts in areas where it was implemented in the United States. The reduced theft risk was shared by all vehicle owners, not only those who bought Lojack. This paper, in contrast, uses the introduction of Lojack to a publicly known set of Ford car models in some Mexican states to show that Lojack generates negative externalities if thieves can distinguish between Lojack and non-Lojack-equipped cars. The empirical analysis suggests that, although Lojack-equipped vehicles experienced a reduction in theft risk of 55 %, most of the averted thefts were replaced by thefts of non-Lojack-equipped automobiles in neighboring states. The increase in thefts in non Lojack-serviced states was especially strong for the same car models that in Lojack-serviced states were sold equipped with Lojack. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite its {{importance}} for victims, and {{society as a}} whole, motor vehicle theft (MVT) recovery is rarely studied. The current research note draws on rational choice and opportunity-based perspectives, and police agency technology use, to develop and test amultilevel event history (survival) analysismodel forMVT recovery. Contrary to the hypothesis that more expensive vehicles have a lower chance of recovery due to their attractiveness for permanent retention, the analysis found that recovery was least likely for incidents in which the stolen car had little value (less than $ 1, 000), with no significant differences among the categories of $ 1, 000 or greater. Measures of local opportunity for permanent retention MVT did not have statistically significant effects on recovery, but closer proximity to a major port or US-Mexico border crossing was associated with lower odds of recovery. Furthermore, police agency use of a <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system increased odds of recovery...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivation}} for the research was primarily to satisfy positional accuracy requirements for mobile phone handsets using terrestrial networks as specified by the United States (US) Federal Communications Commission (FCC) E- 911 rules. The objective of the research was to improve location finding accuracy to support the emergency services and the stolen vehicle recovery service, in areas devoid of satellite coverage. Following a literature review, four novel location finding techniques were discovered and simulated. The first novel technique provides a means to achieve an accurate mobile time source (1 part in 107) in first generation cellular networks and thereby accurate positioning(20 dBi) pseudo-Doppler antenna. The second method provides enhanced processing gain using a novel Error Correction Coding (ECC) post processing algorithm for hard decision decoded messages where signal re-transmission exists or can be requested. The {{results of the study}} revealed that improvements in location finding accuracy are possible in 1 st 2 nd and 3 rd generation cellular radio networks without compromising the operation of legacy handsets or <b>stolen</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> devices.

40|$|Abstract - Seamless Connectivity in Vehicular Networks,and Vehicle Security is {{attracting}} discussion of research {{issues related to}} the integration and cooperation of heterogeneous wireless networks, (i. e. IEEE 802. 11 p, IEEE 802. 16 e, and dedicated shortrange communications (DSRC) as well as seamless connectivity in vehicular scenarios. Research into vehicle security control technology also suggests that more improved monitoring and security offering embedded communication is required. As a result a viable security system needs to be in constant communication with a base station for monitoring purposes. Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) technology offers a secure solution due to excellent interference suppression of non- Gaussian noise and interference. This paper offers an architecture that will utilize a hybrid smart grid technology, wireless and powerline communication (PLC) as a medium. This paper suggests that using microprocessor technology to generate short message bursts utilising hybrid transmission mediums will allow for efficient and accurate transmission with low Bit Error Rates (BER). Remote immobilizer functionality is the ultimate aim of this research.

30|$|Mobile M 2 M {{communication}} offers manifold {{applications and}} services in modern transport and logistical processes such as onboard security, traffic and infrastructure management, fleet management, and route planning [19]. In case of an emergency, the collected data are sent to other vehicles as well as infrastructure to gain immediate attention. To avoid further incidents, communication between the infrastructure and the vehicles must be very fast to detect emergency messages and deliver warning messages immediately. Similarly, traffic and infrastructure management play {{a prominent role in}} handling the problem of road congestion. It tackles the problem by providing two-way communication opportunities between vehicles and infrastructure. Vehicles can send status updates about the position, speed, fuel consumption, and delivery status reports to the infrastructure and can also receive relevant instructions about road accidents and emergency braking system [20]. Moreover, M 2 M communications support several operations such as tracking of a stolen vehicle, traffic reports, and route planning as well as infotainment services [6]. For instance, to recover a stolen vehicle, SVT (<b>Stolen</b> <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Tracking)</b> service providers request data about the location from Telematic Control Unit (TCU) located inside the vehicle. In addition, drivers are also updated by sending reports regarding traffic in a particular region so that they can change or plan new routes in case of traffic jam or an emergency.
