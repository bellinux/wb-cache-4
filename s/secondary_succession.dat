2500|$|Historical ecologists {{recognize}} that landscapes undergo continuous alteration {{over time and}} these modifications are part of that landscape's history. Historical ecology recognizes {{that there is a}} primary and a <b>secondary</b> <b>succession</b> that occurs in the landscape. These successions should be understood without a preconceived bias against humanity. Landscape transformations are ecological successions driven by human impacts. [...] Primary landscape transformations occur when human activity results in a complete turnover of species and major substrate modifications in certain habitats while secondary landscape transformations involve human-induced changes in species proportions. The stages of landscape transformation demonstrate the history of a landscape. These stages can be brought on by humans or natural causes. Parts of the Amazon rainforest exhibit different stages of landscape transformation such as the impact of indigenous slash-and-burn horticulture on plant species compositions. Such landscape transformation does not inherently reduce biodiversity or harm the environment. There are many cases in which human-mediated disturbance increases biodiversity as landscapes transform over time.|$|E

Based on wood anatomical features, we estimated that about 37 percent of the species presented distinct growth rings useful for ring studies. Overall, maximum number of rings matched well the interview-based fallow ages but, at some sites, trees had consistently higher numbers of rings, probably due to errors in fallow ages derived from interviews. Best fallow age estimations were obtained by examining rings in both pioneer and nonpioneer species. Reconstruction of species' establishment dates revealed that pioneer and nonpioneer species establish early during succession, and that species of both groups continue to recruit after many years.

40|$|Summary: Primary {{successions}} involving teatree (Kunzea ericoides var. ericoides {{with some}} Leptospermum scoparium) were studied on shallow landslide scars on soft sedimentary (mudstone) hill country under extensive pastoral {{use in the}} East Cape (Tairawhiti) region, using a 5 - 72 yr chronosequence established from sequential aerial photography {{and the age of}} the oldest teatrees on scars. Dynamics of primary even-aged teatree stands are similar to those in <b>secondary</b> <b>successions</b> on reverting pasture described previously from the region. Height growth rates and basal area indicate that the productivity of teatree stands on landslide scars is similar to that on intact regolith. Although seventy five vascular species were recorded, one-third of them adventive, only five species- all native- were consistently present. Classification and ordination revealed four distinct stages in the evolution of ground layer communities, the first three with 50 % plant cover (principally M. stipoides, from 50 years), reflecting the dynamics- dominated by intraspecific competition- of the teatree stands. Apart from Leucopogon fasciculatus,other early successional canopy species were rare and later successional canopy species typical of primary forest in the region were absent.

We used multivariate ordination and nonlinear models to examine changes in composition and structure and to estimate forest recovery rates and resilience. A shrub phase characterized early succession (0 – 3 yr); afterwards, the tree Mimosa acantholoba became dominant. Below its canopy, sprouts and seed-regenerated individuals of mature forest species slowly accumulated. Canopy height, plant density, and crown cover stabilized in less than 15 yr, whereas species richness, diversity, and basal area continued to increase. The pioneer species group has very low diversity and the long-lived pioneer phase typical of humid forests is absent; species composition may therefore recover soon as suggested by convergence toward mature forest species composition. The time trend of plant density also differed from humid forests for it lacked its characteristic density decline, presumably because of differences in regeneration mechanisms between very dry and other less water-stressed forest types. As opposed to the prevailing hypothesis, resilience was not higher than in moister forests, and thus factors other than structure relative simplicity must be accounted for when assessing resilience...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{analysis}} {{of changes in}} species composition and vegetation structure in chronosequences improves knowledge on the regeneration patterns following land abandonment in the Amazon. Here, the objective was to perform floristic-structural analysis in mature forests (with/without timber exploitation) and <b>secondary</b> <b>successions</b> (initial, intermediate and advanced vegetation regrowth) in the Tapajós region. The regrowth age and plot locations were determined using Landsat- 5 /Thematic Mapper images (1984 - 2012). For floristic analysis, we determined the sample sufficiency and the Shannon-Weaver (H'), Pielou evenness (J), Value of Importance (VI) and Fisher's alpha (&# 945;) indices. We applied the Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) for similarity ordination. For structural analysis, the diameter at the breast height (DBH), total tree height (Ht), basal area (BA) and the aboveground biomass (AGB) were obtained. We inspected the differences in floristic-structural attributes using Tukey and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. The results showed {{an increase in the}} H', J and &# 945; indices from initial regrowth to mature forests of the order of 47 %, 33 % and 91 %, respectively. The advanced regrowth had more species in common with the intermediate stage than with the mature forest. Statistically significant differences between initial and intermediate stages (p< 0. 05) were observed for DBH, BA and Ht. The recovery of carbon stocks showed an AGB variation from 14. 97 t ha- 1 (initial regrowth) to 321. 47 t ha- 1 (mature forests). In addition to AGB, Ht was also important to discriminate the typologies...|$|R

This is due to the rapid rate of reproduction of the A. scoparia, resulting in the species’ early abundance, and the dominant competition from the K-selected B. ischaemum, resulting in that species’ later abundance.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{landscapes of}} the French island of Corsica {{are the result}} of the grazing {{tradition}} which has always occupied a pivotal position in the island's economy. Furthermore, in the last fifty years, a reduction in the pressure from human activity has lead to changes in plant cover. This article intends to study the evolution of dynamic mechanisms during the <b>secondary</b> <b>successions</b> and the effect of changes in vegetation on plant diversity. Our study was based on a simultaneous study of 375 plots carried out between May and September from 1996 to 1998. We studied the floristic composition of each stage both qualitatively (life form, adaptive strategy and seed dispersal mode) and quantitatively (species richness, equitability, Shannon index). The results show a change in species and environmental conditions, with a progressive move from heliophilic grassland and low shrub species with an S or SR strategy, anemochoric and with a high tolerance for soil quality to a final stage of dense forest composed of competitive (C or CS) zoochoric or barochoric phanerophytes. Moreover, the turning point in Corsica in terms of floristic diversity lies between 20 and 55 years after land abandonment. Successions are due to a series of rapid interactions. Thus, when a site is given reserve or protected area status, we need {{to take into account the}} fact that it will evolve according to the biological traits of the species.

40|$|Land {{abandonment}} is {{a widespread}} phenomenon in agricultural systems, especially in former communist countries of Eastern and South-eastern Europe. Moreover, Croatia was affected by acts of war which enhanced the depopulation of marginal areas impelling further land abandonment. Agricultural landscapes in Croatia are highly parcelled with various proportions of forest habitats due to traditional smallholder farming systems. <b>Secondary</b> <b>successions</b> {{as a consequence of}} land abandonment affect farmland birds that are among the most endangered bird species in Europe. We examined bird communities along a habitat gradient in heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. We used the share of woody vegetation cover as a proxy measure for land abandonment that we classified in four classes. Our results showed no significant Shannon Wiener Index differences of bird communities along the land abandonment gradient. However, there were differences in abundances when we examined bird guilds such as farmland, forest and “other” birds separately. However, the conservation value of each of the four land abandonment classes did not show significant differences. We extracted single bird species such as the Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), Red-backed Shrike (Lanius collurio), Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) and European Robin (Erithacus rubecula) as potential indicator species for the four examined land abandonment levels. With these four species we successfully modelled the distribution of the recorded bird assemblages at the plot level along the four vegetation succession stages.
