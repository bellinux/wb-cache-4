Both the velocity field and the <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> <b>rate</b> are determined up to the second order of approximation thus evaluating both the steady streaming and the net (wave-averaged) flux of sediment induced by nonlinear effects. The flow regime is assumed to be turbulent and a two-equation turbulence model is used to close the problem.

The suspended load is determined by computing the sediment flux, once the sediment concentration is determined by solving an appropriate advection–diffusion equation. The decay of the wave amplitude, which is due to the energy dissipation taking place in the boundary layer, is taken into account. The steady streaming and the <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> <b>rate</b> at the bottom of sea waves turn out to be different from those which are observed in a wave tunnel (U-tube), because of the dependence on the streamwise coordinate of the former flow.

Experimental hydrographs were composed of antecedent (base-flow), unsteady event (flood) and post- flood (return to base-flow) stages. Three distinct series of experimental laboratory runs were conducted to systematically investigate the effect of three characteristics of unsteady flow event hydrographs: the magnitude, duration and hydrograph shape (i. e., time-to-peak flow) of the unsteady flow event. Bed morphological adjustments, <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> and {{the composition of the}} <b>sediment</b> in <b>transport</b> were measured throughout all stages of the experimental runs.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{sediment}} exchange between channels and flats in tidal inlets. This topic {{is part of a}} research scheme which must yield more insight into the dynamic equilibrium of tidal inlets. An important aspect of the sediment exchange is the drying and flooding of the flats during the tide. The oscillating water level gives rise to velocity variations which cause stirring and settling of sediment. In nature, tidal inlets are large and complex systems, the dimensions of which vary continuously due to natural effects (tide, storms, sea level rise). For {{the purpose of this study}} a schematised tidal inlet is considered, with dimensions as occurring in the Dutch Wadden Sea. In this schematisation, the bottom ofthe channel and the tidal flats is fixed. The schematisation is used as a starting point to model the water and sediment motion during a few tidal cycles. Subsequently the output of each model run, i. e. velocities, water depths and concentrations, is used to estimate the <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> during ebb and flood, respectively. The transport is calculated in points along a line perpendicular to the channel axis. Model runs are executed in one and two dimensions. <b>Sediment</b> <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> according to power law formula (l-D and 2 -D cases) and according to a suspended sediment equation (l-D cases only) are compared. The suspended sediment fluxes at the flat agree well with the <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> determined by the power law formula. In some of the I-D runs, it appears that problems occur around the transition from the flat to the channel. Very large values of the <b>transport</b> <b>rate,</b> much larger than those in the adjacent cells, result from a thin water film with relatively high velocities. Therefore, the <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> model is provided with a water depth threshold preventing this. The threshold hardly influences the <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> during flood, either suspended or by power law, because the front of the wave is rather steep. The <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> during ebb, however, for which the threshold was meant, are reduced, such that the <b>transport</b> <b>rate</b> approaches the values in the surrounding points.

Under the framework of the European Large Installation Plan, to achieve high quality and high resolution data on hydrodynamics and <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> dynamics on a natural 2 DV beach under equilibrium, erosive and accretive conditions, a programme of detailed measurements of hydrodynamics and <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> in the surf zone has been carried out in DELFT HYDRAULICS' Delta Flume in the period from April to June 1993 (DELFT HYDRAULICS 1994). Hence a set of new data about beach evolution and acting velocity moments has become available. The objectives of the present study are: (1) to derive the measured crossshore <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> from the profile measurements, (2) to predict cross-shore <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> from measured velocity moments by using several existing mathematical models, (3) to compare the results between measured and computed data and [if (3) yields a poor comparison] (4) to propose a modified model. This report is a summary of the work. The report includes profile analysis, the derivation of measured <b>transport</b> <b>rates,</b> the computations of cross-shore <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> by three selected prediction models and the comparison between measured data and computed results as well as the calibration and verification of the proposed model.
