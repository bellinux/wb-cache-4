50|$|In 2008 he {{attended}} the 2008 Summer Olympics as part of Great Britain's Olympic Ambition Programme to expose possible future Olympians to the Olympic experience. He began being coached by Ahmad Mohammad Hasher Al Maktoum, {{who is a member}} of the ruling family of Dubai and the 2004 Summer Olympics gold medallist in the double trap. Following budget cuts by UK Sport following the lack of shooting medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Wilson's funding was removed completely and he was required to fund his <b>shooting</b> <b>expenses</b> which amount to nearly £10,000 a year. He tried to work in a pub as a barman, but found that the night shifts conflicted with his shooting practice. His parents instead funded him for a year while he tried to secure further funding. He has also raised funds, along with the rest of the British shooting team, by running fundraising events.|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} {{designed}} to determine the impact that Texas 4 -H shooting sports has on its youth and the State of Texas using research from a study done 1991 and another study done in 2002. The purpose of these two studies was to analyze the amount of life skills gained by youth through their involvement in the Texas 4 -H shooting sports program, {{to see how much}} parents are willing to spend to have their children participate in this program, and also to evaluate if the state of Texas incurs some economic gain due to the amount of money spent by parents. This study uses existing data from two surveys that were completed in 1991 and 2002 at Texas 4 -H shooting sports state competition(s). The target population for both of the surveys consisted of youth participants and parents. These two surveys are the same in their attitudinal structure, but are different because the 2002 survey also includes cost analyses. The major findings were as follows: 1.) Involvement in the Texas 4 -H shooting sports program does {{have a positive impact on}} the life skills gained by youth. 2.) Money being spent on youth by their parents to be a part of the Texas 4 -H shooting program helps the state of Texas incur some economic gain due to travel and <b>shooting</b> <b>expenses</b> being made in the state 3.) Youth representing Texas shooting sports are also having a national impact due to the amount of money they are spending traveling and shooting in other cities. 4.) Youth representing Texas shooting sports are having a competitive shooting impact not only in Texas, but on the nation as well. 5.) Youth involved in the 4 -H shooting program are spending more quality time with family members and practicing more with supervised instruction. 6.) The state of Texas is spending close to $ 55, 000 per year to keep one juvenile delinquent housed in a correctional facility when it cost $ 4, 000 a year to participate in 4 -H shooting sports...|$|E

60|$|The whole {{field of}} dynamic and effectual {{consciousness}} is always pre-mental, non-mental. Not {{even the most}} knowing man that ever lived would know how he would be feeling next week; whether some new and utterly shattering impulse would have arisen in him and laid his nicely-conceived self in ruins. It is the impulse {{we have to live}} by, not the ideals or the idea. But we have to know ourselves pretty thoroughly before we can break the automatism of ideals and conventions. The savage in a state of nature {{is one of the most}} conventional of creatures. So is a child. Only through fine delicate knowledge can we recognize and release our impulses. Now our whole aim has been to force each individual to a maximum of mental control, and mental consciousness. Our poor little plans of children are put into horrible forcing-beds, called schools, and the young idea is there forced to shoot. It shoots, poor thing, like a potato in a warm cellar. One mass of pallid sickly ideas and ideals. And no root, no life. The ideas shoot, hard enough, in our sad offspring, but they <b>shoot</b> at the <b>expense</b> of life itself. Never was such a mistake. Mental consciousness is a purely individual affair. Some men are born to be highly and delicately conscious. But for the vast majority, much mental consciousness is simply a catastrophe, a blight. It just stops their living.|$|R
40|$|Resolving the {{physiological}} {{mechanisms by which}} rhizobacteria enhance plant growth is difficult, since many such bacteria contain multiple plant growth-promoting properties. To understand further how the 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC) deaminase (ACCd) -containing rhizobacterium Variovorax paradoxus 5 C- 2 affects plant growth, the flows and partitioning of mineral nutrients and abscisic acid (ABA) and ABA metabolism were studied in pea (Pisum sativum) plants following rhizosphere bacterial inoculation. Although root architecture was not affected, inoculation increased root and shoot biomass, and stomatal conductance, by 20, 15, and 24 %, respectively, and increased N, P, K, Ca, and Mg uptake by 16, 81, 50, 46, and 58 %, respectively. P deposition in inoculated plant roots was 4. 9 times higher than that in uninoculated controls. Rhizobacterial inoculation increased root to shoot xylem flows and shoot to root phloem flows of K by 1. 8 - and 2. 1 -fold, respectively. In control plants, major sinks for K deposition were the roots and upper shoot (43 % and 49 % of total uptake, respectively), while rhizobacterial inoculation increased K distribution to the lower <b>shoot</b> at the <b>expense</b> of other compartments (xylem, phloem, and upper shoot). Despite being unable to metabolize ABA in vitro, V. paradoxus 5 C- 2 decreased root ABA concentrations and accumulation by 40 – 60 %. Although inoculation decreased xylem ABA flows, phloem ABA flows increased. Whether bacterial ACCd attenuates root to shoot ABA signalling requires further investigation, since ABA is critical to maintain growth of droughted plants, and ACCd-containing organisms have been advocated {{as a means of}} minimizing growth inhibition of plants in drying soil...|$|R
