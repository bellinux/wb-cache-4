40|$|In {{contrast}} to lentiviral infections {{of humans and}} macaques, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection of natural hosts is nonpathogenic despite high levels of viral replication. However, the mechanisms underlying this absence of disease are unknown. Here we report that natural hosts for SIV infection express remarkably low levels of CCR 5 on CD 4 + T cells isolated from blood, lymph nodes, and mucosal tissues. Given that this immunologic feature is found in 5 different species of natural SIV hosts (sooty mangabeys, African green <b>monkeys,</b> mandrills, <b>sun-tailed</b> <b>monkeys,</b> and chimpanzees) but is absent in 5 nonnatural/recent hosts (humans, rhesus, pigtail, cynomolgus macaques, and baboons), it may represent a key feature of the coevolution between the virus and its natural hosts {{that led to a}} nonpathogenic infection. Beneficial effects of low CCR 5 expression on CD 4 + T cells may include the reduction of target cells for viral replication and a decreased homing of activated CD 4 + T cells to inflamed tissue...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSimian {{immunodeficiency}} viruses (SIVs) {{are found}} in an extensive number of African primates, and humans continue {{to be exposed to}} these viruses by hunting and handling of primate bushmeat. The purpose of our study was to examine to what extent Piliocolobus badius subspecies are infected with SIV in order to better characterize SIVwrc in general and to gain further insight into the impact of geographic barriers and subspeciation on the evolution of SIVwrc. We analysed sixteen faecal samples and two tissue samples of the P. b. temminckii subspecies collected in the Abuko Nature Reserve (The Gambia, West Africa). SIV infection could only be identified in one tissue sample, and phylogenetic tree analyses of partial pol and env sequences showed that the new SIVwrcPbt virus is closely related to SIVwrcPbb strains from P. b. badius in the Taï forest (Côte d'Ivoire), thus suggesting that geographically separated subspecies are infected with a closely related virus. Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the full-length genome sequence confirmed that SIVwrcPbt is a species-specific SIV lineage, although it is distantly related to the SIVlho and SIVsun lineages across its entire genome. Characterization of additional SIVwrc viruses is needed to understand the ancestral phylogenetic relation to SIVs from l'Hoest and <b>sun-tailed</b> <b>monkeys</b> and whether recombination occurred between ancestors of the SIVwrc and SIVlho/sun lineages...|$|R

40|$|Two novel simian {{immunodeficiency}} virus (SIV) strains from wild-caught red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus torquatus) from Nigeria were characterized. Sequence {{analysis of the}} fully sequenced SIV strain rcmNG 411 (SIVrcmNG 411) and gag and pol sequence of SIVrcmNG 409 revealed that they were genetically most {{closely related to the}} recently characterized SIVrcm from Gabon (SIVrcmGB 1). Thus, red-capped mangabeys from distant geographic locations harbor a common lineage of SIV. SIVrcmNG 411 carried a vpx gene in addition to vpr, suggesting a common evolutionary ancestor with SIVsm (from sooty mangabeys). However, SIVrcm was only marginally closer to SIVsm in that region than to any of the other lentiviruses. SIVrcm showed the highest similarity in pol with SIVdrl, isolated from a drill, a primate that is phylogenetically distinct from mangabey monkeys, and clustered with other primate lentiviruses (primarily SIVcpz [from chimpanzees] and SIVagmSab [from African green monkeys]) discordantly in different regions of the genome, suggesting a history of recombination. Despite the genetic relationship to SIVcpz in the pol gene, SIVrcmNG 411 did not replicate in chimpanzee peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), although two other viruses unrelated to SIVcpz, SIVmndGB 1 (from mandrills) and SIVlhoest (from L'Hoest monkeys), were able to grow in chimpanzee PBMC. The CCR 5 24 -bp deletion previously described in red-capped mangabeys from Gabon was also observed in Nigerian red-capped mangabeys, and SIVrcmNG 411, like SIVrcmGB 1, used CCR 2 B and STRL 33 as coreceptors for virus entry. SIVrcm, SIVsm, SIVmndGB 1, and all four SIVlhoest isolates but not SIVsun (from <b>sun-tailed</b> <b>monkeys)</b> replicated efficiently in human PBMC, suggesting that the ability to infect the human host can vary within one lineage...|$|R

50|$|The kipunji was {{independently}} {{discovered by}} {{researchers from the}} Wildlife Conservation Society, the University of Georgia and Conservation International, in December 2003 and July 2004, making it the first new African monkey species discovered since the <b>sun-tailed</b> <b>monkey</b> in 1984.

Here, we report the full-length molecular characterization {{of a second}} SIVsun virus (SIVsunK 08) naturally infecting a wild-caught <b>sun-tailed</b> <b>monkey.</b> The SIVsunK 08 strain was most closely related to SIVsunL 14 and clustered {{with members of the}} SIVmnd- 1 /SIVlhoest group.

40|$|WOS: 000081964700069 International audienceRecently we {{reported}} {{the characterization of}} simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVlhoest) from a central African l'hoest monkey (Cercopithecus lhoesti lhoesti) that revealed a distant relationship to SIV isolated from a mandrill (SIVmnd). The present report describes a novel SIV (SIVsun) isolated from a healthy, wild-caught <b>sun-tailed</b> <b>monkey</b> (Cercopithecus lhoesti solatus), {{another member of the}} l'hoest superspecies. SIVsun replicated in a variety of human T-cell lines and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of macaques (Macaca spp.) and patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas). A full-length infectious clone of SIVsun was derived, and genetic analysis revealed that SIVsun was most closely related to SIVlhoest, with an amino acid identity of 71 % in Gag, 73 % in Pol, and 67 % in Env. This degree of similarity is reminiscent of that observed between SIVagm isolates from vervet, grivet, and tantalus species of African green monkeys. The close relationship between SIVsun and SIVlhoest, despite their geographically distinct habitats, is consistent with evolution from a common ancestor, providing further evidence for the ancient nature of the primate lentivirus family. In addition, this observation leads us to suggest that the SIVmnd lineage should be designated the SIVlhoest lineage...|$|E
