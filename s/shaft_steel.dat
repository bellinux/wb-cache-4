50|$|A {{torsion spring}} {{counterbalance}} system consists {{of one or}} two tightly wound up springs on a steel shaft with cable drums at both ends. The entire apparatus mounts on the header wall above the garage door and has three supports: a center bearing plate with a steel or nylon bearing and two end bearing plates at both ends. The springs themselves consist of the steel wire with a stationary cone at one end and a winding cone at the other end. The stationary cone is attached to the center bearing plate. The winding cone consists of holes every 90 degrees for winding the springs and two set screws to secure the springs to the <b>shaft.</b> <b>Steel</b> counterbalance cables run from the roller brackets at the bottom corners of the door to a notch in the cable drums. When the door is raised, the springs unwind and the stored tension lifts the door by turning the shaft, thus turning the cable drums, wrapping the cables around the grooves on the cable drums. When the door is lowered, the cables unwrap from the drums and the springs are rewound to full tension.|$|E

This {{article is}} studied a coal mine waste rock mine <b>shaft</b> <b>steel</b> {{headframe}} {{which is used}} more than 20 years and the need of the headframe process transformation. The main components of steel headframe (for example: headframe column, beams and bracing) is sampling inspected the geometry and weld size. At last, SAP 2000 is used by analyzing the steel headframe the former and after transformation {{on the basis of}} the on-site detection. Field testing and theoretical analysis showed that: the main steel headframe and the envelope structure is largely intact and the only part of the rod local area is a certain degree of corrosion, the connected nodes are basically in line with the requirements of the original design; The steel headframe structure which has transformed and components meet the requirements of national norms. The Identification and reinforcement of the project, will provide a reference for future similar projects. The Steel headframe frame structure in recent years has been widely used in various coal mines because of light weight, stiffness, good seismic performance, on-site installation, construction is convenient advantages. In the process of its development and application, in view of a variety of factors, such as design, construction, supervision, the structures often is put into use before and after congenital defects, causing structural reliability decreases.

40|$|The U 1 H Shaft Project is {{a design}} build {{subcontract}} {{to supply the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) a 1, 045 ft. deep, 20 ft. diameter, concrete lined shaft for unspecified purposes. The subcontract awarded to Atkinson Construction by Bechtel Nevada to design and construct the shaft for the DOE has been split into phases with portions of the work being released as dictated by available funding. The first portion released included the design for the shaft, permanent hoist, headframe, and collar arrangement. The second release consisted of constructing the shaft collar {{to a depth of}} 110 ft., the service entry, utility trenches, and installation of the temporary sinking plant. The temporary sinking plant included the installation of the sinking headframe, the sinking hoist, two deck winches, the shaft form, the sinking work deck, and temporary utilities required to sink the shaft. Both the design and collar construction were completed on schedule. The third release consisted of excavating and lining the shaft to the station depth of approximately 950 feet. Work is currently proceeding on this production sinking phase. At a depth of approximately 600 feet, Atkinson has surpassed production expectation and is more than 3 months ahead of schedule. Atkinson has employed the use of a Bobcat 331 excavator as the primary means of excavation. the shaft is being excavated entirely in an alluvial deposit with varying degrees of calcium carbonate cementation. Several more work packages are expected to be released in the near future. The remaining work packages include, construction of the shaft station a depth of 975 ft. and construction of the shaft sump to a depth of 1, 045 ft., installation of the loading pocket and station steel and equipment, installation of the <b>shaft</b> <b>steel</b> and guides, installation of the shaft utilities, and installation of the permanent headframe, hoist, collar utilities, and facilities...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the crucial}} steps in the shaft design process is the optimal {{selection}} of the material. Two types of <b>shaft</b> <b>steels</b> with improved corrosion resistances, 1. 4305 and 1. 7225, were investigated experimentally and numerically in this paper {{in order to determine}} some of the material characteristics important for material selection in the engineering design process. Ultimate tensile strength and yield strength have been experimentally obtained, proving that steel 1. 4305 has higher values of both. In addition, J-integral is numerically determined as a measure of crack driving force for finite element models of standardized fracture specimens (single-edge notched bend and disc compact tension). Obtained J values are plotted versus specimen crack growth size (Δa) for different specimen geometries (a/W). Higher resulting values of J-integral for steel 1. 4305 as opposed to 1. 7225 can be noted. Results can be useful as a fracture parameter in fracture toughness assessment, although this procedure differs from experimental analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Residual {{stresses}} play a {{key role}} in thermo-mechanically coupled forming processes for industrial mass production. They are an unavoidable consequence of the alternating inhomogeneous fields of temperature and mechanical stress developing in tools and components dependent on the process parameters applied. Because of their influence on the behavior of the components produced, a great interest exists to get reliable information about origin and distribution of the relevant residual stress fields and to understand the basic principles of their formation. In this paper the development of residual stress in tools (steel AISI H 11) used for the thermo-mechanical forming operation of cylindrical flange <b>shafts</b> (<b>steel</b> SAE 6150) is outlined. The loading situation of the tool is simulated by thermal fatigue tests, providing information about cyclic stress and plastic deformation during the manufacturing process. Furthermore the residual stress states of the flange shafts manufactured are presented and discussed. Chip forming manufacturing operations are challenging tasks and tensile residual stresses can be avoided using adapted process parameters...|$|R
