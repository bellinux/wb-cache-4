40|$|We report {{experimental}} results validating {{the concept that}} plasma confinement is enhanced in a magnetic <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> when beta (plasma pressure/magnetic field pressure) is order of unity. This enhancement is required for a fusion power reactor based on cusp confinement to be feasible. The magnetic <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> possesses a critical advantage: the plasma is stable to large scale perturbations. However, early work indicated that plasma loss rates in a reactor based on a <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> were too large for net power production. Grad and others theorized that at high beta a sharp boundary would form between the plasma and the magnetic field, leading to substantially smaller loss rates. The current experiment validates this theoretical conjecture {{for the first time}} and represents critical progress toward the Polywell fusion concept which combines a high beta <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> with an electrostatic fusion for a compact, economical, power-producing nuclear fusion reactor.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the solar wind and the earth's vacuum dipole field leads {{to the formation of}} a discontinuity called the magnetopause. In the standard picture, the magnetopause confines the magnetic field in such a manner that the polar cusp field lines originate from high latitudes in the dayside ionosphere and end at the two magnetic neutral points. Wu (1983, 1984) has questioned this standard picture of the polar cusp. MHD simulations indicate the existence of a current sheet above the polar cusp region, called 'the cusp current sheet' by Wu. Wu (1983) concluded that the difference between his <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> and the standard picture {{is due to the fact}} that his geometry results from a plasma model, whereas the standard picture is based on a vacuum concept.

40|$|We {{study the}} strong {{gravitational}} lens statistics of triaxial {{cold dark matter}} (CDM) halos occupied by central early-type galaxies. We calculate the image separation distribution for double, <b>cusp</b> and quad <b>configurations.</b> The ratios of image multiplicities at large separations {{are consistent with the}} triaxial NFW model, and at small separations are consistent with the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model. At all separations, the total lensing probability is enhanced by adiabatic contraction. If no adiabatic contraction is assumed, naked <b>cusp</b> <b>configurations</b> become dominant at approximately 2. 5 '', which is inconsistent with the data. We also show that at small-to-moderate separations, the image multiplicities depend sensitively on the alignment of the shapes of the luminous and dark matter projected density profiles. In constrast to other properties that affect these ratios, the degree of alignment does not {{have a significant effect on}} the total lensing probability. These correlations may therefore be constrained by comparing the theoretical image separation distribution to a sufficiently large lens sample from future wide and deep sky surveys such as Pan-Starrs, LSST and JDEM. Understanding the correlations in the shapes of galaxies and their dark matter halo is important for future weak lensing surveys. Comment: 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

The viscoelastic effects are introduced by the constitutive equation based on the Maxwell model, which has a spring and a dashpot connected with each other in series. The method is applied to simulations of a drop under shear flow in viscoelastic fluids and of a bubble rising in viscoelastic fluids. In the simulation of drop deformation under shear flows, the effects of viscoelasticity on the deformation and orientation angle are evaluated.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{two-dimensional}} global scale magnetic field structure {{for a system}} of two merging cylindrical plasmas in a steady state. In the limit of very large magnetic Reynolds numbers the reconnection process is slow, and the plasma almost everywhere finds itself in magnetostatic equilibrium. We show that under certain conditions the classical Syrovatskii-type Y-point configuration, with surface current concentrated only in the reconnection layer, is not possible. Instead, a <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> is formed, with finite surface current in the separatrix. The equilibrium condition, together with constraints on the volume per flux, enables us to determine {{the shape of the}} separatrix and the magnetic field {{in the vicinity of the}} cusp point.

The plasma generator contains no internal structures, and is thus inherently simple in construction and operation and inherently durable. The generator was operated with two different magnetic geometries. One used the rare-earth magnets arranged in an axial line <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration,</b> which directly showed plasma production taking place near the walls of the generator where the electron temperature was highest but with the plasma density peaking in the central low B-field regions.

40|$|Primate molar shapes reflect {{developmental}} and ecological processes. Development may constrain {{as well as}} facilitate evolution of new tooth shapes, affecting how reliable dental characters are in phylogenetic studies. Much of the genetic machinery of development uses the same genes among different organs, including teeth, limbs, and feathers. Furthermore, within a tooth, the development of individual cusps repeatedly uses {{the same set of}} developmental genes, forming a "developmental module. " The repeated activation of the developmental module can explain the cumulative variation in later-developing cusps. Therefore short, later-developing cusps may be evolvable but also more homoplastic. This patterning cascade mode of cusp development can be used to explain the variational properties of dental characters and character states related to cusp initiation. The developmental basis and variational properties of crown termination, cusp shape, and <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> characters are currently less well understood. It is unlikely that there is a simple "gene to phenotype" map for dental characters.

Loss fluxes to various surfaces were determined by measuring the currents to foils attached to or imbedded in the surface. Data were obtained for several sets of discharge voltages and currents. The loss currents were determined from current vs voltage characteristics observed on a transistor curve tracer oscilloscope. Both ion and electron currents were measured to {{all parts of the}} walls and to all parts of the cathode assembly using collecting plates. These measurement were also made for various parameter sets. In line <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> the plasma density is essentially as predicted by existing calculations.

Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the WHT confirm the multiple objects are quasars at redshift z_q= 3. 34.

40|$|Follow-up of a {{group of}} {{subjects}} in whom an aortic ejection sound was the only abnormal finding revealed a bicuspid aortic valve at necropsy or operation in 6 cases. High speed echophonocardiographic studies in 15 subjects with aortic stenosis and known to have bicuspid valves, showed the ejection sound to be exactly synchronous with final halting of the opening aortic valve cusps. Echocardiographic visualisation of the aortic valve from the apex, looking up the left ventricular outflow tract, showed valve echoes during systole indicating abnormal <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration.</b> This proved a more sensitive indicator of a bicuspid aortic valve than the finding of an eccentric aortic valve closure line. These findings were used to evaluate 37 subjects with the auscultatory finding of an isolated aortic ejection sound and the diagnosis of a non-stenotic bicuspid aortic valve was confirmed in 30. The usual cause of misdiagnosis was a sound associated with late tricuspid valve closure. The auscultatory finding of an aortic ejection sound, in the absence of other signs of aortic stenosis, indicates a non-stenotic, bicuspid aortic valve. Confirmation of aortic valvar origin of the sound can be provided by a simultaneous echophonocardiogram...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{statistics}} of large-separation gravitational lens systems produced by non-spherical halos in the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model. Specifically, we {{examine how the}} triaxiality of CDM halos affects the overall lensing probabilities and the relative numbers of different image configurations (double, quadruple, and naked cusp lenses). We find that triaxiality significantly enhances lensing probabilities {{by a factor of}} ∼ 2 – 4, so it cannot be ignored. If CDM halos have central density slopes α � 1. 5, we predict that a significant fraction (� 20 %) of large-separation lenses should have naked cusp image configurations; this contrasts with lensing by isothermal (α ≈ 2) galaxies where naked <b>cusp</b> <b>configurations</b> are rare. The image multiplicities depend strongly on the inner density slope α: for α = 1, the naked cusp fraction is � 60 %; while for α = 1. 5, quadruple lenses are actually the most probable. Thus, the image multiplicities in large-separation lenses offer a simple new probe of the inner density profiles of dark matter halos. We also compute the expected probabilities and image multiplicities for lensed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and argue that the recent discovery of the large-separation quadruple lens SDSS J 1004 + 4112 is consistent with expectations for CDM...|$|R
40|$|Gravitational lensing {{provides}} {{a unique and}} powerful probe of the mass distributions of distant galaxies. Four-image lens systems with fold and <b>cusp</b> <b>configurations</b> {{have two or three}} bright images near a critical point. Within the framework of singularity theory, we derive analytic relations that are satisfied for a light source that lies a small but finite distance from the astroid caustic of a four-image lens. Using a perturbative expansion of the image positions, we show that the time delay between the close pair of images in a fold lens scales with the cube of the image separation, with a constant of proportionality that depends on a particular third derivative of the lens potential. We also apply our formalism to cusp lenses, where we develop perturbative expressions for the image positions, magnifications and time delays of the images in a cusp triplet. Some of these results were derived previously for a source asymptotically close to a cusp point, but using a simplified form of the lens equation whose validity may be in doubt for sources that lie at astrophysically relevant distances from the caustic. Along with the work of Keeton et al. (2005), this paper demonstrates that perturbation theory {{plays an important role in}} theoretical lensing studies.

40|$|Consideration of ion {{transport}} in high density, low pressure plasma systems {{is important for}} meeting process requirements in the manufacturing of ultra-large-scale integrated circuits. The ion energy and angular distributions at {{the boundary between the}} plasma and the wafer, the sheath, influence etching selectivity, linewidth control, plasma-induced damage, and microscopic etching uniformity. These distributions, in turn, are easily altered by changing the magnetic field profile and/or the neutral gas pressure. Using Doppler-shifted laser-induced fluorescence, metastable ion velocity distribution functions in helicon-wave-excited Ar plasmas are measured. Two magnetic field configurations are examined. For a magnetic "mirror," where the field exhibits a maximum and a saddle point in the source, the plasma is observed to be asymmetric and nonuniform: this leads to broadened velocity distributions and significant ion drift from one region of the plasma to another. As the pressure is increased in the mirror field configuration, the transverse ion "temperature" exhibits a maximum as a function of pressure and, when etching is ion-flux limited, either decreasing or increasing the pressure should result in improved linewidth control. The plasma is more symmetric when the magnetic field is reversed in the source and again downstream. With this double <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration,</b> the transverse ion temperature decreases monotonically with pressure, and improved linewidth control in the ion-flux limit would be obtained by operating at higher pressure...|$|R
40|$|Warm Dark Matter (WDM) {{has been}} invoked to resolve {{apparent}} conflicts of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) models with observations on subgalactic scales. In this work we provide {{a new and}} independent lower limit for the WDM particle mass (e. g. sterile neutrino) through the analysis of image fluxes in gravitational lensed QSO. Starting from a theoretical unperturbed <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> we analyze the effects of intergalactic haloes (haloes {{along the line of}} sight) in modifying the fluxes of QSO multiple images, giving rise to the so-called anomalous flux ratio. We found that the global effect of such haloes strongly depends on their mass/abundance ratio and it is maximum for haloes in the mass range 10 6 − 10 8 M⊙. This result opens a new possibility to constrain the CDM predictions on small scales and test different warm candidates, since free streaming of warm dark matter particles can dampen considerably the matter power spectrum in this mass range. As a consequence while a (Λ) CDM model is able to produce flux anomalies at a level similar to those that are observed, a WDM model, with a too light particle, fails in reproducing the observational evidences. We found a lower limit mν> 10 keV for the mass of warm dark matter candidates {{in the form of a}} sterile neutrino, in good agreement with previous results coming from Lyman-α forest and Cosmic Microwave Background analysis.

40|$|ObjectiveAortic valve repair is a {{more recent}} {{approach}} {{for the treatment of}} aortic regurgitation. Limited data exist for reconstruction in specific pathologies with isolated cusp pathology. We analyzed the results of aortic valve repair in patients with aortic regurgitation caused by myxomatous cusp prolapse in the presence of tricuspid valve anatomy and normal root size. MethodsOver a 12 -year period, 111 patients underwent aortic valve reconstruction for regurgitant tricuspid aortic valves without concomitant root dilatation. Cusp prolapse was caused by myxomatous degeneration in 72 subjects (group I) and associated with fenestrations in 39 subjects (group II). Prolapse was corrected by means of plication of the free margin in the presence of normal cusp tissue only (n = 62) or combined with triangular resection of cusp tissue (n = 10). It was treated with additional closure of the fenestration with autologous pericardium in 39 instances (group II). Follow-up was complete in 98. 5 % (cumulative 385 years). ResultsHospital mortality was 1. 8 %, and during follow-up, there was 1 thromboembolic event and no endocarditis. Freedom from reoperation at 5 and 8 years was 96 %. ConclusionsIsolated cusp prolapse is a relevant cause of aortic regurgitation in tricuspid aortic valves without concomitant root dilatation. In myxomatous stretching of cusp tissue, plication of the free margin suffices to restore cusp geometry and aortic valve function. In the presence of fenestrations, reconstruction of normal <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> can be achieved by means of closure of the fenestration with a pericardial patch.

MethodsA total of 115 consecutive patients with bicuspid aortic valve disease underwent surgery of the ascending aorta. We classified the <b>cusp</b> <b>configuration</b> by 3 types: fusion of left coronary and right coronary cusps (type A), fusion of right coronary and noncoronary cusps (type B), and fusion of left coronary and noncoronary cusps (type C). Histopathologic changes in the ascending aortic wall were graded (aortic wall score). ResultsWe observed type A fusion in 85 patients (73. 9 %), type B fusion in 28 patients (24. 3 %), and type C fusion in 2 patients (1. 8 %). Patients with type A fusion were younger at operation than patients with type B fusion (51. 3 ± 15. 5 years vs 58. 7 ± 7. 6 years, respectively; P =. 034). The mean ascending aorta diameter was 48. 9 ± 5. 0 mm and 48. 7 ± 5. 7 mm in type A and type B fusion groups, respectively (P =. 34). The mean aortic root diameter was significantly larger in type A fusion (4. 9 ± 6. 7 mm vs 32. 7 ± 2. 8 mm; P <. 0001). The aortic wall score was significantly higher in type A fusion than in type B fusion (P =. 02). The prevalence of aortic wall histopathologic changes was significantly higher in type A fusion. Moreover, there were no statistically significant differences between type A and type B fusion in terms of prevalence of bicuspid aortic valve stenosis, regurgitation, or mixed disease.

40|$|When {{the source}} in a 4 -image {{gravitational}} lens lies {{close to a}} "fold" caustic, two of the lensed images lie close together. If the lens potential is smooth {{on the scale of}} the separation between the two close images, then the difference between their fluxes should approximately vanish, Rfold = (F 1 -F 2) /(F 1 +F 2) ≈ 0. Violations of this "fold relation" in observed lenses are thought to indicate the presence of structure on scales smaller than the separation between the close images. We study the fold relation and find it to be more subtle and rich than was previously realized. The degree to which Rfold can differ from zero for realistic smooth lenses depends not only on the distance of the source from the caustic, but also on its location along the caustic, and on the angular structure of the lens potential. Thus, it is impossible to say from Rfold alone whether observed flux ratios are anomalous or not. Instead, we must consider the full distribution of Rfold values that can be obtained from smooth potentials that reproduce the separation between the two close images and the distance to the next nearest image. We analyze the generic and specific features of this distribution, and then show that 5 of the 12 known lenses with fold configurations have flux ratio anomalies: B 0712 + 472, SDSS 0924 + 0219, PG 1115 + 080, B 1555 + 375, and B 1933 + 503. Combining this with our previous analysis revealing anomalies in 3 of the 4 known lenses with <b>cusp</b> <b>configurations,</b> we conclude that at least half (8 / 16) of all 4 -image lenses that admit generic, local analyses exhibit flux ratio anomalies indicative of small-scale structure.

Factors influencing late recurrence of aortic valve regurgitation grade II or greater (n =  45) or need for reoperation on the aortic valve (n =  25) were analyzed. ResultsEarly mortality was 2. 8 % (1. 9 % for elective cases), and actuarial survival at 10 years was 83. 5 % ± 2. 4 %. Ten-year freedom from aortic valve regurgitation grade II or greater was 85. 0 % ± 2. 5 %. Preoperative aortoventricular junction diameter greater than 28 mm and postoperative effective height of the aortic cusp less than 9 mm were identified as significant predictors for late aortic valve regurgitation grade II or greater in multivariate analysis (both P < . 001). Ten-year freedom from reoperation on the aortic valve was 89. 3 % ± 2. 5 %. Preoperative aortoventricular junction diameter greater than 28 mm (P < . 001), use of pericardial patch (P = . 022), and effective height of the aortic cusp less than 9 mm (P = . 049) were identified as significant predictors for reoperation in multivariate analysis.

Using test particle simulations, we show that the electric field induced by the compression of the frontside magnetosphere {{may be responsible for}} prominent energization of plasma sheet ions as well as trapping at high latitudes. We demonstrate that, due to the short-lived character of the magnetic field line reconfiguration (on the time scale of a few minutes), the particle magnetic moment (first adiabatic invariant) may not be conserved during such events. Ions that are initially bouncing from one hemisphere to the other are found to experience nonadiabatic energization up to the hundred of keV range while being injected into the outer cusp. Such injections involve particles from limited portions of the dayside flux tubes.

First, an FTE is observed at TC- 1 and not at Cluster; we discuss the implications this has on the evolution of FTEs and {{on the size of the}} reconnection site. Then, a structure observed at both spacecraft is interpreted as a bulge progressing along the magnetopause. It is not clear whether this bulge is actually the remnant of an FTE or a running pulse that makes Cluster sense the reconnection layer. In any case, a rotational discontinuity is observed within it. At last, a northward turning of the magnetosheath magnetic field is observed at TC- 1 and a reverse FTE is subsequently seen at Cluster, suggesting that magnetic reconnection is very fast to set up following a change in the IMF orientation...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{thruster}} discharges exhibit impressive {{performance at}} conventional scales (~ 30 cm in diameter); however, scaling to smaller sizes (~ 3 cm) presents considerable challenges. This research effort addresses the miniaturization of direct current (DC) discharges via {{a series of}} careful investigations (i. e., near-field cusp-confinement, discharge experiments, computational efforts, and theoretical analyses). These investigations provided insight into the plasma behavior and loss mechanisms within small-scale DC discharges. This insight was then used to develop and demonstrate a highly efficient miniature-scale DC ion source called the Axial Ring-Cusp Hybrid (ARCH) discharge. Implemented as a 3 cm ion thruster, it can potentially achieve a discharge loss of 160 eV/ion and mass utilization efficiencies of 0. 89 — performance values that have previously only been attainable by conventional-scale discharges (> 10 cm). The improve performance will greatly expand the mission capabilities of many future spacecraft missions by providing the high efficiency of ion thrusters at small powers and scales. This thesis describes 3 efforts that were undertaken to better understand cusp-confinement physics and miniature DC discharge behavior. Since small-scale DC discharges are limited by their ability to effectively utilize the high-energy primary electrons, the first effort began with experiments utilizing an electron flood gun to investigate the loss behavior of magnetically-confined primary electrons. It was found that increasing {{the complexity of the}} upstream field affected the spatial complexity of the loss area. These efforts showed that, in contrast to existing theory, the primary electron loss can be strongly influenced by the upstream magnetic fields. This behavior is particularly important and noticeable for miniature-scale discharges where small perturbations of the primary electron’s gyro-center are preserved from one cusp to the next. The second effort was then used to investigate the overall confinement behavior of a cusp discharge, to baseline the probing techniques for magnetized plasma discharges, and to validate computational models. It was found that the plasma electron temperature and primary electron density must be analyzed via the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) data. The interpreted primary electron density showed good quantitative agreement with computational simulations. The final effort was to investigate and improve the discharge efficiency of miniature-scale DC ion thruster discharges. The plasma parameter maps for several magnetic field and discharge conditions were analyzed in conjunction with estimated performance measurements. For the 3 cm Miniature Xenon Ion (MiXI) thruster, the detail discharge maps revealed the mechanisms responsible for the MiXI’s flat beam profile and high discharge loss. Analyses of the ionization rates confirm previous computational findings that the plasma within the original MiXI design is created almost entirely by direct primary electron ionization of the xenon gas. Multiple ring <b>cusp</b> <b>configurations</b> (i. e., 3 -ring, 4 -ring, and 5 -ring) were also examined. These efforts revealed that a major redesign is necessary to avoid some of the inherent limitations of ring-cusp discharges at the miniature scale. Ultimately, a new discharge design called the ARCH discharge was developed. Performance data and discharge maps show that this approach provides high primary electron confinement, high plasma electron density, high plasma uniformity along the extraction plane, and discharge performance that may rival well-designed conventionally-sized ion thrusters...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study performed {{to determine the}} effects of hollow cathode position, anode position, and ring <b>cusp</b> magnetic field <b>configuration</b> and strength on discharge chamber performance is described. The results are presented in terms of comparative plasma ion energy cost, extracted ion fraction, and beam profile data. Results show that the rate of primary electron loss to the anode decreases as the anode is moved downstream of the ring cusp toward the screen grid and that the loss rate of ions to hollow cathode surfaces are excessive if the cathode is located upstream of a point of peak magnetic flux density at the discharge chamber centerline. Moreover, the fraction of the ions produced that are lost to discharge chamber walls and ring magnet surfaces is reduced by positioning of the magnet rings so the plasma density is uniform over the grid surface, and adjusting their strength to a level where it is sufficient to prevent excessive ion losses by Bohm diffusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a program to {{experimentally}} develop two new types of plasma generators for 30 cm electrostatic argon ion thrusters are presented. The two plasma generating methods selected {{for this study were}} by radio frequency induction (RFI), operating at an input power frequency of 1 MHz, and by electron cyclotron heating (ECH) at an operating frequency of 5. 0 GHz. Both of these generators utilize multiline <b>cusp</b> permanent magnet <b>configurations</b> for plasma confinement and beam profile optimization. The program goals were to develop a plasma generator possessing the characteristics of high electrical efficiency (low eV/ion) and simplicity of operation while maintaining the reliability and durability of the conventional hollow cathode plasma sources. The RFI plasma generator has achieved minimum discharge losses of 120 eV/ion while the ECH generator has obtained 145 eV/ion, assuming a 90 % ion optical transparency of the electrostatic acceleration system. Details of experimental tests with a variety of magnet configurations are presented...|$|R
40|$|Linac 4 {{is the new}} {{negative}} {{hydrogen ion}} (H^-) linear accelerator of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Its ion source operates {{on the principle of}} Radio-Frequency Inductively Coupled Plasma (RF-ICP) and it is required to provide 50 mA of H^- beam in pulses of 600 μs with a repetition rate up to 2 Hz and within an RMS emittance of 0. 25 π mm mrad in order to fullfil the requirements of the accelerator. This thesis is dedicated to the characterization of the hydrogen plasma in the Linac 4 H^- ion source. We have developed a Particle-In-Cell Monte Carlo Collision (PIC-MCC) code to simulate the RF-ICP heating mechanism and performed measurements to benchmark the fraction of the simulation outputs that can be experimentally accessed. The code solves self-consistently the interaction between the electromagnetic field generated by the RF coil and the resulting plasma response, including a kinetic description of charged and neutral species. A fully-implicit implementation allowed to simulate the high density regime of the Linac 4 H^- ion source, ensuring the energy conservation while maintaining the computational resources tractable. We studied the capacitive to inductive transition characteristic of the initial phase of the pulsed discharge. The simulation results were confirmed by time-resolved photometry measurements and allowed quantifying the effect of the hydrogen pressure and of the external magnetic cusp field on the transition dynamics. This provided insights into possible modifications to the magnetic <b>cusp</b> field <b>configuration</b> to maximize the power deposited to the plasma. The optimal ion source configuration maximizes the density of volume produced H^-, the flux of H^ 0 atoms onto the cesiated molybdenum plasma electrode surface at the origin of H^- emission, and minimizes the electron density and energy in the beam formation region. We simulated the high-density regime (10 ^ 19 m^- 3) representative of the nominal operation of the Linac 4 ion source during beam extraction. We performed a parametric study of the RF current, hydrogen pressure and magnetic <b>configuration</b> (<b>cusp</b> and filter) to assess their impact on the plasma parameters. The simulation results allowed assessment of these parameters and provided guidelines for the optimization of the ion source operational and design parameters. The simulation results of electron density, electron energy and hydrogen dissociation degree showed excellent agreement with optical emission spectroscopy measurements both as a function of RF coil current and magnetic configuration. The outputs of these simulations provide crucial inputs to beam formation and extraction physics models. Dedicated PIC software packages are being developed that will eventually shed insight into essential beam parameters such as the intensity and emittance of the H^- beam and the intensity of the co-extracted electrons...|$|R
