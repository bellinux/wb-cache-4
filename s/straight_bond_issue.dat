40|$|During {{the global}} {{financial}} tsunami, banks were very cautious in financing business needs due to tight credit conditions. Alternative ways for financing projects were sought after by real estate developers worldwide. Within Asia, notably in Hong Kong SAR and Singapore, a number of reputable property developers have been tapping the capital debt market for funds in recent years amidst an increasingly regulated loan market and competitive pricing. In {{the face of a}} growing bond market, some corporate <b>bond</b> <b>issues</b> arranged by these property developers have been successful. Apart from investment appetite, property developers have to gauge carefully {{the pros and cons of}} raising funds through <b>bond</b> <b>issues.</b> Successful <b>bond</b> <b>issues</b> need to be structured with suitable credit enhancement features since the perception of risk and rising interest rates are major deterrents to potential investors who would otherwise face bond defaults or bear high opportunity costs with the committed funds. Through a number of case studies, the suitability of bond financing for property development is compared with loan financing. It is found that a close monitoring of market conditions and some foresight are essential ingredients for successful bond financing, for both <b>straight</b> <b>bond</b> <b>issues</b> and convertibles.

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} effect of the {{conversion}} price of CoCo bonds on equity holders' incentives. First, we use an option-pricing context to show that CoCo bonds can magnify equity holders' incentives to increase the riskiness of assets and decrease incentives to raise new equity in a crisis in cases in which conversion transfers wealth from CoCo bond holders to equity holders. Second, we present a clinical study of the CoCo <b>bonds</b> <b>issued</b> so far. We show that i) almost all existing CoCo bonds are designed in a way that implies a wealth transfer from CoCo bond holders to equity holders at conversion and ii) this contractual design is reflected in traded prices of CoCo bonds. In particular, CoCo bonds are short volatility with a magnitude five times greater than that which can be observed for <b>straight</b> <b>bonds.</b> These results are robust and economically significant. We conclude that the CoCo <b>bonds</b> <b>issued</b> so far can create perverse incentives for banks' equity holders...|$|R
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{academic}} research focuses on how bond issuance impacts the firm. Most recent research focuses on investment grade bonds and ignores noninvestment grade bonds. This article investigates the long-run stock underperformance of high-yield bond Initial Bond Offerings (IBOs) in the 3 - 5 -year post-issuing period compared to firms that do not <b>issue</b> stock and/or <b>bonds</b> over the same 5 -year post period. A second dataset featuring investment grade <b>bond</b> <b>issuing</b> firms is also compared to firms that do not <b>issue</b> stocks and/or <b>bonds</b> over the same 5 -year post period. It is determined that stock underperformance does exist following bond IBOs using both the buy-and-hold return and Fama-French Four-Factor models. The level of underperformance {{is found to be}} greatest for callable bonds issuers followed by <b>straight</b> <b>bonds</b> and convertible bond issuers. Additionally, it is learned that high-yield <b>bond</b> <b>issuing</b> firms experience a greater level of underperformance than their investment-grade counterparts. This line of research partially fills the gap in understanding how noninvestment grade bonds impact the firm in both stock performance and the pricing decision. ...|$|R

Using firm-specific and macroeconomic factors of the contracting costs, {{we examine the}} extent to which they impact the likelihood of issuance and the structure of convertible bonds.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} whether there is any mispricing of publicly <b>issued</b> <b>straight</b> corporate <b>bonds</b> in Japan, and to determine what factors explain variations in the degree of mispricing. While there is an extremely large literature devoted to investigating the extent of mispricing of initial public offerings (IPOs) of equity in both the United States, and Japan, there appear to be very few studies examining the extent of mispricing of IPOs of <b>straight</b> corporate <b>bonds</b> in the United States and Japan. The key study for the United States is Datta et al. (1997) who find that IPOs of speculative grade ("junk") bonds are underpriced, but those rated investment grade are overpriced. Two later studies for the United States report underpricing rather than overpricing (see Helwege and Kleiman (1998) and Cai et al. (2007)). For Japan, Matsui (2000, 2006) finds that IPO and seasoned issues when analyzed together exhibit significant overpricing too. In this paper, using data on initial (IPO) and seasoned issues of publicly <b>issued</b> <b>straight</b> <b>bonds</b> over the ten year period between March 1992 and March 2002, evidence is presented that suggests the existence of significant mispricing, in particular, overpricing, of these bonds. This overpricing has several features: it does not appear decline overtime; on average, it increases as the rating of the <b>bond</b> <b>issued</b> falls, it is smaller for IPO issues; and it is influenced by the degree of competition among lead underwriters.

40|$|Abstract: Severe natural catastrophes in {{the early}} 1990 s {{generated}} a lack of financial capacity in the catastrophe line of the global reinsurance market. The finance industry reacted to this situation by issuing innovative products designed to spread the excess risk more widely among international investors (risk securitization). The paper reviews these developments and emphasizes their significance {{with respect to the}} economic theory of risk exchanges. Special attention is devoted to the case of catastrophe-linked <b>bonds,</b> <b>issued</b> by ceding insurers to secure ex post conditional capital for the payment of claims. We analyze these new securities as financial portfolios combining a <b>straight</b> <b>bond</b> and catastrophe options. Using option pricing theory and simulation analysis in a stochastic interest rate environment, we show that investors attracted by the potential for diversification benefits should not overlook the optional features when including these securities in an asset portfolio.

40|$|French {{banks and}} {{non-financial}} companies issue index-linked debt whose value at maturity is indexed to the CAC 40 or to {{a basket of}} European indices. This paper examines stock announcement effects associated with these bonds on three dates: the date the issuer’s General Assembly decides future capital needs, the publication {{in the journal of}} the COB (the stock market board), and the issue date. We find the issuance of index-linked debt has significant positive announcement effects on the issue date, which we attribute to its market-completion property. In order to examine further whether market completion is at play, we decompose the value of the <b>bond</b> at <b>issue</b> into its <b>straight</b> <b>bond</b> and option values. We determine that the bonds are overvalued again supporting market completion. PublishedN/...|$|R
