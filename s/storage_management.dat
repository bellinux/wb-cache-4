25|$|Lisp was {{originally}} {{created as a}} practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As {{one of the earliest}} programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic <b>storage</b> <b>management,</b> dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, the self-hosting compiler, and the read–eval–print loop.|$|E

Examples are: transaction processing databases, internet infrastructure (email, webserver, e-commerce), scientific computing software, and nearline <b>storage</b> <b>management</b> software. Enterprise drives commonly operate continuously ("24/7") in demanding environments while delivering {{the highest possible}} performance without sacrificing reliability. Maximum capacity is not the primary goal, and as a result the drives are often offered in capacities that are relatively low in relation to their cost.|$|E

[...] The toolkit incorporates not just computation management but also <b>storage</b> <b>management,</b> security provisioning, data movement, monitoring, and a toolkit for developing additional services based on the same infrastructure, including agreement negotiation, notification mechanisms, trigger services, and information aggregation. While the Globus Toolkit remains the de facto standard for building grid solutions, a number of other tools have been built that answer some subset of services needed to create an enterprise or global grid.|$|E
