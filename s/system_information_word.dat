40|$|In large IR <b>systems,</b> <b>information</b> about <b>word</b> {{occurrence}} may {{be stored}} in form of a bit matrix, with rows corresponding to different words and columns to documents. Such a matrix is generally very large and very sparse. New methods for compressing such matrices are presented, which exploit possible correlations between rows and between columns. The methods are based on partitioning the matrix into small blocks and predicting the 1 -bit distribution within a block by means of various bit generation models. Each block is then encoded using Huffman or arithmetic coding. The methods also use {{a new way of}} enumerating subsets of fixed size from a given superset. Preliminary experimental results indicate improvements over previous methods. 1.

40|$|Dialog act tagging is an {{important}} step toward speech understanding, yet training such taggers usually requires large amounts of data labeled by linguistic experts. Here we investigate the use of unlabeled data for training HMM-based dialog act taggers. Three techniques are shown to be effective for bootstrapping a tagger from very small amounts of labeled data: iterative relabeling and retraining on unlabeled data; a dialog grammar to model dialog act context, and a model of the prosodic correlates of dialog acts. On the SPINE dialog corpus, the combined use of prosodic information and unlabeled data reduces the tagging error between 12 % and 16 %, compared to baseline <b>systems</b> using <b>word</b> <b>information</b> and various amounts of labeled data only. 1...|$|R

Since great effort is expended in developing high quality guidelines, and in making them computer-interpretable, it is highly desirable to be able to share them among institutions. Adoption of a common format for representing computer-interpretable guidelines (CIGs) is one way of sharing them. Factors that need to be considered in creating a format for sharable CIGs include (1) the scope of the guideline and its intended applications; (2) the method of delivery of the recommendations; and (3) the environment, consisting of the practice setting and the <b>information</b> <b>system</b> in which the guideline will be applied.
