In the presented work, a green and benign sample pretreatment method called temperature-controlled ionic liquid dispersive liquid phase microextraction (TCIL-DLPME) was followed with stopped-flow injection <b>spectrofluorimetry</b> (SFIS) for quantitation of PXM in pharmaceutical formulations and biological samples. Methods:Temperature-controlled ionic liquid dispersive liquid phase microextraction (TCIL-DLPME) was applied as an environmentally friendly sample enrichment method to extract and isolate PXM prior to quantitation. Dispersion of 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Hmim][PF 6]) ionic liquid (IL) through the sample aqueous solution was performed by applying a relatively high temperature.
