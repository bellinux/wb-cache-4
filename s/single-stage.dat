40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. High temperature fuel cells such as the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) are considered extremely suitable for electrical power plant application. The intermediate temperature (IT) SOFC and MCFC performances are calculated using numerical models which are built in Aspen customer modeler for the internally reformed (IR) fuel cells. These models are integrated in Aspen PlusTM. In this article, a new combined cycle is proposed: this combined cycle consisting of two-staged of MCFC and IT-SOFC. The MCFC&IT-SOFC combined cycle and <b>single-staged</b> cycle with MCFC only are simulated in order to evaluate and compare their performances. The simulations {{results indicate that the}} net efficiency of MCFC&IT-SOFC combined cycle is 64. 6 % under standard operation conditions. On the other hand, the net efficiency of <b>single-staged</b> MCC cycle is 51. 6 %. In other words, the cycle with two-staged MCFC and IT-SOFC gives much better net efficiency than the cycle with <b>single-staged</b> MCFC. vk 201...|$|R

Observations: An 80 -year-old female with a progressively enlarged left upper eyelid mass presented with ocular irritation, blurred vision, and gritty sensation despite topical antibiotics treatment. This multinodular mass involved the left total upper eyelid, compromised corneal surface integrity, and caused complete ptosis. Excisional biopsy confirmed advanced sebaceous gland carcinoma, which {{was followed by}} extensive excision. The resultant total upper eyelid defect was reconstructed by a forehead galeal pericranial flap accompanied by anterior and posterior lamellar grafts.

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy of <b>single-staged</b> modified uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) with nasal surgery and the relationship between its surgical outcomes and an anatomy-based staging system in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with nasal obstruction. Study Design and Setting. Before–after analysis at a university hospital. Subjects and Methods. A total of 41 consecutive OSAS patients (mean age 40. 1 ± 7. 3 years) who underwent <b>single-staged</b> modified (uvula-preserving) UPPP with nasal surgery were included. The investigators compared subjective symp-toms and polysomnographic data before and after surgery and investigated objective surgical outcomes according to the anatomy-based (Friedman) staging system and postoperative complications. Surgical success was defined as a reduction of at least 50 % in preoperative apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) and a postoperative AHI of less than 20 per hour. Results. After simultaneous nasal–oropharyngeal surgery, the AHI significantly decreased (from 45. 9 ± 23. 4 to 20. 9 ± 22. 1 events per hour; P <. 001) and the overall success rate was 56. 1 % (23 / 41). Surgical success rates in stages I, II, and III were 70. 6 % (12 / 17), 60. 0 % (9 / 15), and 22. 2 % (2 / 9), respectively. There were no major complications during or after surgery, and most minor complications were transient and resolved without morbidity. Conclusions. <b>Single-staged</b> modified UPPP with nasal surgery is an available and relatively safe surgical approach in OSAS patients with nasal obstruction.

25|$|Digestion {{systems can}} be {{configured}} with different levels of complexity. In a <b>single-stage</b> digestion system (one-stage), all of the biological reactions occur within a single, sealed reactor or holding tank.

Acidogenic bacteria, through the production of acids, reduce the pH of the tank. Methanogenic bacteria, as outlined earlier, operate in a strictly defined pH range. Therefore, the biological reactions of the different species in a <b>single-stage</b> reactor can be in direct competition with each other. Another one-stage reaction system is an anaerobic lagoon. These lagoons are pond-like, earthen basins used for the treatment and long-term storage of manures.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the osseointegration of implants placed in a <b>single-staged</b> compared to two-staged procedure using bone ring technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study were used standardized, vertical alveolar bone defects in dogs. In the test group, dental implants (Straumann BL®, Basel, Switzerland) were inserted simultaneously with bone ring technique. As control group served implants inserted 6 months following grafting. Implants of both groups were left for an osseointegration period of 3 and 6 months. The peri-implant bone loss and bone-to-implant contact within the bone ring and native bone were analyzed morphometrically. An explorative statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: The peri-implant bone level remained relatively stable within groups and between groups per given time period. Most of bone apposite on the implant surface in two groups was composed of newly formed bone. A nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant advantage for two-staged implant placement for new and total bone, except for residual bone (P =. 0084). Furthermore, two groups of implants performed similarly in bone ring and in native bone throughout the observation period.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Simultaneous implant {{placement}} with {{bone grafting}} shortens the overall treatment period, but {{might lead to}} the peri-implant bone loss or even implant failure. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the <b>single-staged</b> to two-staged implant placement using the bone ring technique. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four standardized alveolar bone defects were made in the mandibles of nine dogs. Dental implants (Straumann BL®, Basel, Switzerland) were inserted simultaneously with bone ring technique in test group and after 6 months of healing period in control group. Animals of both groups were euthanized at 3 and 6 months of osseointegration period. The harvested samples were analyzed by means of histology and micro-CT. RESULTS: The amount of residual bone decreased while the amount of new bone increased up to 9 months of healing period. All morphometric parameters remained stable between 3 and 6 months of osseointegration period within groups. Per a given time point, median area of residual bone graft was higher in test group and area of new bone in control group. The volume of bone ring was greater in test than in control group, reaching the significance at 6 months of osseointegration period (P = 0. 002). CONCLUSIONS: In the present type of bone defect, <b>single-staged</b> implant placement may be potentially useful to shorten an overall treatment period...|$|R

This research finds the optimal power-split drive train for hybrid hydraulic city bus. The research approaches the optimization problem {{by studying the}} characteristics of possible configurations offered by the power-split architecture. The critical speed ratio (S_crit) is introduced in this research to represent power-split configurations and consequently simplifies the optimal configuration search process. This methodology allows the research to find the optimal configurations among the more complicated dual-staged power-split architecture. The search for optimal <b>single-staged</b> and dual-staged power-split configurations is done by tuning the S_crit values until the optimal configuration is reached. The configuration candidates are simulated over three city bus drive cycles and to ensure they operate at optimal condition at each drive cycle, a dynamic programming is used.
