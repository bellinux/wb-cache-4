We propose {{the use of}} an indirect iterative method for solving the inverse problem in terms of multiple moving dipoles. A database of <b>surface</b> <b>potentials</b> generated by single dipoles was generated by solving the forward problem. The inverse problem was solved by iteratively searching the combination of <b>surface</b> <b>potentials</b> in our database most similar to the observed <b>surface</b> <b>potentials.</b> Simulated <b>surface</b> <b>potentials</b> were used to test the algorithm. Single dipoles were accurately located in 92 % simulations and in 90 % simulations in which noise (SNR= 6 dB) was added.

The {{problem of}} noninvasive {{computing}} the epicardial <b>surface</b> <b>potentials</b> from torso <b>surface</b> <b>potentials</b> constitutes {{one form of}} the inverse problem of ECG, which can be acted as a regression problem with multi-input and multi-output.

The experiment results shows that SVR method is an effective way for solving the inverse ECG problem, which can reconstruct more accurate epicardial <b>surface</b> <b>potentials</b> distribution than the common regularization method, such as Tikhonv method and LSQR method. 1...|$|R
2500|$|In DESI, {{there is}} a {{high-velocity}} pneumatically assisted electrospray jet that is continually directed towards the probe surface. The jet forms a micrometer-size thin solvent film on the sample {{where it can be}} desorbed. The sample can be dislodged by the incoming spray jet allowing for particles to come off in an ejection cone of analyte containing secondary ion droplets. A lot of study is still going into looking at the working principals of DESI but there are still some things known. The erosion diameter of the spray spot formed by DESI is known to be directly tied to the spatial resolution. Both the chemical composition and the texture of the surface will also affect the ionization process. The nebulizing gas used most commonly is N2 set at a typical pressure of 160 psi. The solvent is a combination of methanol and water, sometimes paired with 0.5% acetic acid and at a flow rate of 10 μL/min. The surface can be mounted it two different ways, one way consists of a surface holder that can carry 1 x 5cm large disposable surface slides that lie on a stainless steel surface. The steel surface has a voltage applied to provide an appropriate <b>surface</b> <b>potential.</b> The <b>surface</b> <b>potential</b> that can be applied is the same at which the sprayer can be set at. The second surface is made with an aluminum block that has a built in heater, this allows for temperature control with temperatures up to 300°C with newer stages having built in CCD’s and light sources. Their spectra are that similar to ESI. They feature multiply charged ions alkali metal adducts and non covalent complexes that originate from the condensed phase of the sample/solvent interaction. DESI [...] is revealed to have a more gentle ionization condition that leads to a more pronounced tendency for metal adduct formation and a lower specific charging of secondary droplets.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} of operation of Bio-FET devices based on detecting changes in electrostatic potential due to binding of analyte. This the same mechanism of operation as glass electrode sensors which also detect changes in <b>surface</b> <b>potential</b> but were developed {{as early as}} the 1920's. Due to the small magnitude of the changes in <b>surface</b> <b>potential</b> upon binding of biomolecules or changing pH, glass electrodes require a high impedance amplifier which increases the size and cost of the device. In contrast, the advantage of Bio-FET devices is that they operate as an intrinsic amplifier, converting small changes in <b>surface</b> <b>potential</b> to large changes in current (through the transistor component) without the need for additional circuitry. This means BioFETs have the capability to be much smaller and more affordable than glass electrode-based biosensors.

Since the Moon is in the solar wind plasma flow for most of its orbit, <b>surface</b> <b>potentials</b> are first determined for typical fast and slow stream conditions.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} quantitatively, using streamlined mathematics, how the transmembrane ionic {{currents in}} individual cardiac muscle cells act {{to produce the}} body <b>surface</b> <b>potentials</b> of the electrocardiogram (ECG). From fundamental principles of electrostatics, anatomy, and physiology, one can characterize the strength of apparent dipoles along a wavefront of depolarization in a local volume of myocardium. Net transmembrane flow of ionic current in actively depolarizing or repolarizing tissue induces extracellular current flow, which sets up a field of electrical potential that resembles that of a dipole. The local dipole strength depends upon the tissue cross section, the tissue resistivity, the resting membrane potential, the membrane capacitance, the volume fraction of intracellular fluid, the time rate of change of the action potential, and the cell radius. There are no unknown, 2 ̆ 2 free 2 ̆ 2 parameters. There are no arbitrary scale factors. Body <b>surface</b> <b>potentials</b> are {{a function of the}} summed local dipole strengths, directions, and distances from the measuring point.
