A Nb-Si system in-situ {{composite}} Nb- 16 Si- 24 Ti- 6 Cr- 6 Al- 2 Hf(at%) was fabricated using vacuum {{arc melting}} method, {{and then was}} metallurgically reacted with four kinds of ceramics ZrO 2, Y 2 O 3 stabilized ZrO 2, Y 2 O 3, SiC+Si 3 N 4 at elevated temperature. The microstructures in the interface reaction zones were investigated by SEM and EDS. The results showed that different extent chemical reactions between the composite and these four kinds of ceramics took place. It {{has been found that}} HfO 2 riched layer formed near the interfaces between the Nb-Si in-situ composite and three ceramics of ZrO 2, Y 2 O 3 stabilized ZrO 2 and Y 2 O 3, and thickness of the reaction zones were about 100 μm, 10 μm, 1 μm respectively. C and N elements in SiC+Si 3 N 4 ceramic diffused to the composite at elevated temperature, and a new phase that rich of Ti, C and N elements appeared nearby the interface and accumulated inhomogenously. It may be concluded that the interface reactions of both ZrO 2 and SiC+Si 3 N 4 with Nb-Si composite were very violent, therefore they are not suitable as face-coat materials of <b>shell</b> <b>molds</b> for investment casting; the interface reaction of Y 2 O 3 stabilized ZrO 2 and Nb-Si composite was slighter than ZrO 2 and SiC+Si 3 N 4, and it can be used as face-coat material of <b>shell</b> <b>molds,</b> the interface reaction of Y 2 O 3 and Nb-Si composite was very slight, and is recommended as an ideal face-coat materials of <b>shell</b> <b>molds...</b>|$|R
40|$|Single, (001) -oriented {{crystals}} of PWA 1480 were {{processed in}} alumina/silica <b>shell</b> <b>molds</b> {{in a laboratory}} high gradient furnace. The furnace employs a graphite resistance heated element, a radiation baffle, and a water cooled radiation trap below the baffle.

The element is constructed with a variable cross section that is tapered just above the baffle to maximize heat input and therefore thermal gradient. A maximum alloy temperature of 1600 C was used. A thermal gradient of 130 deg C/cm was recorded at 1370 C just above the solidus of the PWA 1480 alloys.

40|$|Superalloy {{airfoils}} {{are produced}} by investment casting (IC), which uses ceramic cores and wax patterns with ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>molds.</b> Hollow cored superalloy airfoils in a gas turbine engine are an example of complex IC parts. The complex internal hollow cavities of the airfoil are designed to conduct cooling air through one or more passageways. These complex internal passageways have been fabricated by a lost wax process requiring several processing steps; core preparation, injection molding for wax pattern, and dipping process for ceramic <b>shell</b> <b>molds.</b> Several steps generate problems such as high cost and decreased accuracy of the ceramic mold. For example, costly tooling and production delay are required to produce mold dies for complex cores and wax patterns used in injection molding, resulting in a big obstacle for prototypes and smaller production runs. Rather than using separate cores, patterns, and <b>shell</b> <b>molds,</b> it would be advantageous to directly produce a mold that has the casting cavity and the ceramic core by one process. Ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA) {{can be used to}} directly fabricate the integrally cored ceramic casting mold (ICCM). CerSLA builds ceramic green objects from CAD files from many thin liquid layers of powder in monomer, which are solidified by polymerization with a UV laser, thereby “writing” the design for each slice. This dissertation addresses the integrally cored casting ceramic mold (ICCM), the ceramic core with a ceramic <b>mold</b> <b>shell</b> in a single patternless construction, fabricated by ceramic stereolithography (CerSLA). CerSLA is considered as an alternative method to replace lost wax processes, for small production runs or designs too complex for conventional cores and patterns. The main topic is the development of methods to successfully fabricate an ICCM by CerSLA from refractory silica, as well as related issues. The related issues are the segregation of coarse fused silica powders in a layer, the degree of segregation parameter to prevent segregation, and sintering and cristobalite transformation in fused silica compacts...|$|R
40|$|<b>Shell</b> <b>mold</b> casting or {{shell molding}} is a metal casting process in {{manufacturing}} industry {{in which the}} mold is a thin hardened shell of sand and thermosetting resin binder backed up by some other material. The internal surface of the <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> is very smooth and rigid.

Manufacturing with the <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> process also imparts high dimensional accuracy. Tolerances of. 010 inches (. 25 mm) are possible.

40|$|A {{primary concern}} in modern fluid {{dynamics}} {{research is the}} experimental verification of computational aerothermodynamic codes. This research requires high precision and detail in the test model employed. Ceramic materials are used for these models because of their low heat conductivity and their survivability at high temperatures. To fabricate such models, slip casting techniques were developed to provide net-form, precision casting capability for high-purity ceramic materials in aqueous solutions. In previous slip casting techniques, block, or flask molds made of plaster-of-paris were used to draw liquid from the slip material. Upon setting, parts {{were removed from the}} flask mold and cured in a kiln at high temperatures. Casting detail was usually limited with this technique [...] detailed parts were frequently damaged upon separation from the flask mold, as the molded parts are extremely delicate in the uncured state, and the flask mold is inflexible. Ceramic surfaces were also marred by 'parting lines' caused by mold separation. This adversely affected the aerodynamic surface quality of the model as well. (Parting lines are invariably necessary on or near the leading edges of wings, nosetips, and fins for mold separation. These areas are also critical for flow boundary layer control.) Parting agents used in the casting process also affected surface quality. These agents eventually soaked into the mold, the model, or flaked off when releasing the case model. Different materials were tried, such as oils, paraffin, and even an algae. The algae released best, but some of it remained on the model and imparted an uneven texture and discoloration on the model surface when cured. According to the present invention, a wax pattern for a <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> is provided, and an aqueous mixture of a calcium sulfate-bonded investment material is applied as a coating to the wax pattern. The coated wax pattern is then dried, followed by curing to vaporize the wax pattern and leave a <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> of the calcium sulfate-bonded investment material. The <b>shell</b> <b>mold</b> is cooled to room temperature, and a ceramic slip is poured therein. After a ceramic shell of desired thickness has set up in the <b>shell</b> <b>mold,</b> excess ceramic slip is poured out.
