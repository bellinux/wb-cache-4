These colonies were evidently founded in subservience to the commerce of Great Britain. From this principle, the whole system of our laws concerning them became a system of restriction. A double monopoly was established {{on the part of the}} parent country; 1. A monopoly of their whole import, which is to be altogether from Great Britain; 2. A monopoly of all their export, which is to be nowhere but to Great Britain, as far as it can serve any purpose here. On the same idea it was contrived that they should send all their products to us raw, and in their first state; and that they should take everything from us in the last <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b>|$|E

A number of factors influence the fatigue life of a component in service, viz., (i) complex stress cycles, (ii) engineering design, (iii) manufacturing and inspection, (iv) service conditions and environment and (v) material of construction. However, almost all service failures can ultimately be attributed to defects of various types introduced mostly inadvertently in various <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> the component or otherwise.

50|$|The {{number of}} ends per inch {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture.</b> Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number of ends per inch, which {{is directly related to the}} size reed being used. After weaving the number of ends per inch will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends per inch (and picks per inch) and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven. Tightly woven fabric shrinks more (and thus the number of ends per inch increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more elastic yarns and fibers.|$|E

The construction process was inspected in May by the Dutch prime minister Hendrik Colijn who at the time was also interim minister of defence. DAF submitted the first blueprints and a scale model to the commission in July.

40|$|The {{archaeology}} of pre-Islamic South Arabia {{is still}} in its infancy. The field is ready for a culturally meaningful study of pottery from a stratigraphically excavated site. Toward this end a techno-functional typology and a descriptive classification is offered for the pottery recovered from the early deposits at HR 3, the largest site in the Wadi al-Jubah, which is centrally located along trade routes connecting the ancient Qatabanian and Sabaean kingdoms with the rest of Arabia. The typology is based on the importance of vessel form, which is reflected by the <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> employed by the ancient potter, in accordance with a specific potting tradition. Definition <b>of</b> those <b>stages</b> enables a reconstruction of a vessel 2 ̆ 7 s potting tradition. This study employs various compositional analyses, manufacturing methods analyses, and thermal analyses to address the <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>manufacture</b> for each techno-functional type. The potting traditions active during the late second millennium BC to around the fourth century BC in this portion of South Arabia are reconstructed. The results of the chronological study demonstrate the presence of South Arabian civilization early in the first millennium BC, and that some degree of geopolitical affiliation can be determined {{on the basis of the}} dispersal of potting traditions. The ceramic repertoire from HR 3 is indistinguishable from that found at sites within the boundaries of the Qatabanian and Sabaean kingdoms, but it is radically different for sites within the other South Arabian kingdoms. The results enable a ceramic province to be proposed for this part of South Arabia. ...|$|R
