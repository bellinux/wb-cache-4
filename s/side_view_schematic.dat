30|$|Figure  4 {{illustrates}} two {{strategies of}} leveraging <b>side</b> <b>views</b> {{in the process}} of selecting subgraph patterns. Conventional graph classification approaches treat <b>side</b> <b>views</b> and subgraph patterns separately and may only combine them at the final stage of training a classifier. Obviously, the valuable information embedded in <b>side</b> <b>views</b> is not fully leveraged in the feature selection process. In order to fuse heterogeneous data sources at an early stage thereby exploring their correlations, Cao et al. introduce an effective algorithm for discriminative subgraph selection using multiple <b>side</b> <b>views</b> as guidance [49]. Side information consistency is first validated via statistical hypothesis testing which suggests that the similarity of <b>side</b> <b>view</b> features between instances with the same label should have higher probability to be larger than that with different labels. Based on such observations, it is assumed that the similarity/distance between instances in the space of subgraph features should be consistent with that {{in the space of a}} <b>side</b> <b>view.</b> That is to say, if two instances are similar in the space of a <b>side</b> <b>view,</b> they should also be close to each other in the space of subgraph features. Therefore the target is to minimize the distance between subgraph features of each pair of similar instances in each <b>side</b> <b>view</b> [49]. In contrast to existing subgraph mining approaches that focus on the graph view alone, the proposed method can explore multiple vector-based <b>side</b> <b>views</b> to find an optimal set of subgraph features for graph classification.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} drop {{flattening}} and substrate surface heterogeneity on the cross-sectional and planar shapes of droplets of liquids resting on solid surfaces are examined. A simple method, volume single image sequencing, for examining a <b>side</b> <b>view</b> digital image profile is developed. Advantages of this sequential approach {{are that the}} influence of the finite pixel resolution is made explicit and the confidence with which shape deviations can be deduced can be quantified. A dual-camera video microscopy system was developed for simultaneously recording the planar and <b>side</b> <b>views</b> of sessile drops. Experimentally observed profiles have been analyzed for large and small drops of triply distilled water evaporating from poly(ethylene terephthalate) (Mylar), poly(methyl methacrylate), Teflon, and glass substrates. The planar view shows that deviations from a circular shape often occur in the latter stages of evaporation but that these are not apparent from a <b>side</b> <b>view</b> observation of the droplet. Experiments were conducted with drops of glycerine on a grooved glass substrate with <b>side</b> <b>view</b> observations both along and at 90 ° to the axis of the grooves.
