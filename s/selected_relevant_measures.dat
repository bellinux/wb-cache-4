40|$|Background: This {{paper offers}} {{mortality}} risk rankings for Iranian mortality data. It extends methods to include mixed co-horts, tests changes in mortality risks, compares measures {{of risk and}} discusses public policy implications. Methods: The methodology used in risk measures takes current practice and extends it to include variations in population dynamics. The specification is presented and compared with existing literature. Results: Our findings confirm literature results in the re-ordering that takes place when different risk measures are used. In addition, we find there is consistency in risk rankings between 1999 and 2000 records of Iranian mortality data. Thus, these risk measures are stable, robust across time and relay risk information consistently. Conclusions: There are considerable implications in adopting particular risk measures for public policy. However, given properties of risk measures discussed here, {{it is clear that}} policy makers can <b>select</b> <b>relevant</b> risk <b>measures</b> depending on their priorities...|$|R

In the past many measures have been implemented to reduce the contribution of point sources, and as a result diffuse pollution from agricultural became more important. The main objective of COST Action 869 is to undertake a scientific evaluation of the suitability and cost-effectiveness of different options for reducing nutrient loss to surface and ground waters at the river basin scale, including their limitations in terms of applicability under different climatic, ecological and geographical conditions. In this report an overview is given of different categories of mitigation options and the individual measures has been described in terms of the mechanism, applicability, effectiveness, time frame, environmental side effects and cost in order to help policy makers, watershed managers and farmers to <b>select</b> the most <b>relevant</b> <b>measures</b> for their condition...|$|R
40|$|The FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm) {{survey is}} an ambitious project {{scheduled}} to cover 10, 000 square degrees {{of the northern}} and southern galactic caps. Until recently, astronomers associated with FIRST identified radio-emitting galaxies with a bent-double morphology through a visual inspection of images. Besides being subjective, prone to error and tedious, this manual approach is becoming increasingly infeasible: upon completion, FIRST will include almost a million galaxies. This paper describes the application of six methods of evolving neural networks (NNs) with genetic algorithms (GAs) to the identification of bent-double galaxies. The objective is to demonstrate that GAs can successfully address some common problems in the application of NNs to classification problems, such as training the networks, choosing appropriate network topologies, and <b>selecting</b> <b>relevant</b> features. We <b>measured</b> the overall accuracy of the networks using the arithmetic and geometric means of the accuracies on bent and non-bent galaxies. Most of the combinations of GAs and NNs perform equally well on our data, but using GAs to select feature subsets produces the best results, reaching accuracies of 90 % using the arithmetic mean and 87 % with the geometric mean. The networks found by the GAs were more accurate than hand-designed networks and decision trees...|$|R

The transportation ofgood is thus an important part in the function of the society and they’ll increase, bothin number and in amount. The efficiency of the transportation system isessential for {{us to be able to}} continue living as we are used to. The aim of this thesis has been to create a simplified representation of the variousways to efficient freight transportation. The problems have been to find outwhich factors that determine the conditions for an effective transport, which of thefactors that influence the effectiveness the most and if the carriers and theliterature have a similar picture of which these factors are. Four measures of transport efficiency have been used in the thesis; loading ratio, CO 2 emissions, damage to the cargo and delivery precision. To obtain this, a study of literature and interviews with six carriers was carriedthrough. Different measures of transport efficiency and the factors that mayaffect them were discussed. A conceptual model was developed to provide anunderstanding of how the transportation of goods, traders and transportefficiency are interrelated. The various carriers agreed that the <b>selected</b> <b>measures</b> are <b>relevant</b> <b>measures</b> oftransportation efficiency. They agreed on some factors that may affect theperformance indicators and disagreed on some. The differing in their opinions coulddepend on the different types of goods they shipping and within differentregions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a method to}} identify components of preference reflecting information and those reflecting only tastes. Important to this method is the identification of {{a unique set of}} revealed probability assignments (called <b>relevant</b> <b>measures)</b> from preferences over acts. We characterize these <b>relevant</b> <b>measures</b> and show where they appear in representations of preferences. This method works for a large set of preference models provided that the state space is treated as if it had a symmetric, “i. i. d. with unknown parameters, ” structure. <b>Relevant</b> <b>measures</b> are shown to characterize revealed information and to help in identifying taste components of preference representations. We apply our findings to four well-known representations of ambiguity-sensitive preferences: the α-MEU model, the smooth ambiguity model, the extended MEU with contraction model and the vector expected utility model. For each representation, the theory identifies both the set of <b>relevant</b> <b>measures</b> and components of the representation that reflect only tastes...|$|R

40|$|Health {{and disease}} management' is a {{clinical}} improvement process aimed at {{ensuring that the}} best practices known to medical science are incorporated with minimal variation over the entire continuum of care. The University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS) is an academic, integrated healthcare delivery system committed to implementing this approach to care by all providers and at all sites. This report outlines our approach to design, implementation, outcomes tracking and improvement, and highlights how the educational, service and research missions of the academic health system add value to the comprehensive health and disease management approach. The involvement of clinical researchers and academic physicians {{in the design of}} programmes contributes directly to improved clinical outcomes. Faculty with specific research interests, and experience with less common conditions, frequently lead this best-practice approach with rarer conditions, so allowing the impact of these programmes on improving the quality of care to be evaluated across many disease states. On the basis of their extensive knowledge of the disease in question, academic faculty play valuable leadership roles in <b>selecting</b> <b>relevant</b> key <b>measures.</b> Education, a key component of health and disease management implementation, is an area of particular strength in academic systems. Provider education, in particular, can be effectively achieved by academic detailing, led by specialists and utilising the involvement of skilled educators. A key requirement for programmes such as these is the need to frequently update the best-practice clinical guidelines. The academic health system is ideally poised to rapidly incorporate clinical advance and emerging knowledge into disease management programmes that can reach a wide audience. Health and disease management offers a unique research opportunity for academic physicians who can adapt the use of process control measurement techniques, which have long been the major approach to performance measurement in industry, to the healthcare environment. Clinical evaluation and outcomes management, has the potential to become widely embraced as a legitimate and important form of research. Substantial effort and resources must be dedicated to gain provider buy-in and achieve compliance. We believe that academic health systems have many of the necessary ingredients to be successful in this initiative. Moreover, if this approach to care is to be widely adopted, and behaviour change achieved, the next generation of healthcare leaders and workers must be introduced to these concepts early in their training.

We apply our find-ings to a number of well-known representations of ambiguity-sensitive preferences.
