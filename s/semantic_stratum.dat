The article starts out from the mythos-logos antithesis and from the twofold conception of the myth as both a fabricated and a sacred story. The allopersonages as characters of different names, who function as markers for the identical element in the structure, are contrasted by the author with the isopersonages bearing names of the same characters, who simultaneously function as markers for diverse elements or <b>semantic</b> <b>strata</b> in the structure. The term sociogony is introduced in analogy to the terms theogony and cosmogony. On the basis of a review of Croatian and mainstream mythological trends, the author perceives two main orientations in mythological research: the historical reconstruction of the Proto-Slavic myth, and research into the myth, mythic consciousness and mythic language in contemporary everyday life. The author supports the idea of differentiating mythology and religion and analyses the role of the myth, and scholarship on the myth, in forming national and cultural identity. From that aspect, we can also identify the contemporary transitional scholarly myth in today’s reconstructions of the unifed Proto-Slavic myth.

In these scientific and industrial contexts, it is well known that, to date, the operational performance of existing stratified non-Lambertian (anisotropic) topographic correction (SNLTOC) algorithms has been limited by the need for a priori knowledge of structural landscape characteristics, such as surface roughness which is land cover class specific. In practice, to overcome the circular nature of the SNLTOC problem, a mutually exclusive and totally exhaustive land cover classification map of a spaceborne MS image is required before SNLTOC takes place. This system requirement is fulfilled by the original operational automatic two-stage SNLTOC approach presented in this paper which comprises, in cascade, 1) an automatic stratification first stage and 2) a second-stage ordinary SNLTOC method selected from the literature. The former combines 1) four subsymbolic digital-elevation-model-derived strata, namely, horizontal areas, self-shadows, and sunlit slopes either facing the sun or facing away from the sun, and 2) symbolic (<b>semantic)</b> <b>strata</b> generated from the input MS image by an operational fully automated spectral-rule-based decision-tree preliminary classifier recently presented in RS literature. In this paper, first, previous works related to the TOC subject are surveyed, and next, the novel operational two-stage SNLTOC system is presented.

30|$|Systemic {{functional}} theory models {{human language}} as a stratified system (Halliday and Webster 2009), from the smallest components of the linguistic system through to more abstract notions such as ‘genre’ and ‘ideology’ (see Martin 2014). In this model of language, context is viewed as the overarching layer that encompasses the linguistic system, split into the three parameters of field, mode and tenor (Halliday and Hasan 1989; Halliday and Matthiessen 2013). While definitions of this trio vary between systemic functionalists, broad descriptions can generally be arrived at: field represents the experiential domain being expressed through the communication (i.e., the topic), mode signifies {{the manner in which}} the communication is performed, and tenor denotes the interpersonal relationships of those in the communicative context. These three contextual parameters have specific links to features found at the <b>semantic</b> and lexicogrammatical <b>strata</b> situated in the linguistic system, as attested to in most systemic functional literature (e.g. Figure 1 - 6 of Halliday and Matthiessen 2013).|$|R

40|$|Stratificational grammar is a {{model of}} {{linguistic}} structure. We can visualize the overall concept as a multistory building connected by a complex series of stairways. The arrangement of rooms and hallways on each floor is that stratum‘s tactic pattern, {{and the manner in which}} the stairways lead from various parts of one floor to various parts of another (and all the way up and down) is the grammar‘s realization pattern. Among the strata, we find at the top the <b>semantic</b> or semiological <b>strata</b> defining relationships of meaning, then the syntactic and morphological (together the grammatical) relationships of order, then the phonological and phonetic relationships of sounds and their feature components at the bottom. The patterns relating all of the points on and among all of the strata are visualized as lines and nodes. The nodes make use of only three logical primes – AND (conjunction), OR (disjunction) and ORDER (precedence), as shown in Figure 1. In (a), x is realized with y in no particular order (UNORDERED AND); in (b), x is realized with y, such that x precedes y (ORDERED AND); in (c), either x or y is realized, with no preference for one or the other (UNORDERED OR); and in (d), x is realized given condition z (from either that stratum‘s tactic pattern or from some other stratum), and otherwise y is realized (ORDERED OR). It is important to note that these nodes, although they are often called entities, are not physical entities per se, but rather are relationships among relationships...|$|R

As a consequence, the primary speech functions can be mapped onto the MOOD TYPE choices typically found in the MOOD systems of languages and their various realizations: statements are prototypically realized by means of declarative clauses, questions by means of interrogative clauses, and commands by means of imperative clauses, whereas offers do not generally correspond to a specific choice in {{the system of}} MOOD TYPE, but may be realized in various ways (ibid. 867 - 868).

H 577 P ENGL 2015 Wangxv, 463 pages :illustrationsThis {{study is}} carried out {{within the scope of}} the {{academic}} discipline of Translation Studies (henceforth TS) interfacing with Systemic Functional Linguistics (henceforth SFL). Baker (2001 : 277) states that TS is understood to "refer to the academic discipline concerned with the study of translation at large, including literary and non-literary translation, various forms of oral interpreting, as well as dubbing and subtitling". The Chinese translation of literary texts, detective stories to be specific, will be the object of this study. To discuss the issue of language inherent in translating for detective stories, my research echoes with Halliday's (1992) view of translation as a "meaning-making activity", a "guided creation of meaning" in which the issue of choice merits attention, particularly when the theory informing the study attending to the language of translation is SFL. In order to investigate the features of verbal clauses in detective stories and compare the differences in the two Chinese translations the translation in the early 20 th century (henceforth TT 1) and the translation in the late 20 th century (henceforth TT 2), nine short stories written by Conan Doyle (henceforth ST) and their two Chinese translations are selected for analysis and comparisons. And the main objectives of this study include: (1) to analyze different thematic patterns or choices occurring in verbal clauses; (2) to observe logico-semantic types and rhetorical relations in ST and TT 1 /TT 2; (3) to identify different translator's choices in TT 1 and TT 2; (4) to investigate and interpret translators' choices in TT 1 and TT 2 from the perspective of context; and (5) to explore the interface between SFL and literary translation based on the theoretical framework developed for the present study. Located within the framework of DTS, this study is an empirical work, which conducts a descriptive research of the Chinese translations of detective stories. Adopting a bottom-up approach, this study starts with the lexico-grammatical stratum, to <b>semantic</b> <b>stratum</b> and then to contextual stratum within the SFL theoretical framework. And during the process of analysis and comparisons, both diachronic and synchronic comparisons are used to investigate differences between two Chinese translations in two periods and differences between various translators in the same period. This will bring new insight to comparisons of language pairs in two different historical moments, going beyond the scope of comparisons in the same period. The corpus in this study covers nine short stories written by Conan Doyle from the period between 1891 and 1905, and their two Chinese translations in wen yan (literary language: classical Chinese) and bai hua (plain language: colloquial Chinese) in 1917 and 2011 respectively. On the basis of systematic analysis and comparisons, this study makes its contributions in the following aspects: (1) theoretically speaking, this study contributes to both systemic functional linguistics and translation studies. In terms of systemic functional linguistics, this study connects the analysis and interpretations from the three strata of lexicogrammar, semantics, and context. In particular, at the <b>semantic</b> <b>stratum,</b> logico-semantic relations and rhetorical relations are compared, which enriches the analysis on the whole. And it is also an important attempt to analyze literal Chinese language from the perspective of systemic functional linguistics. In terms of translation studies, translators' choices are investigated synchronically and diachronically, which both demonstrates significant differences. (2) practically speaking, firstly, as previous studies suggest a lack of investigations at the <b>semantic</b> <b>stratum,</b> verbal projection is spelled out from various points in this study, particularly at the semantic stratum; secondly, verbal projection have been studied in the English context, but this present study makes one of the first attempts to conduct analysis in the Chinese context, including the classical Chinese language context; thirdly, since diachronic comparisons are rarely studied in terms of verbal projection, this study conducts both diachronic and synchronic comparisons.

30|$|Paradigmatic {{description}} {{is not new}} to sfl; in fact it {{dates back to the}} birth of modern linguistics. The origin of the underlying concept can be traced as far back as Saussure’s ‘associative bonds’ (Saussure [1966]; [2006]; Hasan, [2013]; [2014]). For SFL, in particular with its origins in Firthian linguistics, there had been a long tradition of orientation to this method (Firth, [1957]; [1968]; Halliday, [1961]; Butt, [2001]; Matthiessen, [2007]; [2009]; [in press]). Despite this rich inheritance, the system networks (henceforth ‘sys-net’) of today are rather different from Firth’s, and they never had been anything like Saussure’s presentation of ‘associative bonds’ (e.g., [1966]: 126). Guided by a set of theoretical concepts, introduced mostly by Halliday in the 1960 ’s to early 1970 s, the paradigmatic method of analysis has moved a fair way – its representation in the form of sys-nets began in the early 1960 ’s with Halliday. First applied successfully to the analysis of lexicogrammar (Halliday [1967 – 68]; [1969]), the method led to the metafunctional hypothesis in SFL (Halliday [1970 a]; [1973]). Following the efforts by Halliday, the same descriptive orientation and mode of representation were further developed to describe the semantic unit ‘message’ in the early 1980 s (Hasan, [1983], mimeo) which {{led to the development of}} other sys-nets, e.g., that of ‘rhetorical unit’ at the <b>semantic</b> <b>stratum</b> (Cloran [1994]). These were employed successfully as research tools for the study of semantic variation (Cloran [1994]; [1995]; [1999]; [2000]; Williams, [1995]; Hasan [2009 b]). To ignore the paradigmatic method in the description of context of situation would have been careless, particularly since the design of the system network is well suited to contextual parameters.|$|E
30|$|Turning now to look ‘around’ at the stratum of semantics: {{here the}} {{question}} is what resources are around for demanding goods-&-services, i.e., for choosing, {{as a response to the}} secretary’s question on the floor, some appropriate pattern from the family of messages that consist of ‘getting someone to do something’ (Hasan, [2009 b]; [2013]). The <b>semantic</b> <b>stratum</b> can present a large set of possibilities each of which will be heard as some kind of demand to undertake an action in a particular way so as to make a difference to the existing scenario, varying in what goods-&-service are being demanded, and what relation the asking will ‘enact’ with the addressee. It is highly probable, in view of the interactants’ tenor relations as described above, that the command will not have the feature ‘plea’ or such ‘softeners’ as ‘if you don’t mind’, ‘if it isn’t inconvenient’; and it is even less likely to be ‘suggestive’ e.g., ‘lets do it straight away, shall we?’ But even counting out these categories, the speaker might take an assertive stance as in ‘I would like it done straight away’ or ‘it better be done straight away’. A more authoritarian near mandatory command might be ‘you had better/you should/ you must do it straight away’. Compare this with ‘it should/ it must be done straight away’. And all of these can be compared with consultative commands ‘can, will, could, would, won’t, can’t you do it…’. As well, there are a large number of exhortative commands such as ‘do it…, you do it…, better do it…’; and in this context consider the quality of relation enacted by the selection of such additions as ‘…will you?, … can you?, …would you?, … could you? … can’t you?, … won’t you?’. Of course, more details about the selectable meanings can be added; but perhaps this will suffice to indicate the resources ‘around’ in making demand for service and the ‘construal’ of context by meaning-wording. In the end, the employer’s response to the question does not depend purely on ‘what’ the action is, but more likely on his attitude and focus with regard to the addressee (see Figures  6 and 7 for the terms used with reference to mode and tenor).|$|E
30|$|Notwithstanding {{good reasons}} for {{treating}} context as point of origin, its in-built complexity cannot be ignored. Would this affect its linguistic description? At first glance, {{the use of multiple}} braces may appear iconic of that problem. But somewhat surprisingly even here it seems possible not only to generalize about the function of the multiple braces but also to offer analogous relations at the language internal strata of wording and meaning. Thus, the first large opening brace of a sys-net such as incorporated in Figure  3 seems to have an especial function: occurring immediately after the point of origin or close to the primary system – but always {{in the vicinity of the}} less delicate part of the sys-net – the brace seems to be reserved for identifying the metafunctional orientations of the various systems that will constitute the comprehensive system network pertaining to the point of origin. For example, with the unit ‘clause’ as the point of origin, the primary system has two options ‘minor’ or ‘major’; and following ‘major’ an opening brace announces a number of dimensions such as those of mood and modality (interpersonal orientation), transitivity, tense and projection (ideational orientation), and theme and information focus (textual orientation) (see Halliday, [1976]; Matthiessen and Halliday [2014] etc.). Similar to this, at the <b>semantic</b> <b>stratum,</b> Figure  1 has shown two primary options, ‘punctuative’ or ‘progressive’; the latter option is followed by the first large brace of that sys-net; and this specifies four entries, each oriented to a specific metafunction: the first to interpersonal, he next to textual; the third to logical and the last to the experiential metafunction (Hasan [2013]: 286). A similar situation unfolds with context as well: thus, in Figure  3, immediately after the point of origin, is the first brace; it announces the four domains pertinent to the description of context – that is to say, the three dimensions of field, tenor and mode plus that of iteration. I interpret this as signifying that these three domains have carved up the vast area of description called context of situation by reference to their metafunctional orientations.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a case study of}} {{dialogic}} learning in a university context as demonstrated in tutorial talk. The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness or otherwise of dialogic learning as applied in an economics curriculum. More specifically, the thesis examines the learning experiences of a second language international student cohort as they attempted to understand the role of prediction and causality in economic principles and theories through spoken dialogue. This approach means interpreting the students’ learning as a semiotic process and the students’ cognitive development as shaped by their language in use. The theoretical framework for this examination is offered by the analytical resources of systemic functional linguistics, as developed by M. A. K. Halliday (from 1975 to 2004) combined with frameworks for mediated learning offered by Vygotsky (1986, 1987); Bakhtin (1986); Hasan (from 1985 a to 2001); Bernstein (from 1971 to 2001) and Cloran (from 1994 to 2006 draft); and more recent research in ‘scaffolded learning’. The study applies these resources to analyse significant rhetorical functions of economic discourse, such as predictive reasoning and argumentation, and to examine how these were negotiated and mediated by the students and their lecturer. The method for analysing negotiation and mediation in these students’ learning draws on Rhetorical Unit (RU) analysis as devised by Cloran. Linguistically, the analysis takes account of categories and relations between the Rhetorical Units on the basis that these are able to provide theoretical explanations for the predictive reasoning construed in the interactions. The analysis of Rhetorical Units primarily involved the identification of relations between the basic constituent of the text, ie, the message, and how these relations constructed the units of rhetorical meaning in the discussion. The advantage of adopting this approach is the possibility of realising rhetorical activities as an abstraction at the <b>semantic</b> <b>stratum,</b> and, as such, how they were realised by lexicogrammatical phenomena. The analysis examined: first, the use of Rhetorical Units by the lecturer and students in their construal of the critical pedagogic discourses identified by Bernstein, being the regulative and the instructional; and second, the adjustments and shifts to more congruent explanations as a result of contingency strategies taken by both the lecturer and students in response to the students’ difficulties. The findings throw a different light onto dialogic learning in a new social constructivist pedagogical approach in a university context. The study reveals that while the students’ learning was a highly collaborative dialectical process, any transformations in understanding were not at all neatly incremental as described in the literature. Indeed, the negotiations were highly ‘peripatetic’; any increments in understanding were overall devolutionary. While the lecturer’s initial guidance reflected the monologic discourse of written economics, her responses became more congruent and reactive. It was shown that a key predictor of these contingency strategies was the kinds of meanings sought by the students’ extensive questioning. Hence, in this case study, the contingency strategies undertaken within the interactional dynamic reveal a different view of semiotic mediation, necessarily a process of semiotic remediation.

People {{make use of}} them to acquire knowledge, to get acquainted with others and to get things done. By examining the identifying clauses one can gain a preliminary understanding of the cognitive patterns of the human mind. In spite of the importance and ubiquity of identifying clauses, relevant studies {{are few and far}} between, and most of them have been carried out at a fairly general level and have not produced specific evidence-based insights. This thesis is intended to provide a comparatively complete picture of identifying clauses by exploring them mainly in three respects-grammatical characteristics, semantic implications and experiential / textual uses. As a systemic functional study, the thesis takes an inductive approach to examine the identifying clause, starting with extensive data analysis and moving to systemic conclusions. Enlightened by Matthiessen (2006 a), I combine the text-based method and corpus-based method, collecting the data from two sources - college textbooks / academic books and the Corpus of Contemporary American English. These two sources of data complement each other in view of the indeterminacy in identifying clauses. The data from the corpus are typically used in the examination of the grammatical characteristics, semantic implications and experiential uses of identifying clauses because of the comprehensiveness of the data that include typical and non-typical identifying clauses. The data from the textbooks and academic books, which take the form of long passages, are used particularly in the exploration of the textual uses of identifying processes. The data are approached in a trinocular perspective: from above, from roundabout and from below. The qualitative method is fundamental in this research, and the quantitative method is a supplement in supporting some of the findings obtained via the qualitative method and in presenting the findings from the corpus. The analyses of the data show that an identifying clause construes two semiotic processes simultaneously. One is denotation (foreground the special case is the extra-stratal realization process foregrounded by certain types of equative verbs), and the other is the inter/intra-stratal realization process (a semiotic process specific to identifying clauses). These two semiotic processes show different features in both grammatical characteristics and semantic implications. By examining the realizations of the participants and process of an identifying clause, I found that an identifying clause may have an eight-cell paradigm, four-cell paradigm or two-cell paradigm. The identifying clause is traditionally introduced as being characterized by an eight-cell paradigm, but the four-cell and two-cell identifying processes also exist due to three factors - semantic reversibility, the possible locations of tonic prominence and grammatical reversibility /Subject-Complement switchability. These three factors, examined on the lexicogrammatical stratum, are influenced by the factors on the <b>semantic</b> <b>stratum</b> respectively - external perspectival directionality 1, external perspectival directionality 2 and internal perspectival bidirectionality. The semantic implications frequently conveyed by identifying clauses are exhaustiveness and contrastiveness. The focus of the present research falls on the former. Traditionally, the exhaustive meaning has been studied mostly in so-called cleft constructions. However, it is also conveyed frequently by identifying clauses, {{depending on the type of}} exhaustiveness and the coding direction. In terms of referential exhaustiveness, exhaustiveness is indicated by the definiteness of the nominal group realizing the participant unless the nominal group denotes a class rather than an individual. In terms of realizational exhaustiveness, exhaustiveness is relevant to the coding direction. It is conveyed inevitably in encoding identifying clauses but optionally in decoding ones. In addition, the functions of only in identifying clauses are also investigated. The position variability is a significant feature of only, which is related to the textual and interpersonal statuses of only in an identifying clause. When conveying a meaning of exclusion, only is an Adjunct functioning either thematically or rhematically; when indicating an adjustment of an expectation, only is a mood Adjunct functioning interpersonally. The two main functions of only are (1) restricting the number of the possible interpretations of an identifying clause (in this way reducing the ambiguities inherent in identifying clauses) and (2) reinforcing the exhaustive meaning in an encoding identifying process and supplementing the exhaustive meaning in a decoding identifying process (that does not convey such a meaning in case of no only). The thesis examines the experiential and textual uses of identifying clauses by reference to the thematic and information structures of an identifying clause. The experiential uses of identifying clauses refer to their roles in construing the knowledge of the world, including specifying, defining, demonstration, naming, role identification, symbolization, exemplification, constitution, possession, circumstance, equation, counter-expectation and categorization. An identifying clause can function differently according to the coding direction of the information. The textual uses of identifying clauses refer to their roles played in presenting the knowledge as text, including topic introduction, topic maintenance, topic shift (phase/non-phase), evidence providing and summarizing/evaluation. A certain kind of textual use has a close relationship with a certain type of experiential use, such as definition with topic introduction and categorization with evaluation. Apart from these three main aspects, I also present a preliminary corpus-based study of identifying processes. The quantitative study of the data from the corpus shows two findings. First, the equative verbs of the same use tend to show a similar frequency of occurrence. The second concerns the dominant field and the comparatively marginal field of identifying processes in the academic genre. The thesis is guided by Halliday's conception of language as a system of choices, while at the same time shedding further light on this conception. It also demonstrates the cognitive pattern of the human mind in the process of identifying. The findings of the research can be applied to the evaluation of the quality of a textbook so as to find out a better way to design the textbooks to enhance the quality of education. In addition, the system of identifying clauses can be further expanded by the inclusion of an ergative perspective, the mood and modality and non-structural textual description.
