2500|$|Consider {{a smooth}} surface [...] in 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Near to any point, [...] can be {{approximated}} by its tangent plane at that point, which is an affine subspace of Euclidean space. Differential geometers in the 19th century {{were interested in the}} notion of development in which one surface was rolled along another, without slipping or twisting. In particular, the tangent plane to a point of [...] can be rolled on : this should be easy to imagine when [...] is a surface like the 2-sphere, which is the <b>smooth</b> <b>boundary</b> of a convex region. As the tangent plane is rolled on , the point of contact traces out a curve on [...] Conversely, given a curve on , the tangent plane can be rolled along that curve. This provides a way to identify the tangent planes at different points along the curve: in particular, a tangent vector in the tangent space at one point on the curve is identified with a unique tangent vector at any other point on the curve. These identifications are always given by affine transformations from one tangent plane to another.|$|E
2500|$|... for w {{a complex}} {{distribution}} of the complex variable z in some open set U, with derivatives that are locally L2, and where μ is a given complex function in L∞(U) of norm less than 1, called the Beltrami coefficient. Classically this differential equation was used by Gauss to prove the existence locally of isothermal coordinates on a surface with analytic Riemannian metric. Various techniques {{have been developed for}} solving the equation. The most powerful, developed in the 1950s, provides global solutions of the equation on C and relies on the Lp theory of the Beurling transform, a singular integral operator defined on LP(C) for all 1 < p < ∞. The same method applies equally well on the unit disk and upper half plane and plays a fundamental role in Teichmüller theory and the theory of quasiconformal mappings. Various uniformization theorems can be proved using the equation, including the measurable Riemann mapping theorem and the simultaneous uniformization theorem. The existence of conformal weldings can also be derived using the Beltrami equation. One of the simplest applications is to the Riemann mapping theorem for simply connected bounded open domains [...] in the complex plane. When the domain has <b>smooth</b> <b>boundary,</b> elliptic regularity for the equation can be used to show that the uniformizing map from the unit disk to the domain extends to a C∞ function from the closed disk to the closure of the domain.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the problem {{associated}} with abruptly mixing boundary conditions {{in the context of}} a two-dimensional semiconductor device simulator. Explicitly, this paper addresses the transition between an ohmic-type Dirichlet condition and a passivated Neumann boundary.

Subsequently, the calculated observables (most notably the potential) exhibit discontinuous derivatives near the surface at the point where the boundary type switches.
