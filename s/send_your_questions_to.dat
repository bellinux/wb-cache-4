40|$|You {{can order}} CHN promotional {{material}} online. A vari-ety of attractive material is available, such as magnets, pens, posters, bookmarks, pamphlets, and several information sheets. These items {{are great for}} outreach activities and are quality health information resources that you can recom-mend with confidence. Consider having a supply available for your library users. Here are the directions to access the CHN promotional material: (1) Go to www. canadian-health-network. ca (2) Select “Contact Us” (3) Scroll down the page and locate the heading “Still have questions?” (4) Choose “Order promotional items” Furthermore, in the “Still have questions? ” section, please note that you or <b>your</b> users can <b>send</b> a <b>question</b> <b>to</b> CHN and receive a customized response within 5 days. Select the dis-ease prevention, group, or topic area, and <b>send</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the affiliate {{who is responsible for}} that area. For example, you could direct a question about complementary and alter-native health to the Consumer Health Information Service at the Toronto Public Library. Please note that only health in-formation, not health advice, can be provided. A special youth area was launched in October 2006, and it can be accessed from the CHN’s main Web page. If you have young family members and (or) library users interested in youth health, direct them to this customized interface.

40|$|The Taverna {{team are}} pleased to {{announce}} {{the release of the}} Taverna 2. 5. 0 Workbench. [URL] Taverna 2. 5. 0 includes additional functionality (interaction service, PROV support, components), a simplified installation, user interface improvements and bug-fixes. Simplified Installation To simplify installation on common operating systems, Taverna distributions now come bundled with the Java Runtime Environment from OpenJDK and, {{in the case of the}} Workbench, the required Graphviz binaries. The installation no longer requires you to install the JCE Strong Encryption policy. Domain-specific versions Taverna Workbench and Command Line Tool are now available in domain-specific versions for Astronomy, Biodiversity, Bioinformatics and Digital Preservation. Domain-specific editions add support for specific service types and come pre-populated with lists of available services and example workflows that are specifically tailored for a given domain. The Core edition contains a Taverna Workbench suitable for building scientific workflows in any domain, accessing general services such as REST or SOAP Web services and command line tools. Enterprise Taverna is equivalent to the Core edition with BioMart,BioMoby, SoapLab, API Consumer, Service Catalogue and WebDAV installed. Interaction service The Interaction Service has been added to the Workbench. This provides the ability <b>to</b> ask <b>questions</b> and tell information users during the running of the workflow. Unlike the previous interactive local workers, this service uses web pages, and therefore also works when running workflows on a Taverna Server via Taverna Player. Component service The Component capability has been added. This allows the usage of component services, which encapsulate a nested Taverna workflow that has been constructed and described for compatiblity with other components within a chosen Component Family. This allows for publication of reusable and shareable workflow fragments, which appear as single services within the master workflow. Provenance Support for exporting Taverna-PROV provenance format has been added. This adds a new button “Save Provenance Bundle” when clicking “Save All” from the results perspective. The provenance bundle is a ZIP file containing all input, output and intermediate values as separate files, along with the provenance of the workflow run. The bundle is based on the Research Object Bundle specification, and complies with the W 3 C PROV-O provenance specification. For details, see [URL] Tutorials and examples Tutorials for Taverna are available under the Taverna 2. x documentation. Example workflows can be found under the Starter pack tab in the myExperiment perspective of the Workbench. They can also be downloaded from the myExperiment Web site. Known issues Although Taverna 2. 5. 0 contains many improvements there are some known issues with it. These are detailed in our issue tracker Jira. System requirements Please check the details of Taverna 2. 5 system requirements. Licence and source code All editions of Taverna, except for Astronomy, are distributed under the LGPL 2. 1 licence. The Astronomy editions are distributed under the GPL 3 licence. The source code for Taverna can be retrieved from our Subversion repository. We also recommend you to sign up to the taverna-hackers mailing list if you are a developer. Reporting problems If you find any problems that are not listed in our Jira, then please send them to the taverna-users or taverna-hackers mailing lists. Our support team is monitoring the mailing lists and will try <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> <b>questions</b> as soon as possible.

40|$|The massive {{growth in}} English {{as a medium}} of {{instruction}} (EMI) in non-English-dominant universities {{in recent years is}} undisputed. However, it raises questions about the quality and standard of such programmes for all kinds of students: domestic, international, outgoing, incoming and returning. This workshop focuses on the language-related aspects of English-medium programmes, addressing questions about language/content learning, English language proficiency, entry and exit level English-language requirements, pre- and in-session English-language training. The workshop is divided into two parts. The first provides an overview of the what, where and why of English as a medium of instruction. In terms of the what, it seeks to clarify and define ‘EMI’, distinguishing it from other terms with which it is often confused. In terms of where, it provides an overview of the extent of EMI according to country, discipline and tier; and in terms of why, it discusses the reasons for the dramatic rise in EMI programmes. The second part of the workshop will be tailor-made to the audience and address specific questions and concerns about language-related issues of EMI. This part of the workshop depends on attendees emailing <b>questions</b> prior <b>to</b> the event.

If temperature is non-uniform, diffusion of heat occurs. If concentration of a species is non-uniform, diffusion of matter occurs. The simplest mass diffusion problem is the diffusion of a trace of inert gas (e. g perfume) in a environment of inert gas (air).
