60|$|It {{was getting}} dark {{when they came}} in sight of Star Ranch. They made out a long, low {{building}} on the southern slope of a small hill. It was built in modern bungalow fashion, having been erected by Mr. Endicott after the original log dwelling had been destroyed by fire. It was divided into a sitting-room fifteen feet by twenty-five, an office, a good-sized dining-hall, a kitchen, and eight bedrooms, and a bath. Water was pumped from a brook {{at the foot of the}} hill, and the rooms were lighted by a new system of gasoline gas. The ranch home was comfortably furnished, and in the sitting-room were a bookcase filled with good reading, and a new player piano, with a <b>combination</b> <b>cabinet</b> of sheet music and music rolls.|$|R
50|$|Lange {{strongly}} supported the 1984 budget, and promoted it to party and public. Douglas and Lange were a formidable political <b>combination,</b> both in <b>Cabinet</b> and in public, where Lange's humour and rhetoric complemented the determination and single-mindedness embodied in Douglas's commitment to economic restructuring.|$|R
5000|$|These moves, in <b>combination</b> {{with his}} <b>cabinet's</b> {{constitutional}} tinkering and his antics and breaches of protocol around the monarch, fostered suspicion that Trudeau harboured republican notions; it was rumoured by Paul Martin, Sr. that the Queen was worried the Crown [...] "had little meaning for him." [...] In response to Trudeau's {{attitude towards the}} monarchy, the Monarchist League of Canada was founded in 1970 to promote Canada's status as a constitutional monarchy.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} days of QOTSA much of his late setup from Kyuss was still being used, later Homme turned more towards Ampeg amplifers and cabinets, though {{throughout}} his career Homme has experimented a lot with different <b>combinations</b> of amplifiers, <b>cabinets,</b> and settings- especially in studio. When recording, Homme usually opts to use small, often cheap, low wattage amps in bright rooms rather than large, loud amplifiers. Here is a list of some of the equipment he has been known to have used: ...|$|R
50|$|Digital {{modeling}} {{attempts to}} recreate the unique characteristics of musical instruments and pro audio gear. Early Line 6 products used digital modeling to emulate the signature tone of a guitar amp/speaker combination. Further development of Line 6's modeling technology has extended the emulation to include numerous guitar amplifier / guitar <b>cabinet</b> <b>combinations,</b> guitar effects, microphones, and even different guitars and other fretted instruments themselves. Digital modeling offers countless virtual combinations {{of a variety of}} music gear, but only as emulations, however convincing as they may be.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} is {{developed}} a proposal of environment indicators needed for the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) process in Mexico’s Federal District (FD); through which are authorized the construction and realization of different work actions and activities. The methodology {{is based on the}} <b>combination</b> of <b>cabinet</b> and field work, performed in three stages. In the first, a documental review was carried out within the topic of Environment Impact (EI), the EIA and the study area, with a subsequent analysis of the environment indicators at an international, national and regional scale. In the second, the systematization of information was performed for the sixteen study cases at a local scale and the organization and analysis of a data base with the allotted information. And in the last stage, a field work was realized with participative observations in three verification sites and interview applications to the principal actors of the EIA process. These results allowed: to determine the main limitations within the EIA process (methodological, technical and operational), to propose an indicators scheme, and to formulate recommendations focused on the improvement of this Environment Public Policy instrument.   </p...|$|R
50|$|Alexi Laiho {{has used}} the Lee Jackson GP-1000 preamp since after touring and {{recording}} Something Wild, where he used a Peavey 5150, and up until his endorsement with ENGL, still always employed it with various other different amps and preamps, creating a stereo of amp sounds. For {{the first half of}} his career, he used Marshall 1960A cabinets (with 75-watt Celestion speakers) and various power amps, including Lee Jackson Sp-1000, Rocktron Velocity 300 among others. After Hate Crew Deathroll, he started experimenting with different amp heads including the Krank Revolution, Marshall JCM800 KK (which he used to record Blooddrunk, and which he still uses frequently), and the Engl Special Edition EL34 head (in Sinergy, mainly). As of late August 2011, Laiho is signed with Engl and is using the e530 preamp with various power amp and <b>cabinet</b> <b>combinations</b> since their last 2011 tour.|$|R
5000|$|Crossovers {{are used}} because most {{individual}} loudspeaker drivers {{are incapable of}} covering the entire audio spectrum from low frequencies to high frequencies with acceptable relative volume and absence of distortion. Most hi-fi speaker systems and sound reinforcement system speaker <b>cabinets</b> <b>combination</b> of multiple loudspeaker drivers, each catering to a different frequency band. A standard simple example is hi-fi and PA system cabinets that contain a woofer for low and mid frequencies and a tweeter for high frequencies. Since a sound signal source, be it recorded music from a CD player or a live band's mix from an audio console has all of the low, mid and high frequencies combined, a crossover circuit is used to split the audio signal into separate frequency bands that can be separately routed to loudspeakers, tweeters or horns optimized for those frequency bands.|$|R
5|$|Due to the {{top secret}} nature of the work, the Los Alamos Laboratory was isolated. Feynman indulged his curiosity by {{discovering}} the <b>combination</b> locks on <b>cabinets</b> and desks used to secure papers. He found that people tended to leave their safes unlocked, or leave them on the factory settings, or write the combinations down, or use easily guessable combinations like dates. Feynman played jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), {{and found that the}} three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.|$|R

Death of itself produces a [...] certain tendency to view more warmly what was before admired, and [...] more slightly anything that was not. And by stirring the thought [...] of the nation through the press it commonly throws lights upon the [...] subject either new in themselves or new in their <b>combination.</b> [...] Twelve <b>cabinet</b> ministers I have already reckoned in my mind, all [...] carried off by the rude hand {{of death in the}} last five years, [...] during which three only have been made. They are: Lord Dalhousie, [...] Lord Aberdeen, Lord Herbert, Sir J. Graham, Lord Canning, Lord [...] Elgin, Sir G.

6000|$|On {{the paper}} duties there are, I think, only {{three members of}} the [...] cabinet who have a strong feeling of the need of a remedy for the [...] late aggression—Lord John Russell, Gibson, W.

40|$|Effective November 29, 2007, CBOT amended {{its rules}} related to cabinet transactions. A cabinet trade {{is an option}} trade {{executed}} in a deep out-of-the-money option at a premium value less than the standard minimum tick. Each option product chapter defines the standard minimum tick increment and the allowable cabinet increments applicable to that product. For example, the standard minimum tick in Five-Year Treasury Note options is 1 / 64 of one point ($ 15. 625), and a cabinet trade in Five-Year Treasury Note options may be executed at a premium ranging from Cab 1 ($ 1. 00) to Cab 15 ($ 15. 00) in $ 1. 00 increments per option contract. On the electronic trading system, cabinet transactions may occur only at Cab 1 ($ 1. 00). The amended product chapter rules permit the execution of cabinet transactions to initiate or to liquidate a position. Previously, CBOT rules allowed cabinet transactions for liquidating purposes only. Additionally, amended CBOT Rule 542 (“Simultaneous Spread and Combination Transactions”) permits spread or <b>combination</b> transactions involving <b>cabinet</b> options only if the traded price of the spread or combination is an acceptable cabinet increment, as defined for the particular option, or one standard tick...|$|R
5000|$|Lacey {{personally}} {{built his}} current effects pedalboard, describing his setup and collection of pedals as being [...] "kind of overkill", but believes {{the fact it}} is his profession makes it justifiable, stating that he likes [...] "the idea of having nice tools". Lacey uses a Gig Rig analog controller, which has 10 different effects and loops programmed in. Along with his Brand New bandmate Vincent Accardi, Lacey owns numerous effects, and often post details of their new and modified effects to the bands Instagram feed. Effects that Lacey has used include: a Boss TU-2 guitar tuner, Vox Wah, Boss TR-2 tremolo, Boss DD-2 digital delay, Boss DD-5, Line6 DL4 delay, Pro Co RAT, MXR Blue Box, Ibanez TS9 Tube Screamer, Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail, a Big Muff, Small Sound/Big Sound Buzz, Hot Cake overdrive, Boss RV-5, Boss NS-2, and a Morley ABY Selector Switch, among many others. Over the years, Lacey has used multiple amplifier and <b>cabinet</b> <b>combinations,</b> which include: a Marshall Super Lead, Vox AC30, Matchless Phoenix 35, Fender Hot Rod Deville 4x10, Fender Triple, Fender Twin Reverb, and an Orange Rockerverb among others, {{most of which are}} played through a THD Hot Plate. On the Your Favorite Weapon tours he used a Fender Roc Pro 1000 amp head.|$|R
6000|$|His eyes rested, with {{something}} of the vanity of an author, upon the yellow leaflet which Mary held in her hand. She rose, took her seat {{at the head of}} the table, poured out tea for her colleagues, and gave her opinion upon the leaflet. So she had poured out tea, so she had criticized Mr. Clacton's leaflets a hundred times already; but now it seemed to her that she was doing it in a different spirit; she had enlisted in the army, and was a volunteer no longer. She had renounced something and was now--how could she express it?--not quite [...] "in the running" [...] for life. She had always known that Mr. Clacton and Mrs. Seal were not in the running, and across the gulf that separated them she had seen them in the guise of shadow people, flitting in and out of the ranks of the living--eccentrics, undeveloped human beings, from whose substance some essential part had been cut away. All this had never struck her so clearly as it did this afternoon, when she felt that her lot was cast with them for ever. One view of the world plunged in darkness, so a more volatile temperament might have argued after a season of despair, let the world turn again and show another, more splendid, perhaps. No, Mary thought, with unflinching loyalty to what appeared to her to be the true view, having lost what is best, I do not mean to pretend that any other view does instead. Whatever happens, I mean to have no presences in my life. Her very words had a sort of distinctness which is sometimes produced by sharp, bodily pain. To Mrs. Seal's secret jubilation the rule which forbade discussion of shop at tea-time was overlooked. Mary and Mr. Clacton argued with a cogency and a ferocity which made the little woman feel that something very important--she hardly knew what--was taking place. She became much excited; one crucifix became entangled with another, and she dug a considerable hole in the table with the point of her pencil in order to emphasize the most striking heads of the discourse; and how any <b>combination</b> of <b>Cabinet</b> Ministers could resist such discourse she really did not know.|$|R
40|$|As the foodservice {{industry}} {{moves into}} the twenty-first century, it will face serious labor problems, changing consumer preferences, and increased competition. Holding cooked food hot without adversely affecting its taste, texture, or appearance would allow operators to expand their menus without increasing service times, while making the operation more efficient by reducing labor and food costs. First step to extending holding times was {{the design of a}} humidified, hot holding cabinet suitable for data collection. Working with CresCor engineers, a cabinet was modified to improve stability and recovery time. The modified cabinet was used {{to determine the effects of}} temperature and humidity on hot held hamburgers prepared on both a flat griddle and a gas charbroil grill. Samples were pulled from the holding cabinet every 30 minutes for four hours, checked for yield and then subjected to texture, moisture, fat, and rancidity analyses. Nine different <b>combinations</b> of <b>cabinet</b> temperatures (150, 160, and 170 ∘ F) and humidities (70, 80, and 90 percent) were tested. Following laboratory analysis, a semi-trained sensory panel of 22 judges was convened to check for changes in appearance, flavor, texture, and overall acceptability. Results were analyzed using the general linear model. No significant changes were noted in any of the laboratory analyses except moisture content and yield. While temperature had no effect on either the rate of moisture loss or changes in yield, humidity significantly affected both. The rate of moisture loss decreased linearly with increasing relative humidity while the yield increased linearly with humidity. The sensory panel failed to detect statistically significant differences (at α = 0. 05) in the color, flavor, or tenderness of patties that were held up to four hours in a cabinet at 160 degrees Fahrenheit and 95 percent relative humidity. The panel was able to detect a decrease in the moist appearance and juiciness at 150 minutes. The only the sample that had been held for 180 minutes was significantly lower in overall acceptability. Base on the results of this study, it is possible to hold hamburgers two hours without significant loss of quality. ...|$|R
