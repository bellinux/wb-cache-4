A possible correction, making use of a chemical trap consisting of <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> <b>pellets,</b> is successfully experimented at Cava dei Selci site (Roma, Italy).

50|$|A simple whole plant respirometer {{designed}} to measure oxygen uptake or CO2 release consists of a sealed container with the living specimen together with a substance to absorb the carbon dioxide given off during respiration, such as <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> <b>pellets</b> or cotton wads soaked with potassium hydroxide. The oxygen uptake is detected by manometry. Typically, a U-tube manometer is used, which directly shows the pressure difference between the container and the atmosphere. As an organism takes up O2, it generates a proportionate quantity of CO2 (see respiratory quotient), but all the CO2 is absorbed by the <b>soda</b> <b>lime.</b> Therefore, all of the drop of pressure in the chamber {{can be attributed to}} the drop of O2 partial pressure in the container. The rate of change gives a direct and reasonably accurate reading for the organism's rate of respiration.|$|R

40|$|We {{have succeeded}} in forming {{polycrystalline}} silicon (poly-Si) films with thicknesses of over 4 μm on <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass by flash lamp annealing (FLA) of precursor amorphous Si (a-Si) films deposited by catalytic chemical vapor deposition (Cat-CVD). The insertion of Cr thin films between glass substrates and a-Si significantly improves the adhesion of Si films to the glass substrates, resulting in uniform crystallization of a-Si in 20 × 20 mm^ 2 area. Several types of substrate, such as quartz substrates, are also used instead of <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass to elucidate {{the effects of the}} properties of glass substrates on formation of the poly-Si films. A-Si films tend to be crystallized under lower irradiance than those on quartz glass substrates, which can be described by the lower thermal conductivity and the thermal diffusion length of <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass. Raman spectra of the poly-Si films on <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass show high crystallinity close to unity. The utilization of <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> glass with poor thermal resistivity is of great importance for the cost-effective mass production of thin-film poly-Si solar cells...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} the direct {{assessment}} of the dissolved CO 2 concentration in supersaturated water is presented {{that is based on}} changes to the physical chemistry of <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> due to uptake of CO 2. The approach is an adaptation of a standard method used for the quantification of soil respiration, and was found to agree with pCO 2 measurements made using infrared gas analysis. In this method, the <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> is deployed in a CO 2 bucket chamber, and a water sample is allowed to outgas for 48 hours. The initial dissolved CO 2 concentration is then determined from changes in the dry mass of <b>soda</b> <b>lime,</b> which is blank-corrected and adjusted based on differences in molecular weights of <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> before and after the chemical adsorption of CO 2. The method is applicable to highly-supersaturated surface water and emergent groundwater...|$|R
40|$|This was a {{prospective}} study comparing the cost implications between two carbon dioxide (CO 2) absorbers, <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> (Intersurgical) and AMSORB® PLUS. The {{study was conducted}} over two 4 -week periods in two dedicated operating theatres using Datex Ohmeda Aestiva/ 5 anaesthetic machines. AMSORB® PLUS was used during the first four weeks and <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> (Intersurgical) the following four weeks. General anaesthesia was administered as routinely done but fresh gas flow (FGF) during the maintenance phase was limited to a maximum flow of 2 L/min. The CO 2 absorber was only changed when there was evidence of exhaustion. Total duration of anaesthesia, sevoflurane (bottles) and CO 2 absorber (kg) consumption, and amount of waste product (kg) was calculated {{at the end of}} each study period. The total cost of delivering general anaesthesia was lower in the AMSORB® PLUS group, RM 82. 40 (USD 19. 89) /hour versus the <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> group, RM 91. 50 (USD 22. 09) /hour (p= 0. 17), which translates to a 10 % reduction in cost per hour. Reduction in sevoflurane consumption in the AMSORB® PLUS compared to the <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> group was also not statistically significant (p= 0. 22). The only significant finding was the reduction in CO 2 absorber consumption in the AMSORB® PLUS group as compared to <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> group (p= 0. 001). In conclusion, AMSORB® PLUS consumption was significantly reduced compared to that of <b>soda</b> <b>lime.</b> However, the use of AMSORB® PLUS did not significantly reduce sevoflurane consumption nor the total cost of delivering general anaesthesia. Given the superior safety profile, AMSORB® PLUS may be a suitable, cost-effective alternative to <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> in the daily practice of anaesthesia...|$|R

40|$|A GREAT deal of {{work has}} been done on the use of <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> for carbon dioxide {{absorption}} in anaesthesia, much of which has been described by Adriani (1946). In the course of a laboratory study of carbon dioxide absorption, some further informa-tion has been obtained, and this is des-cribed here. This paper does not deal expressly with the carbon dioxide absorptive efficiency (which determines the concentration re-turned to the patient) or the effective life of a charge of <b>soda</b> <b>lime,</b> as these depend to a very large extent on the apparatus in which the <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> is used. Several of the items discussed in this paper, however, have considerable bearing on these topics, and these influences are described. SIZE OF GRANULES It is well known that, in this country, anaesthetic <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> is invariably a nominal 4 - 8 mesh or finer. The British Pharmacopoeia (1953) stipulates a nomi-nal 3 - 6 mesh, but this has since been modified to 4 — 8 mesh (Amendments, Sep-tember 1954). In deciding on the most suitable mesh range for anaesthetic <b>soda</b> <b>lime,</b> a number of factors must be considered. Those factors in favour of a coarser mesh are: (a) A coarser mesh has a lower resist-ance to air-flow. in 422 (b) With a very fine mesh, there is some tendency to caking. On the other hand, there are advantages using finer mesh material. These are: (a) A finer material presents a larger surface area for the same mass, so that the absorptive efficiency is increased. (b) With a particle of smaller effective radius, the rate of regeneration of the surface is greater, as the car-bonate ions formed by the ab-sorption have a shorter distance to diffuse before reaching the interior of the granule. (c) More of a finer <b>soda</b> <b>lime</b> is con-tained in the canister, particularly with a wider mesh range, giving a greater absorptive capacity. (d) With finer mesh <b>soda</b> <b>lime,</b> effects due to channelling (see below) are decreased, giving a longer fully effective life, particularly on a circle system. (e) With a finer mesh <b>soda</b> <b>lime,</b> par-ticularly with a wider mesh range, the intergranular air space is re-duced, so that on a to-and-fro or a Coxeter-Mushin system the dead space of the system is re-duced, this benefit being particu-larly noticeable when the charge is partly exhausted...|$|R
