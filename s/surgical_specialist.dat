40|$|This {{clinical}} research plan {{was designed to}} evaluate the predictable and current developments, growth, and stability of the economic status of part-time or full-time African-American practicing surgeons. In many communities throughout the United States, the economic successes of certified or experienced black <b>surgical</b> <b>specialists</b> are inhibited or modified by mistrust, jealousy, professional disengagements, prejudices, and self-hatred by black and white physicians and lay African Americans. Nevertheless, there are subtle and overt evidences of increasing satisfactory and above average associative interprofessional relationships between African-American physicians and <b>surgical</b> <b>specialists.</b> One hundred African-American <b>surgical</b> <b>specialists</b> from thirty-four communities in the United States were interviewed at periodic intervals {{over a period of}} three decades.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{specialty}} colleges {{under the umbrella}} of the AVMA. The goal of specialty colleges is to create individuals with more expertise in defined areas of veterinary medicine. Specialty colleges ensure and verify that all members meet requirements in regards to training, knowledge, and skill. A Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons has completed an approved surgical training program (typically a 3-year residency), met specific training and caseload requirements, performed research and had their findings published, completed credentialing by the ACVS, and passed rigorous examination. After completion of these requirements and certification as a Diplomate of the ACVS a veterinarian can be considered a veterinary <b>surgical</b> <b>specialist.</b>|$|E
