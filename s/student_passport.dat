40|$|Oscail, the Irish National Distance Education Centre has {{developed}} its strategy of us-ing technology to improve learning opportunities {{at a pace}} whichmatches the expecta-tions, access, and skills of its students. Since its inception in 1982, Oscail has monitored new technological developments on a continuing basis, while taking account of access to technology among its students. Oscail undergraduates {{are required to take}} an IntroductoryModule prior to starting credit modules. These modules act as a filtering programme that allows the students to assess their readiness to learn in the distance learning environment. The modules are designed to help students to update or to acquire skills for studying at university level; they provide a ‘taster ’ of distance education and give students the opportunity to try out the format without committing themselves to a long course; they also give a gen-eral introduction to the discipline. In the traditional mode of delivery, these modules use conventional text based material, supported by face-to-face tutorials. In 2004, <b>Student</b> <b>Passport</b> to E-Learning (SPEL) Project, was launched with finan-cial support from the Health Education Authority (HEA) Targeted Initiative Fund. Es...|$|E

The team was tasked with the design and construction of a photovoltaic system for San Pedro Roman Catholic Primary School in San Pedro, Belize, with the purpose of enabling the school to achieve carbon neutrality with respect to utility grid power consumption. The team of five students collaborated primarily with two professors, two alumni, and an accomplished electrical contractor from Belize to perform six months of design and preconstruction work before ultimately delivering a fourteen-panel photovoltaic system with a projected average output of 13. 4 kilowatt-hours per day. My role on this project was to manage shipping of materials and equipment from San Luis Obispo, California to Belize City, Belize, and to provide construction labor during the system’s installation. I worked directly with our NECA student scheduler and interfaced with our NECA student cost estimator during preconstruction. This project has provided outstanding lessons learned and has aided me in my professional development by demonstrating the incredible logistics and planning necessary to complete international projects...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} outline the {{importance}} of implementing an instructional design model which incorporates a continuous cycle of evaluation, revision and implementation. The context is {{a case study of}} a distance learning module which was first presented in 1993 as an introductory module for students taking an Oscail BA programme. As the majority of Oscail students are adults returning to education after a long period of absence from formal education, providing learners with a supportive learning environment which would ease re-entering the educational world has always been one of Oscail’s key goals. Between 1993 and 2002, the Introductory Module was offered in the traditional distance education format and was subject to regular evaluation and revision (Lorenzi, MacKeogh and Fox, 2004; MacKeogh and Lorenzi, 2005). By early 2000, the wider accessibility of technology encouraged Oscail to combine the need to prepare students for university study with the development of e-learning skills. In 2002 the Introductory Module was reconstituted as the SPEL (<b>Student</b> <b>Passport</b> for E-learning) module and was presented for three years. A review of the module in 2006 indicated shortfalls in what is described in the literature as the bolt-on ‘skills approach’ which makes use of ‘a set of atomized skills – removed from subject specific domains’ (Lea & Street, 1998 : 158). This prompted a rethink of the overall approach to preparing students for study, and resulted in a decision to adopt an embedded approach to e-skills development. It was hoped that a task-based approach to applying skills to subject specific activities would improve the quality of the learning experience and ultimately result in better retention rates. A review of the implementation of the embedded approach in the first year reveals that while students reported an increase in skills development over the module, and identified a number of positive features, the approach did not succeed in increasing retention. Detailed evaluation including surveys of tutors and students as well as online focus groups have identified a number of factors which militated against the achievement of some of the goals of the module. These included the scheduling of activities, workload, a shorter than usual academic year, insufficient tutor training and student induction, and administrative support. This paper will start with a brief overview of instructional design systems and the models used by Oscail in developing its elearning programmes. We will then outline the way in which through a cycle of implementation, evaluation and revision, the original introductory module evolved into a full year-long module comprising an embedded portfolio of study skills tasks. We will describe the outcomes of the embedded SPEL programme and will outline the evaluation process that has led to further revisions. We will discuss the specific issues that have emerged from the evaluations and will show what measures have been put in place to overcome the difficulties encountered. We will conclude with some observations on the changing roles of stakeholders in the context of new elearning approaches...|$|E

40|$|The {{strategic}} location, {{economic and}} political stabilities, regional and international developments and a relatively cheaper cost of living collectively {{contribute to the development}} and growth of education in Malaysia, in line with the vision of becoming a regional hub of education excellence. To attract more foreign students, Private Higher Education Institutions (PHEIs) were encouraged to provide world-class qualifications and holistic education through collaborations with foreign academic partners. However, the education industry was ill equipped to meet the issues that emerged with the influx of foreign students and the underlying advantages were not sufficient to ensure sustainable and continuous recruitment of foreign students. Raising the standards of the infrastructure alone is not enough; {{there is a need to}} look at the existing Policies, which form the backbone of a successful education export industry. This Study investigates the impact of Education and Immigration Policies on the recruitment of foreign students to PHEIs in Malaysia using the Cheng and Cheung Policy Analysis Framework and the qualitative and quantitative research paradigms. It concludes that the Policy Analysis Framework is suitable in the current context and that generally the findings suggest that Education and Immigration Policies impact the recruitment of foreign students to PHEIs in Malaysia. Specifically, Education Policies, in relation to the administration of the Institutions, such as marketing strategies, and the teaching of the Compulsory Subjects, affect recruitment of foreign students. As for Immigration Policies, the carrying of <b>Student</b> <b>Passports</b> is inconvenient and the alternative of the International Student Card is timely and necessary and the Immigration Procedures should be more student-friendly. The policy to allow foreign students to work may not increase the number of foreign students, as the current conditions are too restrictive. To overcome the current shortcomings in the policies concerned, there is a need for the review of these policies by looking at their formulation, implementation and impact. Any attempts to re-draw the policies must be supported with substantive research and participation from PHEIs. Policies are only successful if the objectives are formulated and implemented correctly and stakeholders’ participation is incorporated from the very beginning.

30|$|From a {{practical}} perspective, {{the existence of}} stable individual differences provides a potential solution to poor levels of accuracy on everyday face identification tasks. Selecting high-performing individuals for professional roles that involve face identification has been advocated {{in a number of}} scientific papers on this topic (e.g., Bindemann et al., 2012; Bobak, Bennetts, et al., 2016; Russell et al., 2009; White, Kemp, Jenkins, Matheson, & Burton, 2014). Moreover, a number of professional organizations have now begun to select face identification specialists using standardized tests. A widely publicized example is the ‘super-recognizer unit’ at the London Metropolitan Police Service (Radden Keefe, 2016). Recent tests of individuals in this specialist team show that they outperform university students by an average of around 15 % on standard tests of face identification ability (Davis, Lander, Evans, & Jansari, 2016; Robertson, Noyes, Dowsett, Jenkins, & Burton, 2016).
