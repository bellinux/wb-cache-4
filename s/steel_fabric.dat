They include {{composite materials}} made {{of different types of}} organic matrix (i. e., cement-based mortar and pozzolan-reaction cementitious mortar) and reinforcement (i. e., <b>steel</b> fibre <b>fabric).</b> An experimental investigation has been carried out on prestressed-concrete beams strengthened in flexure with traditional (i. e., pultruded carbon laminate bonded with epoxy resin) and different innovative composite externally bonded systems (i. e., <b>steel</b> <b>fabrics</b> glued with different types of adhesive) in order to compare their structural performance between them and with respect to unstrengthened specimens. At this aim, a total of fifteen specimens characterized by an overall length of 2400 mm and cross-sectional dimensions of 120 by 140 mm were subjected to four-point-bending tests. Test results highlighted the high potential of the innovative composite systems for flexural strengthening applications and similar effectiveness compared with the pultruded carbon laminates.

40|$|Purpose – To {{evaluate}} manufacturers' {{claims that}} structural polypropylene fibres provide satisfactory {{crack control reinforcement}} and compare the findings against <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> used as crack control in screeds where tensile forces are likely to occur. Design/methodology/approach – The procedure used to provide load, deflection data, toughness indices and residual strength factors was compliant with ASTM C 1018 - 97 and in part ASTM C 78 - 02 to define first crack toughness and first crack strength. Findings – A 142 <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforcement as used in screeds was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{with the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete. Where polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete did have an advantage over the steel reinforced concrete was when I 20 was exceeded and the deflection and crack width was excessive. <b>Steel</b> <b>fabric</b> tended to fail and/or the screed material failed either prior to or in excess of I 20, whereas the fibre reinforced concrete held together albeit at a very much reduced load transfer when compared with <b>steel</b> <b>fabric.</b> Practical implications – If the forces to be encountered through expansion or contraction are small, then, due to the small distances between the fibres redistributing the stress and minimising the cracks within the concrete matrix, polypropylene fibres may be suitable for crack control when directly compared with A 142 fabric reinforcement. The use of fibres has benefits to the floor screed companies, using screed-laying machines as the process avoids laying steel on which the screed machine will have to operate. Originality/value – There is a general lack of research coverage examining crack control in screed floor finishing materials...|$|E

Three concrete beam types were produced, plain, steel reinforced and fibre reinforced, and a comparative study was undertaken of post crack flexural toughness. The procedure used was to manufacture steel A 142 fabric and macro fibre reinforced concrete beams to provide load, deflection data, toughness indices and was compliant with, ASTM C 1018 - 97, [ASTM, 1997] using a three point loading arrangement. The data was representative of what might occur in a floor slab. The findings of the paper is that A 1 42 <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforcement as used in slabs was more effective in producing toughness and residual strength when directly compared {{to the performance of}} structural polypropylene fibre reinforced concrete.

In contrast, another typical wall was constructed without using <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> (WOSF).

Wall was set up as pinned-fixed at the top and lowest end. The loading consist of uniformly distributed axial load connected to hydraulic jack and has 2000 kN capacity limit. Analysis of result was done based on the ultimate load carrying capacity, wall displacement, mode of failure and cracking pattern. From experimental work, the ultimate load carrying capacity for WSF was 1729. 1 kN and 1968. 3 kN for wall WOSF respectively.

By using the short wall panel, time and cost can be reduced which in the end contributed to intelligent use of time and cost towards the economic recession. This research is conducted to determine the structural behaviour of the reinforced concrete wall panel using short wall panel.

Two wall panels reinforced with single layer <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> of type B 375 (B 7) with a dimension 75 x 500 x 1000 (Width: Height: Length) were prepared.

In line with this, the use of crushed concrete waste aggregate (CCwA) as a coarse aggregate in mix production of wall panel structural element was investigated. This research was conducted to study the behaviour of the <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforced concrete short wall panel as IBS component incorporating CCwA replacing the Natural Aggregate (NA). Ten (10) samples were prepared using Grade 30 normal Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete with water cement ratio of 0. 55, measuring 75 mm x 500 mm x 1000 mm (Thickness:Height:Length). The aspect ratio (H/L) and slendemess ratio (H/t) of the wall panel were 0. 5 and 6. 67 respectively. Two (2) wall panels were prepared with single layer and two (2) wall panels with double layer <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> using CCwA as a coarse aggregate. Two (2) more wall panel sample with single and double layers each using Natural Aggregate (NA) as control samples. In addition, four (4) samples (2 single layer and 2 double layers were tested on fatigue load test to determine the ultimate cycles at failure. The short wall panel was subjected to compressive axial and fatigue load with pinned-fixed end conditions at upper and lower ends. The experimental result shows that all ten (10) wall panels failed in compression shear with crushing at upper and lower end edges of the wall panel. The average ultimate load for single and double layer <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforced concrete short wall panel were 1349 kN and 1643 kN respectively. A single curvature crushing crack pattern was dominant for all samples with average maximum lateral displacement for single and double layer of <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforced concrete short wall panel were 2. 9 mm and 3. 8 mm respectively, both occurred at 375 mm (0. 7 H) wall height. The structural behaviour of reinforced concrete short wall panel using CCwA as a coarse aggregate was similar with wall panel using NA in terms of structure strength capacity, displacement profile, and mode of failure. The percentage of difference between using CCwA and NA in wall panel in term of ultimate strength was decreased by 5. 5 % and 6. 6 % for single layer and double layer of wall panel respectively. The findings confirmed that the performance of CCwA is as good as NA. The use of CCwA wall panel helps to reduce unnecessary wastages and also prevent depletion of natural resources.

The wall is reinforced with <b>steel</b> <b>fabric</b> of size B 7 and concrete Grade 30 mix with <b>steel</b> <b>fabric.</b> The wall foundation samples were tested under lateral static load with the load applied upper of the wall he ight wall. The support condition was considered as fixed {{at the lower end}} foundation. The ultimate load sustained by the samples is 30 kN with maximum displacement of 35 mm before failure. From the observation, there are failure cracks along the connection and {{at the side of the}} connection that influence the strength of the connection itself. Wall foundation 1 started to crack when load reach the value of 5 kN with maximum deflection of 15. 44 mm while for sample 2, wall foundation started to crack when applied load reach the value of 5. 97 kN with maximum deflection of 10. 37 mm. Lastly, for sample 3, wall foundation started to crack when applied load reach the value of 8. 58 kN with maximum deflection of 20. 13 mm. From research the maximum bending stress for sample 1, 2 and 3 is 3. 75 kN/mm 2, 7. 36 kN/mm 2 and 9. 72 kN/mm 2 respectively.
