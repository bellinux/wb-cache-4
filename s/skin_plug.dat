40|$|The initial {{specimen}} diversion technique (ISDT) {{was first}} described by Patton and Schmitt (J. Clin. Microbiol. 48 : 4501 – 4503, 2010, doi: 10. 1128 /JCM. 00910 - 10). This study {{looked at the}} effect of implementation of the ISDT on blood culture contamination rates at our center. We found a reduction of 30. 34 % in potential blood culture contaminants. Blood cultures are essential for the diagnosis of bloodstreaminfections. A positive culture {{can lead to a}} definitive diagnosis and targeted antimicrobial therapy (1). A major limitation is the potential for false positives in culture which occur as the result of contamination. These false positives can result in increased health care costs related to antimicrobial use, extended hospital stays, and laboratory charges and to adverse patient events (1 – 4). These additional care costs have been reported to be between $ 1, 000 and $ 8, 720 per contaminated blood culture (2 – 4). Different methods to decrease contamination rates have been published, and these methods include systematic skin prepara-tion, disinfection of the tops of culture bottles, and use of a phle-botomy team (1). Patton and Schmitt evaluated the initial speci-men diversion technique (ISDT), in which the firstmilliliter of the venipuncture sample is discarded (or used for another lab test) (5). This technique led to a significant reduction in contamination rates. ISDT is based on the hypothesis that the <b>skin</b> <b>plug</b> aspirated during venipuncture is a major source of contaminating bacteria (5). In November 2011, the ISDT, as described by Patton an...|$|E

40|$|Corticosteroid-induced dermal atrophy {{has been}} studied in the rat using daily {{application}} of ethanolic solutions to small areas of flank skin. After 12 days of treatment, the degree of atrophy was determined by comparing the weights of <b>skin</b> <b>plugs</b> (16 mm diameter) taken from the treated areas with contralaterally paired control areas. Doses can be adjusted so that systemic effects are minimized and only local effects are observed. Hydrocortisone, hydrocortisone butyrate, dexamethasone, betamethasone, desonide and triamcinolone acetonide all produce atrophy in the rat, {{and the degree of}} thinning is dose dependent. Potencies in the dermal atrophy assay compare directly with topical anti-inflammatory potencies in the rat, and the presence of fluorine in the steroid molecule is not a determining factor in the production of atrophy...|$|R
40|$|Follicular unit {{extraction}} (FUE) is {{an accepted}} {{method of extracting}} individual follicular unit grafts for hair transplant surgery. Since follicles are harvested {{from the back of}} the scalp using tiny punches resulting in minimal scarring, it has gained rapid acceptance among the patients. However, due care needs to be exercised while performing FUE. FUE should not be confused with the older plug graft extraction methods of coring out hair-bearing <b>skin</b> <b>plugs.</b> Lack of due diligence while performing such extractions can lead to subluxation of the grafts into the subdermal layer of scalp. Overtumescence of the scalp donor area, use of blunt punches and trying to "core" out the full thickness grafts can all contribute to this. The following cases illustrate some pitfalls to be avoided while performing FUE and the adverse consequences if they occur...|$|R

40|$|AbstractValgrind is a {{programmable}} {{framework for}} creating program supervision {{tools such as}} bug detectors and profilers. It executes supervised programs using dynamic binary translation, giving it total control over their every part without requiring source code, and {{without the need for}} recompilation or relinking prior to execution. New supervision tools can be easily created by writing <b>skins</b> that <b>plug</b> into Valgrind's core. As an example, we describe one skin that performs Purify-style memory checks for C and C++ programs...|$|R
40|$|Full-thickness <b>skin</b> <b>plugs</b> from {{immature}} {{and adult}} rats {{have been shown}} to incorporate 3 H-thymidine in vitro in a semisynchronous fashion for up to 54 hr. DNA synthesis is minimal at 16 hr post sacrifice but increases again at 24 and 48 hr, and cells in S phase at 48 hr have passed through at least one mitosis in vitro (between 32 and 39 hr). Advantage can be taken of this semisynchronous burst of DNA synthetic activity to test the effects of potential inhibitors of skin cell proliferation, and to determine at which phase of the cell cycle these inhibitors act. High concentrations of epinephrine or isoproterenol (∼ 10 − 5 M) are required to cause inhibition but the effect is specific for the G 2 phase of the cell cycle. Propranolol does not demonstrate β-antagonism in this system, since it is a very potent inhibitor acting in G 1 phase. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline have two effects: one is a specific inhibitory action on cells in the G 2 phase and the second is a short-term action limiting thymidine uptake by cells in S phase without affecting the transition of cells from G 1 to S...|$|R
40|$|This report {{details the}} work {{completed}} under the CX- 100 blade manufacturing project. It presents the tooling design and manufacturing, blade production, blade instrumentation, blade shipping and adapter plate design and fabrication. The CX- 100 blade {{was designed to}} demonstrate the efficient use of carbon fiber in the spar cap of a wind turbine blade. The baseline blade used for this project was the ERS- 100 (Revision D) wind turbine blade. ERS- 100 master plugs – for both the high pressure and low pressure skins – were modified to create plugs for the CX- 100. Using the new CX- 100 master <b>skin</b> <b>plugs,</b> high pressure and low pressure molds were fabricated. Similar modifications were also completed on the shear web plug/mold, the blade assembly fixture and the root stud insertion fixture. Once all of the tooling modifications were complete, a production run of seven CX- 100 prototype blades was undertaken. Of those seven blades, four were instrumented with strain gauges before final assembly. After production at the TPI facility in Rhode Island, the blades were shipped to various test sites: two blades to the NWTC at NREL, two blades to Sandia National Laboratory and three blades to the USDA-ARS turbine field test facility located in Bushland...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} skin condition common in adolescence, but occasionally occurs intermittently throughout life. It {{is characterized by}} skin eruption on the face, chest, neck and back. This disease {{is more common in}} males than in female. It happens when the oil gland in the <b>skin</b> become <b>plugged</b> for many reasons. When oil backs up, it becomes infected by bacteria P. acne that is normally present on the skin and acne vulgaris develops. In this work seventy three individuals with acne vulgaris classified into 3 groups, 24 patients with mild acne, 19 patients with moderate acne and 30 patients with severe acne were studied. In addition, included fortytwo healthy individuals considered as a control group. The study revealed that the zinc shows significantly decreased level in the patients and an increase in the level of copper by comparison with the control group. Also results showed that glutathione peroxidase is significantly decreased in patients with severe acne patient group while no difference in other types...|$|R
