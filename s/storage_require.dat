5000|$|These {{measurements}} {{provided information}} related to the mechanism of photosynthesis, as well as give indications on the intactness and health of the specimen. [...] Examples are: (a) the energetics of the primary electron transfer processes, obtained from the energy storage and molecular volume change measured under sub-microsecond flashes; (b) The characteristics of the 4-step oxidation cycle in photosystem II, [...] obtained for leaves by monitoring photoacoustic pulsed signals and their oscillatory behavior under repetitive exciting light flashes; (c) the characteristics of photosystem I and photosystem II of photosynthesis (absorption spectrum, light distribution to the two photosystems) and their interactions. This is obtained by using continuously modulated light of a certain specific wavelength to excite the photoacoustic signal and measure changes in energy storage and oxygen evolution caused by background light at various chosen wavelengths. In general, photoacoustic measurements of energy <b>storage</b> <b>require</b> a reference sample for comparison. It is a sample with exactly the same light absorption (at the given excitation wavelength) but which completely degrades all the absorbed light into heat within the time resolution of the measurement. It is lucky that photosynthetic systems are self-calibrating, providing such a reference in one sample,as follows: One compares two signals: one, which is obtained with the probing modulated/pulsed light alone and the other when a steady non-modulated light (referred to as background light), which {{is strong enough to}} drive photosynthesis into saturation, is added. The added steady light does not produce any photoacoustic effect by itself, but changes the photoacoustic response due to the modulated/pulsed probing light. The resulting signal serves as a reference to all other measurements in absence of the background light. The photothermal part of the reference signal is maximal, since at photosynthetic saturation no energy is stored. At the same time the contribution of the other mechanisms tends to zero at saturation. Thus the reference signal is proportional to the total absorbed light energy.|$|E

We demonstrate how many deployed systems are susceptible to weak man-in-the-middle attacks. Furthermore, emerging technologies such as mobile devices, sensors, medical devices, and RFID tags present new challenges for secure software updates.

This report presents theoretical results from models that explicitly include the molecular nature of the electrical double layer and predict critical electrochemical quantities such as interfacial capacitance.

40|$|Abstract This paper briefly {{examines}} the history, status, policy situation, development issues, and prospects for key renewable power technologies in China. The country {{has become a}} global leader in wind turbine and solar photovoltaic (PV) production, and leads the world in total power capacity from renewable energy. Policy frameworks have matured and evolved since the landmark 2005 Renewable Energy Law, updated in 2009. China’s 2020 renewable energy target {{is similar to that}} of the EU. However, China continues to face many challenges in technology development, grid-integration, and policy frameworks. These include training, research and development, wind turbine operating experience and performance, transmission constraints, grid interconnection time lags, resource assessments, power grid integration on large scales, and continued policy development and adjustment. Wind and solar PV targets for 2020 will likely be satisfied early, although domestic demand for solar PV remains weak and the pathways toward incorporating distributed and building-integrated solar PV are uncertain. Prospects for biomass power are limited by resource constraints.

According to the results obtained, lowering of temperature by short period ventilation along with keeping the relative humidity values in the range of 60 - 75 per cent, dried fig moisture contents do not fall beyond the desired range of 18 - 26 per cent (22 - 35 gram water/ 100 gram dry matter). However, selection of suitable time for ventilation is very important. The recorded temperature and relative humidity values for Aydin and Izmir districts showed that these were not suitable for proper dried fig storage. Due to this, ventilation should be done in the morning and evening hours when temperature and relative humidity are suitable for ventilation. Beside this, in this study, the ventilation requirements for common fig stores were determined and principles for selection of suitable ventilation periods have been explained diagrammatically by giving an example...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes SC++lite, a sequentially-consistent {{system that}} relaxes memory order speculatively {{to bridge the}} {{performance}} gap among memory consistency models. Prior proposals to speculatively relax memory order require large custom on-chip storage to maintain a history of speculative processor and memory state while memory order is relaxed. SC++lite uses the memory hierarchy to store the speculative history, providing a scalable path for speculative SC systems across {{a wide range of}} applications and system latencies. We use cycle-accurate simulation of shared-memory multiprocessors to show that SC++lite can fully relax memory order while virtually obviating the need for custom on-chip storage. Moreover, while demand for storage increases significantly with larger memory latencies, SC++lite's ability to relax memory order remains insensitive to memory latency. An SC++lite system can improve performance over a base SC system by 26 % with only 1. 7 KB of custom storage in a system with 16 processors. In contrast, speculative SC systems with custom <b>storage</b> <b>require</b> 51. 4 KB of storage to improve performance by 29 % over a base SC system...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSecurity {{considerations}} {{for industrial production}} and <b>storage</b> <b>require</b> characterization of the mechanical effects caused by blast waves resulting from a detonation or deflagration. This paper evaluates current analytical methods to determine the characteristic parameters of a blast wave {{with respect to the}} pressure, impulse and duration of the positive phase of the blast. In the case of a detonation, the trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalent-based method determines the mass of TNT that is equivalent to the gas load used during the explosion and evaluates the characteristic parameters. A review of the energy values for TNT detonation is given, and the relationships used to calculate the TNT equivalent are proposed. The identification {{of the effects of the}} pressure wave following the explosion of a gaseous charge in free space equates the deflagration propagation to a piston. In the case of an explosion in an obstructed medium, the deflagration is considered to consist of a basic set of explosions involved in the generation of an intense blast wave.

40|$|Magnetic disks may be {{reaching}} physical performance limits {{due to the}} superparamagnetic effect. To {{close the}} performance gap between processors and storage, researchers are exploring {{a variety of new}} storage technologies [17]. Among these new technologies, probe-based micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS) magnetic storage arrays are attractive [3]. Probe-based storage is dense and highly parallel. It uses rectilinear motion in contrast to rotating media. Commercial devices are expected within the next several years. The wide range of possible architectures and the unique performance characteristics of probe-based <b>storage</b> <b>require</b> that standard file system algorithms for disks, including scheduling and layout, must be revisited to determine their efficiency domain. Because these devices do not yet exist, analysis of system performance depends on simulation models. At this early stage of development, models that bridge the gap between the physics of the device and its performance characteristics can provide important feedback to both hardware and software designers. This paper compares results from three models of probe-based storage that convey successively more accurate descriptions of the underlying physics. We conclude that the physical accuracy of the model has {{a significant impact on the}} predicted performance under real workloads. ...|$|E
