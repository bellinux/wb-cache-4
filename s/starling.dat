5|$|The hoopoe <b>starling,</b> {{also known}} as the Réunion <b>starling</b> or Bourbon crested <b>starling</b> (Fregilupus varius), is a species of <b>starling</b> which lived on the Mascarene island of Réunion, and became extinct in the 1850s. Its closest {{relatives}} were the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> and the Mauritius <b>starling</b> from nearby islands, and the three apparently originated in Southeast Asia. The bird was first mentioned during the 17th century and was long thought {{to be related to the}} hoopoe, from which its name is derived. Although a number of affinities have been proposed, it was confirmed as a <b>starling</b> in a DNA study.|$|E
5|$|The <b>starling</b> family, Sturnidae, is {{an entirely}} Old World group apart from {{introductions}} elsewhere, with the greatest numbers of species in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The genus Sturnus is polyphyletic and relationships between its members are not fully resolved. The closest relation of the common <b>starling</b> is the spotless <b>starling.</b> The non-migratory spotless <b>starling</b> may be descended from a population of ancestral S. vulgaris that survived in an Iberian refugium during an ice age retreat, and mitochondrial gene studies suggest {{that it could be}} considered as a subspecies of the common <b>starling.</b> There is more genetic variation between common <b>starling</b> populations than between nominate common <b>starling</b> and spotless <b>starling.</b> Although common <b>starling</b> remains are known from the Middle Pleistocene, part of the problem in resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the paucity of the fossil record for the family as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe <b>starling,</b> but the {{skeleton}} was smaller. Though the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues <b>starling</b> specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E
40|$|<b>Starlings</b> (Sturnus vulgaris) are robin-sized birds {{weighing}} about 3. 2 ounces (90 g). Since their introduction into New York in the 1890 s, <b>starlings</b> {{have spread}} across the continental United States, northward to Alaska and the southern half of Canada, and southward into northern Mexico. <b>Starlings</b> are found {{in a wide variety}} of habitats including cities, towns, farms, ranches, open woodlands, fields, and lawns. <b>Starlings</b> consume a variety of foods, including fruits and seeds of both wild and cultivated varieties. European <b>starlings</b> were brought into the United States from Europe. <b>Starlings</b> are frequently considered pests because of the problems they cause, especially at livestock facilities and near urban roosts. European <b>starlings</b> are not protected by federal law and in most cases not by state law...|$|R
40|$|Transmissible gastro-enteritis (TGE) is an {{economically}} important viral disease of pigs in Britain, particularly in East Anglia. <b>Starlings</b> are often abundant at pig farms where they feed on pig food. The {{close association between}} <b>starlings</b> and pigs has led farmers to believe that <b>starlings</b> transmit TGE from one farm to another, but evidence has been circumstantial. The following {{study was designed to}} establish whether <b>starlings</b> do move between farms. <b>Starlings</b> which were wing-tagged at a pig farm were relocated at 25 other sites, including eleven other pig farms, so the possibility that <b>starlings</b> can transmit TGE from one farm to another cannot be ruled out...|$|R
5000|$|Nest {{predation}} by introduced common <b>starlings</b> is {{the most}} common cause of nesting failure for black robins on Rangatira Island, with almost 21% of nests failing due to <b>starlings.</b> Incidences of faliure caused by <b>starlings</b> are more common when black robins nest in cavities compared to open nests.|$|R
5|$|In 1900, the English {{scientist}} George Ernest Shelley {{used the}} spelling Necrospa in a book, thereby creating a junior synonym; however, he attributed {{the name to}} zoologist Philip Sclater. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> should belong in the same genus as the hoopoe <b>starling,</b> Fregilupus, due to the similarity of the species. More subfossils found in 1974 added support to {{the claim that the}} Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of <b>starling.</b> The stouter bill is mainly what warrants generic separation from Fregilupus. In 2014, the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume described a new extinct species, the Mauritius <b>starling</b> (Cryptopsar ischyrhynchus), based on subfossils from Mauritius. It was shown to be closer to the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> than to the hoopoe <b>starling,</b> due to the features of its skull, sternum and humerus. Until then, the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> was the only Mascarene passerine bird named from fossil material.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon {{suggested}} that Sturnus-like species could have arrived in Africa, and {{given rise to}} the wattled <b>starling</b> (Creatophora cinerea) and the Mascarene starlings. According to Amadon, the Rodrigues and hoopoe starlings were related to Asiatic starlings, such as some species of Sturnus, rather than the glossy starlings (Lamprotornis) of Africa and the Madagascan <b>starling</b> (Saroglossa aurata); he concluded this based on the colouration of the birds. A 2008 study, which analysed the DNA of various starlings, confirmed that the hoopoe <b>starling</b> was a <b>starling,</b> but with no close relatives among the sampled species.|$|E
5|$|Verger bribes Justice Department {{official}} Paul Krendler {{to accuse}} <b>Starling</b> of withholding {{a note from}} Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures <b>Starling</b> to Union Station. Verger's men, having trailed <b>Starling,</b> capture and bring Lecter to Verger. Verger intends to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, <b>Starling</b> infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter, she is shot by a third guard who was in hiding. Lecter picks up an unconscious <b>Starling</b> just before the boars break through the doors. Verger orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter, but, with Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen. Lecter carries <b>Starling</b> and watches the boars eat Verger alive.|$|E
40|$|European <b>starlings</b> (Sturnus vulgaris, Figure 1) are an {{invasive}} {{species in the}} United States. The first recorded release of the birds was in 1890 in New York City’s Central Park. Because <b>starlings</b> easily adapt {{to a variety of}} habitats, nest sites and food sources, the birds spread quickly across the country. Today, there are about 150 million <b>starlings</b> in North America. Conflicts between people and <b>starlings</b> occur mostly in agricultural settings. Conflicts can occur during winter in urban and suburban environments, especially in business districts. <b>Starlings</b> damage apples, blueberries, cherries, figs, grapes, peaches, and strawberries. Besides causing direct losses from eating fruits, <b>starlings</b> peck and slash at fruits, reducing product quality and increasing the fruits’ susceptibility to diseases and crop pests (Figure 2). <b>Starlings</b> gather at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) during late fall and winter. Flocks are much larger than those encountered in late summer and are harder to disperse {{because of a lack of}} alternative foods. <b>Starlings</b> prefer facilities with open feeder systems which provide easy access to livestock rations (Figure 5). The link between <b>starlings</b> and livestock health is beginning to be understood. Epidemiological evidence suggests that <b>starlings</b> are both biological vectors (e. g., fecal matter) and mechanical vectors (e. g., feet, beaks) of pathogens. <b>Starlings</b> can transmit or amplify several bacterial, fungal, parasitical and viral pathogens. <b>Starlings</b> carry Salmonella spp., several Escherichia coli serotypes, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacterium avium, Chalmydophilia psittaci, Flavivirus spp. (West Nile Virus), Avulavirus spp. (Newcastle’s disease) and transmissible gastroenteritis (a coronavirus) without showing any symptoms of illness. Pathogens survive in feed troughs, watering troughs and fecal deposits, some surviving for weeks or years. Transmission to livestock occurs through fecal–oral routes, mainly ingestion or licking among animals. Combining multiple methods that affect auditory, gustatory and visual senses is an effective approach for managing pest birds, such as <b>starlings.</b> <b>Starlings</b> quickly habituate to visual deterrents (e. g., Mylar® tape, hawk kites) and audio deterrents (e. g., recorded distress calls). You can prolong and enhance the effectiveness of deterrents by frequently changing their locations and reinforcing them with other methods, such as pyrotechnics, propane cannons, falconry, and shooting...|$|R
40|$|While egg {{destruction}} by brood parasites is {{a relatively}} well-known phenomenon, such destruction by non-brood-parasitic heterospecifics is less common. Here, we provide the first evidence of egg destruction by Wattled <b>Starlings</b> Creatophora cinerea on Pied Babblers Turdoides bicolor. We find that the incubation success of Pied Babblers decreases significantly following the arrival of Wattled <b>Starlings</b> at the study site, and we provide video evidence of Wattled <b>Starlings</b> destroying Pied Babbler eggs. This behaviour is costly to Pied Babblers, whose current reproductive attempt is abandoned, with subsequent reproductive attempts delayed by several weeks. We {{found no evidence that}} egg destruction occurred for nutritional benefit: Wattled <b>Starlings</b> never consumed the eggs they destroyed. Rather, this behaviour appears to represent a form of resource competition, since Wattled <b>Starlings</b> only predate babbler nests in habitats where the <b>starlings</b> also build their nests. 5 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The book {{is about}} the adventures of {{accidental}} protagonist Race Worden, a peasant living on the agricultural world of Mavia. His story is set in humanity's post-apocalyptic future where the human race has been split into two castes/species; <b>Starlings</b> and normal Humans. The <b>Starlings,</b> human mentalists who had developed powerful telekinetic powers that allow humankind to travel & settle the stars. Normal humans are under repressive thumb of the <b>Starling's</b> authority. Only {{a small portion of}} human population consisted of these gifted mentalists called <b>Starlings.</b>|$|R
5|$|Beginning in the 1830s, Réunion was deforested for plantations. Former slaves joined white peasants in {{cultivating}} pristine areas after {{slavery was}} abolished in 1848, and the hoopoe <b>starling</b> was {{pushed to the}} edges of its former habitat. According to Hume, over-hunting was the final blow to the species; with forests more accessible, hunting by the rapidly growing human population may have driven the remaining birds to extinction. In 1821, a law mandating the extermination of grain-damaging birds was implemented, and the hoopoe <b>starling</b> had a reputation for damaging crops. During the 1860s, various writers noted that the bird had almost disappeared, but it was probably already extinct by this time; in 1877, Vinson lamented that the last individuals might have been killed by recent forest fires. No attempts to preserve the species in captivity seem to have been made. The hoopoe <b>starling</b> survived longer than many other extinct Mascarene species, and was the last of the Mascarene <b>starling</b> species to become extinct. The Rodrigues and Mauritius species probably disappeared with the arrival of rats; at least five species of Aplonis starlings have disappeared from the Pacific Islands, with rats contributing to their extinction. The hoopoe <b>starling</b> may have survived longer due to Réunion's rugged topography and highlands, where it spent much of the year.|$|E
5|$|Extant East Asian starlings, {{such as the}} Bali myna (Leucopsar rothschildi) and the white-headed <b>starling</b> (Sturnia erythropygia), have {{similarities}} {{with these}} extinct species in colouration and other features. As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings {{seem to be more}} closely related to each other than to the hoopoe <b>starling,</b> which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe <b>starling</b> being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Schlegel first {{proposed}} in 1857 that the species {{belonged to the}} <b>starling</b> family (Sturnidae), reclassifying {{it as part of}} the Sturnus genus S. capensis. This reclassification was observed by other authors; Carl Jakob Sundevall proposed the new genus name Lophopsarus ("crested starling") in 1872, yet Fregilupus varius—the oldest name—remains the bird's binomial, and all other scientific names are synonyms. In 1874, after a detailed analysis of the only known skeleton (held at the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology), James Murie agreed that it was a <b>starling.</b> Richard Bowdler Sharpe said in 1890 that the hoopoe <b>starling</b> was similar to the <b>starling</b> genus Basilornis, but did not note any similarities other than their crests. In 1941, Malcolm R. Miller found the bird's musculature {{similar to that of the}} common <b>starling</b> (Sturnus vulgaris) after he dissected a specimen preserved in spirits at the Cambridge Museum, but noted that the tissue was very degraded and the similarity did not necessarily confirm a relationship with starlings. In 1957, Andrew John Berger cast doubt on the bird's affinity with starlings due to subtle anatomical differences, after dissecting a spirit specimen at the American Museum of Natural History. Some authors proposed a relationship with vangas (Vangidae), but Hiroyuki Morioka rejected this in 1996, after a comparative study of skulls.|$|E
25|$|The <b>starlings</b> are {{generally}} a highly social family. Most species associate in flocks of varying sizes throughout the year. A flock of <b>starlings</b> {{is called a}} murmuration. These flocks may include other species of <b>starlings</b> and sometimes species from other families. This sociality is particularly evident in their roosting behaviour; in the non-breeding season some roosts can number in the thousands of birds.|$|R
5|$|Common <b>starlings</b> may {{contract}} avian tuberculosis, avian malaria and retrovirus-induced lymphomas. Captive <b>starlings</b> often accumulate excess iron in the liver, {{a condition}} that can be prevented by adding black tea-leaves to the food.|$|R
50|$|Adult singing <b>starlings</b> have glossy black plumage {{and bright}} red irises. Immature birds are paler, with {{streaked}} underparts and brown irises. They are distinguished from metallic <b>starlings</b> by shorter, square tails and thicker bills.|$|R
5|$|In Iberia, {{the western}} Mediterranean and {{northwest}} Africa, the common <b>starling</b> may {{be confused with}} the closely related spotless <b>starling,</b> the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range {{it can be seen that}} the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behaviour}} of the Rodrigues <b>starling,</b> apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items. Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct Cylindraspis land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the <b>starling,</b> particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the <b>starling</b> may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.|$|E
5|$|Tafforet was {{familiar}} with the fauna of Réunion, where the related hoopoe <b>starling</b> lived. He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so {{the fact that he did}} not mention a crest on the Rodrigues <b>starling</b> indicates that it was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{reproductive}} condition and exogenous melatonin on immune function were investigated in castrated European <b>starlings,</b> Sturnus vulgaris. Photorefractory and photostimulated <b>starlings</b> exposed to long days were implanted with melatonin or with blank capsules. Photostimulated <b>starlings</b> with blank capsules exhibited reduced splenocyte proliferation {{in response to}} the T-cell mitogen, concanavalin A, compared with the other long-day birds. Exogenous melatonin prevented the suppression of immune function by photostimulation. Photorefractory <b>starlings,</b> with or without melatonin implants, exhibited enhanced immune function compared with photostimulated <b>starlings</b> implanted with blanks. This enhancement was not mediated by endogenous melatonin, but appeared to be related to changes in reproductive state. In addition to the traditional costs of reproduction in birds (e. g. raising of young), there may be a cost of the reproductive state of <b>starlings</b> (i. e. whether they are photorefractory or photostimulated). These data are, we believe, the first to indicate a direct effect of reproductive state on immune function that is independent of both photoperiod (i. e., changes in the duration of melatonin secretion) and gonadal steroids...|$|R
50|$|European <b>starlings</b> {{were not}} native to North America. Schieffelin {{imported}} the <b>starlings</b> from England. Scientists estimate that descendants from those two original released flocks now number {{at more than}} 200 million residing in the United States.|$|R
50|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{have shown}} that mimids are most closely related to <b>starlings.</b> These and oxpeckers (and the Philippine creepers {{if they are not}} outright but highly apomorphic <b>starlings)</b> form a group of Muscicapoidea which originated probably in the Early Miocene - very roughly 25-20 mya - somewhere in East Asia. This is evidenced by the Asian-SW Pacific distribution of the most basal <b>starlings</b> (and Philippine creepers) and the North American range of the basal mimids.|$|R
5|$|The Rodrigues <b>starling</b> (Necropsar rodericanus) is an {{extinct species}} of <b>starling</b> that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues. Its closest {{relatives}} were the Mauritius <b>starling</b> and the hoopoe <b>starling</b> from nearby islands; all three {{appear to be}} of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore islet of Île Gombrani. Subfossil remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested {{to belong to the}} bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of <b>starling</b> predators are avian. The typical response of <b>starling</b> groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of <b>starling</b> flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called <b>Starling</b> as {{his first}} witness. <b>Starling</b> {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
50|$|One {{common use}} of the {{optimality}} model is in optimal foraging theory. For example, the foraging behavior in <b>starlings</b> can be predicted using an optimality model, specifically a marginal value theorem model. Researchers compared {{the amount of time}} a bird forages to the distance the bird travels to the foraging ground. Birds try to maximize the amount of food they take back to their offspring. <b>Starlings</b> mostly feed their offspring leatherjackets. As <b>starlings</b> gather more leatherjackets, it becomes increasingly difficult and time-consuming to find subsequent leatherjackets with the additional prey in their mouths. Thus at some point, it benefits them to stop expending extra energy to find additional food and return to their nests instead. A graph of this phenomenon, called a loading curve, compares foraging time to the number of prey captured. Alex Kacelnik predicted that the curve would fluctuate depending on the <b>starling’s</b> travel time. He predicted that <b>starlings</b> traveling further would spend more time at the foraging site to achieve optimal foraging behavior. It’s important that these <b>starlings</b> spend extra time at the foraging ground because {{it takes a lot of}} energy to travel back and forth from its nest. On the other hand, he predicted <b>starlings</b> traveling shorter distances to foraging grounds should spend less time foraging, making more frequent trips in order to optimize their behavior. Since these <b>starlings</b> have a shorter distance to travel, they don’t need to put as much energy into searching for leatherjackets because it is easier for them to return to the foraging ground. His results were consistent with his predictions.|$|R

5|$|Huge urban roosts {{in cities}} can create {{problems}} {{due to the}} noise and mess made {{and the smell of}} the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's Big Ben that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common <b>starling</b> alarm calls. An entire episode of The Goon Show in 1954 was a parody of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common <b>starling</b> roosts in central London.|$|E

When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July, Lecter subdues and drugs him. <b>Starling,</b> disoriented by {{morphine}} {{and dressed in}} a black velvet evening gown, awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler's prefrontal cortex, sautés it, and feeds it to him.|$|E
5|$|Several {{causes for}} the decline and sudden {{disappearance}} of the hoopoe <b>starling</b> have been proposed, all connected to the activities of humans on Réunion, who it survived alongside for two centuries. An oft-repeated suggestion is that {{the introduction of the}} common myna (Acridotheres tristis) led to competition between these two <b>starling</b> species. The myna was introduced to Réunion in 1759 to combat locusts, and became a pest itself. However, the hoopoe <b>starling</b> coexisted with the myna for nearly 100years and they may not have shared habitat. The black rat (Rattus rattus) arrived on Reunion in the 1670s, and the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) in 1735, multiplying rapidly and threatening agriculture and native species. Like the hoopoe <b>starling,</b> the rats inhabited tree cavities and would have preyed on eggs, juveniles, and nesting birds. During the mid-19th century the Réunion slit-eared skink (Gongylomorphus borbonicus) became extinct due to predation by the introduced wolf snake (Lycodon aulicum), which may have deprived the bird of a significant food source. Hoopoe starlings may have contracted diseases from introduced birds, a factor known to have triggered declines and extinctions in endemic Hawaiian birds. According to ecologist Anthony S. Cheke, this was the chief cause of the hoopoe starling's extinction; the species had survived for generations despite other threats.|$|E
