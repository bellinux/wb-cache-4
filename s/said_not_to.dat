5|$|The legume vine Mucuna pruriens {{is used in}} the {{countries}} of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for problematic Imperata cylindrica grass: the vine is extremely vigorous and suppresses neighbouring plants by out-competing them for space and light. Mucuna pruriens is <b>said</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be invasive outside its cultivated area. Desmodium uncinatum can be used in push-pull farming to stop the parasitic plant, witchweed (Striga).|$|E
5|$|The freeway segment {{northwest}} of Wyoming Avenue {{to the county}} line was previously known as James Couzens Highway after the street it replaced. That street was named {{after the death of}} James J. Couzens. Couzens was a former Commissioner of Detroit's Department of Street Railways from 1913 through 1915, after which he served as Police Commissioner from 1916 until 1918. He was Mayor of Detroit from 1919 until 1922 and United States Senator from Michigan from 1922 until his death on October 22, 1936. During his years of public service, he is <b>said</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have accepted a salary, giving it all to charity. After his death, Detroit renamed its section of Northwestern Highway after Couzens.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation in Singapore protects both procedural and substantive rights. In administrative law, a legitimate expectation generally arises when {{there has been}} a representation of a certain outcome by the public authorities to an individual. To derogate from the representation may amount to an abuse of power or unfairness. The {{doctrine of}} legitimate expectation as a ground to quash decisions of public authorities has been firmly established by the English courts. Thus, where a public authority has made a representation to an individual who would be affected by a decision by the authority, the individual has a legitimate expectation to have his or her views heard before the decision is taken. Alternatively, an individual may also have a legitimate expectation to a substantive right. The recognition of substantive legitimate expectations is somewhat controversial as it requires a balancing of the requirements of fairness against the reasons for any change in the authority's policy. This suggests the adoption of a free-standing proportionality approach, which has been <b>said</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> apply in administrative law.|$|E

25|$|Later scholars, {{such as the}} American {{historian}} of technology Lynn White, have attempted to estimate Eilmer's date of birth based on a quotation in William's Deeds in regard to Halley's Comet, which appeared in 1066. The difficulty lies in that William recorded what Eilmer <b>said</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> establish his age, but to show that his prophecy was fulfilled later that year when the Normans invaded England.|$|E

25|$|The end of Tabinshwehti came {{soon after}} his return from the Siamese campaign. The king, who had always led a highly disciplined life, quickly {{developed}} a liking to wine after having introduced to it by a young Portuguese mercenary who had just entered his service. He became an alcoholic {{in such a short}} time that the king, who had been on constant military campaigns in every year since 1534, decided not only to forgo any new campaigns but also to hand over day-to-day governing duties to Bayinnaung. Instead, he went on hunting and drinking trips with the mercenary-turned-winemaker, whom he had given a royal handmaiden as wife. The drunken king is <b>said</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> have respected other men's wives. Desperate, ministers approached Bayinnaung to take over the throne but he refused. Bayinnaung arrested the winemaking mercenary, paid him off, set him on a ship, and sent him out of the country.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a legend}} in East Anglia about a ghostly black hound from hell that roams the coast and lonely lanes of Norfolk. The hound {{is the size of}} a small horse and appears from the depths of Beeston Bump with malevolent flaming red eyes. Anyone confronted by the Doom Dog will be dead within a year. Sometimes, Black Shuck has {{appeared}} headless and, at other times, he appears to float on a carpet of mist, rather than running. The Black Shuck often terrifies his victims out of their wits, although the apparition is <b>said</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> harm its victims. The legend was the inspiration behind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Conan Doyle had been on a golfing holiday at the nearby Links Hotel in West Runton, and it was in the sitting room of the hotel that his friend, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, recounted the legend of the Black Hound from the Bump.|$|E

500|$|Whether public {{standing}} {{ought to}} be accorded at all has been a subject of considerable academic and judicial controversy. It has been regarded by one academic commentator as the litmus test of how liberal the standing rules within a legal regime are. Common justifications for allowing this form of standing include the need to vindicate {{the rule of law}} and the need to challenge particularly serious illegality where no individual is peculiarly affected by it. Political accountability alone is <b>said</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> serve as a sufficient check on administrative action, and there would be a [...] "grave lacuna in the law" [...] if no one has sufficient standing to challenge such action before the courts.|$|E
500|$|The sixth William succeeded {{his father}} in 1639 shortly before the English Civil War broke out.

Many of his tenants became Parliamentarian soldiers, {{and over the next}} three years he had numerous visits from Parliamentarian soldiers, mostly seeking to acquire goods such as horses and weapons for the war, and using the house for quartering soldiers. Bramall was also host to Royalist soldiers, who confiscated some of the Davenport property for use in the war. William Davenport was at one point charged with delinquency, and ordered to pay a fine of £750 (equivalent to £ in [...] ), and soldiers continued to use Bramall Hall because of its convenience.|$|E

Toronto Star William Burrill wrote that the [...] "Great Zapper War" [...] would be decided by the strength of the light guns' supporting games. Multiple reviewers ultimately recommended that players wait for more games to be released before purchasing the Menacer. William Burrill of the Toronto Star <b>said</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> bother unless the player [...] "absolutely love target shooter games".
