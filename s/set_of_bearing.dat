It {{is based on}} an image processing algorithm that enables: the detection of objects like bearings from a pallet conveyor, the identification of bearings type and the calculus of position and orientation, in order to be manipulated by a SCARA robot. The identification algorithm developed in Matlab software consists in HSV image segmentation and a matching technique based on comparison with previous given <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> prototypes. The methods used for camera and robot calibration are also described...|$|E
40|$|The {{undrained}} vertical {{bearing capacity}} of a shallow foundation is a fundamental problem in geotechnics. Bearing capacity factors based on analytical and numerical methods have been published for strip and circular, surface and shallowly embedded foundations, with rough and smooth foundation-soil interfaces in soils with uniform and linearly increasing shear strength profiles - although not comprehensively for all combinations. Furthermore, {{in the case of}} limit analysis solutions, considerable disparity can exist between upper and lower bound solutions for some foundation and soil conditions. This letter presents a coherent <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity factors based on finite element and finite-element limit analysis, for strip and circular shallow foundations across a practical range of foundation embedment ratio, foundation-soil interface roughness and soil shear strength heterogeneity. </p...|$|E
40|$|The axial {{vibration}} in turbine machine has attracted {{more and more}} interest. Tilting-pad thrust bearings are widely used in turbine machines to support the axial load. The dynamic properties generated by oil film of the thrust pad have important effects on the {{axial vibration}} of the rotor-bearing system. It is necessary to develop the method to test the dynamic characteristics of thrust bearings. A new rig has been developed. The facility allows a complete <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> operating parameters to be measured. Parameters measured include oil temperatures, oil-film thickness, and pressure. The static load and dynamic load can be added on the thrust bearing in the vertical direction at the same time. The relative and absolute displacement vibrations of the test experimental bearing with the changes of dynamic force are measured, and the dynamic characteristics of the test bearing are obtained. The experimental results show clearly that the operating conditions influence largely on the pad static and dynamic characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Mathematical {{morphology}} (MM) is {{an efficient}} nonlinear signal processing tool. It can be adopted to extract fault information from bearing signal {{according to a}} structuring element (SE). Since the bearing signal features differ for every unique cause of failure, the SEs should be well tailored to extract the fault feature from a particular signal. In the following, a signal based triangular SE according to the statistics {{of the magnitude of}} a vibration signal is proposed, together with associated methodology, which processes the bearing signal by MM analysis based on proposed SE to get the morphology spectrum of a signal. A correlation analysis on morphology spectrum is then employed to obtain the final classification of bearing faults. The classification performance of the proposed method is evaluated by a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> vibration signals with inner race, ball, and outer race faults, respectively. Results show that all faults can be detected clearly and correctly. Compared with a commonly used flat SE, the correlation analysis on morphology spectrum with proposed SE gives better performance at fault diagnosis of bearing, especially the identification of the location of outer race fault and the level of fault severity...|$|E
40|$|A robust 1 D film {{hydrodynamic}} {{model has been}} sequentially coupled with a 1 D core gas model and used to predict the instantaneous mean core gas speed, film interface shear stress and liquid film distribution within an idealised bearing chamber. This novel approach to aero-engine bearing chamber simulation provides a predictive tool {{that can be used}} for the fast and reliable exploration of a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> chamber design and operating conditions characterised by the: chamber dimensions, air/oil fluid properties, shaft speed, sealing air flows, oil feed rates and sump scavenge ratios. A preliminary validation of the model against available bearing chamber flow measurements from literature shows good agreement. The model represents a significant step change in predictive capabilities for aero-engine oil system flows compared to previous semi-empirical models. The bearing chamber is idealised as a one-dimensional (2 D) domain with a predominantly azimuthal flow in both the rotational oil film and core gas such that axial components may be ignored. A 1 D system of depth-averaged film hydrodynamics equations is used to predict oil film thickness and mean speed distributions in the azimuthal direction under the influence of interface shear, gravity, pressure gradient and surface tension forces. The driving shear stress in the film model is obtained from the 1 D core-gas model based on an azimuthal gas momentum conservation equation which is coupled to the film model through the interface shear stress and film interface velocity...|$|E
40|$|With {{the growing}} wind {{industry}} in Canada, {{it has become}} important to optimize wind turbine foundation design. Wind turbine foundations are subjected to combinations of vertical, horizontal and moment loads due to vertical self-weight of the structure and soil surcharge. Additionally, there are significant lateral loads and overturning moments attributed to varying wind forces acting at considerable tower heights above the ground level. In this thesis, the undrained bearing capacity response of circular 2 ̆ 6 octagonal foundations subjected to combined loading is calculated using finite element analyses. Previous works have mostly focused on circular foundations. An octagonal foundation of the style typically used in the wind industry forms {{the focus of this}} research. Foundations are either surface based or embedded in homogeneous or heterogeneous soils. The results are expressed in terms of a coherent <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity factors and failure envelopes in two dimensional planes (VH, VM and HM). This research also presents a parametric study on the effect of a surficial crust on the bearing capacity of a foundation. Finally, working and design loads for a typical wind turbine foundation are plotted in two dimensional failure planes to investigate if there is a potential `spare 2 ̆ 7 capacity. The finite element study indicates that an increase in soil strength heterogeneity and embedment leads to increases in the uniaxial limit capacities and size of the failure envelopes. For octagonal foundations, the average increase in uniaxial vertical, horizontal and moment capacities due to increases in the embedment is 15...|$|E

40|$|Rolling element bearing has vast {{domestic}} and the vital parts in any rotating machinery. Appropriate function of these appliances {{depends on the}} smooth operation of the bearings. Failure of this particular part can affect the machinery performance and in time will cause major failure to the machinery. Result of various studies shows that bearing problems account for over 40 % of all machine failures. Due to the crucial problem, online monitoring has become an alternative in preventive maintenance. The objective of this project is to develop software with signal processing tools to detect defect features in mechanical signal of the bearing. Five <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> were tested {{with one of them}} remains in good condition while the other four has its own type of defects. The data for good bearing were used as baseline data to compare with the defected ones. The data consist with three different speed rotation which are 287, 1466, and 2664 rpm. Then analyzed by using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). From there, it is further analyse using wavelet coefficient for each level of decomposition from CWT method. From the result generated, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and wavelet coefficient {{plays an important role in}} supporting result analyzed by using CWT that will be used on Graphical User Interface (GUI) software in MATLAB. A system or data with low wavelet coefficient compare to the good condition wavelet coefficient will clearly state as in good condition bearing while the defect features still may be recovered by calculating the wavelet coefficient for each level of decomposition in CWT method. If the wavelet coefficient of data is higher than the good bearing, it proves that the defect occurred on that bearing. The GUI will display the result of the CWT process by displaying condition of the bearing either in good condition or not. Finally, the CWT method also proves to be an effective method for online condition monitoring tool with GUI software. Future research should be detecting type of the defect features based on statistical tool...|$|E

40|$|A {{solution}} to the shaft alignment problem is a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> prescribed <b>bearing</b> offsets that ensure an acceptable load distribution among the shaft-supporting bearings. Acceptable load distribution implies not only all positive bearing reactions under all operating conditions of the vessel, but also an acceptable relative-misalignment between the shaft and the bearing. In a marine environment the difficulty is not in finding a single suitable {{solution to}} the above criteria, but rather in defining the optimal <b>set</b> <b>of</b> solutions capable of accommodating the extreme bearing disturbances- resulting mainly from hull deflections and thermal deviation. As the problem is stochastic, with an infinite number <b>of</b> satisfactory <b>bearing</b> offsets, {{it is appropriate to}} apply the Genetic Algorithm (GA) optimization procedure to search for the optimal <b>set</b> <b>of</b> solutions, rather then rely on the plain trial and error approach or some of the step-by-step conventional search algorithms.

This problem can naturally arise within the context of several multi-robot applications such as, e. g. exploration, coverage, and surveillance. First, we introduce and thoroughly analyze the concept and properties <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> formations, and provide a class <b>of</b> minimally linear <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearings</b> sufficient to uniquely define such formations. We then propose a bearing-only formation controller requiring only bearing measurements, converging almost globally, and maintaining bounded inter-agent distances despite the lack of direct metric information. The controller still leaves the possibility of imposing group motions tangent to the current bearing formation. These can be either autonomously chosen by the robots because of any additional task (e. g. exploration), or exploited by an assisting human co-operator. For this latter ‘human-in-the-loop’ case, we propose a multi-master/multi-slave bilateral shared control system providing the co-operator with some suitable force cues informative of the UAV performance.
