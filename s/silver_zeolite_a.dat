40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether xenon- 131, the decay daughter of I- 131, was retained in or escaped from the <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridge after iodine- 131 had been adsorbed in the cartridge. Currently, <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridges are used in the nuclear power industry to adsorb the radioactive iodine gas in sampling lines because of their high retention efficiency for gaseous iodine but not for noble gases. If xenon- 131 is desorbed and escapes from the <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridge, the surfaces originally occupied by iodine- 131 in the <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridge may be vacant and thus available to adsorb other iodine gas molecules. The reusability of <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridges may reduce the sampling cost and radioactive waste volume and also preserve the silver resource. ^ <b>A</b> <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridge containing only iodine- 131 of known activity in a cartridge holder was connected with a blank charcoal cartridge in another cartridge holder. The end of each cartridge holder was sealed so the diffusion of xenon was contained in a closed system. Radioactive xenon- 131 m, the daughter of iodine- 131, was used as an indicator for stable xenon- 131. The absence or presence of xenon- 131 m on the charcoal cartridge was used to determine if xenon- 131 was desorbed from the <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridge. <b>A</b> NaI scintillator was used to detect iodine- 131 and a HPGe detector was used to detect xenon- 131 m. ^ The desorption fraction of xenon- 133 from the <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridge was found to be 0. 66 ± 4. 3 % and the retention fraction of xenon- 133 in the charcoal cartridge was found to be 0. 61 ± 7. 5 %. Xenon- 131 m was frequently present in the charcoal cartridge. This showed that xenon 131 was desorbed and escaped from the initial occupied sites in the <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridge after iodine- 131 decayed. The amount of xenon- 131 m escaping from the <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> cartridge fluctuated from day to day. This is thought to be due to what is known as the tunnel blocking effect.

40|$|The present PhD {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the synthesis and characterization of highly luminescent silver clusters embedded in zeolitic matrices, emphasizing their potential applications. For instance, as alternative phosphors for the fabrication of fluorescent lamps, wavelength converters in solar cells, and as luminescence-based sensors. The development of synthesis protocols, robust characterization techniques and selective activation procedures are explored and addressed in this dissertation. Moreover, the first attempt to fabricate a fluorescent lamp prototype using the luminescent <b>silver</b> exchanged <b>zeolites</b> synthesized in this work is also presented. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first non-lanthanide based emissive coating employed in the fabrication of a fluorescent lamp. The main contributions and conclusions of this PhD project can be summarized as follows. An adapted and robust version of a widely used technique for measurements of external quantum efficiencies (EQE), needed for the correct evaluation of EQE of highly scattering materials, was developed. In this work, EQE values of luminescent silver-zeolite composites were reported for the first time. The EQE values reported in this study (up to 69 percent) proved the high potential of these alternative materials for competing with commercial phosphors used nowadays. The development of a next generation of <b>silver</b> exchanged <b>zeolite</b> composites, based on the rational design of the precursor materials, with remarkable luminescence performance, was achieved. We show in this study the effect that the counter-balancing ions can have on the luminescence properties of <b>silver</b> loaded <b>zeolites.</b> <b>A</b> difference of approximately 12 % in water content in the samples was reflected into a visible change of the emission color from yellow (fully hydrated state) to blue (partially hydrated state). Next to other potential applications already suggested for luminescent Ag-zeolite composites such as novel phosphors for the fabrication of luminescent lamps, wavelength converters for solar cells, and smart fluorescent labels, these new type of materials are potential candidates to be used as luminescence-based humidity/temperature sensors at micro and macro scale. The use of X-ray lithography to fabricate luminescent silver clusters confined in zeolites was successfully employed. This technique, unexplored in <b>silver</b> exchanged <b>zeolites,</b> provides <b>a</b> tight and controllable spatial production of luminescent silver clusters at fast time scales compared to common activation procedures previously reported. The developed strategy opens many possibilities for the creation of luminescent micro-structures in different <b>silver</b> <b>zeolite</b> arrays, providing <b>a</b> new opportunity for the development of alternative light-emitting devices at micro and macro scales. A facile and cheap route to fabricate silver nanoparticles with limited size distribution on <b>silver</b> exchanged <b>zeolites</b> by using the photo-catalytic properties of TiO 2 was developed. A comparison between natural (day light) and artificial (UV lamp and UV photoreactor) irradiation sources revealed a difference in particle size dispersion and morphology of the photo-reduced silver nanoparticles. The samples were systematically characterized by XRD, TEM, SEM, UV-VIS and DRS spectroscopy. The average particle dimension in the naturally irradiated samples was found between 5 and 10 nm, whereas in the artificially exposed samples the average silver nanoparticles size ranged between 20 and 50 nm. Finally, we carried the first attempt to fabricate a fluorescent lamp prototype, in collaboration with Philips R&D, using Ag-zeolite based phosphors. The most promising samples in terms of luminescence performance and chemical stability were selected to fabricate a suspension containing Ag-zeolite phosphors, this formulation was used in the coating of glass tubes that subsequently were converted into fluorescent lamps. Preliminary results showed that the coating of the fluorescent lamps with Ag-zeolite phosphors is feasible, nevertheless certain problems associated with the agglomeration of zeolite particles were observed. At the end of the fabrication process a working lamp was obtained, however the lifetime and yield of the lamp did not fully meet the standards required for commercial lamps. Nonetheless, a full optimization directed to the creation of Ag-zeolite phosphors to be utilized in the fabrication of fluorescent lamps is ongoing in collaboration with Philipsamp;D. In conclusion, several aspects related to the synthesis, characterization and potential applications of luminescent silver clusters confined in zeolite matrices were addressed in this dissertation. Robust characterization techniques were developed to study the optical properties of Ag-zeolite materials and assess their luminescent efficiencies in an adequate way. Similarly, diverse activation protocols were tested. For the first time, the use of X-ray lithography to produce highly luminescent <b>silver</b> clusters in <b>zeolites</b> was demonstrated. Based on the information obtained by the different characterization techniques and the optimization protocols, a new generation of luminescent <b>silver</b> exchanged <b>zeolites</b> was obtained. This study represents one of the first steps towards the rational design and synthesis of luminescent silver clusters with optimized properties. Finally, the first attempt to fabricate a fluorescent lamp prototype using Ag-zeolite based phosphors was carried. nrpages: 202 status: publishe...|$|R

(29) Si NMR spectroscopy results suggest that the starting gel is double four-ring (D 4 R) rich and during crystallization of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> both alpha and beta cages appear. (27) Al NMR spectroscopy results indicate the absence of Al (2 Si) species in the starting gel, suggesting the absence of single 4 R building units in the starting gel. Furthermore, composition analysis of both solid and liquid samples shows that the solid rather than liquid phase predominates for the crystallization of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A.</b> Therefore, it is proposed that the crystallization of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> mainly occurs in the solid phase by self-assembly or rearrangement starting from the zeolite building units mainly consisting of D 4 R.

By choosing a polymer with good hole transport properties (PVK), and a dye (emitter), with a redox potential that allows charge separation sporadically after excitation of the dye, we can change the 'blinkingpatern' under the influence of an electric field. So far there is no study with above formulated hypothesis. More specifically, in the first phase both the distribution of energy levels for ATTO-PVK be determined by fluorescence measurements, {{and on the other hand}} the distribution of on-and off-times of the system will be determined in the absence of an applied electric field. In a next step, the influence of an electric field to the system will be examined,wherein both the magnitude and the polarity of the electric field will be be varied and the system will be expanded with additional layers such as `hole trapping' layers to see the influence of these layers onthe mobility of these charges.

The possibility of forming <b>zeolites</b> <b>A,</b> P 1 and X was of particular interest in the present study. Factors, mechanism and modeling of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> were investigated thoroughly in the present study. Zeolite synthesis process was evaluated using X-Ray diffraction to study different formed zeolite types and their chemical composition {{as well as their}} percentages. Morphological and physical characteristics of the produced zeolitic materials were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, and cation exchange capacity property, CEC. The findings indicate that hydrothermal process did not succeed in producing significant amounts of zeolites. Consequently, the CEC of the produced zeolitic materials were much below the available commercial zeolite materials. Fusing the ash prior to hydrothermal treatment successfully produced sodium aluminum silicates and sodium silicates precursors to <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> formation. Fusion followed by hydrothermal treatment yielded significant amounts of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A,</b> at maximum value of 38. 8 % with CEC up to 245. 0 meq/ 100 g, which is within the range of commercially available zeolites. Experimental design analysis performed on <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> synthesis showed that <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> formation was reproducible and equation of interaction between different used conditions was established. Mechanism of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> formation was concluded to be solution transport mediated process that involved both gel and solution interaction rather than being pure solution reaction or pu re gel transformation process. Solution super saturation and optimum silica/aluminum ratio were the driving force for nucleation of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Zeolite</b> <b>A</b> is a {{crystalline}} aluminosilicate {{which has}} been used as a builder component in laundry detergents for many years. An LCI for the production of <b>Zeolite</b> <b>A</b> ("cradle-to-factory-gate") was carried out on behalf of the European Zeolite producers. Data from five European production sites were collected to generate an average LCI for <b>Zeolite</b> <b>A.</b> The plants covered more than 77 % of the total European production in 1993 an therefore represent an average situation. The original LCI tables show detailed figures about raw material, intermediates and auxiliary material consumption. The overall energy flow for the production of 1 t of anhydrous Zeolite is 22400 MJ with a minimal spread of +/- 5 % over the individual companies. Furthermore 25 air emission parameters and 35 water emission parameters are listed and categorised with respect to their origins e. g. process dependent, transportation, thermal energy and electricity production. Each company is able to compare their individual data with the average LCI to identify any opportunities to improve production processes. In addition, this LCI of <b>Zeolite</b> <b>A</b> provides the basis for any further LCA studies of <b>a</b> product containing <b>Zeolite</b> <b>A,</b> including comparisons and assessments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Zeolite</b> <b>A</b> was {{successfully}} synthesized via convenient hydrothermal process using potassium-extracted residue of potassium feldspar as a combined source for silica and alumina. Optimization {{studies on the}} molar ratios of Na 2 O/SiO 2 and H 2 O/SiO 2, and aging time have been conducted. The results were that pure <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> with high crystallinity could be synthesized when the reaction mixture with molar ratios of Na 2 O/SiO 2 and H 2 O/SiO 2 of 2. 0 and of 85, respectively, were crystallized at 100 ˚C for 3 h. Aging {{was found to be}} not prerequisite for the formation of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> in the system. The product was characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM and calcium exchange capacity. Finally, a comparative study of the <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> formation from the potassium-extracted residue and other industrial waste or natural silicate minerals was also carried out...|$|R
40|$|Four {{samples of}} Ba-exchanged <b>zeolite</b> <b>A,</b> bearing 0. 27, 0. 43, 0. 58 and 0. 74 meq/g Na {{residual}} amounts, were thermally {{treated in the}} temperature range 200 - 1500 °C for times up to 28 hours. The same samples were pressed at 30 and 60 MPa to manufacture cylindrical pellets, which were thermally treated at 1300 °C for 5 hours. Thermally treated materials were characterized by room temperature XRD. The sequence of thermal transformations that Ba-exchanged <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> undergoes (<b>zeolite</b> ® amorphous phase ® hexacelsian ® monoclinic celsian) and the strong mineralizing action developed by Na are confirmed. Pressing the Ba-exchanged <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> powder-like samples to obtain cylindrical pellets is found to expedite the sluggish final phase transition hexacelsian ® monoclinic celsian.

40|$|In this study, high phase {{purity of}} <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> was {{prepared}} from {{coal fly ash}} precursors. The molar regime of both the clear solution extract and unseparated fly ash slurry was adjusted to achieve the right composition for <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> crystallization. The formation process for <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> from coal fly ash precursors was monitored in detail using an in situ ultrasonic system and was complemented by use of ex situ techniques such as XRD, FTIR, SEM and FTIR. The findings from both the in situ ultrasonic monitoring process and ex situ techniques clearly contributed significantly in unmasking the formation process of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> from coal fly ash compared to previous studies reported in the literature. The study also enriches the existing body of literature by deeply investigating the gel–solution–crystal interactions starting from this complex feedstock.

40|$|We {{tried to}} {{synthesize}} zeolite from the sand-like particles of crushed LCD panel glass collected from discarded electronics devices. In the previous study, <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> was synthesized using fine glass particles of < 10  μm. Acid treatment was found effective toward synthesizing single phase <b>zeolite</b> <b>A.</b> Using sand-like coarse glass particles, {{of which the}} internal-core consists of glass and the surficial shell transforms into zeolite, we investigated the effect of acid-treatment by evaluating {{the surface of the}} coarse glass particles. Under acid-treatment, components other than Si eluted from the glass. The elution amounts were several percent of the total glass mass. After acid-treatment, the surface of the glass particle was discovered to be covered in a thin layer of poor components other than Si and a relatively rich quantity of Si, by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrum analysis. The synthesized <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> increased the longer the acid-treatment time, which suggest the thin layer increased. When the concentration of the acid solution decreased, glass components other than Si dissolved well, and the synthesized <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> increased as a result. This indicates that the Si-rich layer is necessary for preferential synthesis of <b>zeolite</b> <b>A</b> from crushed particles of aluminoborosilicate glass...|$|R
40|$|Herein {{we report}} on the {{formation}} and characterization of mixed-matrix ultrafiltration (UF) membranes hand-cast by nonsolvent induced phase inversion. We evaluated nanometer-to-micrometer sized inorganic fillers (<b>silver,</b> copper, silica, <b>zeolite,</b> and silver-zeolite) materials with polysulfone (PSf) as the polymeric dispersing matrix. In general, mixed-matrix membranes were rougher, more hydrophilic, and more mechanically robust. Only sub-micron zeolite-PSf mixed-matrix membranes exhibited simultaneous improvements in water permeability and solute selectivity; all other mixed-matrix membranes were more permeable, but less selective due to defects associated with poor polymer-filler binding. Protein and bacterial fouling resistance of mixed-matrix membranes containing <b>silver,</b> <b>zeolite,</b> and silver-zeolite nanoparticles were compared to a low-fouling, poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) UF membrane. <b>Zeolite</b> and <b>silver</b> containing membranes exhibited better protein fouling resistance (due to higher hydrophilicity), whereas silver and silver-zeolite based membranes produce better bacterial fouling resistance due to antimicrobial properties. Overall, zeolite-PSf and silver exchanged zeolite-PSf membranes offered the best combination of improved permeability, selectivity, and fouling resistance - superior to the commercial PAN membrane. © 2011 Elsevier B.
