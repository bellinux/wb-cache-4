I shall take full advantage of that freedom in my talk and present only a few topics. 1 QCD at High Energy In the infinite momentum frame (IMF) a proton or nucleus is seen as a Lorentz contracted disk, and xg(x,Q 2) is the number of gluons per unit rapidity of transverse size less than 1 /Q on that disk. At small x the number of gluons becomes so large that there is a saturation in the growth of the number of gluons. As a consequence of this saturation, the total virtual-photon proton scattering cross section satisfies a geometrical scaling law 1 as shown in Fig. 1, σ(x,Q 2) → σ(τ), τ = Q 2 /Q 2 s (x), Qs(x) = (x/x 0) λ, λ = 0. 3.

Class III or mesio-occlusion, is characterized by the mesial relationship of the mandibular dental arch with respect to the maxillary dental arch taking as reference the mesial buccal cusp of the upper first molar which occludesmesial to groove of the lower first molar. This pathology greatly compromises facial esthetics and psychosocial status and adversely affects the self-esteem of those who suffer from it. It {{is one of the most}} difficult challenges that the clinician can face; if left untreated it can progress to a degree so severe, that in most cases, the only treatment option is orthognathic surgery in adulthood. Surgical techniques had their origin in the twentieth century from then on, they have been modified into versatile and predictable methods for the correction of maxillofacial malformations. The aesthetic problem is the main reason for consultation in orthodontics. The divine proportion is being studied more and more every day for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes related to facial aesthetics. Materials and methodsTwenty patients were included in the sample for this study. Pre and post-treatment cephalograms and photographs (<b>scale</b> <b>1.</b> <b>1)</b> were obtained. Seven angular measurements were taken from the pre/post-treatment cephalograms and seven linear measurements were obtained from frontal photographs.

However, directional gene flow may actually reinforce divergence of populations in close proximity. This study documents the phenotypic differentiation over more than two decades in body size (tarsus length) at a very short spatial <b>scale</b> (<b>1.</b> <b>1</b> km) within a population of pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca inhabiting deciduous and coniferous habitats. Unlike females, males breeding in the deciduous forest were consistently larger than those from the managed coniferous forest. This assortment by size is likely explained by preset habitat preferences leading to dominance of the largest males and exclusion of the smallest ones toward the nonpreferred coniferous forest coupled with directional dispersal. Movements of males between forests were nonrandom with respect to body size and flow rate, which might function to maintain the phenotypic variation in this heritable trait at such a small spatial scale. However, a deeply rooted preference for the deciduous habitat might not be in line with its quality due to the increased levels of breeding density of hole-nesting competitors therein. These results illustrate how eco-evolutionary scenarios can develop under directional gene flow over surprisingly small spatial scales. Our findings come on top of recent studies concerning new ways in which dispersal and gene flow can influence microevolution. Although gene flow is assumed to counteract evolutionary differentiation, directional gene flow may actually reinforce divergence of populations. We show that natal dispersal of male pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca inhabiting contrasting, adjacent habitats over two decades was nonrandom with respect to size (tarsus length) and intensity of dispersers flow, leading to rapid phenotypic differentiation in a heritable trait. This result illustrates new ways in which dispersal can influence microevolutionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Christiaens D., ''Data-driven {{local and}} global {{reconstruction}} of white matter fibres in diffusion-weighted imaging'', Proefschrift voorgedragen tot het behalen van het doctoraat in de ingenieurswetenschappen, KU Leuven, July 2016, Leuven, Belgium. Mapping the structural network topology {{of the human brain}} is a fundamental challenge in science, and one that may advance our understanding and treatment of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is currently the only non-invasive technique for probing the structural connectivity in the brain in vivo. Its principle is based on indirect measurement of the diffusion anisotropy of water, which is correlated with tissue microstructure. Estimating the local geometry of axonal fibres then hinges on biophysical models of diffusion in white matter. Such local estimates can subsequently be integrated along the image to reconstruct global structural connections in the brain, a process known as tractography. Many state-of-the-art DWI analysis methods build on strong model assumptions about the signal in white matter, which are hard to validate and may not generalize to other tissues and pathology. In this thesis, we therefore aim to reconstruct the {{local and global}} fibre configuration in brain white matter with as few prior assumptions about the microstructure as possible. Instead, we develop data-driven methodology, informed by spatial priors, population priors, and the signal itself. From this perspective, we develop a global tractography framework that integrates a spatial prior on the continuity of white matter fibres into a minimal convolutive multi-tissue model for DWI in the brain, based on a fibre response function that is estimated from and thus adapted to the data at hand. In this method, local fibre orientation estimates inform the global track configuration and vice versa, hence integrating local and global scales into one Markov chain Monte Carlo optimization framework. Results show improved specificity of valid connections and maintain a quantitative correspondence between track density and the apparent fibre density in the data. Secondly, we introduce population priors in the form of atlases of the local fibre orientation or of the global white matter bundle label to which individual fibres belong. As such, tractography in individual subjects is informed by common structure found across a cohort. Results indicate that such priors can reduce false positive tracks, thus improving specificity. Finally, we develop a blind source separation technique for multi-shell DWI, decomposing the data as a convolutive mixture of nonnegative tissue orientation distribution functions and corresponding response functions, without assuming the latter as known thus fully unsupervised. In healthy human brain data, the resulting components are associated with white matter fibres, grey matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. This factorization is on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods, as demonstrated also in Monte-Carlo simulations evaluating accuracy and precision. In animal data and in the presence of edema, our method is able to recover unseen tissue structure, fully data-driven. In summary, we developed local and global fibre reconstruction methods for DWI that improve over the state-of-the-art and extend to applications in preclinical data and pathology.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{presented}} the experimental campaign on multi-leaf stone masonry panels in original and consolidated conditions that was performed at the Laboratory of Building Materials of the Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering (University of Padova). The experimental research includes a series of monotonic and cyclic simple-compression tests on three-leaf stone masonry panels in <b>scale</b> <b>1</b> : <b>1</b> and 2 : 3, in original and consolidated conditions using grout injection, and a single-leaf stone masonry wall in <b>scale</b> <b>1</b> : <b>1.</b> These tests were complemented by Non-Destructive Tests (NDT - direct and indirect sonic tests, sonic tomography) performed on the walls {{before and after the}} strengthening and by the mechanical, physical and chemical characterization of the applied materials (stone, mortar and grout) and of composite elements of stone fragments and grout, in both <b>scales</b> <b>1</b> : <b>1</b> and 2 : 3, simulating the masonry internal core panels. Both NDT and DT allowed assessing the effectiveness of the grout injection as a reinforcement technique and to expand and deepen the knowledge on its influence on the behaviour of the studied type of masonry.
