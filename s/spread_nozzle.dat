In order to design two-dimensional nozzle/ejector systems of minimum size and weight, the plume decay and spreading characteristics of basic two-dimensional nozzles must first be established. The present work deals with the experimental analyses of these plume characteristics and includes the effects of nozzle aspect ratio and flow conditions (jet Mach number and temperature) on the plume decay and <b>spreading</b> of two-dimensional <b>nozzles.</b> Correlations including these variables are developed {{in a manner similar}} to those previously developed successfully for conic and dual-flow plumes...|$|R

Measurements for coaxial air blast atomizers were obtained using air to represent the gaseous stream and water to represent the liquid stream. A wide range of flow conditions were examined for sprays with and without swirl for gaseous streams. The parameters varied include Weber number, gas flow rate, liquid flow rate, swirl, and nozzle geometry. Measurements were made with a phase Doppler velocimeter.

40|$|The {{spreading}} {{characteristics of}} jets from several asymmetric nozzles, {{and a set}} of rectangular orifices are compared, covering a jet Mach number range of 0. 3 - 2. 0. The effect of 'tabs' for a rectangular and a round nozzle is also included in the comparison. Compared to a round jet, the jets from the asymmetric <b>nozzles</b> <b>spread</b> only slightly more at subsonic conditions whereas at supersonic conditions, when 'screech' occurs, they spread much more. The dynamics of the azimuthal vortical structures of the jet, organized and intensified under the screeching condition, are thought to be responsible for the observed effect at supersonic conditions. Curiously, the jet from a 'lobed' <b>nozzle</b> <b>spreads</b> much less at supersonic condition compared to all other cases; {{this is due to the}} absence of screech with this nozzle. Screech stages inducing flapping, rather than varicose or helical, flow oscillation cause a more pronounced jet spreading. At subsonic conditions, only a slight increase in jet spreading with the asymmetric nozzles contrasts previous observations by others. The present results show that the spreading of most asymmetric jets is not much different from that of a round jet. This inference is further supported by data from the rectangular orifices. In fact, jets from the orifices with small aspect ratio (AR) exhibit virtually no increase in the spreading. A noticeable increase commences only when AR is larger than about 10. Thus, 'shear layer perimeter stretching', achieved with a larger AR for a given cross-sectional area of the orifice, by itself, proves to be a relatively inefficient mechanism for increasing jet spreading. In contrast, the presence of streamwise vortices or 'natural excitation' can cause a significant increase - effects that might explain the observations in the previous investigations. Thus far, the biggest increase in jet spreading is observed with the tabs. This is true in the subsonic regime, as well as in the supersonic regime, in spite of the fact that screech is eliminated by the tabs. The characteristic spreading of the tabbed jets is explained by the induced motion of the tab-generated streamwise vortex pairs. The tabs, however, incur thrust loss; the flow blockage and loss in thrust coefficient, vis-a-vis the spreading increase, are evaluated for various configurations...|$|R
40|$|In {{proton therapy}} {{delivered}} with range modulated beams, the energy spectrum of protons entering the delivery nozzle {{can affect the}} dose uniformity within the target region and the dose gradient around its periphery. For a cyclotron with a fixed extraction energy, a rangeshifter is used to change the energy but this produces increasing energy spreads for decreasing energies. This study investigated {{the magnitude of the}} effects of different energy spreads on dose uniformity and distal edge dose gradient and determined the limits for controlling the incident spectrum. A multilayer Faraday cup (MLFC) was calibrated against depth dose curves measured in water for nonmodulated beams with various incident spectra. Depth dose curves were measured in a water phantom and in a multilayer ionization chamber detector for modulated beams using different incident energy <b>spreads.</b> Some <b>nozzle</b> entrance energy spectra can produce unacceptable dose nonuniformities of up to ± 21 % over the modulated region. For modulated beams and small beam ranges, the width of the distal penumbra can vary by a factor of 2. 5. When the energy spread was controlled within the defined limits, the dose nonuniformity was less than ± 3 %. To facilitate understanding of the results, the data were compared to the measured and Monte Carlo calculated data from a variable extraction energy synchrotron which has a narrow spectrum for all energies. Dose uniformity is only maintained within prescription limits when the energy spread is controlled. At low energies, a large spread can be beneficial for extending the energy range at which a single range modulator device can be used. An MLFC can be used as part of a feedback to provide specified energy spreads for different energies...|$|R

40|$|The {{spreading}} {{characteristics of}} jets from several asymmetric nozzles are studied {{in comparison to}} those of an axisymmetric jet, over the Mach number (M(sub J)) range of 0. 3 to 1. 96. The effect of tabs in two cases, the axisymmetric nozzle fitted with four tabs and a rectangular nozzle fitted with two large tabs, is {{also included in the}} comparison. Compared to the axisymmetric jet, the asymmetric jets spread only slightly faster at subsonic conditions, while at supersonic conditions, when screech occurs, they spread much faster. Screech profoundly increases the spreading of all jets. The effect varies in the different stages of screech, and the corresponding unsteady flowfield characteristics are documented via phase-averaged measurement of the fluctuating total pressure. An organization and intensification of the azimuthal vortical structures under the screeching condition is believed to be responsible for the increased spreading. Curiously, the jet from a 'lobed mixer' <b>nozzle</b> <b>spreads</b> much less at supersonic conditions compared to all other cases. This is due to the absence of screech with this <b>nozzle.</b> Jet <b>spreading</b> for the two tab configurations, on the other hand, is significantly more than any of the no-tab cases. This is true in the subsonic regime, {{as well as in the}} supersonic regime in spite of the fact that screech is essentially eliminated by the tabs.

40|$|Hot water {{supplies}} account for approximately 30 % of energy consumption in residential sectors of Japan; {{it is therefore}} important that the energy efficiency of water heaters be improved. Absorption heat pump water heaters are expected to provide greater efficiency than conventional water heaters that use gas. However, the absorption systems have larger volumes and are not widely accepted in the market. In this paper, we propose the use of adiabatic absorbers to replace conventional shell-and-tube or plate-fin-type absorbers to downsize absorption heat pump water heaters that use H 2 O/NH 3. The adiabatic absorption system consists of two components: sub-cooler and adiabatic absorber. For the proposed absorption system, the solution from the generator first flows through the sub-cooler and is sub-cooled by tap water, and then flows into the adiabatic absorber to complete absorption. The absorption performance, {{as well as the}} volume of the adiabatic absorber, is important in order to obtain greater efficiency. In this study, three types of absorbers are proposed: atomizing <b>nozzle,</b> <b>spreading</b> tray, and packed-column absorbers. These three types of absorption system are modeled and their absorption performances are analyzed. In modeling the atomizing-nozzle-type absorber, the breakup position of liquid film and the diameter of generated droplets are discussed {{on the basis of the}} instability theory of liquid film. In analytically modeling the spreadingtray- type absorber, the breakup length of the liquid column and generated droplet diameter are discussed. In the case of the packed-column-type absorber, the effective interfacial area of dumped packing is discussed. From the calculation results, design guidelines are developed and the expected sizes are compared...|$|R

Cold Spray (C S) is a newly developed manufacturing technique, based upon the deposition of metal powder on a substrate due to high energy particles impacts. In this process, the powder is accelerated up to considerable speed in a converging - di verging nozzle, typically using air, nitrogen or helium as a carrier gas. Recent developments have demonstrated significant process capabilities, from the building of mould - free 3 D shapes made of various metals, to low porosity and corrosion resistant tita nium coatings. In the C S process, the particle stream characteristics during the acceleration process is important in relation to the final geometry of the coating.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} nozzles and jet flows {{have attracted}} the attention of many researchers due to their potential application to many practical devices. Rectangular nozzles are considered for short/vertical take off and landing aircrafts for achieving powered lift. Axisymmetric nozzles with lobes, tabs or slots and elliptical nozzles are considered for noise reduction in aircrafts and mixing augmentation in airbreathing rockets. Interaction of supersonic jets with solid surface, {{as in the case of}} retro and ullage rockets in launch vehicles and interaction of multiple jets as in the case of launch vehicles with multiple booster rockets/multiple nozzle engines are of practical importance. Design of rockets and aircrafts employing these nozzles needs the understanding of the structure and behaviour of the complex three dimensional supersonic jets issuing from these nozzles. The problem is so complex that different investigators have addressed only some specific aspects of the problem and there is much more to be done to fully understand these flows. For example, in the case of rectangular nozzle with semi circular ends (known as elliptical nozzle), the investigations have been limited to a single nozzle of aspect ratio 3, 0 and pressure ratio (ratio of the total pressure to ambient pressure) 3. 0. Further, the measurements were made in the far field subsonic region beyond a distance of 20 times the equivalent nozzle radius (RJ. For the present study, the elliptical sonic nozzle of the type mentioned above was chosen, as it offered simplicity for manufacturing and carrying out computations, but has all the complex features associated with the three dimensional jets. A systematic study to understand the mean flow structure and the effect of important governing parameters like ratio and pressure ratio on the flow development process of the jet issuing from Navier-Stokes equations. The experimental study revealed many interesting flow features. It was found that the Underexpanded jet issuing from elliptical sonic <b>nozzle</b> <b>spreads</b> rapidly in the minor axis plane while it maintains almost constant width or contracts in the major axis plane. However, the gross spreading of this jet is much higher compared to the axisymmetric jet. The higher spreading rates experienced in the minor axis plane compared to the major axis plane of this 'et, results in the jet width in the minor axis plane to become higher than that in the major axis plane. The longitudinal location, where this occurs is called the axis switching location. This kind of axis switching phenomenon is known to exist for subsonic elliptical jets. However, for the present supersonic jets, the axis switching locations are much closer to the nozzle exit compared to the subsonic cases reported. It was further found that this location strongly depends on the pressure and aspect ratios. A critical pressure ratio was found to exist for each nozzle at which the axis switching location is the farthest. Above the critical pressure ratio, the axis switching location was observed to move upstream with the increase in the pressure ratio and is controlled by the complex interactions of shock and expansion waves near the nozzle exit. Below the critical pressure ratio, the axis switching location moves upstream with the decrease in pressure ratio and is controlled by some kind of instability in the minor axis plane. The shock structure present in the underexpanded jet from an elliptical nozzle was also observed to depend on both pressure and aspect ratios. For some aspect ratios and pressure ratios, the shock pattern observed in both the major and minor axis planes are similar to that of an axisymmetric jet, where the incident barrel shock and the Mach reflection (from the edges of the Mach disk) are present. But for all other cases, this shock continues to be seen only in the major axis plane. Whereas, in the minor axis plane, the incident shock is absent in the shock pattern. Detailed measurement in the jet cross sectional planes, for the case of aspect ratio 2. 0 nozzle, shows that the cross sectional shape changes along the length and it becomes almost a circle at the axis switching location. Further downstream, the jet spreads rapidly in the minor axis plane whereas no significant change in the width of the jet in the major axis plane is observed. Far downstream, the jet boundary appears like a distorted ellipse with its major and minor dimensions lying respectively in the minor and major axis planes of the nozzle. The elongated shape of the jet cross sections at locations downstream of the axis switching point gives the impression that the entire flow in the major axis plane is turned towards the minor axis plane. This effect appears to be predominant at high pressure ratios. The computed near field shock structure in the planes of symmetry, pitot pressure distributions, cross sectional shape of the jet and the spreading pattern agree very well with the experimental results. In addition to this, the present computational method gives the detailed near field flow structure including the azimuthal extent of the incident shock, cross flow details and distributions of flow variables. It is shown that the present inviscid methodology can also predict the axis switching point accurately if it occurs before the formation of the Mach disk and it demonstrates that the jet growth phenomenon in the near field, atleast, is mainly controlled by the inviscid flow process. The computed results have shown that changes in the jet cross sectional shape in the near field is caused mainly by the interaction of compression and expansion waves with each other and with the constant pressure boundary. The inviscid method seems to be able to capture the complicated secondary cross flow structure (indicating presence of longitudinal vortices) of the elliptical jet. The complex mean flow structure in the near field region of the jet issuing from elliptical nozzles and the effect of nozzle aspect ratio and pressure ratio on the structure are brought out clearly in the present study. The mechanism governing the spreading and the axis switching characteristics are also brought out. Thus the present experimental and computational investigations give a comprehensive understanding of the mean flow structure of the underexpanded jets issuing from elliptical nozzles. Further studies are required to understand the other aspects of the elliptical jets as well as other three-dimensional jets. Some of these studies are identified for future work...|$|R
