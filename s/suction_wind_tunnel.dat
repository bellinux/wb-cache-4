40|$|The {{climate change}} due to {{emissions}} from the combustion of fossil fuel {{to meet the}} ever increasing energy demands of the growing world population has roused the attention of governments and individuals {{to protect the environment}}. The formulated policies to protect the environment have aroused interest in wind turbines as an alternative source of energy. The suitability of the vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) in harnessing energy from the wind in the built areas have been shown, but there still exists a large knowledge gaps in the aerodynamics and performance of the VAWT especially in the design and selection of an appropriate blade chord. This thesis studied the influence of the blade chord on the aerodynamics and performance of vertical axis wind turbines through experimental and computational fluid dynamics methods. Two VAWT configurations of blade chords 0. 04 m (AR = 15) and 0. 03 m (AR = 20) with corresponding solidities of 0. 34 and 0. 26 were used for the investigations. The performance and the flow fields of the two configurations were measured experimentally through the use of performance measurement method and Particle Image Velocimentry (PIV) measurement techniques. All the experimental tests were conducted in a low-speed open <b>suction</b> <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> and the results are presented. Computational fluid dynamics modelling based on the Unsteady Reynolds Average Navier-stokes (URANS) was employed to simulate the two configurations at the same wind tunnel test conditions to complement the revelations from the experimental tests. The developed CFD models after a parametric study that enabled the selection of the model’s features were validated against experimental data by comparing both forces and the flow physics. Vorticity of the CFD flow visualisation and blade forces provided an additional and penetrating insight into the aerodynamics and performance of the VAWTs by linking flow physics, and performance to the aerodynamics. The VAWT flow physics, aerodynamics and performances have been shown to depend on the Reynolds numbers that ranges from 1. 27 x 103 to 1. 1 x 105, the blade chord (solidity), the azimuth angle blade stall is initiated and the dynamic stall associated with the flow fields around the blade. At 6 m/s test condition, the C = 0. 04 m VAWT attained peak CP = 0. 165 at λ = 4, while the C = 0. 03 m VAWT performed in the negative region at all the λ. The better performance attained by the C = 0. 04 m VAWT over the C = 0. 03 m VAWT was repeated at all other wind speeds tested in the experiments and also in the computational fluid dynamics investigations. The C = 0. 04 m VAWT attained a higher peak CP = 0. 326 at 8 m/s at λ = 3. 75 indicating increased performance with increases in Reynolds numbers. This trend was equally seen with the C = 0. 03 m VAWT in the experiments and also the computational fluid dynamics results. The VAWT with σ = 0. 34 performed better than σ = 0. 26 VAWT in all the conditions tested due to its higher Reynolds numbers and solidity differences that influence the nature of the dynamic stall phenomenon associated with the flow fields around the blades...|$|E

The paper describes comparative assessment of two distinct experimental strategies of aerodynamic predictions by conventional <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> approach and its subsequent validation with advanced computational procedures, carried out as a part of design process of a small hybrid car proposed to be named as ADRENe. The experimental investigations were performed on an open circuit <b>suction</b> type <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> having a 30 cm x 30 cm x 100 cm test section, on a geometrically similar, reduced scale (1 : 15) clay model, while the three dimensional computational analysis was carried out using Gambit as the preprocessing software and Fluent as the solver and post processor. A good agreement between performance values obtained independently by two experimental methods, suggests their reliability and suitability for further experimentation purposes. The comparison with computational approach shows that the computed drag forces and pressure distributions agree well with the experimental values over the entire range of air velocities, however, the agreement with the data for drag coefficient varies, which appears to suggest a higher degree of dependency on the grid quality and elements selection...|$|R

This {{investigation of a}} Goldschmied Propulsor aimed to determine influential characteristics of the suction slot geometry to aid in better slot geometry design and to decrease the suction flow requirements for maintaining attached flow over the entire model surface. The Propulsor model was 38. 5 inches in length with a max diameter of 13. 5 inches. Three suction slot geometries were investigated {{with the addition of}} aluminum cusps to the slot entrance.

The studies were conducted on two flat plates with 4 mm cylindrical film cooling holes, one with simple angle {{and the other with}} compound angle, in a low-speed <b>suction</b> type <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Density effect was studied at ratios of 0. 93 and 1. 47 by using air and CO 2 as coolant.

The solution of the flow equations are presented for an angle of attack range (14, 16, 18, 20 and 24) degrees, at excitation frequency values (100, 150 and 200) Hz, with the two-excitation location from the leading edge (6. 5 % and 11. 5 %) of chord, at Reynolds number based on chord of 3. 4 x 10 5. The experimental tests are separately conducted in two <b>suction,</b> open-typed <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels</b> at the Reynolds number based on chord of 3. 4 x 10 5 for the measurements and 1 x 10 4 for the visualization.

The most effective excitation frequency is found to be equal 150 Hz, which leads to increase the lift coefficient at 45 % at the excitation location 6. 5 % chord and 35 % at the excitation location of 11. 5 % chord, especially at the poststall region of angle of attack (16 - 20) degree, with 10 % increasing for the Lift/Drag coefficient. www. ijmer. co...|$|R

40|$|One {{particular}} characteristic {{observed in}} unsteady shear layers is the phase shift {{relative to the}} main flow. In attached boundary layers this will have an effect both on the instantaneous skin friction and heat transfer. In separation bubbles the contribution to the drag {{is dominated by the}} pressure distribution. However, the most significant effect appears to be the phase shift on the transition process. Unsteady transition behaviour may determine the bursting of the bubble resulting in an un-recoverable full separation. An early analysis of the phase shift was performed by Stokes for the incompressible boundary layer of an oscillating wall and an oscillating main flow. An amplitude overshoot within the shear layer as well as a phase shift were observed that {{can be attributed to the}} relatively slow diffusion of viscous stresses compared to the fast change of pressure. Experiments in a low speed facility with the boundary layer of a flat plate were evaluated in respect to phase shift. A pressure distribution similar to that on the suction surface of a turbomachinery aerofoil was superimposed generating a typical transitional separation bubble. A periodically unsteady main flow in the <b>suction</b> type <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> was introduced via a rotating flap downstream of the test section. The experiments covered a range of the three similarity parameters of momentum-loss-thickness Reynolds-number of 92 to 226 and Strouhal-number (reduced frequency) of 0. 0001 to 0. 0004 at the separation point, and an amplitude range up to 19 %. The free stream turbulence level was less than 1 %. Upstream of the separation point the phase shift in the laminar boundary layer does not appear to be affected significantly bay either of the three parameters. The trend perpendicular to the wall is similar to the Stokes analysis. The problem scales well with the wave velocity introduced by Stokes, however, the lag of the main flow near the wall is less than indicated analytically. The separation point comes closest to the Stokes analysis but the phase is still 20 degrees lower at the wall...|$|R

(some col.) Experimental and computational results regarding turbulent mixing of passage flow and the coolant from a high-pressure turbine blade trailing edge cooling scheme are documented. Special interest {{is devoted to}} gaining a fundamental understanding of the thermal protection provided by the cooling scheme. The trailing edge cooling scheme is a scaled version of a generic scheme, tested in a <b>suction</b> type <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The scaled model is three-dimensional with rectangular ribs. Three different lip geometries (square, single round, and double round) are tested. The freestream Reynolds number, based upon the lip thickness, is fixed at 10, 200. Primarily, three blowing ratios, M= 1. 5, M= 1. 0, and M= 0. 5 are documented. A hot-wire sensor and a thermocouple are placed inside the slot and detailed measurements of velocities, turbulence intensities, and temperatures are acquired. Values of adiabatic effectiveness obtained on the model surface quantify thermal protection. Spectral analysis of the hot-wire signal is performed at various locations in the flow field. Spectra indicate a coherent mechanism of mixing. This clear unsteadiness is attributed to vortex shedding from the lip. It is shown that effectiveness increases as the blowing ratio increases. This document suggests also that lip geometry is an influential parameter for this cooling scheme. Effectiveness is greatly increased when a rounded lip is utilized. In one case, additional blowing ratios (M= 0. 75 and M= 1. 25) were tested. Experiments concluded that above M= 1. 25, effectiveness is insensitive to blowing ratio. Two-dimensional simulations are presented for M= 1. 5, M= 1. 0 and M= 0. 5. They use various Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes turbulence closure models. The frequencies of unsteadiness are well modeled but, in general, effectiveness is over-predicted.
