50|$|During the 1980s, Alan Cooper {{authored}} several business applications including Microphone II for Windows and an early, critical-path {{project management}} program called <b>SuperProject.</b> Cooper sold <b>SuperProject</b> to Computer Associates in 1984, where it achieved {{success in the}} business-to-business marketplace.|$|E
50|$|Sorcim {{was best}} known for SuperCalc, a {{spreadsheet}} the company developed for the Osborne Computer Corporation portable computer. The company made many other products, including SuperWriter and <b>SuperProject</b> before its acquisition by Computer Associates in 1985. Although the company continued as a largely autonomous division of CA, it never again achieved prominence after the acquisition.|$|E

Featured on the track are Gregg Bissonette (drums), Tony Franklin (bass), Guthrie Govan (guitars) and project mastermind Douglas R. Docker (keyboards).|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} a success criterion for open-source software projects, we analyzed 122, 205 projects in the SourceForge database. There were 80, 597 projects with no downloads at all. We restricted our analysis to the 41, 608 projects that together were downloaded 704, 897, 520 times. Contrary to what we had expected, {{the distribution of the}} number of downloads of each project is not Zipf-like; only a portion of the log-log plot of the number of downloads and their rank appears to be a straight line. We performed leastsquares analysis (utilizing the Bayesian information criterion) to divide the plot into three segments. On the basis of the shapes of the corresponding curves and the locations of their boundary points, we categorized the projects as follows: 85 <b>superprojects</b> (highly successful projects with more than 1. 1 million downloads); just over 10, 000 successful projects (with more than 1680 downloads each); and struggling projects (with 1680 downloads or fewer). In terms of our criterion, only a quarter of the projects that have one or more downloads can be deemed to be successful. 6 page(s...|$|R

Newly acquired products, as well as home-built efforts, failed to achieve much sales success. These included <b>SuperProject,</b> a project management program using [...] "drop down menus," [...] which was licensed from its creator Alan Cooper; and Paul McQuesten's SuperCalc3 for the Apple IIc (in native 6502 code.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} Klang Valley officially {{consists}} of separate cities and suburbs, integration between these cities is very high, {{with a highly}} developed road network and an expanding rapid transit system. Many expressways criss-cross the metropolis making cars the most convenient way to get around. However, {{this has led to}} the Klang Valley's notorious traffic jams which span whole kilometres of expressways and make driving during peak hours exhausting. Since the 1990s, new rapid transit systems, such as the Rapid KL's light rail transit (LRT), KTM Komuter and the monorail have been developed. Most of these systems have gone through extensive expansion as a <b>superproject,</b> in which the two LRT lines are being extended into outlying suburbs such as Puchong and Subang Jaya. The Klang Valley Integrated Transit System, as of now, are currently being upgraded to become fully-fledged mass rapid transit systems with the construction of three new Klang Valley MRT lines that are respectively being built from the southeastern suburb of Kajang to the northwestern suburb of Sungai Buloh, as well as Putrajaya and through Kuala Lumpur itself. Buses that operate around Klang Valley is also extensive.|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of a {{benchmark}} test evaluating the resource allocation capabilities of the project management software packages Acos Plus. 1 8. 2, CA <b>SuperProject</b> 5. 0 a, CS Project Professional 3. 0, MS Project 2000, and Scitor Project Scheduler 8. 0. 1. The tests are based on 1560 instances of precedence– and resource–constrained project scheduling problems. For different complexity scenarios, we analyze the deviation of the makespan obtained by the software packages from the best feasible makespan known. Among the tested software packages, Acos Plus. 1 and Project Scheduler show the best resource allocation performance. Moreover, our numerical analysis reveals a considerable performance gap between the implemented methods and state–of–the–art project scheduling algorithms, especially for large–sized problems. Thus, {{there is still a}} significant potential for improving solutions to resource allocation problems in practice...|$|E
40|$|In {{the project}} DIBMOF-VALID, the {{transmission}} {{parts of the}} <b>superproject</b> DIBMOF-VALID, following the results which have been worked out up to 1996, have been finalized successfully in the timeframe January to September 1997. The work packages radio network optimization, spezification of FZB (i. e. Train Control System) quality of services and channel error model have been finalized. Optimization of the radio network led to a reduction of more than 30 % of the network elements without reducing transmission quality, which was validated on the trial site. For the train control system FZB, QoS parameters have been defined and specified. Also measuring methods have been specified. The parameters could not be fully validated. A channel error model has been designed {{as a result of}} the collected measuring files and is available for simulation. Further Results cover the finalization of the technical specification, design specifications for both driver and controller MMIs (man machine interfaces) and a new redundancy concept for the fixed transmission lines of the base stations.
