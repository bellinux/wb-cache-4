40|$|From 1997 to 1999 1005 new born German Holstein calves were {{investigated}} for {{the incidence of}} <b>supernumerary</b> <b>teats.</b> Age at inspection varied from 1 to 4 weeks. In total 110 affected calves (20 male and 90 female) and their 21 sires were genotyped for five chromosome 3 microsatellites. The average size of half-sib families was 5. 2 ranging from 2 to 17. A non-parametric multipoint linkage analysis showed no evidence for linkage...|$|E
40|$|This {{review article}} {{especially}} features the surgical treatment of udder and teat lesions in cattle. In part I anatomical specificities and different anesthetic techniques were described. Surgical treatment of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>teats,</b> accessory teats and teat fistulas was discussed. Most attention {{was paid to}} etiology, examination, prognosis, treatment and prophylaxis of teat wounds. In this part teat stenosis, leaking teat, mastectomy and hemimastectomy, mammary tumours and pre- and intramammary haematoma are reported. The treatment of teat canal obstructions is discussed in depth. The conservative treatment and the surgical treatment through the teat canal orifice or by thelotomy are described...|$|E
40|$|A Japanese native goat 2 ̆ 2 Tokara goat 2 ̆ 2 {{has been}} bred in Tokara islands, south of Kyushu island in Japan, and keeps {{peculiar}} characteristics, namely colored coat, horns, <b>supernumerary</b> <b>teats,</b> no wattles and so on. Using phenotypic homogeneity index (H. I.), the goats bred in Kagoshima Univ. (KGU), Hirakawa Zoo in Kagoshima city (HZK) and Kyushu Univ. (KSU) after introducing from Tokara islands were examined about those peculiar characteristics. Both {{of male and}} female goats had small or middle sized horns but not any wattles. All goats in the KGU and HZK populations were covered with their characteristic colored coat, but 32. 3...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports a}} {{quantitative}} genetics and genomic analysis of undesired presence of <b>supernumerary</b> <b>teats</b> (SNT) in goats. <b>Supernumerary</b> <b>teats</b> {{are a problem}} in goat breeding as they can considerably impede machine milking efficiency, leading to increased milking time and injury. This phenotype has routinely been recorded for the past 15 yr in French Alpine and Saanen goats. Around 4 % of the females had been assigned the SNT phenotype and consequently could not {{be included in the}} breeding program as elite animals. The heritability of this binary trait, estimated by applying linear logistic polygenic models to 32, 908 Alpine and 23, 217 Saanen females, was 0. 40 and 0. 44, respectively. A genome-wide association study was implemented using a daughter design composed of 810 Saanen goats sired by 9 artificial insemination bucks and 1, 185 Alpine goats sired by 11 bucks, genotyped with the goatSNP 50 chip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). This association study was based on logistic polygenic models, one with separately taken single nucleotide polymorphisms and the other with haplotypes as fixed effects. The 2 breeds were analyzed together and separately. No region was found to be significant at the genome level, but 17 regions on 10 chromosomes were significant at the chromosome level. These signals were always only slightly above the chromosome significance threshold and only a few of them overlapped across analyses. No evidence of segregation of a major gene in our Saanen and Alpine populations was observed, suggesting that SNT presence is inherited in a polygenic fashion. This conclusion regarding SNT determinism agrees with recent association analyses in cattle, and one locus was even found in an orthologous region. The possibility of applying markers-based selection on the SNT trait is therefore unlikely, but, as this trait is heritable and routinely recorded, it could be managed by attributing a dedicated estimated breeding value...|$|E
40|$|Genome-wide {{association}} studies (GWASs) {{have been}} widely applied in livestock to identify genes associated with traits of economic interest. Here, we conducted the first GWAS of the supernumerary nipple phenotype in Wadi sheep, a native Chinese sheep breed, based on Ovine Infinium HD SNP BeadChip genotypes {{in a total of}} 144 ewes (75 cases with four teats, including two normal and two <b>supernumerary</b> <b>teats,</b> and 69 control cases with two teats). We detected 63 significant SNPs at the chromosome-wise threshold. Additionally, one candidate region (chr 1 : 170. 723 – 170. 734 Mb) was identified by haplotype-based association tests, with one SNP (rs 413490006) surrounding functional genes BBX and CD 47 on chromosome 1 being commonly identified as significant by the two mentioned analyses. Moreover, Gene Ontology enrichment for the significant SNPs identified by the GWAS analysis was functionally clustered into the categories of receptor activity and synaptic membrane. In addition, pathway mapping revealed four promising pathways (Wnt, oxytocin, MAPK and axon guidance) involved {{in the development of the}} supernumerary nipple phenotype. Our results provide novel and important insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the phenotype of supernumerary nipples in mammals, including humans. These findings may be useful for future breeding and genetics in sheep and other livestock...|$|E
