It is initially expressed in stages 8-11 of development in 14 isolated bands of cells along the embryo's anterior-posterior axis.

40|$|The Drosophila <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> patched (ptc) is an {{integral}} component of the segmentation gene cascade acting in the early embryo. At later stages of embryogenesis, ptc is expressed in the primordia of epithelial placodes of a specific portion of the brain, the optic lobes. Mutant analysis shows {{that the lack of}} ptc activity alters the fate of optic-lobe primordia precursors. In ptc mutants they give rise to supernumerary neurons in the larval light-sensory system, termed Bolwig organ, which is derived from precursor cells next to the optic-lobe anlagen. We specifically eliminated ptc protein by chromophore-assisted laser inactivation (CALI) in late wild-type embryos. Such embryos show a normal segment pattern, but they develop phenocopies equivalent to the phenotype of ptc mutant Bolwig organs. Our results demonstrate that the CALI technique can be applied to separate genetic functions at different developmental stages of a living organism and that the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> ptc is redeployed to functionally discriminate between distinct developmental pathways in adjacent pools of precursor cells...|$|E
40|$|The two Drosophila genes {{gooseberry}} (gsb) and gooseberry neuro (gsbn) {{are closely}} apposed and divergently transcribed. While gsb is a <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> and mainly {{expressed in the}} epidermis, gsbn is expressed in the central nervous system. An intriguing question is how their transcriptional specificity arises. Here we show that different non-overlapping enhancer or upstream control elements drive the specific expression of gsb and gsbn. Specificity of these enhancers for their genes is achieved by their inability to activate transcription {{in combination with the}} heterologous promoter of the other gene. These results therefore suggest that compatibility between the enhancer and its cognate promoter is a mechanism ensuring transcriptional specificity...|$|E

40|$|During Drosophila embryogenesis, {{position}} {{along the}} anteroposterior axis is specified within each segment by {{the products of}} the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>genes</b> which include wingless (wg) and gooseberry (gsb). The striped expression of these genes in each segment is initially established by the pair-rule gene products during late blastoderm. This pattern is subsequently maintained after germ band extension by interaction among the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>genes</b> themselves. Here we show that the maintenance of gsb, a PHox gene encoding a paired-domain and a homeodomain, is controlled by the wg signal, the homolog of the murine Wnt- 1 protein. A control element responsible for wg-dependent maintenance of gsb expression, gsb-late element, is separable from an element required for the initial activation of gsb by pair-rule transcription factors, gsb-early element. The significance of such a regulatory strategy is discussed with respect to the establishment and maintenance of cell states within each segment by <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>genes...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{know there}} are some genes {{responsible}} for the body segmentation through research done with Drosophila melanogaster. Some examples of these genes are engrailed and wingless, that belong to the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>genes</b> class, and even-skipped, hairy and fushi-tarazu belonging to pair-rule gene class (Davis, G. k. and Patel, N. H., 1999). Engrailed is conserved among arthropods and {{has been shown to}} function like a segment formation gene in annelids. The expression of <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>genes</b> has been characterized in few annelid species and the expression patterns vary among the species characterized (Seaver, E. C. and Kaneshige, L. M., 2006). I intended to compare the development of segment formation among three annelid species, Boccardia proboscidea, Notomastus sp. (Capitellidae family) and Spirorbid sp. Beyond the comparison of segment development, I intended to see if they have similar expression patterns, or vary among the species...|$|R
40|$|Members of the Hedgehog (Hh) {{family of}} {{secreted}} signaling proteins function as potent short-range organizers in animal development. Their range {{of action is}} limited by a C-terminal cholesterol tether and the upregulation of Patched (Ptc) receptor levels. Here we identify a novel <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> in Drosophila, dispatched (disp), and demonstrate that its product is required in sending cells for normal Hh function. In the absence of Disp, cholesterol-modified but not cholesterol-free Hh is retained in these cells, indicating that Disp functions to release cholesterol-anchored Hh. Despite their opposite roles, Disp and Ptc share structural homology {{in the form of}} a sterol-sensing domain, suggesting that release and sequestration of cholesterol-modified Hh may be based on related molecular pathways...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{involved in}} glial/neuronal fate decisions during embryonic development are largely unknown. Here {{we show that}} the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> engrailed, which encodes a homeodomain protein, controls these decisions within an insect CNS lineage. The grasshopper median neuroblast (MNB) generates both neurons and midline glia in distinct temporal phases. engrailed expression in MNB progeny can be inhibited by injection of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides into the MNB nucleus. This produces a phenotype in which the midline glia do not develop and extra midline neurons are generated. In the absence of engrailed function, midline glial precursors are apparently converted into neuronal precursors. Thus, engrailed is required for execution of the decision between the glial and neuronal fates...|$|E
40|$|In Drosophila {{the process}} of {{segmentation}} depends on the function of coordinate, gap, pair-rule and segment-polarity genes. Mutations in segment-polarity genes cause defects {{in the pattern of}} every segment. Here the cloning of sequences from a <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene,</b> wingless, and the in situ localization of a transcript in embryos are described. The transcript is first detected in the anterior and posterior regions of the blastoderm embryo at cellularization, and accumulates in a series of stripes in the extended germ band, one stripe per metameric unit. Each stripe is localized to the most posterior cells of each parasegment. The signal is predominantly epidermal, and transcript accumulates only transiently in the mesoderm and nervous system. This pattern of expression is discussed with respect to models of pattern formation in segmental units...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we analyse large random Boolean {{networks}} {{in terms of}} a constraint satisfaction problem. We first develop an algorithmic scheme which allows to prune simple logical cascades and under-determined variables, returning thereby the computational core of the network. Second we apply the cavity method to analyse number and organisation of fixed points. We find in particular a phase transition between an easy and a complex regulatory phase, the latter one being characterised by the existence of an exponential number of macroscopically separated fixed-point clusters. The different techniques developed are reinterpreted as algorithms for the analysis of single Boolean networks, and they are applied to analysis and in silico experiments on the gene-regulatory networks of baker's yeast (saccaromices cerevisiae) and the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>genes</b> of the fruit-fly drosophila melanogaster.

40|$|We {{describe}} the molecular {{characterization of the}} Drosophila gene tenm, a large transcription unit spanning > 110 kb of DNA. tenm encodes a large extracellular protein of 2515 amino acids related to the extracellular matrix molecule tenascin. The Tenm protein is found in seven stripes during the blastoderm stage, and each stripe overlaps with the even-skipped stripes. tenm mutants show a phenotype resembling that of odd-paired (opa), {{a member of the}} pair-rule class of segmentation genes. Thus, Tenm is the first example of a pair-rule gene product acting from outside the cell. While the Tenm protein is under the control of fushi tarazu and even-skipped, but not of opa, at least two pair-rule genes, paired (prd) and sloppy paired (slp), and all <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>genes</b> analysed to date are under the control of tenm. Our data suggest that Tenm initiates a signal transduction cascade which acts, via or in concert with opa, on downstream targets such as prd, slp, gooseberry, engrailed and wingless, leading to an opa-like phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Guiding axon growth cones {{towards their}} targets is a {{fundamental}} process that occurs in a developing nervous system. Several major signaling systems are involved in axon-guidance, and disruption of these systems causes axon-guidance defects. However, the specific role of {{the environment in which}} axons navigate in regulating axon-guidance has not been examined in detail. In Drosophila, the ventral nerve cord is divided into segments, and half-segments and the precursor neuroblasts are formed in rows and columns in individual half-segments. The row-wise expression of <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>genes</b> within the neuroectoderm provides the initial row-wise identity to neuroblasts. Here, we show that in embryos mutant for the gene midline, which encodes a T-box DNA binding protein, row- 2 neuroblasts and their neuroectoderm adopt a row- 5 identity. This reiteration of row- 5 ultimately creates a non-permissive zone or a barrier, which prevents the extension of interneuronal longitudinal tracts along their normal anterior-posterior path. While we do not know the nature of the barrier, the axon tracts either stall when they reach this region or project across the midline or towards the periphery along this zone. Previously, we had shown that midline ensures ancestry-dependent fate specification in a neuronal lineage. These results provide the molecular basis for the axon guidance defects in midline mutants and the significance of proper specification of the environment to axon-guidance. These results also reveal the importance of segmental polarity in guiding axons from one segment to the next, and a link between establishment of broad segmental identity and axo...|$|R

40|$|Drosophila and Musca both {{belong to}} the group of higher {{dipteran}} flies and show morphologically a very similar early development. However, these two species are evolutionary separated by at least 100 million years. This presents the opportunity for a comparative analysis of segmentation gene expression across a large evolution-ary distance in a very similar embryonic background. We have analysed in detail the early expression of the maternal gene bicoid, the gap genes hunchback, Kriippel, knirps and tailless, the pair-rule gene hairy, the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> engrailed and the homoeotic gene Ultra-bithorax. We show that the primary expression domains of these genes are conserved, while some secondary expression aspects have diverged. Most notable is the finding of hunchback expression in 11 - 13 stripes shortly before gastrulation, as well as a delayed expression of terminal domains of various genes. We conclude that the early developmental gene hierarchy, as it has been defined in Drosophila, is evolutionary conserved in Musca domestica...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} DNA recognition by the homeodomain, truncated proteins containing the entire homeodomain encoded by the Drosophila engrailed gene were expressed in Escherichia colL Each protein was accumulated to an amount representing more than 40 % of the total bacterial protein and recovered in the soluble fraction. Of the three truncated proteins, the shortest one (71 amlno acid residues) was further purified by conventional chromatography. The purified engrailed homeodomain (En-HD) protected a DNA sequence, TTAATT, the core element of consensus sequences recognized by many other homeodomain proteins, from DNase I digestion. UV-CD spectra of the En-HD showed that it mainly consisted of a-helix. Based on one-dimensional 'H-NMR spectra, the tertiary structure of the En-HD was shown to be stable against temperature up to 50 'C and low pH. The low pH resistancey of the protein was also demonstrated by UV-CD measurement. Thus, the current over-production system provides an active and stable homeodomain, which is suitable for structure-function analysis.

The phenotype of apc or axin mutation in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is strikingly similar to that caused by mutation in the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene,</b> naked cuticle (nkd). Nkd inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to the Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl) family of scaffold proteins that link Wnt receptor activation to beta-catenin accumulation and TCF-dependent transcription, but human NKD genes {{have yet to be}} directly implicated in cancer.

The mutant Nkd 1 proteins are defective at inhibiting Wnt signaling; in addition, the mutant Nkd 1 proteins stabilize beta-catenin and promote cell proliferation, in part due to a reduced ability of each mutant Nkd 1 protein to bind and destabilize Dvl proteins. Our data raise the hypothesis that specific NKD 1 mutations promote Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis in a subset of DNA mismatch-repair-deficient colorectal adenocarcinomas and possibly other Wnt-signal driven human cancers...|$|E
40|$|Argonaute {{proteins}} {{are essential}} {{components of the}} molecular machinery that drives RNA silencing. In Drosophila, different members of the Argonaute family of proteins have been assigned to distinct RNA silencing pathways. While Ago 1 is required for microRNA function, Ago 2 is a crucial component of the RNA-induced silencing complex in siRNAtriggered RNA interference. Drosophila Ago 2 contains an unusual amino-terminus with two types of imperfect glutamine-rich repeats (GRRs) of unknown function. Here we show that the GRRs of Ago 2 are essential for the normal function of the protein. Alleles with reduced numbers of GRRs cause specific disruptions in two morphogenetic processes associated with the midblastula transition: membrane growth and microtubule-based organelle transport. These defects {{do not appear to}} result from disruption of siRNA-dependent processes but rather suggest an interference of the mutant Ago 2 proteins in an Ago 1 -dependent pathway. Using loss-of-function alleles, we further demonstrate that Ago 1 and Ago 2 act in a partially redundant manner to control the expression of the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> wingless in the early embryo. Our findings argue against a strict separation of Ago 1 and Ago 2 functions and suggest that these proteins act in concert to control key steps of the midblastula transition and of segmental patterning...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSubdivision of the neuroectoderm into {{discrete}} {{gene expression}} domains {{is essential for}} the correct specification of neural stem cells (neuroblasts) during central nervous system development. Here, we extend our knowledge on dorsoventral (DV) patterning of the Drosophila brain and uncover novel genetic interactions that control expression of the evolutionary conserved homeobox genes ventral nervous system defective (vnd), intermediate neuroblasts defective (ind), and muscle segment homeobox (msh). We show that cross-repression between Ind and Msh stabilizes the border between intermediate and dorsal tritocerebrum and deutocerebrum, and that both transcription factors are competent to inhibit vnd expression. Conversely, Vnd segment-specifically affects ind expression; it represses ind in the tritocerebrum but positively regulates ind in the deutocerebrum by suppressing Msh. These data provide further evidence that in the brain, in contrast to the trunc, the precise boundaries between DV gene expression domains are largely established through mutual inhibition. Moreover, we find that the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> engrailed (en) regulates the expression of vnd, ind, and msh in a segment-specific manner. En represses msh and ind but maintains vnd expression in the deutocerebrum, is required for down-regulation of Msh in the tritocerebrum to allow activation of ind, and is necessary for maintenance of Ind in truncal segments. These results indicate that input from the anteroposterior patterning system is needed for the spatially restricted expression of DV genes in the brain and ventral nerve cord...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} {{functions of}} gene products frequently {{depend on the}} developmental {{context in which they}} are expressed. Thus, studies on gene function will benefit from systems that allow for manipulation of gene expression within model systems where the developmental context is well defined. Here we describe a system that allows for genetically controlled overexpression of any gene of interest under normal physiological conditions in the early Drosophila embryo. This regulated expression is achieved through the use of Drosophila lines that express a maternal mRNA for the yeast transcription factor GAL 4. Embryos derived from females that express GAL 4 maternally activate GAL 4 -dependent UAS transgenes at uniform levels throughout the embryo during the blastoderm stage of embryogenesis. The expression levels can be quantitatively manipulated through the use of lines that have different levels of maternal GAL 4 activity. Specific phenotypes are produced by expression of a number of different developmental regulators with this system, including genes that normally do not function during Drosophila embryogenesis. Analysis of the response to overexpression of runt provides evidence that this pair-rule segmentation gene has a direct role in repressing transcription of the <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> engrailed. The maternal GAL 4 system will have applications both for the measurement of gene activity in reverse genetic experiments {{as well as for the}} identification of genetic factors that have quantitative effects on gene function in vivo...|$|E

The phenotypic consequences of Li+ treatment on Xenopus embryos and sporulating Dictyostelium {{are similar to}} the effects of inhibition or disruption, respectively, of a highly conserved protein serine/threonine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (GSK- 3). In Drosophila, the GSK- 3 homologue is encoded by zw 3 sgg, a <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> involved in embryogenesis that acts downstream of wg. In higher eukaryotes, GSK- 3 has been implicated in signal transduction pathways downstream of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Results We investigated the effect of Li+ on the activity of the GSK- 3 family. At physiological doses, Li+ inhibits the activity of human GSK- 3 β and Drosophila Zw 3 Sgg, but has no effect on other protein kinases. The effect of Li+ on GSK- 3 is reversible in vitro. Treatment of cells with Li+ inhibits GSK- 3 -dependent phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein Tau. Li+ treatment of Drosophila S 2 cells and rat PC 12 cells induces accumulation of cytoplasmic Armadillo/β-catenin, demonstrating that Li+ can mimic Wingless signalling in intact cells, consistent with its inhibition of GSK- 3. Conclusions Li+ acts as a specific inhibitor of the GSK- 3 family of protein kinases in vitro and in intact cells, and mimics Wingless signalling. This reveals a possible molecular mechanism of Li+ action on development and differentiation...|$|E
40|$|DiGeorge {{syndrome}} (DGS) is {{a developmental}} defect {{of some of}} the neural crest derivatives. Most DGS patients show haploinsufficiency due to interstitial deletions of the proximal long arm of chromosome 22. Deletions of 22 q 11 have also been reported in patients with the velocardio-facial syndrome and familial conotruncal heart defects. It has been suggested that the wide phenotype spectrum associated with 22 q 11 monosomy is a consequence of contiguous-gene deletions. We report the isolation of human cDNAs homologous to the Drosophila dishevelled (dsh) <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene.</b> Sequences homologous to the 3 ' UTR of these transcripts (DVL- 22) were positioned within the DGS critical region and were found to be deleted in DGS patients. Human DVL mRNAs are expressed in several fetal and adult tissues, including the thymus and, at high levels, the heart. Two transcripts, 3. 2 and 5 kb, were detected, in northern blot analysis, with different expression patterns in the surveyed tissues when different cDNAs were used. The isolated cDNAs exhibit high amino acid homology with the mouse and Xenopus Dvl- 1 gene, the only other vertebrate dsh homologues so far isolated, The pivotal role of dsh in fly development suggests an analogous key function in vertebrate embryogenesis of its homologue genes. Since DGS may be due to perturbation of differentiation mechanisms at decisive embryological stages, a Dsh-like gene in the small-region overlap (SRO) might be a candidate for the pathogenesis of this disorde...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground Segmentation of the Drosophila embryo {{is based}} on a cascade of {{hierarchical}} gene interactions that is initiated by maternal morphogens; these interactions define spatially restricted domains of zygotic gene expression within the blastoderm. Although the hierarchy of the segmentation genes that subdivide the trunk is well established, the patterning of the head is less well understood. Seven head segments can be assigned on the basis of metameric patterns of <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene</b> expression and internal sensory organs. The domains of expression of head gap-like genes broadly overlap, with their posterior margins out of phase by one segment. Taken together with the lack of pair-rule gene expression in the head, these observations led to the suggestion that head gap genes act in a combinatorial manner, determining head segmental borders and segmental identity at the same time. Results We have identified a new Drosophila gene, collier (col), whose expression at the blastoderm stage is restricted to a single stripe of cells corresponding to part of the intercalary and mandibular segment primordia, possibly parasegment 0. Reduction of col activity in early gastrula embryos by antisense RNA expression results in a specific lack of head structures derived from these segments. The expression of col coincides with a mitotic domain, which supports the proposal that cells in this domain undergo a concerted mitotic and differentiation program that is orchestrated at the transcriptional level. Col is an ortholog of mammalian early B-cell factor/Olfactory- 1. These proteins define a new family of transcription factors that contain a helix–loop–helix dimerization motif and a new type of DNA-binding domain that is highly conserved during evolution. Conclusion Here we describe Col, the first Drosophila member of a new family of transcription factors. Col may act as a ‘second-level regulator’ of head patterning. The structural conservation of Col during evolution raises the questions of its conservation of function in head specification and its interactions with other factors conserved between insects and vertebrates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{gooseberry}} {{locus of}} Drosophila {{consists of two}} homologous Pax genes, gooseberry neuro (gsbn) and gooseberry (gsb). Originally characterized by genetics as a single <b>segment-polarity</b> <b>gene,</b> its role in segmentation has been enigmatic, as only deficiencies uncovering both genes showed a strong segmentation phenotype while mutants of gsb did not. To solve this conundrum and assay for differential roles of gsbn and gsb, we have obtained by homologous recombination {{for the first time}} null mutants of either gene as well as a deficiency inactivating only gsbn and gsb. Our analysis shows that (i) gsbn null mutants are subviable while all surviving males and most females are sterile; (ii) gsb and gsbn share overlapping functions in segmentation and the CNS, in which gsbn largely, but not completely depends on the transcriptional activation by the product of gsb; (iii) as a consequence, in the absence of gsbn, gsb becomes haploinsufficient for its function in the CNS, and gsbn−/− gsb−/+ mutants die as larvae. Such mutants display defects in the proper specification of the SNa branch of the segmental nerve, which appears intact in gsbn−/− mutants. Lineage analysis in the embryonic CNS showed that gsbn is expressed in the entire lineage derived from NB 5 - 4, which generates 4 or 5 motoneurons whose axons are part of the SNa branch and all of which except one also express BarH 1. Analysis of gsbn−/− gsb−/+ clones originating from NB 5 - 4 further suggests that gsb and gsbn specify the SNa fate and concomitantly repress the SNc fate in this lineage and that their products activate BarH 1 transcription. Specification of the SNa fate by Gsb and Gsbn occurs mainly at the NB and GMC stage. However, the SNa mutant phenotype can be rescued by providing Gsbn as late as at the postmitotic stage. The hierarchical relationship between gsb and gsbn, the haploinsufficiency of gsb in gsbn mutants, and their redundant roles in the epidermis and CNS are discussed. A model is proposed how selection for both genes occurred after their duplication during evolution...|$|E
