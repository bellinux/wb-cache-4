5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter turnout in states without close races. Voters living outside the swing <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> greater certainty of which candidate {{is likely to}} win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E

25|$|An informal, {{heuristic}} {{meaning of}} the principle is the following: A state that only exists {{for a short time}} cannot have a definite energy. To have a definite energy, the frequency of the state must be defined accurately, and this requires the state to hang around for many cycles, the reciprocal of the required accuracy. For example, in spectroscopy, excited <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> finite lifetime. By the time–energy uncertainty principle, {{they do not have a}} definite energy, and, each time they decay, the energy they release is slightly different. The average energy of the outgoing photon has a peak at the theoretical energy of the state, but the distribution has a finite width called the natural linewidth. Fast-decaying <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> broad linewidth, while slow decaying <b>states</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> narrow linewidth.|$|E
