40|$|A new {{theoretical}} {{approach to the}} problem of the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>linear</b> antenna driven by a two-wire line is presented. Then <b>symmetrical</b> <b>linear</b> antenna and the feeder line are treated as a unique boundary-value problem leading to a system of two simultaneous integral equations containing antenna and line currents as unknown sub-integral functions. The integral equations are approximately solved by the so-called point-matching method. Due to the mutual coupling between the antenna and the line, a new conveniently defined apparent driving-point admittance is to be introduced. The method is applied on several types of linear antennas: Centre driven symmetrical dipole antenna, Centre-driven V-antenna, Cage antenna, H-antenna and System of two parallel non-staggered dipoles antennas, positioned in the air over semi-conducting ground. Then theoretical results for admittances were compared with the experiments and remarkably good overall agreement has been found.

40|$|Introduction: Complex signals {{with the}} button {{ambiguity}} function {{can provide the}} distance and speed of target independent estimation. The signal with the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>linear</b> frequency modulation has this property {{in the class of}} signal with frequency modulation. Problem statement: To show that in the class of signals frequency-shift is signal with button ambiguity function. Such signal is a signal with the quadratic frequency intra-modulation. The potential characteristics research of signal with the quadratic frequency intra-modulation: The signal with quadratic frequency modulation and its properties are considered, analytic form of signal and its spectrum are shown, figures of amplitude spectra of signal are drawn, and figures of ambiguity diagram, crosscorrelation functions and response ambiguity function in strong and weak fields are shown. The comparison of the signal with the quadratic frequency intramodulation and the signal with the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>linear</b> frequency modulation are shown. The result of research is that the ambiguity function form of a signal with the quadratic frequency intramodulation comes nearer to button in the strong correlation field and it has X ? for min the weak correlation field. The autocorrelation function of the signal with the quadratic frequency intra-modulation has some constant level which decreases with signal base increasing. It is revealed that autocorrelation function of the signalhas no side lobes. It improves resolution capability of a weak signal against the strong signal. The pedestal level of the autocorrelation function of this signal is a little lower than pedestal level of the autocorrelation function of the signal with the <b>symmetrical</b> <b>linear</b> frequency modulation. Properties of section of crosscorrelation function to two peaks and effect of these properties are considered. Signals with the quadratic frequency intramodulation are expedient for using in the sonar of submarines, because in case of submarines detection the case of multiple targets existence is the improbable. Conclusions: Conclusions about advantages and disadvantages of this signal are pre-sented. The advantages are as follows: the autocorrelation function and the cross-correlation function of the signal with the quadratic frequency intra-modulation have no side lobes. The pedestal level of the autocorrelation function has level of smaller 0. 1 for a signal with base 50. The cross-correlation function width feebly depends on speed of the target. The disadvantages are as follows: the direction of target movement can't be understood. It is compensated by existence of prior information about the target direction. ?????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ??? ???????????, ????????? ????????????? ?????? ??????? ? ??? ???????, ??????? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ? ?????? ?????, ????????? ??????? ????????????????, ??????? ????????????????????? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?? ????????? ? ???????????? ??????? ???????????????? ? ??????? ??????? ? ?????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????????????????? ??????? ?? ??? ???? ? ??????????? ????? ???????. ????????? ????????? ??????? ? ???????????? ????????? ?????????? ? ??????? ? ???????????? ???????? ??????????. ??????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????, ??????? ?????? ?????? ???????????????? ? ??????? ????????????? ???????...|$|R

The morphometric analysis can be performed through measurement of <b>linear,</b> <b>aerial,</b> relief, gradient of channel network and contributing ground slope of the basin (Nautiyal 1994; Nag and Chakraborty 2003; Magesh et al. 2012 b). The dynamic nature of runoff {{is controlled by the}} geomorphologic structure of the catchment area and the induced runoff is very sensitive towards the morphometric characteristics of the contributing area (Rudraiah et al. 2008). In India, National Institute of Hydrology (1993) has carried out hydro-geomorphological studies of various basins and their analyses were based on <b>linear,</b> <b>aerial</b> and relief aspects using different mathematical equations. Various morphometric parameters such as drainage pattern, stream order, bifurcation ratio, drainage density and other linear aspects are studied using remote sensing technique and topographical map (Mesa 2006). The surface runoff and flow intensity of the drainage system can be estimated using the geomorphic features associated with morphometric parameters (Ozdemir and Bird 2009). Pioneer work on basin morphometry has been carried out by Horton (1932, 1945), Miller (1953), Smith (1950), and Strahler (1964). Based on their ideology, similar work has been emerged throughout the world by different researchers using different techniques. In India, morphometric studies of various drainage basins have been carried out by Rastogi and Sharma (1976), Nautiyal (1994), Nag and Chakraborty (2003), Rudraiah et al. (2008), Magesh et al.

30|$|Morphometric {{analysis}} {{is an important}} aspect of characterization of watersheds.

Over the past several decades, morphometric analysis to evaluate watersheds and to describe the characteristics of surface drainage networks with reference to land and water management has been a major emphasis in geomorphology. Pioneer studies by Horton (1932, 1945) demonstrated the significance of quantitative morphometric analysis to better understand the hydrologic and geomorphic properties of watersheds. Since then, several methods of watershed morphometry were further developed (e.g., Miller 1953; Strahler 1954, 1957, 1964; Schumm 1956; Melton 1957; Faniran 1968) that enabled morphometric characterization at watershed scale to extract pertinent information on the formation and development of land surface processes.|$|R

Asymmetric expression of Pitx 2 has therefore been reported during different cardiac developmental stages, and genetic deletion of Pitx 2 provided evidence of key regulatory roles of this transcription factor during cardiogenesis and thus congenital heart diseases. More recently, impaired Pitx 2 function has also been linked to arrhythmogenic processes, providing novel roles in the adult heart.
