The market was proved, but shipping ice in this way was expensive and demand outstripped supply. Ice began to be ordered instead from the then Russian-controlled Alaska in 1851 at $75 a ton (901kg). The American-Russian Commercial Company was subsequently formed in San Francisco in 1853 to work in partnership with the Russian-American Company of Alaska to supply ice to the west coast of America. The Russian company trained Aleutian teams to harvest ice in Alaska, built saw-mills to produce insulating <b>saw-dust</b> and shipped the ice south along with supplies of chilled fish. The costs of this operation remained high and M. Tallman founded the rival Nevada Ice Company, which harvested ice on Pilot Creek and transported to Sacramento, bringing the west coast price for ice down to seven cents ($2) a pound (0.5kg).|$|E

The Antiquary, though by no means an enemy to good cheer, was a determined foe to all unnecessary expense on a journey; and upon his companion giving a hint concerning a bottle of port wine, he drew a direful picture of the mixture, which, he said, was usually sold under that denomination, and affirming that a little punch was more genuine and better suited for the season, he laid his hand upon the bell to order the materials. But Mackitchinson had, in his own mind, settled their beverage otherwise, and appeared bearing in his hand an immense double quart bottle, or magnum, {{as it is called}} in Scotland, covered with <b>saw-dust</b> and cobwebs, the warrants of its antiquity.|$|E

60|$|A {{show had}} {{the same kind of}} smell as a circus, up to a certain point, and then its smell began to be different. Both smelt of tan-bark or <b>saw-dust</b> and trodden grass, and both smelt of {{lemonade}} and cigars; but after that a show had its own smell of animals. I have found in later life {{that this is a very}} offensive smell on a hot day; but I do not believe a boy ever thinks so; for him it is just a different smell from a circus smell. There were two other reasons why a show was not as much fun as a circus, and one was that it was thought instructive, and fellows went who were not allowed to go to circuses. But the great reason of all was that you could not have an animal show of your own as you could a circus. You could not get the animals; and no boy living could act a camel, or a Royal Bengal tiger, or an elephant so as to look the least like one.|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, the {{distress}} {{in the city}} for want of food had become horrible. Olympias herself, with Roxana and the boy, and the other ladies of the court, lived on the flesh of horses. The soldiers devoured the bodies of their comrades as they were slain upon the wall. They fed the elephants, it was said, on <b>saw-dust.</b> The soldiers and the people of the city, who found this state of things intolerable, deserted continually to Cassander, letting themselves down by stealth in the night from the wall. Still Olympias would not surrender; there was one more hope remaining for her. She contrived to dispatch a messenger to Polysperchon with a letter, asking him to send a galley round into the harbor at a certain time in the night, in order that she might get on board of it, and thus escape. Cassander intercepted this messenger. After reading the letter, he returned it to the messenger again, and directed him to go on and deliver it. The messenger did so, and Polysperchon sent the galley. Cassander, of course, watched for it, and seized it himself when it came. The last hope of the unhappy Olympias was thus extinguished, and she opened the gates and gave herself up to Cassander. The whole country immediately afterward fell into Cassander's hands.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a day or}} two I {{managed to}} appear at meals; for the human grub must eat till the {{butterfly}} is ready to break loose, and no one had time to come up two flights while it was possible for me to come down. Far be it from me to add another affliction or reproach to that enduring man, the steward; for, compared with his predecessor, he was a horn of plenty; but--I put it to any candid mind--is not the following bill of fare susceptible of improvement, without plunging the nation madly into debt? The three meals were [...] "pretty much of a muchness," [...] and consisted of beef, evidently put down for the men of '76; pork, just in from the street; army bread, composed of <b>saw-dust</b> and saleratus; butter, salt as if churned by Lot's wife; stewed blackberries, so much like preserved cockroaches, that only those devoid of imagination could partake thereof with relish; coffee, mild and muddy; tea, three dried huckleberry leaves to a quart of water--flavored with lime--also animated and unconscious of any approach to clearness. Variety being the spice of life, a small pinch of the article would have been appreciated by the hungry, hard-working sisterhood, one of whom, though accustomed to plain fare, soon found herself reduced to bread and water; having an inborn repugnance to the fat of the land, and the salt of the earth.|$|E
60|$|By this time, Willoughby {{was engaged}} with the earnestness and zeal of the captive who catches {{a glimpse of}} liberty. Notwithstanding, he {{proceeded}} intelligently and with caution. The blanket given him by his captors, as a pallet, was hanging from a nail, {{and he took the}} precaution to draw this mil, and to place it above the spot selected for the cut, that he might suspend the blanket so as to conceal what he was at, {{in the event of a}} visit from without. When all was ready, and the blanket was properly placed, he began to make long heavy strokes with the tool, in a way to deaden the sound. This was a delicate operation; but the work's being done behind the blanket, had some effect in lessening the noise. As the work proceeded, Willoughby's hopes increased; and he was soon delighted to hear from Nick, that it was time to insert the saw in another place. Success is apt to induce carelessness; and, as the task proceeded, Willoughby's arm worked with greater rapidity, until a noise at the door gave the startling information that he was about to be visited. There was just time to finish the last cut, and to let the blanket fall, before the door opened. The <b>saw-dust</b> and chips had all been carefully removed, as the work proceeded, and of these none were left to betray the secret.|$|E
60|$|Covered with dust, gasping {{with the}} fatigue of a three hours' run beside the procession, but fresh at heart {{as in the}} beginning, they arrived with it on the Commons, where the tent-wagons were already drawn up, and the ring was made, and mighty men were driving the iron-headed tent-stakes, and {{stretching}} the ropes of the great skeleton of the pavilion which they {{were just going to}} clothe with canvas. The boys were not allowed to come anywhere near, except three or four who got leave to fetch water from a neighboring well, and thought themselves richly paid with half-price tickets. The other boys were proud to pass a word with them as they went by with their brimming buckets; fellows who had money to go in would have been glad to carry water just for the glory of coming close to the circus men. They stood about in twos and threes, and lay upon the grass in groups debating whether a tan-bark ring was better than a <b>saw-dust</b> ring; there were different opinions. They came as near the wagons as they dared, and looked at the circus horses munching hay from the tail-boards, just like common horses. The wagons were left standing outside of the tent; but when it was up, the horses were taken into the dressing-room, and then the boys, with many a backward look at the wide spread of canvas, and the flags and streamers floating over it from the centre-pole (the centre-pole was revered almost like a distinguished personage), ran home to dinner so as to get back good and early, and be among the first to go in.|$|E
6000|$|The {{boys did}} not miss the {{smallest}} feats of any performance, and they enjoyed them every one, not equally, but fully. They had their preferences, of course, as I have hinted; {{and one of}} the most popular acts was that where a horse has been trained to misbehave, so that nobody can mount him; and after the actors have tried him, the ring-master turns to the audience, and asks if some gentleman among them wants to try it. Nobody stirs, till at last a tipsy country-jake is seen making his way down from one of the top seats toward the ring. He can hardly walk, he is so drunk, and the clown has to help him across the ring-board, and even then he trips and rolls over on the <b>saw-dust,</b> and has to be pulled to his feet. When they bring him up to the horse, he falls against it; and the little fellows think he will certainly get killed. But the big boys tell the little fellows to shut up and watch out. The ring-master and the clown manage to get the country-jake on to the broad platform on the horse's back, and then the ring-master cracks his whip, and the two supes who have been holding the horse's head let go, and the horse begins cantering round the ring. The little fellows are just sure the country-jake is going to fall off, he reels and totters so; but the big boys tell them to keep watching out; and pretty soon the country-jake begins to straighten up. He begins to unbutton his long gray overcoat, and then he takes it off and throws it into the ring, where one of the supes catches it. Then he sticks a short pipe into his mouth, and pulls on an old wool hat, and flourishes a stick that the supe throws to him, and you see that he is an Irishman just come across the sea; and then off goes another coat, and he comes out a British soldier in white duck trousers and red coat. That comes off, and he is an American sailor, with his hands on his hips, dancing a horn-pipe. Suddenly away flash wig and beard and false-face, the pantaloons are stripped off with the same movement, the actor stoops for the reins lying on the horse's neck, and James Rivers, the greatest three-horse rider in the world, nimbly capers on the broad pad, and kisses his hand to the shouting and cheering spectators as he dashes from the ring past the braying and bellowing brass-band into the dressing-room! ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} she usually drove with Mrs. Hudson, but Rowland frequently {{saw her again}} in the evening. He was apt to spend half {{an hour in the}} little sitting-room at the hotel-pension on the slope of the Pincian, and Roderick, who dined regularly with his mother, was present on these occasions. Rowland saw him little at other times, and for three weeks no observations passed between them on the subject of Mrs. Hudson's advent. To Rowland's vision, as the weeks elapsed, the benefits to proceed from the presence of the two ladies remained shrouded in mystery. Roderick was peculiarly inscrutable. He was preoccupied with his work on his mother's portrait, which was taking a very happy turn; and often, when he sat silent, with his hands in his pockets, his legs outstretched, his head thrown back, and his eyes on vacancy, it was to be supposed that his fancy was hovering about the half-shaped image in his studio, exquisite even in its immaturity. He said little, but his silence did not of necessity imply disaffection, for he evidently found it a deep personal luxury to lounge away the hours in an atmosphere so charged with feminine tenderness. He was not alert, he suggested nothing in the way of excursions (Rowland was the prime mover in such as were attempted), but he conformed passively at least to the tranquil temper of the two women, and made no harsh comments nor sombre allusions. Rowland wondered whether he had, after all, done his friend injustice in denying him the sentiment of duty. He refused invitations, to Rowland's knowledge, in order to dine at the jejune little table-d'hote; wherever his spirit might be, he was present in the flesh with religious constancy. Mrs. Hudson's felicity betrayed itself in a remarkable tendency to finish her sentences and wear her best black silk gown. Her tremors had trembled away; she was like a child who discovers that the shaggy monster it has so long been afraid to touch is an inanimate terror, compounded of straw and <b>saw-dust,</b> and that it is even a safe audacity to tickle its nose. As to whether the love-knot of which Mary Garland had the keeping still held firm, who should pronounce? The young girl, as we know, did not wear it on her sleeve. She always sat at the table, near the candles, with a piece of needle-work. This was the attitude in which Rowland had first seen her, and he thought, now that he had seen her in several others, it was not the least becoming.|$|E

However, the employees were able to protect the boiler, main engines and pumping plant from serious damage. There were also two other planing machines in a separate building that was not destroyed. Prior to the fire Johnston had purchased machinery for a new sawmill at Shipton's Flat near Cooktown, and after the fire he placed some of the machinery at Mount Molloy. He claimed that the latter was a paying proposition and a very essential part of his organisation. It was also essential to have the mill at Mount Molloy, as most hardwood supplies came from there.|$|E
5000|$|This energetic, but {{inflammatory}} appeal, {{was followed}} by such enthusiastic plaudits, that the Sheriff hinted to the Clergyman to withdraw, and forbade Colonel Despard to proceed. The cap was then drawn over their eyes, during which the Colonel was observed again to fix the knot under his left ear, and, at seven minutes before nine o'clock the signal being given, the platform dropped, {{and they were all}} launched into eternity. From the precaution taken by the Colonel, he appeared to suffer very little, neither did the others struggle much, except Broughton, who had been the most indecently profane of the whole. Wood, the soldier, died very hard. The Executioners went under, and kept pulling them by the feet. Several drops of blood fell from the fingers of Macnamara and Wood, during the time they were suspended. After hanging thirty-seven minutes, the Colonel's body was cut down, at half an hour past nine o'clock, and being stripped of his coat and waistcoat, it was laid upon <b>saw-dust,</b> with the head reclined upon a block. A surgeon then in attempting to sever the head from the body by a common dissecting knife, missed the particular joint aimed at, when he kept haggling it, till the executioner was obliged to take the head between his hands, and to twist it several times round, when it was with difficulty severed from the body. It was then held up by the executioner, who exclaimedâ"Behold the head of EDWARD MARCUS DESPARD, a Traitor!" [...] The same ceremony followed with the others respectively; and the whole concluded by ten o'clock.|$|E

The primary fuel was coke breeze and total heat output of all the tested raw blends was the same and was calculated as 3. 8 wt. % coke breeze. The coke substitution and energy requirement provided by <b>saw-dust</b> from oak wood (SDOW) was {{in the range of}} 8 - 44 %.

The use of SDOW fuel up to 20 % as a partial substitution of coke resulted in a decrease in the sintering time but on the other hand with the increasing of SDOW the bed temperatures were reduced. A substitution of coke with SDOW more than 20 % may lead to decrease in permeability of mixture and consequently it may lead to achieve low temperature profile of bed.

Special charcoal is also shown for comparison with the Asian black charcoal. äºåº¦ã«ããããªã¤ã«ã·ã§ãã¯ãçµã¦ï¼ 1978 å¹´ 12 æã®ç¬¬ 33 åå½é£ç·ä¼ã«ããã¦æ±ºå®ããããæ°ï½¥åçå¯è½ã¨ãã«ã®ã¼ã®éçºï½¥å©ç¨ã®ä¿é²ãã«é¢ããå½é£ä¼è­°ã 1981 å¹´ 8 æã±ãã¢å½ãã¤ã­ãå¸ã«ããã¦ï¼ 125 ã±å½ï¼å çå½ 154 ï¼ã®ä»£è¡¨ 4000 åã®åå ãå¾ã¦éå¬ããï¼ãã®åé¡ã«å¯¾ãã¦å½éç¤¾ä¼ãåãã¹ãæ¹ç­ã®åºæ¬çæ çµãç­å®ãï¼ãã¤ã­ãè¡åè¨ç»ãæ¡æãããããã«ããã¨ï¼åç³ã¨ãã«ã®ã¼ä»¥å¤ã®æ°ã»åçå¯è½ã¨ãã«ã®ã¼ã¨ãã¦ï¼èªæï¼æ¨ç­ï¼ãã¤ãªãã¹å¤æï¼å¤ªé½ï¼å°ç±ï¼æ°´åï¼é¢¨åï¼æ½®åï¼æ³¢åç­ 14 ç¨®é¡ã®ã¨ãã«ã®ã¼æºãå¯¾è±¡ã«åã¨ãã«ã®ã¼æ¯ã®åå¥æªç½®ã®è¡åè¨ç»ãæ±ºãããã¦ããããã®è¡åè¨ç»ã«ããè¾¼ã¾ããæ¨è³ªç³»ã¨ãã«ã®ã¼ã«é¢ããåå¥æªç½®ã®ãã¡ï¼åªåè¡ååéã¨ãã¦éçºéä¸å½ã®è¾²å±±æå°åã®è¾²æ¥­çç£ï¼è¾²æå·¥æ¥­ï¼å®¶åº­ã¨ãã«ã®ã¼ãç¢ºä¿ããããï¼ï¼ 1 ï¼æ©ææé·æ¨¹ç¨®ã®é¸æ ï¼ 2 ï¼ä½ã³ã¹ãã»å¹çççç¼å¨å·ã®éçºï¼ 3 ï¼æ¨ç­è£½é æ¹æ³ã®æ¹å ï¼ 4 ï¼èªæä¸è¶³å°åã§ã®èªæç¨ã®æ¤æã®ä¿é²ã®ç·è¦èª²é¡ãæ¡æããã¦ããããã®ãããªå½éæå¢ãèæ¯ã«çµæ¸å¤§å½æ¥æ¬ã®éçºéä¸å½æ´å©ã®ä¸ç°ã¨ãã¦ï¼ç ç©¶éçºã¨æ®åï¼æè¡ç§»è»¢ãç®çã¨ããæ¥æ¬-ã¤ã³ããã·ã¢ä¸¡å½éã®ã°ãªã¼ã³ã¨ãã«ã®ã¼ã»ããã¼ã 1982 å¹´ 9 æã¸ã£ã¯å³¶ã®ãã´ã¼ã«è¾²ç§å¤§å­¦ãæ ç¹ã«ãã¦éããï¼å·æç»ææï¼äº¬å¤§ã»è¾²ï¼ãå£é·ã¨ãã 6 åãæ¥æ¬å­¦è¡æ¯èä¼ã®æ´å©ã«ãã£ã¦æ´¾é£ããï¼éä¼å¼ã«å¼ç¶ãï¼å¤«å¤«ã®çºè¡¨ã¨è¨è­°ãè¡ãªã£ãããã®è«æã¯ãã®ã»ããã¼ã«ãããææ¥­é¨éå¨è¬ãæå½ããç§ã®å ±åã®å¨æã§ãã...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} {{investigations of the}} hydraulic performance ofgroynes of lattice-type settled in open channel flows. Experiments were made in laboratoryflumes, under two flow conditions of fixed and movable beds. Experimental results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) the direction of flow iscontrolled by groynes {{in such a way}} that the approaching flow is partly concentrated in thecentral core of flow from the upstream side of groyne, which is examined by observing theflow pattern on the free surface through the flow visualization technique used with <b>saw-dust</b> tracer, 2) the velocity measurement using a hot-film flowineter of constant-temperatureoperation shows that the longitudinal component of mean or turbulent velocities changesextremely near the groyne, 3) it should be noticed that extensive movements of the groyne,which settled over the movable bed, will probably occur due to sand transportations...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} impact of different crop residues on late jute seed yield and organic matter content of soil. The plant height, number of branch/plant, number of pod/plant, number of seeds/pod and seed yield/plant were significantly increased with different crop residues. The performance in seed yield were dry jute leaves (89. 30 %) > lentil straw (87. 77 %) wheat straw (43. 28 %) > compost (35. 35 %) > rice straw (32. 740 %) > <b>saw-dust</b> (16. 91 %) over the control. The resources increased the soil organic matter content in soil by 24. 59, 22. 92, 26. 22, 19. 67, 29. 51 and 30. 33 % respectively over the control indicating the enrichment of soil health. In correlation studies {{it was observed that}} the jute seed yield parameters, the seed yield was highly correlated with plant height, number of branches/plant and number of pods/plant...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} lignin {{containing}} natural substrates corn-cob, coir-dust, <b>saw-dust,</b> wheat straw and bagasse particles on the extracellular secretion of laccase in the liquid culture growth medium of Pleurotus sajor-caju MTCC 141 has been studied. The culture conditions for maximum secretion of laccase by Pleurotus sajor-caju MTCC 141 have been optimized. Homogeneous preparation of laccase from the culture filtrate of the fungus {{has been achieved}} using ammonium sulphate precipitation, anion exchange chromatography on DEAE and gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G- 100. The purified enzyme preparation gave a single protein band in SDS-PAGE analysis indicating a molecular weight of 90 kD. The enzymatic characteristics Km, kcat, pH and temperature optima of the purified laccase have been determined using 2, 6 -dimethoxyphenol as the substrate and {{have been found to}} be 35 Î¼mol/L, 0. 30 minâ 1, 4. 5 and 37 oC respectively. The Km values for the other substrate like catechol, m-cresol, pyrogallol and syringaldazine have also been determined which were found to be 216 Î¼mol/L, 380 Î¼mol/L, 370 Î¼mol/L and 260 Î¼mol/L respectively...|$|E
