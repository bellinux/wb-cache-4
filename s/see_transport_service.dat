40|$|Transport is {{a crucial}} {{component}} in logistics, which joints each activity in the logistics chain. The performance of logistics heavily relies on the efficiency of <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> However, until now {{there has not been}} a clear definition about <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, along with the rapid rise of fuel prices, the input-output ratio of transport has been trapped in an unreasonable situation, which causes the poor performance of logistics. Therefore, the research on <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> and <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> efficiency is urgently required. In this paper, we propose to use semantic web technologies to construct a conceptual model of <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> and thus present a clear structure of the <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> hierarchy. Furthermore, we propose a semantic search engine based on this <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> ontology, in order to provide an efficient tool for users to query <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> providers. This design can also be seen as a potentially alternative approach for solving the issue of <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> inefficiency...|$|R

This research analyses {{the development of}} rural <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> in Kemalang Sub-district, Klaten District, Central Java Province using qualitative research method and Case Study research approach.

40|$|For most {{applications}} {{the used}} <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> providers are predetermined {{during the development}} of the application. This makes it difficult to consider the application communication requirements and to exploit specific features of the network technology.

In this paper we propose a concept for the realization of protocol independent <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Only a <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> is predetermined during {{the development of the}} application and an appropriate <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> provider is dynamically selected at run time.

40|$|An {{analytic}} model is presented for a partially reliable transport protocol based on retransmissions. The model illustrates tradeoffs between two QoS parameters (delay and throughput), and {{various levels of}} reliability.

On the other hand, over lossy networks, unreliable <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> is unable to respect an application's loss tolerance. In lossy environments, partially reliable <b>transport</b> <b>service</b> avoids the extra cost of reliable <b>transport</b> <b>service,</b> and, simultaneously, guarantees the minimal reliability that an application requires.
