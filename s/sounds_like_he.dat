500|$|According to Brown, in {{the song}}, Timberlake <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> [...] "inhaled" [...] 1970s Stevie Wonder, [...] "breathing it out" [...] {{as the song}} [...] "disperses into {{something}} spacily 21st century". Rolling Stone reviewer Jody Rosen noted that Timberlake borrows Curtis Mayfield's falsetto and Wonder's chord changes in the song. Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald wrote that Timberlake [...] "snatches swagger" [...] from Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Al Green soul [...] "with dashes of Frank Sinatra swing and Prince's heavy breathing". Empire wrote that [...] "Walt Disney meets Quincy Jones" [...] on [...] "Pusher Love Girl" [...] and that the song rivals English space rock band Spiritualized for [...] "dovetailing affection with addiction". Metros Arwa Haider declared that the song initially recalls Barry White and The Love Unlimited Orchestra, only with [...] "the walrus of lurve's bass croon" [...] replaced by Timberlake's [...] "falsetto yelp".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics and the style {{has been compared}} to that of West's The College Dropout album. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breiham praised the song, saying [...] "Jay and Kanye trade off verses and never pause for a chorus, each one building on whatever the last one said-- an old-school rap-collab style you almost never hear anymore. And since these guys are working loose and casual, it gives them chances to show how funny and clever they are without telegraphing their own importance. Simon Vozick-Levinson of Rolling Stone gave the song a four stars rating out of five wrote that [...] "West twists a few seconds of Otis Redding's [...] "Try a Little Tenderness" [...] into a Blueprint-style barrage, setting the stage for some slick collar-popping from Jay-Z ("Photo shoot fresh, looking like wealth / I'm about to call the paparazzi on myself"). Jay's performance, in turn, inspires Ye to step up his wordplay ("Luxury rap, the Hermes of verses / Sophisticated ignorance, write my curses in cursive"); the younger star <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> pulled an all-nighter trying to outdo his mentor's rhymes." [...] Frank Berg of NME gave the song a mostly positive review, stating that [...] "What we have here are two titans of black music duetting with another from beyond the grave. For that reason, it's unquestionably An Event", though feeling [...] "In all honesty, if this winds up being the highlight of Watch the Throne we'll all be a bit disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Others {{have noted}} that the show's stars are not {{particularly}} good performers or presenters. Buell and the changing cast of supporting [...] "paranormal trainees", psychologists, counselors and psychics seem inexperienced and are ineffectual at creating a sense of fear or suspense. [...] "Buell looks self-conscious and <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is reading from cue cards", one critic wrote. [...] "The remaining {{three members of the}} core team ... don't seem confident or mature enough to take on a crabby Starbucks' manager, much less a demonic presence." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{his review}} for AllMusic, Alex Henderson states [...] "Karayorgis pushes Pakula toward his more {{cerebral}} side, and the altoist <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> enjoying {{every minute of}} it." ...|$|R
5000|$|She added about casting:It {{was really}} hard to find that vampire. In fact, Cyril came in so late I thought he was {{delivering}} a pizza to my house. It was really {{late at night and}} I thought ‘God, we’re never going to find a vampire’ and he walked in. He was the first one auditioned who didn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was doing a stage play; and <b>he</b> didn’t <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was doing a period piece or something either. <b>He</b> just talked <b>like</b> a real person and I said [...] "Okay this is the guy!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Also {{once again}} turning {{out for this}} tour was John Robb who again ecstatically {{reviewed}} the Manchester date of the tour (14 December 2011 at the HMV Ritz) for his Louder Than War website. [...] Robb singled out for particular praise new album track Vince Taylor (about the 1960s musician of that name) which was premiered on the tour. [...] "Vince Taylor is primetime Adam Ant. It sounds like those off the wall early pop songs like 'Young Parisians' crossed with the 3D filmscapes of the 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' album and sounds like a potential single with its nagging riff in the verses and its great melody. It's great to hear a new song in a near two-hour set of Ant classics and obscurities and is a hint at the healthy future of this remarkable comeback from Adam... People keep talking about the best new band of the year. In a weird way here it is {{right in front of}} you. Decades in and Adam Ant sounds fresher than ever, reinvigorated he <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> has just started ... As Adam strips down to semi nakedness during the filthy Physical- the long, slow f—k of the set has reached its climax. It seems astonishing {{when you think about it}} but Adam Ant is currently fronting one of the best rock n roll shows in the UK right now." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a {{contemporary}} negative for The Division Bell, Tom Graves of Rolling Stone described [...] "What Do You Want from Me" [...] {{as the only}} track that [...] "Gilmour <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> cares".|$|E
5000|$|The {{narrator is}} {{falling in love}} and doesn't know why he is acting differently. He asks the doctor and then his friends, they all say that it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is falling in love.|$|E
50|$|Stan Boardman {{talked about}} Focke-Wulf but made it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> {{was using the}} swear word: it {{resulted}} {{in the end of}} live broadcasts of the show, until the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|... "His talent {{level is}} enough {{that even in}} four songs {{you know what a}} Matt Hires’ song <b>sounds</b> <b>like.</b> <b>He’s</b> etched his sonic mark in a very short time." [...] -Awmusic ...|$|R
5000|$|In Norway, {{there was}} much {{discussion}} about Solli-Tangen's English pronunciation of the word [...] "heart", as it could <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> sang hard, resulting in the line [...] "my hard is yours".|$|R
5000|$|Amber Authier or Exclaim! states, [...] "drummer Mark Garza shines" [...] but [...] "vocalist Sean Corbray <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is {{struggling}} to perform {{at the same level}} as the rest of his band-mates on some tracks".|$|E
5000|$|Big Chill - (Aries Spears) - Jamal's chubby friend, who {{is always}} hungry and <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> has a cold. Whenever he's {{entering}} a room he'll say [...] "the b-i-g c-h-i double l is in the hizouse".|$|E
50|$|Juno - a male lion with a nasal {{voice that}} <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> has a {{permanent}} cold. He is generally insecure and often {{seen to be}} frightened of confrontation. He is very forgetful, but loves having fun with his friends.|$|E
5000|$|Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard {{magazine}} {{reviewed the}} song favorably, {{calling it a}} [...] "lilting ballad". She {{goes on to say}} that [...] "Strait's voice <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> lived every word — the pleasure, the nostalgia, the wistful longing".|$|R
5000|$|Chris Evans stated at the 2006 Brit Awards {{that the}} song was {{originally}} to have been called [...] "It's There", but was changed due to Shaun Ryder's strong Mancunian accent making it <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was saying 'It's dare.' ...|$|R
5000|$|NME's Lucy Jones {{gave the}} album a {{favourable}} review, paying praise to Conor O'Brien's vocals, stating that [...] "O’Brien’s smiling-through-tears vocal {{that makes him}} <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he’s</b> going to explode with sorrow or joy at any minute is extraordinary." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bridges's {{style is}} soul {{resembling}} 1960s rhythm and blues. The Wall Street Journal {{described him as}} a [...] "throwback to '60s-soul a la Otis Redding and Sam Cooke." [...] Bridges performs in vintage clothing; Fort Worth Weekly described him as someone whose [...] "music <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> looks." ...|$|E
50|$|He <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> {{knows the}} game {{well enough to}} do the whole thing with his eyes shut; the {{difference}} here is he's learnt it's best to {{do this sort of}} thing with them open. This record is tuneful, jittery, exhausting and, I suspect, made by a man having difficulty in keeping a straight face.|$|E
5000|$|... “When I {{heard his}} {{impersonation}} of Barry I {{knew he was}} doing something that nobody else had done. Sean had correctly observed that Barry always <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is talking to you {{from a great distance}} away. I knew that Sean had something different, that he was really good, very clever." [...] -Anderson on Coyle.|$|E
5000|$|Dan A man phoning a florist {{in order}} to send his mother some flowers with a card. The Fonejacker uses a CD in an {{electrical}} shop which plays battleground effects, so it <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> telephoning from the Afghanistan war.|$|R
5000|$|The Rolling Stone {{review by}} Steve Futterman said the album [...] "brings out Zorn's anarchic tendencies... Quartet masterminds Zorn and Wayne Horvitz spit fire, never {{allowing}} this heartfelt tribute {{to get too}} reverential... Here Zorn <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> having serious fun".|$|R
5000|$|As {{the film}} ends, we see Raunak {{teaching}} {{a group of}} deaf children how to perceive <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> does. Additionally, we see Raunak who is then met by Gauri and a child (presumably their own). They affectionately walk together down a street unrecognized ...|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, Richard M. Juzwiak of Pitchfork {{gave the}} album a {{negative}} review, stating: [...] "The fact that Gira attempts the monumental, snug fit is admirable. Sure, he <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> means what he's saying, but his esoteric words seem born {{more out of}} self-satisfaction than pleasing listeners. Ultimately, conviction does not compensate for inaccessibility; Gira's calluses, you see, sound much more like warts." ...|$|E
50|$|Drycry - The {{nickname}} of {{the manager}} of the local Co-op store, Mr. McKelvie. McKelvie owns several of Larkspur's major supply businesses and is the town's leading employer. Don gave him the name after noticing his voice always <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is crying, but he never sees any tears. Drycry is clearly the most untrustworthy character in the series and is always trying to take advantage of Walt.|$|E
5000|$|Others {{have noted}} that the show's stars are not {{particularly}} good performers or presenters. Buell and the changing cast of supporting [...] "paranormal trainees", psychologists, counselors and psychics seem inexperienced and are ineffectual at creating a sense of fear or suspense.

5000|$|Rolling Stone {{rated the}} album with three stars out of five, {{receiving}} a mixed review: [...] "Nelson can {{be kind of}} lazy ... <b>he</b> only occasionally <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> trying. ... But his band pushes the music into airless cocktail-jazz territory, and Nelson often sounds glib and unengaged." ...|$|R
5000|$|Steve disappears, {{leaving a}} note apologizing for not repeating {{his plans to}} return to Texas, since it would <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was asking for money. Elizabeth's {{grandmother}} is perplexed, until Elizabeth explains about the incident with Cousin Bias. Steve then dies in an accident while [...] "riding the rods".|$|R
5000|$|Owen is {{a natural}} actor. <b>He</b> doesn't <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he's</b> acting, <b>he</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> a human being {{speaking}} in a situation, and that's very appealing to me. He's got a wonderful funny bone, a wonderful comic instinct that's quite unlike my own, but wonderful of its kind. He's a blond Texan kind of Everyman's hero, the kind of hero of the regiment in the old war pictures, with a great flair for being amusing. It's a rare combination and I thought he'd be great." [...] — Woody Allen, in production notes about the film ...|$|R
5000|$|Billy Dukes of Taste of Country {{rates the}} song 3.5 stars out of 5. He states, [...] "the new song - presumably from an {{upcoming}} album — {{is closer to}} the 2003 hit ‘I Love This Bar’ than it is ‘Red Solo Cup’ or ‘Beers Ago.’ All of his best bar room cuts (including ‘Whiskey Girl’ and ‘As Good as I Once Was’) work because Keith <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> could easily fill in for Norm on ‘Cheers,’ albeit a more gruff and successful version of the famous television character." ...|$|E
5000|$|Joe Daily of Metal Hammer {{noted that}} Worsnop, in {{comparison}} {{of his previous}} endeavours with Asking Alexandria, he <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is having {{a lot more fun}} musically on this album than he has on any previous album he has been featured on, approving of the band's lyrical style orientating around sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll cliches reminiscent of the 1980s, comparing their efforts to Mötley Crüe and Bon Jovi, further admiring the albums [...] "...full-throttle tempos and arena friendly choruses...' and its range of hard rock tracks, some being heavier and/or softer than some others.|$|E
5000|$|Phillip Mlynar at HipHopDX said [...] "Beyond [...] "Granted verse time on {{a quartet}} of tracks, the blend of Gibbs and Jeezy works stylistically, with the Gary gangsta's fleeter flow often {{flipping}} into double time and embellishing Jeezy's economic and guttural voice to smart effect. But too often Gibbs still sounds like a rapper yet to find the voice he's comfortable with. As singular in subject matter as Jeezy's trap raps can be, he always <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> believes what he's spitting, even when he's one-upping Kanye by claiming to use [...] "Louis Vuitton toilet paper."" ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the film}} ends, we see Frankie {{disguised}} as a homeless street musician, who is then met by Penelope and a child (presumably their own). They affectionately walk together down a street unrecognized. Additionally, we see Frankie teaching a group of deaf children how to perceive <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> does.|$|R
25|$|On the radio, Farber became easily {{identifiable}} by his unique combination of drawn-out Southern drawl, intense delivery, verbose prose, and quick wit. Sponsors loved {{his ability to}} deliver a live commercial spot, often ad-libbed, and make whatever the particular product was sound tantalizing; <b>he</b> always <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> truly believed in the product.|$|R
5000|$|Juli Thanki of Engine 145 {{thought that}} Turner's {{rendition}} of the song <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "phoning it in". Bobby Peacock of Roughstock rated it 4 stars out of 5, saying that Turner [...] "finds the right balance of emotions". He also {{thought that it was}} better than both Williams' and Dean's versions.|$|R
