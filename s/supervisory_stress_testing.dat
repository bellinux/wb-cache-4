40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the global financial crisis, policymakers in the United States and elsewhere have adopted stress testing as a central tool for supervising large, complex, financial institutions and promoting financial stability. Although <b>supervisory</b> <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> may confer substantial benefits, such tests are vulnerable to model risk. This paper studies the risk-based capital stress test conducted by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that are central to the U. S. housing finance system. This research aims to identify the sources of the stress test's spectacular failure to detect the growing risk and ultimate financial distress at these GSEs as mortgage market conditions deteriorated in 2007 and 2008. The analysis focuses on a key element of OFHEO's stress test, the models used to predict default and prepayment of 30 -year fixed-rate mortgages...|$|E
40|$|In the post-crisis era banks’ capital {{adequacy}} is {{established by the}} Basel III capital standards and, in many jurisdictions, also by supervisory stress tests. In this paper we first describe {{the ways in which}} supervisory stress tests can supplement the risk-based capital framework of Basel III and how this could be codified with a stress test buffer. We then argue that in order to ensure coherence with the macroprudential objectives of Basel III, the severity of supervisory stress tests should be procyclical. In addition, to increase the transparency and predictability of the overall capital framework, severity choices should follow a constrained discretion approach based on a simple rule. Finally, we analyze <b>supervisory</b> <b>stress</b> <b>testing</b> practices across some jurisdictions and find that while the United States and the UK frameworks are in line with some of the elements of our proposal, including most notably the need for procyclical severity, {{this is not the case}} in the euro area. stress test, capital regulation, macroprudential polic...|$|E

Large international banks began using internal <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> in the early 1990s. In 1996, the Basel Capital Accord was amended to require banks and investment firms to conduct <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> to determine their ability to respond to market events. However, up until 2007, <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> were typically performed only by the banks themselves, for internal self-assessment. Beginning in 2007, governmental regulatory bodies became interested in conducting their own <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> to insure the effective operation of financial institutions. Since then, <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> have been routinely performed by financial regulators in different countries or regions, to insure that the banks under their authority are engaging in practices likely to avoid negative outcomes. In India, legislation was enacted in 2007 requiring banks to undergo regular <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> In October 2012, U.S. regulators unveiled new rules expanding this practice by requiring the largest American banks to undergo <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> twice per year, once internally and once conducted by the regulators.

Objective: We examined the frequency of significant CAD in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain {{who have had a}} recent negative or inconclusive (< 85 % of predicted maximum heart rate) cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>test.</b> Methods: This was a retrospective chart review of patients identified from ED and cardiology registries at the study hospital. We included patients presenting to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain, with a negative cardiac <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> {{in the past three years}} as the last cardiac test, and hospital admission. One-hundred sixty-four patients met the inclusion criteria. Their admission was reviewed for {{diagnosis of}} CAD by positive serum troponin, percutaneous coronary intervention, or positive <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> while an inpatient. Results: Of 164 patients, 122 (74. 4 %, 95 % CI 67. 7, 81. 1) had a negative <b>stress</b> <b>test</b> prior to the index admission, while 42 (25. 6 %, 95 % CI 18. 9, 32. 3) had otherwise normal but inconclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests.</b> Thirty-four (20. 7 %, 95 % CI 14. 4, 27. 0) of the included patients were determined to have CAD. Twenty-five of the 122 patients (20. 5 %, 95 % CI 13. 3, 27. 7) had negative pre-admission <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> and nine of 42 patients (21. 4 %, 95 % CI 9. 0, 33. 8) had inclusive <b>stress</b> <b>tests</b> of CAD. A statistical comparison between these two proportions showed no significant difference (p =. 973).
