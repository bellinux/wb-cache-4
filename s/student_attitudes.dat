40|$|Graduation date: 1984 This {{research}} project compared teacher attitude using the Pupil Control Ideology Form with <b>student</b> <b>attitude</b> using the Arlin-Hills <b>Student</b> <b>Attitude</b> Survey. P. C. I. Forms {{were collected from}} 834 teachers from 95 elementary Christian schools in several states. A total of 1074 <b>student</b> <b>attitude</b> surveys were collected from Christian school students in grades 4 th through 6 th from groups of Christian schools determined to be high P. C. I. schools and low P. C. I. schools. The null hypothesis of no relationship between the <b>attitudes</b> of <b>students</b> for high P. C. I. schools and for low P. C. I. schools was accepted. The test of null hypothesis was the Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) using a 2 x 3 x 2 factoral design. The results of the MANOVA provided evidence to accept the null hypothesis based on the significance at the. 05 level. Interaction effects of grade level and sex differences were significant beyond the. 05 level, as were grade, sex and P. C. I. interaction for some measures of <b>student</b> <b>attitude.</b> Most {{of the variance in}} this case, however, is attributed to grade level and sex interaction effect and not to high and low P. C. I. Several important factors did emerge from the study. It was determined, as in other studies using the P. C. I., that pupil control ideology of teachers has wide variance across individual teachers, classrooms, and schools. The Arlin-Hills instruments also provided wide variance of scores on a similar basis. The <b>student</b> <b>attitude</b> scores of <b>students</b> tend to diminish from 4 th through 6 th grades. The <b>attitude</b> of <b>students</b> toward teachers and learning processes can be combined as a possible measure of climate due to high correlation between those two measures. However, <b>student</b> <b>attitude</b> toward teachers and toward learning processes should not be combined with <b>student</b> <b>attitude</b> toward mathematics and language arts because of reverse correlations.

This research used the quasi experimental research. Its population was all of the students in Grade VII of State Junior Secondary Schools of Belitung regency in Academic Year 2014 / 2015. The samples of the research were taken by using the stratified cluster random sampling technique and consisted of 285 students.
