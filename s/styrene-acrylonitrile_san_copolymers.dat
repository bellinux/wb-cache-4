Both binary and ternary blends were miscible at certain blends compositions, and the miscible blends showed the LCST-type phase behavior or did not phase separated until thermal degradation temperature. The miscible region of binary blends is wider than that of the corresponding ternary blends. Furthermore, the phase-separation temperatures of miscible binary blends are higher than those of miscible ternary blends at the same chemical compositions. To explain the destabilization of polymer mixture with the increase of the number of component, interaction energies of binary pairs involved in these blends were calculated from the phase separation temperatures using lattice-fluid theory and then the phase stability conditions for the polymer mixture was analyzed with volume fluctuation thermodynamics...|$|E
40|$|In this study, high {{intensity}} ultrasound {{was employed to}} induce mechano-chemical degradation during melt mixing of polycarbonate (PC) {{and a series of}} <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> (<b>SAN)</b> <b>copolymers.</b> It was confirmed that generation of macroradicals of constituent polymers can lead to in-situ copolymer formation by their mutual combination, which should be an efficient path to compatibilize immiscible polymer blends and stabilize their phase morphology in the absence of other chemical agents. Based on the effectiveness of the com-patibilization by ultrasound assisted mixing process, we investigated the effects of viscosity ratio of PC and SAN and AN content in SAN on the compatibilization of PC/SAN blends. It was found that effectiveness of compatibilization is optimal when the AN content is in the range of favorable interaction with PC and the viscosity of the matrix is higher than that of the dispersed phase. In addition, changes in the interfacial tension between PC and SAN were assessed by examining relaxation spectra which were obtained from measuring rheological properties of ultrasonically treated blends...|$|E

The laser fluence necessary to locally ablate the copolymer is found to be dependent on the copolymer composition. Unlike other dielectric polymers, the laser irradiation produced both direct ablation of the irradiated material and collapse of the surface. It is shown that, by varying the laser fluence and the copolymer composition, the surface structure can be changed from a periodic pattern with a swelled topography to an ablated-like structure.

The dielectric techniques used include broadband ac dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS, in the frequency range of 10 (- 2) to 10 (7) Hz and a temperature range of 20 - 200 degrees C, and thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC) techniques in the temperature range of - 170 - 30 degrees C. These techniques enable us to observe the primary alpha relaxations and the secondary gamma and beta relaxations of TPU and SAN in the pure components and in the blends and to follow the dependence of their characteristic parameters on composition. DRS proves to be very sensitive in monitoring the melting of the crystalline soft segments of TPU in the blends. In addition the investigation of de conductivity effects in the blends provides information on the morphology of the blends at mesoscopic level.

This work involves the synthesis of <b>Styrene-Acrylonitrile</b> (<b>SAN)</b> <b>copolymer</b> based materials for CO 2 capture application and synthesis of novel Platinum and Palladium incorporated PAN-based materials for catalysis of hydrogenation reactions. Copolymers with varying PAN/Polystyrene ratio and particle size were synthesized using micellar and coagulative homogenous nucleation mechanisms in an emulsion polymerization system. An appropriate synthesis recipe for all ratios of <b>SAN</b> <b>copolymer</b> nanoparticles was deduced. Platinum-incorporated PAN material was produced by mini-emulsion technique. TEM-EDX mapping revealed good dispersion of platinum in the polymer nanoparticle. Palladium incorporation was brought about by batch emulsion polymerization with water-soluble palladium precursor.

40|$|The {{present study}} employs a {{standardized}} progressive load scratch test (ASTM D 7027 /ISO 19252) {{to investigate the}} fundamental physical and mechanistic origins of scratch deformation in <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> (<b>SAN)</b> random <b>copolymers.</b> Previous findings from numerical simulation using finite element methods are used to establish correlation between mechanical properties and key scratch deformation mechanisms of the SAN model systems. For SAN, the acrylonitrile (AN) content and molecular weight (MW) can be changed to alter mechanical properties such as tensile strength and ductility. The key scratch deformation mechanisms are identified as: scratch groove formation, scratch visibility, periodic micro-cracking and plowing. Groove formation has been correlated to the secant modulus at the compressive yield point while micro-cracking and plowing {{are related to the}} tensile strength of the material. The fundamentals and physical origins of scratch visibility are discussed. It is explained how unbiased evaluation is accomplished by means of an automatic digital image analysis software package (ASV?). Frictional behavior and the effects of scratch speed and moisture absorption are also addressed. Increasing the AN content and/or the MW of the <b>SAN</b> random <b>copolymers</b> generally enhances the scratch resistance of the material with regard to the onset of the key deformation mechanisms. Increasing the scratch speed increases the brittleness of the material, resulting in failure at lower applied loads. Moisture absorption increases with AN content and imparts a degree of plasticization as the moisture diffuses into the sub-surface. This plasticization initially results in a degradation of scratch resistance with respect to the key deformation mechanisms, but then, after saturation, the moisture on the surface provides lubrication and improves the scratch resistance. It {{is important to note that}} polymers are fundamentally different in nature, but the findings of this study serve as an important stepping stone down the path to a deeper understanding of polymer scratch behavior...|$|R

Glass transition behavior depended upon the applied transformation path from the liquid-equilibrium state to the glassy state. From isobaric cooling ramps performed at constant rate and at several pressures, it was possible to determine the glass transition temperature and its dependence upon pressure; whereas from isothermal compressions at various temperatures, it was possible to determine a glass transition pressure and its temperature dependence. Both the dependences were linear, and a correlation was observed between the slopes of the fitting lines.

Study of the molecular weight distributions of PMMA and SAN by gel permeation chromatography indicates that the mechanisms of degradation of both components are modified in the blend. The G-value for main chain scission of PMMA is lower in the blend than in pure PMMA and decreases with increasing SAN content. Main chain scission and crosslinking occur simultaneously in pure SAN and in the blends.

It is clearly demonstrated that the phase morphology of these blends and the acrylonitrile (AN) content of the SAN component are important factors with respect to the ultimate mechanical properties (tensile strength and elongation at fracture). Following injection molding, a very fine phase distribution is observed for blends with SAN components containing 15 to 29 % AN. By annealing of the blends at 200 -degrees-C. i. e. above T(g) (PC), it has been possible to obtain different degrees of domain sizes. From this range of morphologies, quite similar phase structures can be selected differing only in AN-content of the SAN blend components. This allows a systematic investigation of the effect of the AN-content on the tensile stress-strain properties of PC/SAN blends. The elongation at fracture exhibits an optimum for blends with SAN containing 24 % AN. A coarsening of the phase morphology only results in a decrease of the ductility and not in a shift of the optimum.

40|$|Blends of <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> (<b>SAN)</b> with ethylene-propylene-diene (EPDM) {{with and}} without high impact {{polystyrene}} (HIPS) as a compatibilizer were studied. One series of blends was prepared in composition 95 / 5, 90 / 10, 85 / 15, 80 / 20 and 60 / 40; and the second series of blends was prepared with addition of 5 wt % of HIPS. Their morphology and thermal behaviour were inspected by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and dynamic mechanic analysis (DMA), respectively. Further on, blends were separated to their components by Soxlet extraction in selective solvent and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), respectively. The results of morphological observations revealed that {{the addition of a}} small percentage of compatibilizer decreases the domain size of the dispersed phase and the compatibility of the blends was enhanced. The shifts of values of glass temperatures (Tg) in the examined blends also indicate that with addition of compatibilizer HIPS miscibility between SAN and EPDM is improved...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{molecular}} mobility and microphase separation studies in blends of crosslinked polyurethanes and <b>styrene-acrylonitrile</b> (<b>SAN),</b> prepared by reactive blending, {{by means of}} differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) techniques. The DRS techniques employed include broadband ac techniques, 10 (- 2) - 10 (6) Hz, and thermally stimulated depolarization currents (TSDC) techniques, - 180 to 30 degrees C. The results suggest, in agreement with each other by the different techniques, that SAN promotes the microphase separation between hard segment (HS) microdomains and soft segment (SS) microphase due to SAN-MS interactions, whereas SAN-SS interactions are weak. TSDC thermal sampling techniques show that a compensation law holds for the alpha relaxation associated with the glass transition of the SS microphase, with the compensation temperature being {{very close to the}} glass transition temperature. Analysis of the alpha relaxation in terms of fragility indicates that the systems under investigation are fragile. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
