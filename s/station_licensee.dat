50|$|Often an STA is {{necessary}} {{due to an}} unforeseen event. While one is no longer needed to replace a particular transmitter, it {{is necessary}} to replace a radio antenna with another one that has different characteristics. STAs are often issued for a particular mode of operation while a full application for a construction permit is pending. <b>Station</b> <b>licensees</b> must exhibit why the STA is necessary and serves the public good. For example, WANN-CD has a permit to use an omnidirectional antenna for digital TV, but received an STA to diplex into the same antenna used by analog WANN-LP, which has a slightly directional antenna. This obviously served the public good by getting the station on the air earlier (before the original full-power analog cutoff in June 2009), than waiting for the new antenna, even though coverage is somewhat less in some directions.|$|R
