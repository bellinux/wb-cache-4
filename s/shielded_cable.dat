25|$|Open wire {{test leads}} (flying leads) {{are likely to}} pick up interference, so they are not {{suitable}} for low level signals. Furthermore, the leads have a high inductance, so they are not suitable for high frequencies. Using a <b>shielded</b> <b>cable</b> (i.e.,coaxial cable) is better for low level signals. Coaxial cable also has lower inductance, but it has higher capacitance: a typical 50ohm cable has about 90pF per meter. Consequently, a one-meter direct (1X) coaxial probe will load a circuit with a capacitance of about 110pF and a resistance of 1megohm.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{lightning protection}} systems use a <b>shielded</b> <b>cable</b> system. [...] These systems consist {{of one or}} more conductors enclosed by a conductive shield. [...] The cable has both conductors of one end connected to a grounding element. [...] This is intended to provide protection from electromagnetic interference. [...] Such systems reduce the electromagnetically induced voltage in a shielded conductor. [...] This is intended to provide protection against induced electromagnetic interference from lightning. [...] This network provides a normally-high impedance which breaks down to a very low impedance in response to a momentary voltage surge electromagnetically induced in the shield. [...] This establishes a conductive path between the shield and ground. [...] Any surge voltage from lightning creates a current through the cable. [...] This results in an electromagnetic field of the opposite direction, which cancels or reduces the magnitude of the electromagnetic field within the <b>shielded</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Shielding</b> <b>cables</b> - In general, using <b>shielded</b> <b>cables</b> {{to protect}} the wires from {{unwanted}} noise frequencies in a sensitive circuit is good practice. A shielded wire {{can be thought of}} as a small Faraday cage for a specific wire as it uses a plastic or rubber enclosing the true wire. Just outside the rubber/plastic covering is a conductive metal that intercepts any noise signal. Because the conductive metal is grounded, the noise signal runs straight to ground before ever getting to the true wire. It is important to ground the shield at only one end to avoid a ground loop on the shield.|$|R
