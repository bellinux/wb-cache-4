Originally, the Spanish had ordered regulations on trade with Cuba, which kept the island from becoming a dominant <b>sugar</b> <b>producer.</b> The Spanish were interested in keeping their trade routes and slave trade routes protected. Nevertheless, Cuba's vast size and abundance of natural resources made it an ideal place for becoming a booming <b>sugar</b> <b>producer.</b> When Spain opened the Cuban trade ports, it quickly became a popular place. New technology allowed a much more effective and efficient means of producing sugar. They began to use water mills, enclosed furnaces, and steam engines to produce higher-quality sugar at a much more efficient pace than elsewhere in the Caribbean.|$|E
