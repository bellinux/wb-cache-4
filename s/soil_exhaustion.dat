5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The wheat fields of the Dakotas and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from <b>soil</b> <b>exhaustion</b> due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{gives an}} {{approach}} to a quantitative treatment of <b>soil</b> atmosphere <b>exhaustion</b> measures at contamination with chlorinated hydrocarbons and {{on the design of}} units for <b>soil</b> atmosphere <b>exhaustion.</b> It is demonstrated that account of increasing immobilization of the liquid phase during exhaustion, the basic multiphase flow and transport problem can be reduced to the singlephase transport problem in the gas phase. Cleaning time and efficiency are governed by the following parameters: soil permeability, contaminant distribution between the phases, mechanism and velocity of matter transfer, threedimensional distribution of permeability and transfer velocity. In-situ determination of these parameters is discussed. A complex numerical model tool has been compiled to compute the efficiency of exhaustion units in the decontamination of soils.

40|$|The {{dominant}} {{drive for}} understanding soil {{has been to}} pace its fertility with human demand. Today, warnings about <b>soil’s</b> <b>exhaustion</b> and endangered ecology raise concerns marked by fears of gloomy environmental futures, prompting scientists and soil practitioners urgently to develop better ways {{of taking care of}} soils. Yet the pace required by ecological soil care could be at odds with the predominant temporal orientation of technoscientific intervention, which is driven by an inherently progressivist, productionist and restless mode of futurity. Through a conceptual and historical approach to the soil sciences and other domains of soil knowledge, this article looks for soil ontologies and relations to soil care that are obscured by the predominant timescape. Contemporary discussions of the future of the soil sciences expose tensions between ‘progress as usual’ – by intensifying productivity – and the need to protect the pace of soil renewal. The intimate relation of soil science with productionism is being interrogated, as ecology attempts to engage with soil as a living community rather than a receptacle for crops. In this context, and beyond science, the ‘foodweb’ model of soil ecology has become a figure of alternative human–soil relations that involve environmental practitioners in the soil community. Reading these ways of making time for soil as a form of ‘care time’ helps to reveal a diversity of more-than-human interdependent temporalities, disrupting the anthropocentric appeal of predominant timescales of technoscientific futurity and their reductive notion of innovation.

40|$|Little is {{currently}} known about modifications in edaphic characteristics caused by short-rotation eucalyptus and {{the impacts of}} these alterations on the sustainability of eucalyptus wood production. This study was carried out to identify theses changes at five sites of eucalyptus plantation {{in the region of}} the Rio Doce Valley, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Areas with more than three previous eucalyptus cycles, adjacent to pasture land or native forest, were chosen. Soil samples were collected and soil fertility analyzed by routine methods and other fractionation methods in order to measure alterations in the K, Ca and Mg contents as a consequence of eucalyptus cultivation. In the eucalyptus areas, reductions in the exchangeable Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and K+ contents and pH were observed and increased Al 3 + and H + Al contents. Of all nutrients, only P contents (Mehlich- 1 P) increased in the eucalyptus areas. The reduction in exchangeable forms and in medium-term soil nutrient pools indicates the need for higher nutrient rates than the currently applied in order to prevent nutritional limitations and <b>soil</b> nutrient <b>exhaustion.</b> After several eucalyptus rotations there was a recovery in the SOM content in comparison to degraded pasture soils, although not {{to the level of the}} native forest soil. The positive correlation between effective CEC and medium-term non-exchangeable Ca, Mg and K with SOM emphasizes the need for adequate fertilizer and plant residue management to sustain or even increase forest productivity in future cycles...|$|R

40|$|Vegetable crops grown under plastic tunnels in the Mediterranean {{region are}} intensively managed. Generally, a spring row crop, such as tomatoes, is {{followed}} by one or two lettuce crops in the autumn and winter. Lettuce cropping in these systems can generate significant nitrate losses. Thus, nitrogen must be properly managed in such systems. Drip fertigation of the tomato crops prior to lettuce cropping creates an uneven distribution of nitrate in the soil including its accumulation between the rows. However, the fate of this residual, unevenly distributed nitrate {{and its impact on}} the following crop nitrogen (N) budget is unknown. Thus, a 2 -year experiment was conducted to study N dynamics in a tomato–lettuce rotation. Two different management systems were tested: one with typical current farm practices (“C”) and a second system with decisions based on continuous monitoring of soil nitrate and water content (“L”) that resulted in the requirement of less water and N inputs. We revealed a recurring annual sequence in the two systems: strong N accumulation occurred during the spring crop and autumn fallow followed by <b>soil</b> nitrate <b>exhaustion</b> during lettuce growth as a consequence of crop uptake and leaching. We showed that leaching during lettuce growth appeared unavoidable even in the “L” management system. Between the former tomato rows (in the inter-rows), the higher initial soil N residues resulted in significantly higher N uptake (an increase of 14 – 25 kg ha- 1) and higher leaching (an increase of 2 – 32 kg ha- 1) compared with uptake and leaching within the tomato rows. Therefore, to limit substantial N losses, nitrogen fertiliser recommendations should take into account the residual nitrate distribution in the soil by adding different amounts of fertiliser depending on the position relative to the previous row crop...|$|R
50|$|Shifting {{cultivation}} is {{an agricultural}} {{system in which}} plots of land are cultivated temporarily, then abandoned and allowed to revert to their natural vegetation while the cultivator moves on to another plot. The period of cultivation is usually terminated when the soil shows signs of exhaustion or, more commonly, when the field is overrun by weeds. The length of time that a field is cultivated is usually shorter than the period over which the land is allowed to regenerate by lying fallow. This technique is often used in LEDCs (Less Economically Developed Countries) or LICs (Low Income Countries). In some areas, cultivators use a practice of slash-and-burn as one element of their farming cycle. Others employ land clearing without any burning, and some cultivators are purely migratory and do not use any cyclical method on a given plot. Sometimes no slashing at all is needed where regrowth is purely of grasses, an outcome not uncommon when <b>soils</b> are near <b>exhaustion</b> and need to lie fallow.In shifting agriculture, {{after two or three}} years of producing vegetable and grain crops on cleared land, the migrants abandon it for another plot. Trees, bushes and forests are cleared by slashing, and the remaining vegetation is burnt. The ashes add potash to the soil. Then the seeds are sown after the rains.|$|R
25|$|The Bengal {{soil profile}} {{impacted}} the famine in two ways. First, {{the soil in}} eastern Bengal, in combination with abundant irrigation from monsoon rains, was unique {{for its ability to}} grow large amounts of high quality jute. This gave Bengal an effective monopoly on a cash crop. Jute of lesser quality was grown in smaller quantities in western Bengal, but eastern Bengal was the clear-cut center of jute production. During the famine, jute-producing districts suffered higher mortality rates. Second, the sandy soil of eastern Bengal and the lighter sedimentary soil of the Sunderbans tended to drain more rapidly after the monsoon season than the laterite or heavy clay regions of western Bengal. As a rule, malaria epidemics lasted approximately one month longer in the areas with slower drainage. This problem was {{compounded by the fact that}} <b>soil</b> <b>exhaustion</b> created the need for large tracts in western and central Bengal to be left fallow; eastern Bengal had far fewer fallow fields. Flooded fallow fields are one key breeding place for malaria carrying mosquitoes, which was the biggest killer during the famine.|$|E
25|$|In 1948 the {{government}} {{set up a}} Land Planning Committee, whose first report recommended that government should re-acquire land which was either undeveloped or occupied by large numbers of Africans. This included the projected re-purchase of {{about two-thirds of the}} British Central Africa Company’s freehold land. The company had long fought to retain its landholdings, much of which was undeveloped, claiming that <b>soil</b> <b>exhaustion</b> and erosion, deforestation and poor husbandry would result if the land were resettled by smallholders. In 1948, the company was still unwilling to sell its better land to {{the government}}. However, it was prepared to sell inferior land, and in 1948 the government bought freehold land from the British Central Africa Company in the Chingale area {{in the western part of}} Zomba District to convert it to land held by customary tenure and resettle Africans evacuated from other estates in the Shire valley and highlands on it. The Chingale resettlement scheme took place from 1948 to 1954. Following a serious famine in 1949, Geoffrey Colby, the Governor of Nyasaland from 1948 to 1956, attempted to get the major estate companies to sell the under-used parts of their land to the government for resettlement. However, Colby made it clear he would not use the compulsory purchase powers he had been granted, preferring voluntary agreement. By ruling compulsion out, he gave unintended encouragement to the British Central Africa Company’s plans to retain its estates. In 1955, the Nyasaland government agreed to purchase almost 36,470 acres in Cholo District with 24,600 residents from the British Central Africa Company for resettlement. Before this, the company had owned 74,262 acres with 36,400 residents. The company retained 38,143 acres, but of the 11,800 residents, 3,240 were moved onto Crown lands. However, it was only in 1962, when independence was clearly in prospect, that the company accepted the need to sell its surplus land, retaining only its most profitable assets. At the time of its takeover by Lonrho (Malawi) Ltd in 1964, the Central Africa Company Ltd owned a 3,500 acre tea plantation, two tea factories and some other small estates. The Central Africa Company Ltd, with its remaining agricultural assets, was sold by Lonrho to African Plantations Corporation June 1997.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Johor's economy {{began to}} diversify from gambier and pepper {{plantations}} to other agricultural crops. Starting with coffee in 1881, [...] crops such as tapioca, tea, pineapple and rubber were introduced into the state. Coffee and tapioca was quickly abandoned in the 1890s when the value of these crops experienced a drop, while rubber was introduced and quickly established a strong foothold in Johor, as the world demand for rubber increased greatly around 1910. Prices for gambier plunged between 1905 and 1906, and many Kangchu abandoned gambier in favour of rubber.
