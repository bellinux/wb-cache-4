5|$|By the 17th dynasty, the Book of the Dead {{had become}} {{widespread}} {{not only for}} members of the royal family, but courtiers and other officials as well. At this stage, the spells were typically inscribed on linen <b>shrouds</b> wrapped around the dead, though occasionally they are found written on coffins or on papyrus.|$|E

King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern, to which he clipped a harness. His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E
50|$|Not all <b>shrouded</b> {{turbines}} are {{the same}} - {{the performance of a}} <b>shrouded</b> turbine varies with the design of the <b>shroud.</b> Not all <b>shrouded</b> turbines have undergone independent scrutiny of claimed performances, as companies closely guard their respective technologies, so quoted performance figures need to be closely scrutinised. Lunar Energy reports a 15%-25% improvement over the same turbine without the <b>shroud.</b> <b>Shrouded</b> turbines do not operate at maximum efficiency when the <b>shroud</b> does not intercept the current flow at the correct angle, which can occur as currents eddy and swirl, resulting in reduced operational efficiency. At lower turbine efficiencies the extra cost of the <b>shroud</b> must be justified, while at higher efficiencies the extra cost of the <b>shroud</b> has less impact on commercial returns. Similarly the added cost of the supporting structure for the <b>shroud</b> has to be balanced against the performance gained. Yawing (pivoting) the <b>shroud</b> and turbine at the correct angle, so it always faces upstream like a wind sock, can increase turbine performance but may need expensive active devices to turn the <b>shroud</b> into the flow. Passive designs can be incorporated, such as floating the <b>shrouded</b> turbine under a pontoon on a swing mooring, or flying the turbine like a kite under water. One design by Tidal Energy Pty Ltd passively yaws the <b>shrouded</b> turbine using a turntable with a peer reviewed claim of 3.84 (384%) increase in efficiency over the same turbine minus the <b>shroud</b> - See Kirke..|$|R

The influence of <b>shroud</b> ventilation, relative <b>shroud</b> diameters, and orientation of the ventilation holes was studied. In some cases, average inner-cylinder Nusselt numbers were found to exceed the comparable bare-cylinder values {{by as much as}} 50 percent. Cylinder heat convection was influenced more by the degree of ventilation and <b>shroud</b> diameter than by hole orientation. An equivalent inner bare cylinder diameter, based on degree of <b>shroud</b> ventilation and <b>shroud</b> diameter, was developed which can be useful in <b>shroud</b> design studies...|$|R

5|$|A vampire is a {{being from}} {{folklore}} that subsists by feeding {{on the life}} essence (generally {{in the form of}} blood) of the living. In European folklore, vampires were undead beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore <b>shrouds</b> and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.|$|E
5|$|In Antananarivo and {{throughout}} the highlands, Merina and Betsileo families practice the famadihana, an ancestor reburial ceremony. This ceremony typically occurs {{five to seven years}} after the death of a relative and is celebrated by removing the relative's lamba-wrapped remains from the family tomb, rewrapping it with fresh silk <b>shrouds</b> and returning it to the tomb. Relatives, friends and neighbors are invited {{to take part in the}} music, dancing and feasting that accompanies the event. The famadihana is costly; many families sacrifice higher living standards to set aside money for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced {{by the work of}} François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of <b>shrouds,</b> coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his background as a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments before someone's death.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted to investigate the aerothermal performance of a <b>shrouded</b> high pressure turbine blade {{in a large scale}} rotating rig. The rotor blade and the associated <b>shroud</b> and casing geometry have been modelled in a large scale low speed turbine rig that was designed to investigate a novel passive <b>shroud</b> cooling methodology. The objective of the present paper is to describe the aerothermal performance of a passive <b>shroud</b> cooling strategy using measured heat transfer and adiabatic cooling effectiveness data. Improved physical understanding of the <b>shroud</b> aerodynamics as reported in the companion paper Lehmann et al. [1] will be used here to support the analysis. Highly resolved experimental heat transfer data was acquired on the <b>shroud,</b> the fins and on the <b>shroud</b> underside with the thin heater film method. The distribution of the adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the rotor <b>shroud</b> was measured with a combination of the Ammonia-Diazo and a foreign gas sampling technique. The measurements are complemented by steady numerical computations of the turbine stage. Due to the impact of vortical flow structures in the over <b>shroud</b> cavities, the Nusselt numbers on the <b>shroud</b> top surfaces were found to be of the same order as on the <b>shroud</b> underside. The passive <b>shroud</b> cooling concept was found to provide quite efficient and uniform cooling to the over-shroud surfaces while the distribution of coolant on the <b>shroud</b> underside was significantly affected by the rotor secondary flow...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} two-dimensional thrust augmenting ejector flows has been conducted. Measurements of the <b>shroud</b> surface pressure distribution, mean velocity, turbulent intensities and Reynolds stresses {{were made in}} two <b>shroud</b> geometries at various primary nozzle pressure ratios. The effects of <b>shroud</b> geometry and primary nozzle pressure ratio on the <b>shroud</b> surface pressure distribution, mean flow field and turbulent field were determined. From these measurements the evolution of mixing within the <b>shroud</b> of the primary flow and entrained fluid was obtained. The relationship between the mean flow field, the turbulent field and the <b>shroud</b> surface pressure distribution is discussed...|$|R
5|$|The {{leading edge}} of the wing has a {{honeycomb}} structure panel construction, providing strength with minimal weight; similar panels cover the flap <b>shrouds,</b> elevators, rudders and sections of the fins. The skin panels are integral with the stringers and are fabricated using computer-controlled machining, reducing production time and cost. Combat experience has shown that this type of panel is more resistant to damage. The skin is not load-bearing, so damaged skin sections can be easily replaced in the field, with makeshift materials if necessary. The ailerons are at the far ends of the wings for greater rolling moment and have two distinguishing features: The ailerons are larger than is typical, almost 50 percent of the wingspan, providing improved control even at slow speeds; the aileron is also split, making it a deceleron.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Persia, saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') was {{cultivated}} at Derbena and Isfahan in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads {{have been}} found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral <b>shrouds.</b> Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood {{to use as a}} body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after Cyrus the Great. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.|$|E
5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find and climbed up into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the <b>shrouds.</b> The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E

The rotor blade and the associated <b>shroud</b> and casing geometry have been modelled in a large scale low speed turbine rig that was designed to investigate a novel passive <b>shroud</b> cooling methodology. The objective of the present paper is to provide {{a detailed description of the}} flow field around the rotor blade <b>shroud.</b> The improved physical understanding of the <b>shroud</b> flow gained from this study will be used to analyse the aerothermal performance of the <b>shroud</b> cooling strategy as reported in a companion paper, Lehmann et al. [1]. Experiments have been carried out using endoscopic PIV to identify and understand salient flow features that exist upstream and downstream of the <b>shroud</b> as well as within the <b>shroud</b> cavities. The measurements are complemented by steady and unsteady numerical computations of the turbine stage. The study identifies the existence of important vortical structures within the <b>shroud</b> cavities that not only interact with the main passage flow but also modify the amount and distribution of the <b>shroud</b> leakage flow in a manner that has major implications for <b>shroud</b> cooling and heat transfer. A detailed <b>shroud</b> flow model is derived and used to elucidate the causes and consequences of the flow pattern observed. The model emphasises the circumferentially asymmetric nature of the cavity flow structures caused by the presence of the inter <b>shroud</b> gap that in turn influences the production, interaction and dissipation of such vortical structures...|$|R

25|$|Whereas 20th-Century square-rigged vessels were {{constructed}} of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller {{by the end}} of the 19th Century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the lower mast, top mast, and topgallant mast. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and <b>shrouds.</b> Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored at in front each mast. <b>Shrouds</b> were tensioned by pairs deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—lanyard—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud.|$|E
