6000|$|To their Excellencies the Lords Justices of Ireland,[1] [...] The humble {{petition}} of Frances Harris, Who must starve and die a maid if it miscarries; Humbly sheweth, that I went to warm {{myself in}} Lady Betty's[2] chamber, [...] because I was cold; And I {{had in a}} purse seven pounds, four shillings, and sixpence, [...] (besides farthings) in money and gold; So because I had been buying things for my lady last night, I was resolved to tell my money, {{to see if it}} was right. Now, you must know, because my trunk has a very bad lock, Therefore all the money I have, which, God knows, is a very small stock, I keep in my pocket, ty'd about my middle, next my smock. So when I went to put up my purse, as God would have it, my smock was [...] unript, And instead of putting it into my pocket, down it slipt; Then the bell rung, and I went down to put my lady to bed; And, God knows, I thought my money was as safe as my maidenhead. So, when I came up again, I found my pocket feel very light; But when I search'd, and miss'd my purse, Lord! I thought I should have [...] sunk outright. [...] "Lord! madam," [...] says Mary, [...] "how d'ye do?"--"Indeed," [...] says I, [...] "never worse: But pray, Mary, can you tell what I have done with my purse?" [...] "Lord help me!" [...] says Mary, [...] "I never stirr'd out of this place!" [...] "Nay," [...] said I, [...] "I had it in Lady Betty's chamber, that's a plain case." [...] So Mary got me to bed, and cover'd me up warm: However, she stole away my garters, that I might do myself no harm. So I tumbled and toss'd all night, as you may very well think, But hardly ever set my eyes together, or slept a wink. So I was a-dream'd, methought, that I went and search'd the folks round, And in a corner of Mrs. Duke's[3] box, ty'd in a rag, the money was [...] found. So next morning we told Whittle,[4] and he fell a swearing: Then my dame Wadgar[5] came, and she, you know, is thick of hearing. [...] "Dame," [...] said I, as loud as I could bawl, [...] "do you know what a loss I have [...] had?" [...] "Nay," [...] says she, [...] "my Lord Colway's[6] folks are all very sad: For my Lord Dromedary[7] comes a Tuesday without fail." [...] "Pugh!" [...] said I, [...] "but that's not the business that I ail." [...] Says Cary,[8] says he, [...] "I have been a servant this five and twenty years [...] come spring, And in all the places I lived I never heard of such a thing." [...] "Yes," [...] says the steward,[9] [...] "I remember when I was at my Lord [...] Shrewsbury's, Such a thing as this happen'd, just about the time of gooseberries." [...] So I went to the party suspected, and I found her full of grief: (Now, you must know, of all things in the world I hate a thief:) However, I was resolved to bring the discourse slily about: [...] "Mrs. Duke," [...] said I, [...] "here's an ugly accident has happened out: 'Tis not that I value the money three skips of a louse:[10] But the thing I stand upon is the credit of the house. 'Tis true, seven pounds, four shillings, and sixpence makes a great hole [...] in my wages: Besides, as they say, service is no inheritance in these ages. Now, Mrs. Duke, you know, and everybody understands, That though 'tis hard to judge, yet money can't go without hands." [...] "The devil take me!" [...] said she, (blessing herself,) [...] "if ever I saw't!" [...] So she roar'd like a bedlam, as thof I had call'd her all to naught. <b>So,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>what</b> could I say to her any more? I e'en left her, and came away as wise as I was before. Well; but then they would have had me gone to the cunning man: [...] "No," [...] said I, [...] "'tis the same thing, the CHAPLAIN[11] will be here anon." [...] So the Chaplain came in. Now the servants say he is my sweetheart, Because he's always in my chamber, and I always take his part. So, as the devil would have it, before I was aware, out I blunder'd, [...] "Parson" [...] said I, [...] "can you cast a nativity, when a body's plunder'd?" [...] (Now you must know, he hates to be called Parson, like the devil!) [...] "Truly," [...] says he, [...] "Mrs. Nab, it might become you to be more civil; If your money be gone, as a learned Divine says,[12] d'ye see, You are no text for my handling; so take that from me: I was never taken for a Conjurer before, I'd have you to know." [...] "Lord!" [...] said I, [...] "don't be angry, I am sure I never thought you so; You know I honour the cloth; I design to be a Parson's wife; I never took one in your coat for a conjurer in all my life." [...] With that he twisted his girdle at me like a rope, as who should say, [...] "Now you may go hang yourself for me!" [...] and so went away. Well: I thought I should have swoon'd. [...] "Lord!" [...] said I, [...] "what shall I do? I have lost my money, and shall lose my true love too!" [...] Then my lord call'd me: [...] "Harry,"[13] said my lord, [...] "don't cry; I'll give you something toward thy loss." [...] "And," [...] says my lady, [...] "so will I." [...] Oh! but, said I, what if, after all, the Chaplain won't come to? For that, he said (an't please your Excellencies), I must petition you. [...] The premisses tenderly consider'd, I desire your Excellencies' [...] protection, And that I may have a share in next Sunday's collection; And, over and above, that I may have your Excellencies' letter, With an order for the Chaplain aforesaid, or, instead of him, a better: And then your poor petitioner, both night and day, Or the Chaplain (for 'tis his trade,[14]) as in duty bound, shall ever [...] pray.|$|E

5000|$|Only a few {{minority}} players, such as Tiger Woods, {{have dominated}} professional golf. Woods is of African American and Asian-American descent. With 83 percent of golf participants being white, a white majority dominates golf. Tiger Woods, a multiracial individual, has {{the second most}} major wins of any individual in golf's history with 14. [...] His excellence was well recognized as {{he became one of}} the most marketable players in the world. Woods helped tear down the imposing racial discrepancies in golf by not only competing with golf's current best but also by challenging other accomplished golfers for being the best of all time. In 1997, Woods became the first black player to win a Men's major golf championship at just 21 years of age. After winning the 1997 Masters Tournament, Woods faced ridicule from Fuzzy Zoeller, who won this championship in 1979.

40|$|In {{the papers}} it is {{presented}} {{a way to make}} and use report models for data acquisition. Information workers throughout an organization need access to business data for timely and effective decision making. With a wide range of skills and expertise, these business users need an intuitive yet powerful tool to explore and find answers to critical questions without deep technical knowledge of corporate data sources. A report model, in technical terms, is a metadata description of a data source and the relationships. First step is to analyze the needs of the users <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> fields they are going to need in their reports. Providing too little information renders the reporting service useless, but providing too much information could eventually cause performance issues as more users access reports. The second step is to ensure you have the appropriate referential integrity in place. Having a series of reports running on a poorly normalized database or poorly designed Analysis Services cube will cause additional headaches. The report model aids users in navigating and selecting the desired information from the underlying data source. Report Builder uses the report model definitions to automatically generate the sourc...|$|E

The biggest risk factor for developing cancer is age, {{with the majority of}} cancers more common in older than younger people. There are different types of cancer and breast cancer is widely seen. Breast cancer is the develop-ment of cancer from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, uid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the world.

40|$|Professor Dally {{was getting}} {{requests}} on tips for reading papers, {{so he went}} over his method in class: 1. Before diving in, think about what your goals are, and {{what you want to}} get out of the paper. You need to approach the reading with an aim to extract info; you may want to target specific areas of the paper in case you are looking for something particular. Keeping these objectives in hand will help you while reading. 2. Read the abstract first. This should be an advertisement for the paper. 3. Read the conclusions. Figure out what the authors accomplished, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> their goals were. 4. Find the “paper overview ” section in the introduction and read it if you need to. If you don’t know about a certain topic, you may find background material here. 5. Make a quick first pass through the paper, so you understand their presentation of the topics. Figure out how the equations fit into the discussion, but don’t try to understand the math. On the second pass, read the paper more carefully. 6. Highlight important parts of a paragraph so you don’t have to reread the entire paragraph each time. This helps in class discussions as well. 7. Write down an outline as you go- this will help you remember what you have read. You can refer back to this outline as you go through the paper. 8. Look up key references if you are looking for a particular topic. This paper may not have what you are looking for, but it may build on top of a topic you need to research. In the library, you can find guides that list forward references for each paper, which may also be useful in your quest...|$|E
