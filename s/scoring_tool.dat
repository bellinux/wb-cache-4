40|$|The {{neighbourhood}} {{scale has}} become an important focus in sustainable decision taking. To support designers and building stakeholders several Building Sustainability Assessment Methods (BSAM) have been developed. Among these methods, a distinction can be made between <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) <b>tools.</b> <b>Scoring</b> <b>tools,</b> such as BREEAM Communities and LEED Neighborhood, associate scores {{to a number of}} criteria (credits), covering a wide range of sustainability issues such as energy, materials, water, user transport and comfort. LCA tools, such as novaEQUER and GreenCalc+, are based on a systematic study of the environmental impact caused during the entire neighbourhood life span. This paper analyses the effectiveness of <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> in assessing the sustainability of neighbourhoods, by comparing their methodology with an integrated life cycle approach, combining Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC).

METHODS: Two derivation datasets were used crosswise for external validation. In addition, both tools were validated in a third independent cohort. Predictive values were reassessed and the Area Under the Curve expressed discriminatory capacity. Performance was compared by calculating positive predictive values of the emergency department triad in the validation cohorts and with a cut-off analysis for the clinical <b>scoring</b> <b>tool</b> at a positive predictive value of 90 %. RESULTS: Predictive value of the emergency department triad was comparable to the clinical <b>scoring</b> <b>tool.</b> The positive predictive value of the emergency department triad (97 %) decreased in the clinical <b>scoring</b> <b>tool</b> cohort (81 %) and was excellent in the independent cohort (100 %), identifying 24 %, 20 % and 14 % of the patients. A smaller proportion of patients with diverticulitis could be identified with the clinical <b>scoring</b> <b>tool</b> (6 %, 19 % and 9 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study {{muscle biopsy}} tissue from {{patients}} with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) {{in order to}} test the reliability of a <b>score</b> <b>tool</b> designed to quantify the severity of histological abnormalities when applied to biceps humeri in addition to quadriceps femoris. Additionally, to evaluate whether elements of the tool correlate with clinical measures of disease severity. METHODS: 55 patients with JDM with muscle biopsy tissue and clinical data available were included. Biopsy samples (33 quadriceps, 22 biceps) were prepared and stained using standardised protocols. A Latin square design was used by the International Juvenile Dermatomyositis Biopsy Consensus Group to score cases using our previously published <b>score</b> <b>tool.</b> Reliability was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and scorer agreement (α) by assessing variation in scorers' ratings. Scores from the most reliable tool items correlated with clinical measures of disease activity at the time of biopsy. RESULTS: Inter- and intraobserver agreement was good or high for many tool items, including overall assessment of severity using a Visual Analogue Scale. The tool functioned equally well on biceps and quadriceps samples. A modified tool using the most reliable score items showed good correlation with measures of disease activity. CONCLUSIONS: The JDM biopsy <b>score</b> <b>tool</b> has high inter- and intraobserver agreement and can be used on both biceps and quadriceps muscle tissue. Importantly, the modified tool correlates well with clinical measures of disease activity.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the {{neighbourhood}} scale has gained {{importance in the}} field of sustainable construction. To support designers and building stakeholders in the design of sustainable buildings and neighbourhoods, several sustainability assessment tools have been developed. Among these tools, a distinction can be made between <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) <b>tools.</b> <b>Scoring</b> <b>tools</b> assign <b>scores</b> to a number of criteria covering a wide range of sustainability issues, such as energy use, material use, water use, user transport and comfort. LCA tools are based on a systematic study of the environmental impacts caused during the entire life span of the building or neighbourhood. Although LCA tools are preferred because of their transparency and scientific base, current tools are mostly limited to the assessment of individual buildings and only cover the environmental dimension of sustainability. In this PhD research a sustainability assessment method for neighbourhoods is developed using an integrated life cycle approach. This integrated approach combines an assessment of the economic, environmental and social performance of neighbourhoods, together with an assessment of the neighbourhood qualities. The assessment method is based on an existing assessment method for buildings, SuFiQuaD (i. e. Sustainability, Financial and Quality evaluation of Dwelling types), which is extended to the neighbourhood scale level and refined to include additional evaluation aspects related to operational energy use, operational water use, neighbourhood land use, user transport and neighbourhood qualities. To deal with the complexity of the neighbourhood, a hierarchic assessment structure in line with the principles of the “element method for cost control” and a subdivision in various scale levels, is implemented. The approach, which is translated in a modular spreadsheet tool, is applicable during the various design stages, from rough estimations in the master planning to detailed impact calculations in later design stages. The assessment method is applied to analyse the impact of neighbourhood elements (i. e. neighbourhood infrastructure and open spaces) and to compare four neighbourhood models with various layouts and built densities. First, the analysis reveals that neighbourhood elements have a non-negligible contribution to the neighbourhood impact, especially in low built density neighbourhoods, where these contribute to about 20 % and 30 % of the environmental and financial impact of material use respectively. Second, the comparison between neighbourhoods built according to former building practice (before the 1970 s energy crisis) and current building practice (year 2017) shows the high influence of the construction standards. The environmental and financial impact of the neighbourhoods in line with the current practice is about 60 % and 30 % lower respectively, which is mainly a consequence of the stricter energy performance requirements. Third, the comparison between the neighbourhood models reveals the high influence of the urban form and built density. When considering the current building practice, environmental and financial impact reductions up to 10 % and 20 % respectively are obtained for the neighbourhood model with the highest built density, compared to the model with the lowest built density. Appropriate urban planning and denser neighbourhood layouts are therefore recommended to reduce the impact of the built environment. Finally, the assessment method is compared with a number of well-known <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> for neighbourhoods. The analysis of various sustainability measures reveals many discrepancies between the life cycle impact results and the scores awarded in <b>scoring</b> <b>tools,</b> confirming that the use of <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> is not a guarantee for a reduction of the environmental and financial impact of neighbourhoods. Based on this analysis, recommendations are formulated to better capture environmental and financial issues in <b>scoring</b> <b>tools.</b> nrpages: 338 status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|Liver {{disease is}} a serious public health issue. Cirrhosis related ICU admissions {{increased}} dramatically over the last decade. These patients have a poor prognosis and accurate prognostic <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> could help determine those patients who would benefit from ICU admission. There is remarkably little evidence regarding the utility of these scores within a non-transplant setting, despite this being where many critically ill cirrhotic patients are treated. Methods: This was a 12 month, single centred prospective cohort study performed in a general, non-transplant Scottish ICU. 40 clinical and demographic variables were collected on admission to allow the calculation of eight prospective <b>scoring</b> <b>tools.</b> Patients were followed up to obtain ICU and in-hospital mortality. ROC curve {{analysis was used to}} determine the accuracy of the scores. Multivariate analysis was used to identify any independent predictors of mortality in these patients. Results: 59 patients were recruited into the study, with an ICU mortality of 31 %. All scores other than the renal specific AKIN score performed to a similar degree of accuracy, producing area under the curves (AUC) of between 0. 70 and 0. 76 - although none reached the clinically useful level of 0. 8. The SOFA score was the best performing score. Lactate and ascites were individual predictors of ICU mortality with statistically significant odds ratios of 1. 69 and 5. 91 respectively. When lactate was incorporated into the Child-Pugh score, its prognostic accuracy increased to a clinically applicable level (AUC 0. 86). Conclusions: This investigation suggests that current prognostic <b>scoring</b> <b>tools</b> should be used with caution when assessing critically ill patients with cirrhosis admitted to a general ICU.
