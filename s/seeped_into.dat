5|$|The Duck End {{was one of}} {{the poorer}} districts of Aylesbury. Until the end of the 19thcentury it had no sewers or refuse collections. The area had a number of open ditches filled with {{stagnant}} water, and outbreaks of malaria and cholera were common. The cottages had inadequate ventilation and lighting, and no running water. Faeces from the duck ponds permeated the local soil and <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> the cottages through cracks in the floors.|$|E
5|$|At a dock {{owned by}} Shell Oil Company in Deer Park near Houston, a {{lightning}} bolt from thunderstorms of Elena struck the oil supertanker SS Chevron Hawaii. The lightning started a fire on the ship, which expanded and wrecked one adjacent barge and burned nearby docks. The ship was nearly split in half from the lightning strike, and oil <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> Houston Ship Channel for several hours. Firefighters combated the fire on the tanker in boats, but their efforts were hindered due to unsettled weather from Elena, as well as unsafe water to travel through. The fire caused three deaths and 13 injuries, and damage related to the incident totaled $27 million (1979 USD, $76 million 2007 USD).|$|E

5|$|Four {{overlapping}} ecological regions {{have been}} identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1990s, New World Order conspiracism {{was limited to}} two American countercultures, {{primarily}} the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have devastating effects on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stages of Ceaușescu's rule, when {{liberalization}} was curbed, matein writings were rediscovered and reclaimed by the Optzeciști group of authors, themselves noted for attempting to evade cultural guidelines by adopting fantasy and avant-garde literature. Mircea Cărtărescu, a leading exponent of the Optzeciști and an advocate of Postmodernism, referred to Caragiale as one of his interwar precursors, while Ștefan Agopian acknowledged he pursued Mateiu's interests in his 1981 novel Tache de catifea ("Tache de Velvet"). According to critic Dumitru Ungureanu, it was mainly through Radu Albala that the matein model <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> the work of various Optzeciști—Cărtărescu, Horia Gârbea and Florin Șlapac among them. Another Postmodernist author, Fundulea native Mircea Nedelciu, paid tribute to matein prose by basing a character of his 1986 novel Tratament fabulatoriu ("Confambulatory Treatment") on Caragiale, and again much later, by adopting the same practice in his final novel Zodia Scafandrului ("Sign of the Deep-sea Diver"). The isolated Postmodernist figure and former Communist Party ideologue Paul Georgescu is also believed to have used elements of Craii... as inspiration for his novels of the 1980s. In parallel, as an echo of mateism, more critics grew interested in subjects relating to Caragiale's work. Various comprehensive monographs were published after 1980, including a volume edited by the Museum of Romanian Literature and two influential works written by, respectively, Alexandru George and philosopher Vasile Lovinescu. The latter, with its claim to uncover esoteric layers in Matein texts, remains controversial.|$|E

50|$|Although all {{water that}} enters pit {{workings}} originates from atmospheric precipitation, the miner distinguishes between surface water and groundwater.

25|$|George or Gheorghe Ranetti, born George Ranete (October 1875 – May 25, 1928), was a Romanian poet, {{journalist}} and playwright, {{known as the}} founder and editor of Furnica magazine. A professional journalist from the late 1890s, he alternated between political dailies and literary reviews, being sympathetic to Romanian nationalism and traditionalism, and working under Ion Luca Caragiale at Moftul Român. By 1904–1906, he was active on the margin of left-wing traditionalism, or Poporanism, showing himself sympathetic to republican or generically anti-elitist ideologies. Such views and influences <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> his activity at Furnica, which was for decades a prominent institution in Romanian humor.|$|E
25|$|The {{bearers of}} the Pazyryk culture were horse-riding {{pastoral}} nomads of the steppe, and some may have accumulated great wealth through horse trading with merchants in Persia, India and China. This wealth {{is evident in}} the wide array of finds from the Pazyryk tombs, which include many rare examples of organic objects such as felt hangings, Chinese silk, the earliest known pile carpet, horses decked out in elaborate trappings, and wooden furniture and other household goods. These finds were preserved when water <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> the tombs in antiquity and froze, encasing the burial goods in ice, which remained frozen in the permafrost until the time of their excavation.|$|E

Dwell time varies by material {{and the size of the}} indications that are intended to be identified but is generally less than 30 minutes. It requires much less time to penetrate larger flaws because the penetrant is able to soak in much faster. The opposite is true for smaller flaws/defects.|$|R

25|$|Ranetti and the traditionalists had {{in common}} a mutual dislike for the Francization and aristocratic pretense of fin de siècle Romanian culture. This hostility <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> rhyming letters sent by Ranetti to his self-exiled friend Caragiale, and then into a topical volume, the 1904 Franțuzomania ("Frenchie-mania"). Also that year, he became the chief editor at Furnica ("The Ant"). It had been founded by him and Nae Dumitrescu Țăranu, son of a rich agriculturist. He would publish there under a host of pseudonyms, revisiting his Zeflemeaua ones, but also add more to the list: George Biciușcă, Caiafa, Coco, Contele de Techirghiol ("Count of Techirghiol"), Ghiță Delagambrinus (or the mock-aristocratic Lord Ghytza and Don Ghițos Delagambrinos y Mizilos), Netty, Ghiță Nifilistul, Sarsailă, Tovarășul Ghiță.|$|E
25|$|As this {{subsurface}} {{movement of}} salt shaped the landscape, erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface. Except for isolated remnants, the major formations {{visible in the}} park today are the salmon-colored Entrada Sandstone, in {{which most of the}} arches form, and the buff-colored Navajo Sandstone. These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park. Over time, water <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> the surface cracks, joints, and folds of these layers. Ice formed in the fissures, expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock, breaking off bits and pieces. Winds later cleaned out the loose particles. A series of free-standing fins remained. Wind and water attacked these fins until, in some, the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out. Many damaged fins collapsed. Others, with the right degree of hardness and balance, survived despite their missing sections. These became the famous arches.|$|E
25|$|Dave Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the two paramedics {{who were}} called {{to the scene of}} Kelly's death, have since gone public with their opinion that there was not enough blood at the {{location}} to justify the belief that he had died from blood loss. Bartlett and Hunt told The Guardian that they had seen a small amount of blood on plants near Kelly's body and a patch of blood the size of a coin on his trousers. They said they would expect to find several pints of blood at the scene of a suicide involving an arterial cut. Two forensic pathologists, Chris Milroy of Sheffield University and Guy Rutty of Leicester University, dismissed the paramedics' claims, saying it is hard to judge blood loss from the scene of a death, as some blood may have <b>seeped</b> <b>into</b> the ground. Milroy also told The Guardian that Kelly's heart condition may have made it hard for him to sustain any significant degree of blood loss.|$|E
