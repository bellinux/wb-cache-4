5|$|Arha's {{routine is}} {{disrupted}} by her {{discovery of a}} man (Ged, the protagonist of A Wizard of Earthsea) in the undertomb. She traps him in the labyrinth by <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt {{to open the door}} with a spell. Trapped in the labyrinth the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating what to do with him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.|$|E
25|$|The detective {{enters and}} talks with Serena {{and her friends}} about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny {{knowledge}} of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed {{in the presence of}} their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York ("There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately, {{their journey}} {{does not pay}} off well. The {{customer}} is revealed to be Tom (a recurring character throughout the series), who is at first happy that he finally got his pizza, until he discovers {{he did not get}} the drink he claims to have asked for. A confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that Tom didn't order a drink (although it is heavily implied that Mr. Krabs didn't hear Tom's order correctly or that he hung up before Tom had a chance to finish). His blood boiling with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> SpongeBob goes back to Squidward and collapses to the ground and cries (while absorbing his tears). Infuriated that Tom berated SpongeBob and won't pay for the pizza all because of a missing drink (making the long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward confronts Tom who arrogantly says, [...] "Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that!" [...] to which Squidward angrily claims, [...] "Well, this one's on the house!" [...] and brutally shoves the pizza into Tom's face as payback for his rudeness. Squidward then goes back to SpongeBob who, stilling crying, asks, [...] "Did he change his mind?" [...] Squidward cheers him up by saying, [...] "He sure did. Ate the whole thing in one bite." [...] The two then drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to be right across the street, much to Squidward's dismay, who then says [...] "Oh, my aching tentacles!".|$|E
60|$|With a quick {{movement}} Kemp {{thrust the}} Invisible Man back, sprang aside, and <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> <b>The</b> key was outside and ready. In another moment Griffin {{would have been}} alone in the belvedere study, a prisoner. Save for one little thing. The key had been slipped in hastily that morning. As Kemp <b>slammed</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> it fell noisily upon the carpet.|$|R

500|$|While {{the events}} at the SGC repeat themselves, Daniel makes first {{progress}} in the translation of writings in the photos of the ancient altar. SG-1 return to the planet where Malikai lets slip he too remembers what's happening, but O'Neill finds himself back at breakfast before the altar's activation can be stopped. With the help of O'Neill's and Teal'c's explanations, Carter devises a plan to break the time loop by preventing an incoming wormhole, which fails. Meanwhile, Daniel attempts to translate the altar's writing loop after loop, but his memory is reset each time along with everyone else's, and he cannot possibly translate it all within just a few hours. [...] Ultimately, O'Neill and Teal'c realize the only solution is to learn and remember the alien language themselves. After many loops of teaching, Daniel makes an offhand remark about events that occur during each loop having no consequences once the loop is over, which inspires O'Neill and Teal'c to indulge in wildly outrageous behavior {{as a means of}} dealing with the boredom and frustration of being caught in repeating time. The pair play golf through the active Stargate (much to General Hammond's irritation in at least one loop), Teal'c takes action against the painful starts of his loops by <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> back {{in the face of the}} airman who accidentally hit him with it in the beginning of each loop, O'Neill tries pottery-making (clearly improving with each progressive loop), bicycles through the base, and just before the end of one loop, resigns from the Air Force whilst wearing an outrageous sweatshirt for the sole purpose of grabbing Carter and kissing her in the seconds before the loop resets.|$|E
2500|$|At Halloween Havoc, The Enforcers began feuding with Barry Windham and Dustin Rhodes, {{and broke}} Windham's hand by <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{of his car}} on his hand. Following this act, Zbyszko gave himself the sobriquet the [...] "Cruncher". Windham was {{replaced}} by Ricky Steamboat, and at Clash of the Champions XVII on November 19, 1991 in Savannah, Georgia, the Enforcers lost the titles to Steamboat and Rhodes.|$|E
2500|$|A common sight-gag of {{the show}} was George <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> in Bentley's face mid-conversation. Bentley also had a bad back, and {{frequently}} needed George to walk on his back. He also became known for addressing the Jeffersons as [...] "Mr. J" [...] and [...] "Mrs. J". Zara Cully played George's mother, Olivia [...] "Mother" [...] Jefferson, who constantly disparaged her daughter-in-law. Cully, who had {{first appeared in the}} 1974 All in the Family episode, [...] "Lionel's Engagement", reprised her role. She appeared regularly in the first two seasons, but made sporadic appearances {{over the next two years}} and was written out in the fifth season (Cully died in 1978, from lung cancer; no episode was centered on Mother Jefferson's death, but it was mentioned that she had died in season 5). Ned Wertimer played the doorman, Ralph Hart, throughout the series, along with Danny Wells who played Charlie the bartender.|$|E

2500|$|Leave It to Beaver {{is unique}} in 1950s {{television}} sitcom history for its extraordinary number of bathroom scenes. Beaver and Wally have an en-suite bathroom, and many scenes are set in it. One early episode, [...] "Child Care", is set almost entirely in their bathroom. Other episodes include major scenes set in the boys' bathroom. Additionally, in almost every scene set in the boys' bedroom, the bathtub, shower curtain, or vanity can be seen through the open bathroom door. Beaver uses the bathroom several times to escape his brother when angry, <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to express his emotions. At such times, June and Ward {{are called upon to}} order Beaver to vacate his refuge. In [...] "Beaver's Good Deed", a scene is set in Ward and June's bathroom. A tramp takes a bath in their tub and slips away wearing one of Ward's suits and a pair of his shoes. In the [...] "Captain Jack" [...] episode, Wally and Beaver try to hide a baby alligator they bought by keeping it in their bathroom's toilet tank.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{starts with}} King {{swinging}} {{around on a}} chair, then goes {{through all of the}} band's members with a close up shot. As Healy starts singing, she is at a window, and it is images outside of the window, with raindrops on the window, goes inside of the house, where she is seen sitting playing with the blinds at the window. The band are pictures at the Cinema trying to cheer Healy up after she's had her heart broke, eventually the band start having a laugh by throwing popcorn at her. Sandford and Wiseman are seen putting the phone down on their boyfriends after singing the lyrics, [...] "there's nothing left to say". As the chorus kicks in, White is seen walking out of the house, <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> singing the lyrics, [...] "forever is over", which means she's left her boyfriend, she has had enough. The band start smashing and throwing things as they are angry with their ex-boyfriends. Wiseman is later seen having lunch with her boyfriend, which she is not very happy about and starts pulling faces, and later throws her glass of wine over him, and throws her engagement ring away. Sandford is also seen trying to phone her boyfriend, but he does not pick up the phone, and she puts her head against the wall, and King comes comfort her by putting her arm around her. There are scenes where Healy and Wiseman begin to cook cakes in the kitchen, and where all the band are dancing in the car. Healy is seen typing 'Lover' into her laptop, but then deletes the L so it spells 'Over'. As the video comes to an end, the band are seen in a night club dancing, then leaving the club.|$|E
2500|$|Late in {{the run of}} the strip, and {{following}} a renewal of Hart's religious faith in 1984, B.C. increasingly incorporated religious, social, and political commentary, continuing until Hart's death in 2007. References to Christianity, anachronistic given the strip's supposed setting and the implications of its title, became increasingly frequent during Hart's later years. [...] In interviews, Hart referred to his strip as a [...] "ministry" [...] intended to mix religious themes with secular humor. Though other strips such as The Family Circus and Peanuts have included Christian themes, B.C. strips were pulled from comics pages on several occasions due to editorial perception of religious favoritism or overt proselytizing. Easter strips in 1996 and 2001, for example, prompted editorial reaction from a handful of U.S. newspapers, chiefly the Los Angeles Times and written and oral responses from Jewish and Muslim groups. [...] The American Jewish Committee termed the Easter 2001 strip, which depicted the last words of Jesus Christ and a menorah transforming into a cross, [...] "religiously offensive" [...] and [...] "shameful." [...] A 2003 strip depicting a character using an outhouse with a crescent symbol on the front, <b>slamming</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> shut, and declaring, [...] "Is it just me, or does it stink in here?" [...] was interpreted by some as carrying an anti-Islam message. Hart responded to the controversy, saying [...] "This comic was in no way intended to be a message against Islam — subliminal or otherwise.... It would be contradictory to my own faith as a Christian to insult other people’s beliefs." [...] The Los Angeles Times consequently relegated strips which its editorial staff deemed objectionable to the religion pages, instead of the regular comics pages.|$|E
