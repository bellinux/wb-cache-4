6000|$|Such {{at least}} is the {{conclusion}} of one who, studying certain families of plants, which indulge in the most fantastic varieties of shape and size, and yet through all their vagaries retain - as do the Palms, the Orchids, the Euphorbiaceae - one organ, or form of organs, peculiar and highly specialized, yet constant throughout the whole of each family, has been driven {{to the belief that}} each of these three families, at least, has [...] "sported off" [...] from one common ancestor - one archetypal Palm, one archetypal Orchid, one archetypal Euphorbia, simple, it may be, in itself, but endowed with infinite possibilities of new and complex beauty, to be developed, not in it, but in its descendants. He has asked himself, sitting alone amid the boundless wealth of tropic forests, whether even then and there the great God might not be creating round him, slowly but surely, new forms of beauty? If he chose to do it, could He not do it? That man found himself none the worse Christian for the thought. He has said - and must be allowed to say again, for he sees no reason to alter his words - in speaking of the wonderful variety of forms in the Euphorbiaceae, from the weedy English Euphorbias, the Dog's Mercuries, and the Box, to the prickly-stemmed Scarlet Euphorbia of Madagascar, the succulent Cactus-like Euphorbias of the Canaries and elsewhere; the Gale-like Phyllanthus; the many-formed Crotons; the Hemp-like Maniocs, Physic-nuts, Castor-oils, the scarlet Poinsettia, the little pink and yellow Dalechampia, the poisonous Manchineel, and the gigantic Hura, or <b>sandbox</b> <b>tree,</b> of the West Indies, - all so different in shape and size, yet all alike in their most peculiar and complex fructification, and in their acrid milky juice,- [...] "What if all these forms are the descendants of one original form? Would that be one whit the more wonderful than the theory that they were, each and all, with the minute, and often imaginary, shades of difference between certain cognate species among them, created separately and at once? But if it be so - which I cannot allow - what would the theologian have to say, save that God's works are even more wonderful than he always believed them to be? As for the theory being impossible - that is to be decided by men of science, on strict experimental grounds. As for us theologians, who are we, that we should limit, à priori, the power of God? 'Is anything too hard for the Lord?' asked the prophet of old; and {{we have a right to}} ask it as long as the world shall last. If it be said that 'natural selection,' or, as Mr. Herbert Spencer better defines it, the 'survival of the fittest,' is too simple a cause to produce such fantastic variety - that, again, is a question to be settled exclusively by men of science, on their own grounds. We, meanwhile, always knew that God works by very simple, or seemingly simple, means; that the universe, as far as we could discern it, was one organization of the most simple means. It was wonderful - or should have been - in our eyes, that a shower of rain should make the grass grow, and that the grass should become flesh, and the flesh food for the thinking brain of man. It was - or ought to have been - more wonderful yet to us that a child should resemble its parents, or even a butterfly resemble, if not always, still usually, its parents likewise. Ought God to appear less or more august in our eyes if we discover that the means are even simpler than we supposed? We held Him to be Almighty and All-wise. Are we to reverence Him less or more if we find Him to be so much mightier, so much wiser, than we dreamed, that He can not only make all things, but - the very perfection of creative power - MAKE ALL THINGS MAKE THEMSELVES? We believed that His care was over all His works; that His providence worked perpetually over the universe. [...] We were taught - some of us at least - by Holy Scripture, that without Him not a sparrow fell to the ground, and that the very hairs of our head were all numbered; that the whole history of the universe was made up, in fact, of an infinite network of special providences. If, then, that should be true which a great naturalist writes, 'It may be metaphorically said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinizing, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being, in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life,' - if this, I say, were proved to be true, ought God's care and God's providence to seem less or more magnificent in our eyes? Of old it was said by Him without whom nothing is made - 'My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.' Shall we quarrel with physical science, if she gives us evidence that those words are true?" ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Sandbox</b> <b>trees</b> {{can grow}} to 60 m, {{and the large}} ovate leaves grow to two feet wide. They are monoecious. The red flowers have no petals. Male flowers grow on long spikes; female flowers are solitary in axils. The fruit is a large capsule with {{explosive}} dehiscence; seeds can be launched at 70 m/s. One source states that ripe capsules catapult their seeds as far as 100 m. Another source states that seeds are thrown as far as 45 m from a tree, with a mode of about 30 m. It has also been known as the Dynamite tree, so named for the explosive sound of the ripe fruit as it splits into segments.|$|R

50|$|Hura crepitans, the <b>sandbox</b> <b>tree,</b> {{also known}} as {{possumwood}} and jabillo, is an evergreen tree of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae), native to tropical regions of North and South America, including the Amazon Rainforest. It is recognized by the many dark, pointed spines and smooth brown bark. These spines have caused it to be called Monkey no-climb.|$|E
50|$|Clay-eating {{behaviour}} by macaws is {{not seen}} outside the western Amazon region, even though macaws in these areas consume some toxic foods such as the seeds of Hura crepitans, or <b>sandbox</b> <b>tree,</b> which have toxic sap. Species of parrot that consume more seeds, which potentially have more toxins, do not use clay licks more than species that eat {{a greater proportion of}} flowers or fruit in their diets.|$|E

It also presents radio broadcasts of some sporting events (though international events originating outside of Barbados, such as Champions' Trophy cricket, is blacked {{out on the}} internet feed). When no regularly scheduled programs are heard, CBC Radio plays all Caribbean music. The station has news updates on the hour and major newscasts which are held at 6 am, 1 pm and 7 pm. The station used to air obituary announcements, but those are now aired on its sister station, Quality 100.7 FM.|$|E

Glutinuous rice which is soaked in water of common water hyacinth and red flower- <b>sandbox</b> <b>tree</b> ash {{is mixed with}} taro {{and a kind of}} wine. Then, it is boiled and brayed. The next step is that it is cut into square-shaped or canarium fruit-shaped pieces and dried in the sun later. When the festival is going to come, it is fried until it is swelled. At last, it is soaked in molasses and then in fried-rice powder.|$|E
5000|$|Explosive {{dehiscence}} is a ballistic form of dispersal that flings seeds or spores {{far from}} the parent plant. This rapid plant movement can achieve limited dispersal without the assistance of animals. A notable example is the <b>sandbox</b> <b>tree</b> (Hura crepitans), which can fling seeds 100 meters (300 ft) and {{has been called the}} [...] "Dynamite tree" [...] due to the loud sound of its explosive dehiscence. Another example is Impatiens, whose explosive dehiscence is triggered by being touched, leading it to be called the [...] "touch-me-not." [...] Explosive dehiscence of sporangia is a characteristic of Sphagnum.|$|E
50|$|The seed pods of {{the orange}} jewelweed have {{projectile}} seeds that, if ripe, explode out of the pods when they are lightly touched. The seed pods of the scotch broom also burst open, often with an audible crack, projecting the seeds from the parent plant. Similarly, {{the fruit of the}} <b>sandbox</b> <b>tree</b> burst open to disperse seeds, but the reaction is so violent that it can injure nearby people or livestock. Some plants such as the dogwood bunchberry and white mulberry will also fling pollen from their flowers. Peat mosses are known to explosively launch their spores.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Seeds of Hura crepitans (<b>Sandbox</b> <b>tree)</b> were decorticated, milled and homogenized to flour {{from which}} oil was {{extracted}} using solvent extraction method. Proximate, mineral and fatty acid compositions, as well as, antimicrobial activity of Hura creptians seed flour and oil were determined using standard test methods. Results of these determinations {{show that the}} seed has high crude fat content and is very rich in magnesium. Oleic acid is the most abundant fatty acid and contains more unsaturated fatty acids, but showed no observable antimicrobial activity against the test organisms; E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and C. albicans...|$|E
40|$|The use of Hura crepitans (<b>sandbox</b> <b>tree)</b> seed as a biomass {{adsorbent}} was {{studied for}} the removal of phenol from aqueous solutions before extraction (HC) and after extraction (EHC) with hexane and methanol. The surface chemistry of HC and EHC was characterized by using the Boehm titration and pH drift while the removal of phenol from solution was monitored by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Decrease in the pH of solutions led to {{a significant increase in the}} adsorption capacity of HC and EHC. The linear regression of the experimental data showed that the Freundlich model fitted well with the values of adsorption capacity equal to 121 mmol/g for HC and 85 mmol/g for EHC, and the pseudosecond order kinetic model best described the adsorption process for HC and EHC. The experimental data indicated that the seed of Hura crepitans could be effectively used as an adsorbent {{for the removal}} of phenol from aqueous solution...|$|E
