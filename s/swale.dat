5|$|Sheerness {{is in the}} {{parliamentary}} constituency of Sittingbourne and Sheppey. Since the constituency's creation in 1997 until 2010 the Member of Parliament was Derek Wyatt of the Labour Party. At the 2010 general election, Gordon Henderson of the Conservative Party won the seat. Before 1997, Sheppey and Sittingbourne {{were part of the}} constituency of Faversham. Sheerness is in the local government district of <b>Swale.</b> The town is split between the two local government wards of Sheerness East and Sheerness West, which have four of the forty-seven seats on the <b>Swale</b> Borough Council. At the 2007 local elections, three of those seats were held by the Labour Party and one by the Sheppey First party. <b>Swale</b> Borough Council is responsible for running local services, such as recreation, refuse collection and council housing; Kent County Council is responsible for education, social services and trading standards. Both councils are involved in town planning and road maintenance. From 1894 to 1968, Sheerness formed its own local government district, Sheerness Urban District, and lay within the administrative county of Kent. Over much of the past century, the Labour Party has received the most support in Sheerness, mainly due to the town's industrial nature. As early as 1919, the town had four Labour councillors; Faversham elected its first only in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The Oare Gunpowder Works, {{scene of}} the 1916 explosion, is now a country park and nature reserve {{open to the public}} free of charge. The Oare Marshes are an {{important}} reserve for birds. There is an information centre near the site of the former Harty ferry over the <b>Swale</b> to the Isle of Sheppey. Remains of the process houses and other mill leats have been conserved, and various trails are signposted. An early 20th century electric-powered gunpowder mill which was transferred to Ardeer in 1934 has been repatriated to the country park and is on display.

40|$|Vegetated <b>swales</b> are open, shallow {{channels}} with vegetation {{covering the}} side slopes and bottom that collect and slowly convey runoff flow to downstream discharge points. They {{are designed to}} treat runoff through filtering by the vegetation in the channel, filtering through a subsoil matrix, and/or infiltration into the underlying soils. <b>Swales</b> can be natural or manmade. They trap particulate pollutants (suspended solids and trace metals), promote infiltration, and reduce the flow velocity of stormwater runoff. Vegetated <b>swales</b> can serve {{as part of a}} stormwater drainage system and can replace curbs, gutters and storm sewer systems. Therefore, <b>swales</b> are best suited for residential, industrial, and commercial areas with low flow and smaller populations. Inspection/Maintenance Considerations It is important to consider that a thick vegetative cover is needed for vegetated <b>swales</b> to function properly. Usually, <b>swales</b> require little more than normal landscape maintenance activities such as irrigation and mowing to maintain pollutant removal efficiency. <b>Swales</b> can become a nuisance due to mosquito breeding in standing water if obstructions develop (e. g., debris accumulation, invasive vegetation) and/or if proper drainage slopes are not implemented and maintained. The application of fertilizers and pesticides should be minimized...|$|R
2500|$|Although often {{referred}} to as being a [...] "Captain" [...] {{at the time of his}} last flight, <b>Swales</b> was in fact an 'Acting' Major.

5|$|A {{gunpowder}} plant {{had been}} established around 1573 in Faversham. The town had a stream which could be dammed at intervals to provide power for watermills. It {{became known as the}} Home Works in the 18th century and was nationalised in 1759. By the 19th century, the site stretched for around a mile along the waterfront. A second explosive works was established at Oare to the northwest of town in the late 17th century, with the Marsh Works following in 1786. Towards the end of the 19th century, two new factories were built alongside the <b>Swale</b> to manage production of TNT and cordite. Faversham developed six explosive factories, and from 1874 to 1919, the town was the centre of the explosives industry in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Fire {{response}} {{may also}} furnish {{an explanation for}} the evolution of this species. The differences in fire regime between dune crests and swales would have created different evolutionary pressures, with plants on crests adapting to frequent hot fires by becoming strongly serotinous, and plants in swales adapting to patchier, cooler fires with weaker serotiny. Speciation would be made possible by the much reduced genetic exchange between crest plants and <b>swale</b> plants, although evidence suggests that there was some introgression at first. Eventually, however, the need for weakly serotinous plants to produce ripe seed by the bushfire season would have brought forward its flowering season until the flowering seasons no longer overlapped; thus a phenological barrier to exchange was erected, allowing the two populations to drift independently of each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget of}} the series is {{estimated}} to be £15 million. Filming began in February 2013 and concluded in August 2013, with location shooting largely taken place in Kent and northern France. Filming in Kent was based in Discovery Park in Sandwich and was supported by the Kent Film Office. A former Pfizer facility was used as a number of sets, including the Calais police station and Elise's apartment. The series was filmed throughout five districts: Canterbury, Dover, Shepway, <b>Swale</b> and Thanet. Several prominent locales were featured, including Folkestone Harbour; The Turner Contemporary art gallery; Westwood Cross shopping centre; and the towns of Dover, Folkestone and Margate. Production also made use of the Kent Film Office's legal powers to close certain roads for uninterrupted filming. An estimated £2.5 million of the budget was spent on, among other services, accommodation, locations, parking and catering, providing a boost for the Kent economy. The filming in France was supported by the Nord-Pas de Calais Film Commission and benefited from the Tax Rebate International. Shooting took place over 31 days across Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais and Dunkerque.|$|E

25|$|Swales can be {{incorporated}} in urban designs along streets or parklands {{and add to the}} aesthetic character of an area. Typical swales are created with longitudinal slopes between 1% and 4% in order to maintain flow capacity without creating high velocities, potential erosion of the bioretention or <b>swale</b> surface and safety hazard. In steeper areas check banks along swales or dense vegetation can help to distribute ﬂows evenly across swales and slow velocities. Milder-sloped swales may have issues with water-logging and stagnant ponding, in which case underdrains can be employed to alleviate problems. If the <b>swale</b> is to be vegetated, vegetation must be capable of withstanding design ﬂows and be of sufficient density to provide good ﬁltration). Ideally, vegetation height should be above treatment ﬂow water levels. If runoff enters directly into a <b>swale,</b> perpendicular to the main ﬂow direction, the edge of the <b>swale</b> acts as a buffer and provides pre-treatment for the water entering the <b>swale.</b>|$|E

50|$|Peter <b>Swales</b> (2003) {{investigated}} the historical data and states that Freud probably visited an exposition of Italian masters in Bergamo mid-September 1898, showing paintings of Signorelli, Botticelli and Boltraffio one {{next to the}} other.

The association of the name Boltraffio to the name Da Vinci, another hypothesis formulated by <b>Swales</b> (because Freud might have seen the statue of Boltraffio {{at the bottom of the}} Da Vinci monument on Piazza della Scala in Milan some days before his visit to Bergamo), is not further pursued by <b>Swales.</b> Although Freud visited Trafoi on the 8th of August 1898, <b>Swales</b> doubts whether Freud received a message on the suicide of one of his patients.|$|R

25|$|Bioretention swales, {{similar to}} buffer strips and swales, are placed within {{the base of}} a <b>swale</b> that is {{generally}} located in the median strip of divided roads.

The runoff water usually goes through a fine media filter and proceeds downwards where it is collected via a perforated pipe leading to downstream waterways or storages. Vegetation growing in the filter media can prevent erosion and, unlike infiltration systems, bioretention swales are suited {{for a wide range of}} soil conditions.|$|E
