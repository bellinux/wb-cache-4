Abraham is considered {{a man of great}} faith. What drove Abraham 2 ̆ 7 s faith? Was it an altruistic desire to serve God or was it a strong desire to have a family or an intertwining of both‘? This thesis proposes to examine how emotional family process shapes our faith and how faith development shapes our ‘families’. Every family has a story to tell. ln the introduction I share my family story. The focus of chapter one is how God 2 ̆ 7 s story is intertwined with the story of the human family through the promise of God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> Chapter two illustrates how the implicit story, the family emotional process, interferes with the explicit story of the church, the Gospel. Chapter three reviews Murray Bowen 2 ̆ 7 s theory of family systems. Edwin Friedman and Peter Steinke have applied Bowen theory to the congregational family. The results of their work are reflected upon. Chapter four explores ways to intertwine the explicit story of the church and the implicit story of the family emotional process in a more life enhancing manner by reconsidering the way we do our rituals and tell our stories...|$|R

40|$|Drawing from D. J. McCarthy 2 ̆ 7 s {{findings}} on the family-properties of covenants, Part One analyzes various OT covenants between God and his people {{in terms of the}} father-son relationship as a basic interpretive category. Three covenant-types are differentiated (kinship, treaty, grant) by distinguishing which party swears the oath (both, vassal, suzerain). Kinship and covenant are correlated with oath-swearing and curse-bearing. Using canonical criticism, we classify and explicate God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenants</b> with Abraham (Gen. 15, 17, 22), and Israel (Sinai, Levitical, Deuteronomic, Davidic), {{in the light of the}} momentous occasions when God swore covenant oaths (e. g., Gen. 22 : 16 - 18; Num. 14; Deut. 32 : 40; 1 Sam. 2 - 3; Ps. 110 : 1 - 4). In Part Two, our findings are applied to Galatians 3 - 4 and Hebrews 1 - 9, to show how Christ 2 ̆ 7 s death fulfills the Old Covenant and ratifies the New Covenant grant of divine sonship, thus revealing God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> faithfulness and merciful ingenuity in executing his plan to reunite Jews and Gentiles [...] by sharing in their common plight [...] to constitute one worldwide familia Dei. Arguments in Galatians and Hebrews are based on a typological correlation of the Abrahamic, Mosaic and Davidic covenants, which are advanced by the authors 2 ̆ 7 strategic deployment of OT texts cited according to their original contextual meanings. Diatheke in Gal. 3 : 15 and Heb. 9 : 16 - 17 is explained as 2 ̆ 2 covenant-oath 2 ̆ 2 (versus 2 ̆ 2 testament 2 ̆ 2), in the light of curse-bearing entailed by oath-swearing. Unique findings of our canonical-critical analysis include: (1) identifying Melchizedek with Shem, presupposed in the Targums, and (we argue) in Heb. 1 - 7; (2) the royal-priesthood of firstborn sons forfeited by the 12 tribes to Levi after the golden calf; (3) Israel 2 ̆ 7 s bi-covenantal constitution (i. e., the Deuteronomic and Levitical covenants); (4) in Gal. 3 - 4, the New Covenant is pre-enacted by the Abrahamic covenant [...] in Heb. 1 - 7, by the Davidic. The New Covenant precedes and supercedes the Old (i. e., Mosaic) covenant; (5) Gal. 3 - 4 shows how breaking the latter led to the Deuteronomic covenant curses; in Heb. 1 - 7, to the symbolic but ineffectual Levitical priestly covenant, both of which foreshadow Christ 2 ̆ 7 s curse-bearing death...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{covenant}} became a common construct of many theologians {{in the early}} part of the sixteenth century. Although it was a common notion, covenant theology varied in nuance among its theologians, depending on the needs and attitudes of the people to whom they brought this theological notion. In England, William Tyndale developed his notion of covenant as he translated scripture into the English tongue. To offset and overcome the power of the Roman clergy over Englishmen, he developed his covenant principles. Given full latitude, Tyndale believed his construct would move common Christians from ignorance to knowledge, from bondage to freedom, from unaccountability to responsibility. The sources for my work are primarily Tyndale 2 ̆ 7 s writings. Ample documentation will afford the reader the opportunity to look over my shoulder at these sources. In contrast to other interpreters, I will argue that there is a consistent theology and ethic of covenant throughout Tyndale 2 ̆ 7 s writings.

40|$|Beyond Redemption is a {{study of}} the imagery of {{redemption}} that structured American representations of Israel in the decades leading up to and including the 1967 war. In an interdisciplinary set of texts in the postwar decades, Zionism 2 ̆ 7 s redemptive mission is represented as being commensurate with a variety of ethnic, moral, and political identities in America. This dissertation argues that these idealized representations of the Jewish state 2 ̆ 7 s redemptive project—of modernizing the Holy Land, civilizing and regulating immigrant Jews, strengthening the Jew through physical labor and soldiery, and fulfilling God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> after Auschwitz—based on a foundational assumption: the redemptive power of the modern nation-state. As both the agent and the object of this state, the 2 ̆ 2 new Jew 2 ̆ 2 of Israel appears in these texts as a fetishized figure, reflecting a fascination with Zionism 2 ̆ 7 s ability to remake global Jewry. Furthermore, this figure has appeared in the U. S. as the antithesis of the 2 ̆ 2 Arab Nazi, 2 ̆ 2 as part of worldview that relocates anti-Semitism from the vestiges of European to the radicalized arenas of the Middle East. On the one hand, this dissertation argues, the 1967 war catalyzed a constitutive pairing of the Holocaust with the Israeli army in the United States in ways that represented the Middle East as the site of a re-located war against anti-Semitism. Against this background of America 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to the Palestinian Question, Beyond Redemption suggests an alternative framework for conceptualizing the deliverance from oppression: one that centralizes, and contextualizes, power relations rather than identity politics. ...|$|R
40|$|At {{the top of}} Prospect Hill in Harvard, Massachusetts, are the Fruitlands Museums, {{founded in}} 1914 by Clara Endicott Sears, a wealthy Bostonian who summered in Harvard. She befriended the last members of the Shaker {{communities}} of Harvard and Shirley that formed the Harvard Bishopric of the United Believers of Christ, and chronicled their histories. Miss Sears structured the Museum around the farmhouse in which Bronson Alcott and his family lived in a communistic experiment from June 1843 to January 1844. She later added a Shaker building, an art gallery of early American itinerant portraits and Hudson River School landscapes, and a gallery devoted to the American Indian. As Miss Sears intended, the eclectic collection of the Museums forces the visitor to connect {{different aspects of the}} past, and the past with the present. This paper is my modest effort to make the same sort of connections through an examination of one aspect of the Shakers 2 ̆ 7 lives: the method by which they obtained and retained children who came to Shaker communities without their parents. Because Shaker theology required that community members subscribe to a creed of celibacy, new members could only come from outside a community 2 ̆ 7 s boundaries. When adults joined a community, they signed a covenant and 2 ̆ 2 consecrated themselves and their property to God. 2 ̆ 2 When these relationships crumbled, courts were faced with the broken pieces.

When families, or only portions of them, joined the Shakers, different legal questions were posed. Did a woman have grounds for obtaining a divorce if her husband joined the Shakers? The way that courts dealt with these issues has received some analysis by scholars of legal and Shaker history...|$|R
40|$|Ishodište ovoga rada je Post 17, izvještaj o Božjem savezu s Abrahamom koji se pripisuje svećeničkom spisu (Pg). Za razliku od drugih predaja, svećenički pisac izvješćuje samo o dva saveza: o Božjem savezu s Noom (Post 9, 1 - 17) i s Abrahamom (Post 17). Post 9, 1 - 17 služi kao zaključak svećeničke prapovijesti, a Post 17 otvara svećeničko izvješće o povijesti izabranog naroda i ima, za spomenutu povijest, programatsko značenje. Naime, prilikom sklapanja toga saveza Bog obećaje Abrahamu brojno potomstvo (17, 2 - 6), da će biti njegov Bog i Bog njegovih potomaka (17, 7. 8 b), te da će njemu i njegovu potomstvu dati u posjed zemlju Kanaan (17, 8 a). Ova tri obećanja provlače se kroz naredne tekstove svećeničkog spisa (Post 28, 1 - 9; 35, 9 - 15; Izl 6, 2 - 8) i postupno se ostvaruju. Prvo obećanje ispunja se u Izl 1, 7, a drugo u Izl 40, 34 - 35. Što se pak tiče obećanja zemlje, mnogi egzegeti danas smatraju da ono ostaje neispunjeno te da Pg završava u Knjizi Izlaska ili u Levitskom zakoniku, u tekstovima koji govore o uspostavi bogoslužja na Sinaju. Polazeći od Post 17, u ovome smo radu analizirali tekstove svećeničkog spisa koji se osvrću na Božja obećanja Abrahamu i izvješćuju o njihovu ispunjenju. Naše je istraživanje pokazalo da obećanje zemlje nalazi svoje ispunjenje u Br 13 - 14 * te da, suprotno vladajućem mišljenju, postoje solidni motivi za smještanje završetka svećeničkog spisa u Knjigu Brojeva (Br 13 - 14 *; 20, 1 - 13. 22 - 29; 27, 12 - 23). The {{referential}} {{point of}} this article is the account of God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> with Abraham in Gen 17, which is attributed to priestly writing (Pg). The priestly writer reports only two covenants: God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> with Noah (Gen 9 : 1 - 17) and God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> with Abraham (Gen 17). While the covenant with Noah represents the conclusion of priestly prehistory (Gen 1 - 11), Gen 17 opens the narration of Israel 2 ̆ 7 s history and has, for this history, a programmatic function. When he made his covenant God promised Abraham numerous offspring (17 : 2 - 6), that he would be his God and the God of his descendants (17 : 7 - 8 b); and that he would give him and his offspring the land of Canaan to his possession (17 : 8 a). The priestly texts following Gen 17, i. e., Gen 28 : 19; 35 : 9 - 15; Ex 6 : 2 - 8, refer back to these promises and relate their gradual fulfilment. Scholars generally agree that the first two promises find their fulfilment in the book of Exodus (1 : 7; 40 : 34 - 35), while the fulfilment of the promise of the land is subject of debate. Namely, there is growing agreement in contemporary exegesis that Pg ends in Exodus or Leviticus, in texts which do not recount the gift of the land but the institution of cult (Ex 29 : 42 b- 46; 40 : 16 - 17 a, 33 b; Lev 9 : 23 - 24; 16). In this article, by taking Gen 17 as the starting-point, we have analyzed the priestly texts which are concerned with God 2 ̆ 7 s promises to Abraham and we have reached the conclusion that the promise of the land is fulfilled in Num 13 - 14 *, and that there are valid reasons to place the end of priestly writing in the book of Numbers. Contemporary research of the book of Numbers has shown that the dating of this book is very late, but still, some scholars attributed four accounts to Pg in this book: Num 13 - 14 *; 20 : 1 - 13, 22 - 29; 27 : 12 - 23. Our brief survey of these texts has revealed that these texts can indeed be ascribed to Pg {{on the basis of their}} content, terminology and specific stylistic features. Moreover, these texts refer to the fulfilment of the promise of the land. In fact, while the promise of the land in Pg is always formulated in the future tense (!tn weqatal / yiqtol; cf. Gen 17 : 8; 2 :, 4; 35 : 12; Ex 6 : 8),, in Num 13 : 2 we find the !tn participle, and in 20 : 12 - 24; 27 : 12 qatal. These occurrences point to the conclusion that in Num 13 : 2 God »gives« the land to the people by sending the leaders to »spy it out« (rwt; 13 : 2). The official representatives of the people, by spying it out (rwt; 13 : 21), take the land legally into possession. Namely, we know from biblical accounts that »walking« on a certain territory can designate taking it into possession (cf. Gen 13 : 14 - 17; 1 Kg 21 : 16 - 18). Subsequently, the qatal form !tn in Num 20 : 12 - 24; 27 : 12 confirms that for the priestly writer Israel has already received the gift of the land, even if the people have not yet entered it. The performed analysis, thus, suggests that Pg does not end in the book of Exodus or Leviticus, but continues and ends in the book of Numbers (13 - 14 *; 20 : 113; 22 - 29; 27 : 12 - 23). The priestly texts in Numbers do not only narrate the failure of the generation of exodus and their leaders, Moses and Aaron, to enter the promised land, but also confirm the people 2 ̆ 7 s receiving the gift of the land (13 : 21; 20 : 12 - 24; 27 : 12), announce the entering of the next generation (14 : 31) and report the installation of new leaders, Eleazar and Joshua (20 : 28; 27 : 22 - 23). The priestly writing would, therefore, have an open ending, since it prepares Moses 2 ̆ 7 death and the people 2 ̆ 7 s entering of the land, but it does not report them. This open ending could have been conditioned by the historical moment in which the priestly writer composed his work, i. e., at the end of the Babylonian exile and in the first years of return. His last accounts, which we now find in the book of Numbers, would then reflect the failure of the first generation of returnees to come back to the land, but at the same time, they announce the return of the next generation (14 : 31) ...|$|R

The landlord never did and tenant terminated rent payments. The landlord instituted a summary dispossess action against Berzito for nonpayment and the state district court held that the landlord was in violation of his express warranty of habitability and reduced the tenants rent but tenant still did not pay. The trial court ruled in the tenant 2 ̆ 7 s favor and rejected the landord 2 ̆ 7 s contention that by remaining in possession the tenant had waived the failure to repair. The appellate division reversed and tenant appealed. The NJ supreme court held that the landlord had breached his covenant of habitability 2 ̆ 7 and that the tenant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> to pay rent depended upon the fulfillment of the warranty of habitability. Prior to this holding the NJ courts had only recognized two tenant remedies – caveat emptor by allowing the tenant to vacate the premises when constructively evicted and the common law belief that traditional common law relationships were ill suited to modern living conditions and should be relaxed. This latter remedy, the warranty of habitability, gave relief to the tenant when his landlord failed to maintain the premises in a habitable condition. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 This case does not present a fact pattern fitting New Jersey 2 ̆ 7 s available remedies since 2 ̆ 2 the tenant did not vacate the premises nor did she undertake the needed repairs herself and then seek to offset the expense so incurred against her obligation to pay rent. 2 ̆ 2 Due to this court’s holding, the tenant is no longer limited to the establishment of defenses in a landlord 2 ̆ 7 s action and can take the initiative establishing a new remedy for tenants.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to provide a {{holistic}} reading of the largely narrative material in Jeremiah 26 - 45 that is informed by the disciplines of literary and rhetorical criticism. This study seeks to contribute to the growing trend of reading the book of Jeremiah as a literary entity that possesses an editorial unity in spite of the complex compositional history that appears to stand behind the book. This study will focus primarily on the overarching plot and structure that emerge from the reading of Jeremiah 26 - 45. The thesis is that this section of the book of Jeremiah consists of two panels of material, chapters 26 - 35 and 36 - 45 that are roughly symmetrical to one another. These two panels of material share four basic features in common with each other: an introduction that details national rejection of the prophetic word at the Jerusalem temple (chs. 26 and 36); narratives dealing with prophetic conflict over the issue of submission to Babylon (27 - 29 and 37 - 39); sections dealing with the fate of Israel in the aftermath of exile that contrast the immediate and distant futures (30 - 33 and 40 - 43); and a concluding section that focuses on the issue of Judah 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> infidelity (34 - 35 and 44 - 45). The plot of Jeremiah 26 - 45 revolves around the concept that national destiny is determined by response to the prophetic word, and the central tension in the narrative is created by the contrast between the immediate aftermath of the exile where Judah perpetuates the sins of the past and the promised restoration of the distant future. The study has six chapters. The first chapter summarizes how the conclusions of modern critical scholarship have impacted reading the book of Jeremiah as a literary entity. The second chapter explores the problems involved in searching for an overarching structure for the book of Jeremiah in general and this section in particular. Chapters three through five are the heart of this study and explore the major parallels that exist between the two panels found in chapters 26 - 35 and 36 - 45. The sixth chapter concludes the study by providing a brief summary of the major themes and patterns that emerge from a holistic reading of chapters 26 - 45...|$|R

In Old Testament Hebrew the term »berit« is used which in Greek is translated with διαθήκη, in Latin testamentum and foedus, and it means some form of relation, connection, confidence, obligation, partnership. All these notions point out the connection of the person in love and trust, connected unilaterally or in mutual obligation. That connection has a dialogic, personal and dynamic significance. God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant</b> with his people in the Old Testament is literally shaped as a treaty which was legally already shaped in ancient times by the Hittites. The author presents the similarities or parallels between the Hittites 2 ̆ 7 treaty and the Biblical description of the covenant. In both descriptions there is a mutual relation between the structural similarity: preamble, historical prologue, clauses [...] . That coinciding is best seen when comparing the Hittites vassal treaty and the Biblical formula of the Ten Commandments, particularly with regard to the first few clauses. The remaining clauses are dispersed in various sections of the first five Biblical books and beyond them. - The notion of the Covenant is rarely repeated in the works of classical prophets in the eighth century but that doesn 2 ̆ 7 t mean that these works do not refer to what we mean under the notion of the Covenant, i. e. the relationship between God and man. - The notion of the Covenant is particularly pointed out in the Deuteronomy regarding the time of its creation and with reference to its theological meaning. Various expressions - God liberated you, he loves you, he shows you mercy and faith (Hebr. hesed ve 2 ̆ 7 emet) - stressing the central perspective of the Covenant. The Deuteronomy often speaks of minding, holding, succeeding, execution of God 2 ̆ 7 s commandments and orders. This refers to the Israeli 2 ̆ 7 s gratitude to Yahweh who saved them and led them to all his secrets. Even when the Deuteronomy speaks of fear that word is used in the sense of respect and love. In the Deuteronomy the word »to be afraid« and »love« are synonyms! They are vertical! Naturally there is also a horizontal: This is best seen in the commentary of the order about the Sabbath (6 : 13 ss) for which Jesus says, »The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath!« (Mk 2 : 27). The serving man and serving woman must eat the holy meal (Dt 12 : 18). One tenth each third year belongs to the needy [...] . The author gives an in depth analysis of selected Biblical moments in the 1 st Decalogue (Ten Commandments and the chapter of the Covenant (Dt 5 : 6 - 21) and the Israelites as God 2 ̆ 7 s own, holy and chosen people (Dt 26 : 17 - 19) ...|$|R

In 2014, it would be profoundly regressive to institutionalize such exclusion in a law school 2 ̆ 7 s policy. 2 ̆ 2 In passing its motion yesterday, Osgoode joins a chorus of organizations that have raised concerns about {{the appropriateness of the}} TWU environment for legal education and the disproportionate pathways into legal practice for those targeted by TWU 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Covenant.</b> Law schools at three other universities have passed similar motions, and law faculty in Alberta have written their law society with concerns. Other organizations that have spoken on the issue include the Canadian Council of Law Deans, the Canadian Bar Association, the Canadian Federation of Students, the Federation of Asian Canadian Lawyers, LEAF, law school student governments, and law school LGBTQ groups. 2 ̆ 2 The motion passed by Osgoode Faculty Council speaks to the value Osgoode places in building a more inclusive, representative learning environment and legal profession, 2 ̆ 2 said Osgoode student Douglas Judson, seconder of the motion. 2 ̆ 2 It not only calls on TWU to retract its policies, but institutes ameliorative measures tied to the themes of the TWU discussion - sexual orientation, religious freedom, and human rights. 2 ̆ 2 As part of the motion, Osgoode Faculty Council also agreed to make its best efforts to establish financial allotments to be awarded annually: one prize for the best essay about law, sexual orientation/identity, and human rights/equality; another for the best essay about law, religion and human rights/equality; and a bursary or scholarship for an LGBTQ student in financial need. The Chair of Faculty Council will forward a copy of the motion to the President of Trinity Western University, and the motion will be widely circulated to law schools and other organizations, including the Federation of Law Societies and the Law Society of Upper Canada. TWU is a private, faith-based university seeking to open a fully-accredited law school. Incoming students and faculty at TWU must sign a 2 ̆ 2 Community Covenant Agreement, 2 ̆ 2 which requires the signatory to abstain from “sexual intimacy that violates the sacredness of marriage {{between a man and a}} woman. ” The TWU Student Handbook states that students who do not comply with the agreement may be removed from the university without readmission. Last year, the BC government approved the degree-granting program. The Federation of Law Societies of Canada recommended that provincial law societies grant approval to TWU. Since that time, law schools across Canada have registered their concerns about the integrity of a program of legal education at an institution that openly discriminates on a protected ground, such as sexual orientation. - 30 - York University is helping to shape the global thinkers and thinking that will define tomorrow.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses our work on factors that will affect the potential economic impact of implementing the legislation applying U. S. immigration law to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). Although subject to most U. S. laws, the CNMI has administered its own immigration system since 1978, {{under the terms of}} its 1976 Covenant with the United States. The CNMI has applied this flexibility to admit substantial numbers of foreign workers through a permit program for non-U. S. citizens (noncitizens) entering the CNMI. In 2005, these workers represented a majority of the CNMI labor force and outnumbered U. S. citizens in most industries, including garment manufacturing and tourism, which have been central to the CNMI's economy. The CNMI also has admitted tourists under its own entry permit and entry permit waiver programs and has provided various types of admission to foreign investors. As we have reported previously, the CNMI faces serious economic challenges, including the decline of garment manufacturing and fluctuations in tourism. The recent immigration legislation amends the U. <b>S.</b> -CNMI <b>Covenant</b> to establish federal control of CNMI immigration and includes several provisions affecting foreign workers and investors in the CNMI during a transition period that ends in 2014. The Secretary of Homeland Security decided to delay the start of the transition period for 180 days, from June 1, 2009, to November 28, 2009, as allowed under the law in consultation with the Secretaries of the Interior, Labor, and State, the Attorney General, and the CNMI Governor. Unless otherwise noted, "transition period" refers to the period beginning November 28, 2009, and ending on December 31, 2014. During the transition period, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretaries of the Interior, Labor, and State, as well as the Attorney General, are responsible for establishing, administering, and enforcing a transition program to regulate immigration in the CNMI. This program will provide foreign workers temporary permits to work in the CNMI (CNMI-only work permits); the number of these permits must be reduced to zero {{by the end of the}} transition period or the end of any extensions of the CNMI-only work permit program. The legislation also establishes a joint visa waiver program by adding the CNMI to an existing visa waiver program for Guam visitors. The legislation's stated intent is to ensure effective border control procedures and protect national and homeland security, while minimizing the potential adverse economic and fiscal effects of phasing out the CNMI's own foreign worker permit program and while maximizing the CNMI's potential for economic and business growth. ...|$|R
40|$|The NT {{concept of}} hope is {{essentially}} {{determined by the}} OT 2 ̆ 7 Among different words for expressing the reality of biblical hope, elpis and elpiso are of the greatest importance. After describing the Greek view of the two mentioned words, the article first considers their role and their meaning in the OT - emphasizing {{the fact that in}} the OT there is no neutral concept of expectation. An expectation is either good or bad and therefore it is either hope or fear. God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> promise(s) and <b>covenant(s)</b> with Israel is assumed to be the ground and object of man 2 ̆ 7 s expectation. NT gives a new content to the concept of hope. God is the ultimate author and ground of elpis and elpiso. His promise to the fathers is fulfilled in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. He is, through the action of the Holy Spirit, the sustaining power and the unseen yet certain object of every hope. From this background originates the understanding of hope in the letters to the Colossians and to the Ephesians. A detailed textual analysis of all "elpis and elpiso verses" in the two mentioned letters offers a comprehensive insight into the two of the deuteropauline texts. In both letters, with some minor differences, the risen Christ 2 ̆ 7 seated at the right hand of God" (Col 3, 3) is the object of elpis. This hope is "laid up for you in heaven" (Col 1, 5). God makes it known through the Gospel which becomes a sign and a mediator of hope. Because of this the hope is called the elpis tou euangeliou. The community was called to the one hope that belongs to the christian call (cf. Eph 4, 4) ...|$|R
40|$|Članak obrađuje temu saveza u Poslanici Galaćanima koncentrirajući se pritom na dvije perikope u kojima se izraz savez pojavljuje (3, 15 - 18 i 4, 21 - 31). Navedene perikope su dio Pavlove doktrinarne argumentacije (3, 1 - 4, 31) kojom Pavao brani svoju tezu o opravdanju po vjeri (2, 16). Nakon što je prethodno poistovjetio Božje obećanje blagoslova za sve narode dano Abrahamu s opravdanjem pogana po vjeri (3, 8), Pavao u perikopi 3, 15 - 18 dokazuje da ostvarenje tog obećanja ne može ovisiti o izvršavanju Zakona. Zakon ne može promijeniti bezuvjetni karakter obećanja koja su sadržaj neponištivog i nepromjenjivog Božjeg saveza s Abrahamom. U perikopi 4, 21 - 31 Pavao sažima pripovijest o Jišmaelovu i Izakovu rođenju i tumači je alegorijski. Ropkinja Hagara i slobodna Sara predstavljaju dva saveza, Sinajski koji je određen ropstvom i tjelesnošću te Savez s Abrahamom koji je određen slobodom i obećanjem. Kao što u 3, 18 suprotstavlja obećanje i Zakon s obzirom na zadobivanje baštine, tako sada u 4, 30 Pavao radikalno odvaja, opet s obzirom na baštinu, sina sluškinje od sina slobodne. Za razliku od judaizanata prema kojima Sinajski savez predstavlja ostvarenje Abrahamova saveza, za Pavla je, što se tiče misionarskog djelovanja među poganima, ova sinteza neprihvatljiva, jer rezultira time da opsluživanje Zakona postaje uvjetom za ostvarenje Abrahamovih obećanja, tj. opravdanja. The article {{handles the}} topic of the {{covenant}} in the Epistle to the Galatians focusing on two pericopes in which the term covenant (διαήκη) appears (3 : 15 - 18 and 4 : 21 - 31). The said pericopes are part of Paul 2 ̆ 7 s doctrinal arguments in which he defends the content of his gospel (3 : 1 - 4, 31), i. e. the thesis that man is not justified by acts of the Law as claimed by Judaism which compelled the Galatians to circumcision (6 : 12) but exclusively through »belief in Jesus Christ« (2 : 16). After previously claiming that Abraham justified himself by faith (3 : 6) then equalled God 2 ̆ 7 s promise to bless all the peoples given to Abraham justifying the pagan by faith (3 : 8), in periscope 3 : 15 - 18 Paul proves that the realisation of that promise may depend on the execution of the Law. In order to prove it, he calls on human experience and uses the argument a fortiori comparing human and divine valid covenant - διαήκη. The article discusses the meaning of the term διαθήκη in 3 : 15 - 17 and concludes that not only is it permissible but more appropriate to comprehend and translate it as a 2 ̆ 7 covenant 2 ̆ 7 and not as a legacy 2 ̆ 7. Using the argument a fortiori Paul compares the human and divine valid covenant made and suggests a conclusion that if the first is unbreakable and unchangeable how much more so is the second? Seeing that the promises made to he whom was the promise of the blessing for all his people the content of the unchangeable and unbreakable covenant that God made with Abraham, their unconditional and gratuitous nature cannot be changed by Law that came into force 430 years later and whose role in the history of redemption is merely temporary. (3 : 19 - 25). Paul speaks about the covenant again in pericope 4 : 21 - 31. This time Paul argues, referring to the Letter and explicitly says that his argument is directed to those Galatians who wish to succumb to the Law, considering it as a condition for justification. Paul firstly surmises the fable of lshmael and Isaac 2 ̆ 7 s births and then claims that the said data has an allegoric meaning. Two women, one of whom is a slave and the other a free woman literally symbolise Hagar and Sara. They allegorically represent the two covenants of which the first - on Mount Sinai - determined by slavery and bodily, i. e. servility to the Law and religious existentiality leaning upon it and the second, that which God made with Abraham, freely and promisingly, i. e. religious existentiality leaning on faith. In the same line as the covenant on Mount Sinai is »current-day Jerusalem« which under the context of the Epistle to the Galatians is conceived to be that part of Jerusalem representing the Christian community for whom the pagans have set the condition of redemption, compelling them to circumcision and adherence to the Law. Paul contradicts »Current-day Jerusalem« with Jerusalem above«, i. e. the heavenly Jerusalem which is free like Sara and as such in line with the covenant that she symbolises, that is, it represents its fulfilment. Namely, it contains the approach by which pagans become his successors not by the acts of the Law but through faith in Jesus Christ, i. e. the »power of the promise«. In the same way that in 3 : 18, he contradicts the promise and the Law with regard to gaining heritage now in 4 : 30 Paul radically veers, once again with regard to heritage, the son of the servant from the son of the free woman, i. e. the son of Sara – διαθήκη from the son of Hagar – διαθήκη. Contrary to Judaism by which the covenant of Sinai represents the realisation of Abraham 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>covenant,</b> for Paul with regard to his missionary work amongst pagans, this synthesis is unacceptable because it results in serving the Law as a condition to realise Abraham 2 ̆ 7 s promise. Paul therefore seeks radical separation by the Galatians from Judaism and Judaist fractions in the Galatian community and supports his demand with an allegoric-typological reading Gen. 21. In conclusion the article points out that Paul 2 ̆ 7 s reference to the covenant in the Epistle to the Galatians is in the ministry of defending his thesis of justification and his missionary practise amongst pagans...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} of Paul 2 ̆ 7 s rhetorical strategy in Philippians 3 : 1 - 4 : 1, a passage unique {{for a number of}} reasons, among them is the form and content of the autobiographical section in vv. 5 - 6. Paul uses deliberative rhetoric to persuade the Philippian believers toward a particular mind-set in relating to Christ and to the apostle, himself. This section in Philippians is found in the probatio. Through the use and development of three enthymemes, Paul accomplishes three things. First, he obtains positive ethos from the Philippian believers, i. e. his personal character is enhanced. Second, Paul effectively warns them against potential enemies who may lead some away from a proper perspective of both Christ and a particular way of life. Third, he establishes an eschatological perspective focusing on the meaning and significance of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s post-resurrection return that should serve as a bearing-setting principle in their temporal existence. Paul uses a historical exemplum from Old Testament tradition to aid not only in establishing a positive ethos for himself, but also in teaching the Philippian believers the meaning of living in a covenant relationship with God. This relationship is the result of their being in Christ. In the process of writing, Paul functions much like the later Old Testament prophets, calling the people back to reflection and action appropriate to their belief in God {{and what it means to}} be a member of his people. The Introduction outlines what types of studies have been done on Philippians in general, and 3 : 1 - 4 : 1 specifically. Of greatest concern for this work are the issues of the integrity of the letter and the identity of Paul 2 ̆ 7 s foes. Two other categories introduced in this section are the contributions of sociological studies to New Testament studies and my interest in interacting with liberation and black theology in light of this study. Paul is a contributor to the rhetorical situation with the Philippian believer. He is in turn a product of Old Testament tradition. Chapter 1 is a study of a few relevant themes in the Old Testament tradition, establishing major themes from some of the major prophets and sections of the Pseudepigrapha of which Paul may have been aware. This awareness did influence Paul 2 ̆ 7 s reflections on the relationship of God with his Old Covenant people, thus providing needed lessons for God 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> New <b>Covenant</b> people. Chapter 2 surveys some of the contributions to recent New Testament studies from rhetorical criticism. It is essentially the rediscovery of an ancient art, the use of which sheds much light on the nature of the early church communities. The contributions of rhetorical analysis and Old Testament background are brought together in Chapter 3. Paul uses his own personal history to teach lessons to the Philippian believers on the results of faithfulness to God and unfaithfulness to God. Verbal and conceptual connections between Philippians 2 and 3 establish the centrality of Jesus Christ as a model, the one whom Paul himself emulates. Chapter 4 is a summary on matters of the integrity of the letter and the identity of Paul 2 ̆ 7 s foes in Philippians 3 : 1 - 4 : 1. It is also the major point of interaction between lessons learned from Paul 2 ̆ 7 s rhetorical strategy in this section and certain emphases in liberation and black theology...|$|R
