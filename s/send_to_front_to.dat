50|$|Liu Zhen's {{hopes were}} raised, when, on Chinese New Year 844 (January 24), {{soldiers}} that Li Shi was ordered <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>to</b> the <b>front</b> <b>to</b> reinforce the Hedong soldiers already attacking Zhaoyi, angry {{that they were}} forced to do so at New Year time and that they had not received what they felt were adequate rewards to do so, rebelled at Hedong's capital Taiyuan Municipality (太原) under the leadership of the officer Yang Bian (楊弁), forcing Li Shi to flee. Yang released Jia from captivity and had him return to Zhaoyi, pledging to be sworn brothers with Liu Zhen. In the aftermaths of Yang's rebellion, there were much discussion among imperial officials that the imperial government should end the campaign against Liu Zhen. Wang Zai, in particular, sent messengers to Zhaoyi to see if Liu Zhen would be willing to surrender. (Li Deyu later suggested to Emperor Wuzong that this was because of two reasons — that Wang Zai's father Wang Zhixing had previously falsely accused Shi of crimes and Wang was therefore fearful that Shi would gain great honors by capturing Liu Zhen; and that Wang Zai's biological son Wang Yanshi (王晏實), whom Wang Zhixing adopted as a son, was then the prefect of Ci Prefecture and was being held hostage by Liu Zhen.) At Li Deyu's suggestion, Emperor Wuzong refused Wang Zai's suggestion of accepting Liu Zhen's surrender, and ordered the Hedong soldiers under the officer Wang Feng (王逢), as well as soldiers sent by Yiwu (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), Xuanwu (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), and Yanhai (兗海, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong) Circuits to attack Yang, followed up by troops from Wang Yuankui's Chengde Circuit. The Hedong soldiers under Wang Feng, worried that if the other circuits' soldiers captured Taiyuan first that their own family members would be killed, volunteered to attack quickly under the command of the eunuch monitor Lü Yizhong (呂義中), and on February 20, the Hedong soldiers recaptured Taiyuan, capturing Yang and killing many of his coconspirators.|$|R

40|$|The landing {{response}} of tethered flying housefliesMusca domestica elicited by motion of periodic gratings is analysed. The {{field of view}} of the compound eyes of a fly can be subdivided into a region of binocular overlap and a monocular region. In the monocular region the landing response is elicited by motion from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back and suppressed by motion from back <b>to</b> <b>front.</b> The sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back motion in monocular flies (one eye covered with black paint) has a maximum at an angle 60 °– 80 ° laterally from the direction of flight in the equatorial plane. The maximum of the landing response <b>to</b> <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back motion {{as a function of the}} contrast frequencyw/λ is observed at around 8 Hz. In the region of binocular overlap of monocular flies the landing response can be elicited by back <b>to</b> <b>front</b> motion around the equatorial plane if a laterally positioned pattern is simulataneously moved from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back. 40 ° above the equatorial plane in the binocular region the landing response in binocular flies is elicited by upward motion, 40 ° below the equatorial plane in the binocular region it is elicited by downward motion. The results are interpreted as an adaptation of the visual system of the fly to the perception of a flow field having its pole in the direction of flight...|$|R

5000|$|All trim levels {{retained}} the typical AWD layouts seen in previous generation Legacy, depending on transmission choice. Manual transmission models {{came with a}} mechanical [...] "Continuous AWD" [...] system which was normally 50/50 front/rear, and relied on limited slip differentials <b>to</b> redirect power <b>front</b> <b>to</b> rear, rear <b>to</b> <b>front,</b> and from one rear wheel to the other (when fitted with a rear limited slip differential). Automatic transmission models had an electronically controlled AWD system that was 90/10 front/rear and redirected differing amounts of power to the rear wheels continuously. When accelerating or driving uphill, the vehicles weight shifts rearward, reducing front wheel traction, causing the transmission <b>to</b> automatically <b>send</b> torque <b>to</b> the rear wheels to compensate. When braking or driving downhill, the vehicle's weight shifts towards the front, reducing rear wheel traction. The transmission again compensates by <b>sending</b> torque <b>to</b> the <b>front</b> wheels for better steering control and braking performance. If the automatic is placed in Reverse or [...] "1st" [...] gear, the transmission divides the torque 50-50 <b>to</b> both <b>front</b> and rear wheels.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The optomotor {{following}} response, {{a behavior}} based on movement detection {{was recorded in}} the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster b fore and after the injection of picrotoxinin, an antagonist of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. The directional selectivity of this response was transiently abolished or inverted after injection. This result is in agreement with picrotoxinin-induced modifications observed in electrophysiological activity of direction-selective cells in flies (Biilthoff and Schmid 1983; Schmid and Bfilthoff, in preparation). Furthermore, walking and flying flies treated with picrotoxinin followed more actively motion from back <b>to</b> <b>front</b> instead of <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back as in normal animals. Since {{the difference in the}} responses <b>to</b> <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back and back <b>to</b> <b>front</b> motions is proposed <b>to</b> be the basis of fixation behavior in flies (Reichardt 1973) our results support his notion and are inconsistent with schemes explaining fixation by alternative mechanisms. ...|$|R
