5000|$|On a grand scale, common {{international}} {{research programs}} got its way during the {{international geophysical year}} (IGY) of 1957/58. For the exploration of deep-sea circulation and strong sea currents, sixty research ships out of forty nations were deployed. In cooperation of the research ships [...] "Crawford", [...] "Atlantis", [...] "Discovery II", [...] "Chain" [...] and the Argentine <b>sounding</b> <b>vessel</b> [...] "Capitan Canepa", fifteen profiles at intervals of eight latitudes between 48° N and 48° S were taken.|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{field trials}} of a 3. 2 -cm Motorola range {{positioning}} system {{used by the}} Department of Transport for the positioning of <b>sounding</b> <b>vessels</b> have revealed that the system suffers from range limitation, and interference from marine radars. In an attempt to overcome both these deficiencies {{the design of a}} higher-gain transponder antenna and a shipboard omnidirectional antenna was carried out.

Some proposed International Polar Year activities {{could help}} {{improve the situation}} by collecting new <b>soundings</b> during <b>vessel</b> transits to and from their operating areas, and by making their observations available for inclusion in existing international databases...|$|R
50|$|USNS Tanner (T-AGS-40), {{was built}} for the United States Navy as a fast oceanographic {{research}} vessel by Bethlehem Steel Corporation at its Sparrows Point Yard in Maryland in 1990. The vessel was the second oceanographic research ship to bear the name of Zera Luther Tanner, a noted oceanographer and inventor of a patented <b>sounding</b> machine. The <b>vessel</b> experienced catastrophic engine failure in 1993 and was laid up by the Navy and eventually transferred ownership to the Maritime Administration (MARAD).|$|R
6000|$|That night I had {{but little}} sleep, but {{was in and}} out of my cabin continually. Whenever I was upon the deck I could hear the [...] "click, click, click" [...] of the capstan aboard the pirate <b>vessel,</b> <b>sounding</b> more clearly through the {{dampness}} of the night than in the daytime. There was still not a breath of air going, and I thought it likely that the pirate intended making her way into the harbor that night, but about three o'clock in the morning the noise of working the capstan ceased, and I fancied that I heard a sound as of dropping anchor, though I could make out nothing through the darkness, even with the night-glass.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn investigation is made into {{the feasibility of}} using mixing-ratio predictions employing multiple linear regression techniques applied to saturated mixing ratio profiles at specified levels. Three such sets of coefficients are determined from Ocean Station <b>Vessel</b> <b>sounding</b> data recorded for the months of January (1967 - 70, inclusive), and tested for effectiveness to determine a "best" prediction scheme. The resultant "best" set of coefficients is then compared to a previously designed regression-prediction scheme due to Weinreb and Crosby (1973) based on a selection of island and coastal data divided equally in time and space. Tests were performed to determine possible sources of error affecting the water vapor specifications made by the multiple regression procedure. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|In December 1808 Flying Fish was sailing {{along the}} coast of San Domingo, working her way towards Port Royal, Jamaica, with a {{schooner}} in tow, a prize that she had taken. As the weather worsened, Gooding sailed closer to shore. When breakers were sighted ahead, he attempted to turn Flying Fish, but was unable to do so before she grounded. Although the strike was gentle, water poured in and Flying Fish was quickly turned on her side. The prize came in and removed all the men on Flying Fish. The subsequent court martial reprimanded the master for failing to take frequent depth <b>soundings</b> as the <b>vessels</b> approached shore, and admonished Gooding not to sail so close to shore in the future.|$|R
