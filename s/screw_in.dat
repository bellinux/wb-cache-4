5|$|After WrestleMania, Massaro {{continued}} as a valet for WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In storyline, on the April 13 episode of SmackDown!, Massaro {{was attacked by}} Jillian Hall. In reality, Massaro had loosened a <b>screw</b> <b>in</b> her ankle, which had been inserted the previous year after she legitimately fractured her tibia and fibula while in a battle royal. Massaro returned on the June 1, 2007 episode of SmackDown!, helping McCool defeat Hall after she distracted her. This return was short lived when on the June 8 edition of SmackDown!, Massaro was suspended indefinitely after accidentally spilling Mr. McMahon's coffee on him. In reality, Massaro was taking time off to participate on the show Survivor.|$|E

25|$|He {{describes}} {{the construction of}} Archimedes' <b>screw</b> <b>in</b> Chapter X (without mentioning Archimedes by name). It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and drain mines. Other lifting machines he mentions include the endless chain of buckets and the reverse overshot water-wheel. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water were discovered when old mines were re-opened at Rio Tinto in Spain, Rosia Montana in Romania and Dolaucothi in west Wales. The Rio Tinto wheel is now shown in the British Museum, and the Dolaucothi specimen in the National Museum of Wales.|$|E
25|$|In the men's free skating, Brian Joubert slashed {{his hand}} on his skate blade and left drops of blood all over the ice; he {{completed}} the program but later required medical attention. Also during the free skating, a <b>screw</b> <b>in</b> Daisuke Takahashi's skate came loose on his first jump. He was able to get it repaired and resumed his program within the three minutes allowed. Oda ruined his chances of a medal by doing an extra triple jump, resulting in a loss of 13 points. Florent Amodio used music with lyrics, which is not allowed in competitive skating with the exception of ice dancing. He was not given the normally required one-point penalty because not enough judges voted for it.|$|E
25|$|Very small lamps {{may have}} the {{filament}} support wires extended through {{the base of the}} lamp, and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison <b>screw</b> <b>in</b> candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.|$|E

500|$|The {{changes to}} the story were mostly superficial, and the {{adaptation}} generally mirrors the novella's tone. The television critic Matthew Baylis observed that the film creates unease and horror through distortions of reality, and that The Turn of the Screw is not a [...] "screaming-banshees-and-horrible-corpses style of ghost story". The film utilises subtle horror, including details such as a broken doll on a window ledge, {{and the fact that}} viewers never discover certain elements of the story (for example, it is never revealed why the character Miles has been suspended from his boarding school). This, for Baylis, ties to the title of the film: [...] "it's the writer who puts the <b>screw</b> <b>in</b> the hole and the best ones ask the audience to turn it themselves".|$|E

[...] The fore-end is located {{on the underside of the}} barrel and moves front to back. [...] The weapon can hold a maximum of five rounds total with four in the tubular magazine and one in the chamber. [...] It has a hammerless action which means that there is no external hammer spur. [...] There is only a firing pin which strikes the primer on the shell to ignite the powder in the round.|$|E
500|$|During preseason {{training}} in January 2011 McCaw injured his foot, subsequent x-rays {{revealed that he}} had received a stress fracture in the fifth metatarsal of his right foot. It was determined his best chance of recovery was to undergo an operation where a pin was inserted. As a result, McCaw missed the opening two months of the Super Rugby season. During the All Black's third Rugby World Cup pool match against France, McCaw became the first All Black to reach 100 test caps. However, it was also during this match McCaw re-aggravated his foot injury. In order to rest his injury, {{he was forced to}} skip the more physical aspects of training and miss the All Blacks' final pool match against Canada. Prior to the Quarter-final against Argentina McCaw decided against having another x-ray. Following the re-occurrence of his injury it was uncertain whether McCaw could continue to play for the All Blacks, this forced the coaching staff to develop contingency plans and Matt Todd was called into the All Black training squad. McCaw was able to continue to play throughout the World Cup tournament and lifted the Webb Ellis trophy after a tense 8–7 victory over France. This was the lowest score in a final in World Cup history. After the final, the All Black coach Graham Henry stated [...] "He can hardly walk and how he played today I just don't know," [...] and he acknowledged the All Blacks probably would not have won without him. Following the World Cup x-rays showed that the <b>screw</b> <b>in</b> his foot, necessary to stop the deterioration of the original injury had caused a second fracture. The fracture again, required a further operation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{determine}} the diagnostic power of three-dimensional reformatted multi-slice computerized tomography (CT) images on misplaced pedicle <b>screws</b> <b>in</b> spinal surgery. Eighty-four consecutive patients with 458 <b>screws</b> <b>in</b> situ were investigated prospectively using both axial CT slices and reformatted images after operation by two blinded investigators. All the screw misplacements were documented and the differences between the two imaging modalities were recorded. Axial CT slices were able to show only 23 of 60 misplaced pedicle screws; multislice CT was three times more powerful in the diagnosis of pedicle <b>screw</b> complications <b>in</b> spinal surgery (p< 0. 05). We concluded that multi-slice CT reconstruction should be the primary diagnostic tool after <b>screw</b> implantation <b>in</b> the human spine...|$|R

[...] During Tammo's funeral procession {{the next day in}} the town of Qamishli, Syrian security forces fired into a crowd of more than 50,000 mourners, killing five people. According to Tammo's son, Fares Tammo, [...] "My father's assassination is the <b>screw</b> <b>in</b> the regime's coffin. They made a big mistake by killing my father." [...] Since then, Kurdish demonstrations became a routine part of the Syrian uprising.

2500|$|The Experiment, built {{sometime}} around 1807-1810, {{was an early}} horse-powered ferry boat. It was a twelve-ton three-mast boat drawing {{a few feet of}} water, about 100 feet long by 20 feet beam. Its driving mechanism, an in-water screw, was invented by David Grieve in 1801. The boat was constructed by David Wilkinson (some sources give his name as Varnum) in 1807 to 1810, depending on the source. It was propelled by a [...] "goose-foot paddle" [...] large mechanical screw propeller in the water (instead of a paddle wheel at water surface). The new technology devised by Grieve and Wilkinson was powered by eight horses on a treadmill. The horse boat technology to propel the boat upstream was originally invented by David Grieve and granted a patent February 24, 1801 in the patent category of [...] "Boats to ascend rivers". The complete recorded patent was lost in the 1836 U.S. Patent Office fire. The novel idea of propelling vessels upstream by the use of a large mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>in</b> the water is now referred to as Ericsson’s propeller.|$|E

There, Bart is immediately smitten with a kind and charitable girl named Jenny. Bart makes {{a concerted effort to}} appear [...] "good" [...] to Jenny, demonstrating his newfound good nature by defending ducklings and eventually inviting Jenny over for dinner. However, Milhouse shows up on the Simpsons' doorstep and threatens to reveal Bart's true, dark nature because Bart forgot to visit him during his suspension. Milhouse begins appearing on Bart and Jenny's outings, each time hinting at Bart's misdeeds. Eventually, Bart confesses to Jenny that he was actually bad before he met her and only pretended to be good to start a relationship. He continues to say that he is changed completely because of being with her. Jenny, though momentarily pleased by Bart's honesty, realizes she cannot forgive or trust Bart, and angrily dumps him. At home, Bart cries, and Homer & Marge console and reassure him that girls come and go, but he still has his family, only for him to cry even harder, and for Homer to shed tears too.|$|E
