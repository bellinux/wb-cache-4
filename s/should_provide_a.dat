5|$|Management {{of human}} {{consumption}} of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria for ecological sustainability: renewable resources <b>should</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.|$|E

25|$|For over 600 years Stamford was {{the site}} of the Stamford Bull Run festival, held {{annually}} on 13 November, St Brice's day, until 1839. According to local tradition, the custom was started by William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, after he saw two bulls fighting in the meadow beneath his castle viewpoint. Some butchers came to part the combatants and one of the bulls ran into the town. The earl mounted his horse and rode after the animal; he enjoyed the sport so much that he gave the meadow in which the fight began to the butchers of Stamford on condition that they <b>should</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> bull, to be run in the town every 13 November, for ever after.|$|E
25|$|Macmillan {{placed the}} Nassau Agreement before Cabinet on 3 January 1963. He {{made the case}} for Britain {{retaining}} nuclear weapons. He asserted {{that it would not be}} in the best interest of the Western Alliance for all knowledge of the technology to reside with the United States; that possession of an independent nuclear capability gave Britain the ability to respond to threats from the Soviet Union even when the United States was not inclined to support Britain; and that possession of nuclear weapons gave Britain a voice in nuclear disarmament talks. However, concerns were expressed that the dependence on the United States would necessarily diminish Britain's influence on world affairs. Thorneycroft addressed the view that Britain <b>should</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> nuclear deterrent from its own resources. He pointed out that Polaris represented $800 million in research and development costs that the United Kingdom would save. Nonetheless, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Selwyn Lloyd, was still concerned at the cost.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 {{report for}} DEFRA, {{conducted}} following the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, found that, discounting 'exotic {{events such as}} meteorite impacts', 'in most plausible circumstances {{it is likely that}} such an event would be contained by current defences, designed to resist storm surges, for all major developed areas', however the joint occurrence of events, such as a tsunami coinciding with a storm surge, was discounted. The report did, however call for additional more detailed modelling to be carried out, recommended that the Met Office <b>should</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> tsunami warning service, and that detection devices should be upgraded. A follow-up report indicated that, of the three likely scenarios modelled, a Lisbon-type event would pose the greatest danger, potentially resulting in a tsunami wave exceeding the 1:100 year extreme sea level at the Cornish peninsula by up to 1.4m, but being within the range elsewhere. This conclusion is markedly different from the greater heights calculated by Bryant and Haslett as having been encountered in the Bristol Channel during the 1607 Bristol Channel floods.|$|E

2500|$|There was {{a chapel}} in the far-removed hamlet of Kingswood which had existed {{long before the}} middle of the 15th century; for when the vicarage of Ewell was endowed in 1458, it is {{mentioned}} as of long standing. [...] Mention occurs towards the close of the reign of Edward I of England. [...] A church ruling stipulated that the vicar of Ewell should not be obliged to minister to the hamlet of Kingswood or to celebrate Mass in the chapel there; that when any of the Sacraments of the Church were to be administered to the people of that place, the rectors (Prior and convent of Newark) <b>should</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> priest for the purpose; and in case of the death of any inhabitant of Kingswood and his removal to Ewell for burial, the vicar should meet the body at Provost's Cross, {{on the south side of}} Ewell, which had been the custom from ancient time.

The churchwardens’ accounts of St Magnus list many payments to those injured on the Bridge and record that in 1752 a man was crushed to death between two carts. [...] After the House of Commons had resolved upon the alteration of London Bridge, the Rev Robert Gibson, Rector of St Magnus, applied to the House for relief; stating that 48l. 6s. 2d. per annum, part of his salary of 170l. per annum, was assessed upon houses on London Bridge; which he should utterly lose by their removal unless a clause in the bill about to be passed <b>should</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> remedy.

Boot and his fellow benefactors sought to establish an [...] "elite seat of learning" [...] committed to widening participation, and hoped that the move would solve the problems facing University College Nottingham, in its restricted building on Shakespeare Street.
