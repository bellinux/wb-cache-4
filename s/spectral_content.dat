25|$|This {{enhanced}} {{sensitivity to}} {{noise in the}} region of 6kHz became particularly apparent in the late 1960s with the introduction of compact cassette recorders and Dolby-B noise reduction. A-weighted noise measurements were found to give misleading results because they did not give sufficient prominence to the 6kHz region where the noise reduction was having greatest effect, and did not sufficiently attenuate noise around 10kHz and above (a particular example is with the 19kHz pilot tone on FM radio systems which, though usually inaudible is not sufficiently attenuated by A-weighting, so that sometimes one piece of equipment would even measure worse than another and yet sound better, because of differing <b>spectral</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although the A-weighting curve, in {{widespread}} use for noise measurement, {{is said to}} have been based on the 40-phon Fletcher-Munson curve, research in the 1960s demonstrated that determinations of equal-loudness made using pure tones are not directly relevant to our perception of noise. This is because the cochlea in our inner ear analyses sounds in terms of <b>spectral</b> <b>content,</b> each 'hair-cell' responding to a narrow band of frequencies known as a critical band. The high-frequency bands are wider in absolute terms than the low frequency bands, and therefore 'collect' proportionately more power from a noise source. However, when more than one critical band is stimulated, the outputs of the various bands are summed by the brain to produce an impression of loudness. For these reasons equal-loudness curves derived using noise bands show an upwards tilt above 1kHz and a downward tilt below 1kHz when compared to the curves derived using pure tones.|$|E
25|$|A {{compressor}} with a side-chain input controls {{gain from}} main input to output {{based on the}} level of the signal at the side-chain input. The compressor behaves in the conventional manner when both inputs are supplied with the same signal. The side-chain input is used by disc jockeys for ducking – lowering the music volume automatically when speaking. The DJ's microphone signal is routed to the side-chain input so that whenever the DJ speaks the compressor reduces the volume of the music. A sidechain with equalization controls can be used to reduce the volume of signals that have a strong <b>spectral</b> <b>content</b> within a certain frequency range: it can act as a de-esser, reducing the level of vocal sibilance in the range of 6–9kHz. A de-esser helps reduce high frequencies that tend to overdrive preemphasized media (such as phonograph records and FM radio). Another use of the side-chain in music production serves to maintain a loud bass track without the bass drum causing undue peaks that result in loss of overall headroom.|$|E

Here, distortion product otoacoustic emissions are used to assess the frequency range over which the inner ear is sensitive. It is found that both the <b>spectral</b> <b>contents</b> of the calls and the innerear sensitivity change in a similar fashion along an altitudinal gradient. As a result, the call frequencies and the auditory tuning are closely matched at all altitudes.

2500|$|Neural {{oscillations}} {{have been}} most widely studied in neural activity generated by large groups of neurons. Large-scale activity can be measured by techniques such as EEG. In general, EEG signals have a broad <b>spectral</b> <b>content</b> similar to pink noise, but [...] also reveal oscillatory activity in specific frequency bands. The first discovered and best-known frequency band is alpha activity (7.5–12.5 Hz) that can be detected from the occipital lobe during relaxed wakefulness and which increases when the eyes are closed. Other frequency bands are: delta (14Hz), theta (48Hz), beta (1330Hz) and gamma (3070Hz) frequency band, where faster rhythms such as gamma activity {{have been linked to}} cognitive processing. Indeed, EEG signals change dramatically during sleep and show a transition from faster frequencies to increasingly slower frequencies such as alpha waves. In fact, different sleep stages are commonly characterized by their <b>spectral</b> <b>content.</b> Consequently, neural oscillations have been linked to cognitive states, such as awareness and consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|Karlheinz Brandenburg used a CD {{recording}} of Suzanne Vega's song [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] {{to assess and}} refine the MP3 compression algorithm. This song was chosen because of its nearly monophonic nature and wide <b>spectral</b> <b>content,</b> {{making it easier to}} hear imperfections in the compression format during playbacks. Some refer to Suzanne Vega as [...] "The mother of MP3". This particular track has an interesting property in that the two channels are almost, but not completely, the same, leading to a case where Binaural Masking Level Depression causes spatial unmasking of noise artifacts unless the encoder properly recognizes the situation and applies corrections similar to those detailed in the MPEG-2 AAC psychoacoustic model. Some more critical audio excerpts (glockenspiel, triangle, accordion, etc.) were taken from the EBU V3/SQAM reference compact disc and have been used by professional sound engineers to assess the subjective quality of the MPEG Audio formats. LAME is the most advanced MP3 encoder. LAME includes a VBR variable bit rate encoding which uses a quality parameter rather than a bit rate goal. Later versions 2008+) support an n.nnn quality goal which automatically selects MPEG-2 or MPEG-2.5 sampling rates as appropriate for human speech recordings which need only 5512Hz bandwidth resolution.|$|E
2500|$|Skyglow {{refers to}} the diffuse glow {{that can be seen}} over {{populated}} areas. It arises from light reflected from illuminated surfaces and from light escaping directly upward from incompletely shielded or upward-directed light fixtures, which then is scattered (redirected) by the atmosphere back toward the ground. The brightness of skyglow is affected strongly by the amount of light used, the shielding characteristics of the light fixtures, and by the color or <b>spectral</b> <b>content</b> of the light sources. Though it is commonly thought that Rayleigh scattering strongly increases the brightness of skyglow arising from white sources with strong blue and green emission, the dominant spectral effect has been shown to arise from the Purkinje effect instead. Because of the eye's increased sensitivity to blue and green light when adapted to very low luminance levels (such as those in even moderately polluted clear night skies), white light sources such as white LEDs contribute significantly more to skyglow than an equal amount of yellow light from sources such as high-pressure sodium, low-pressure sodium, [...] "phosphor-converted" [...] (PC) amber LED, or [...] "narrow spectrum" [...] amber AlGaInP LEDs.
