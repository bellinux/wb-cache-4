2500|$|Poorly {{produced}} moonshine can be contaminated, {{mainly from}} {{materials used in}} the construction of the still. Stills employing automotive radiators as condensers are particularly dangerous; in some cases, glycol, products from antifreeze, can appear as well. Radiators used as condensers also may contain lead at the connections to the plumbing. These methods often resulted in blindness or lead poisoning for those consuming tainted liquor. This was an issue during Prohibition when many died from ingesting unhealthy substances. [...] Consumption of lead-tainted moonshine is an important risk factor for <b>saturnine</b> <b>gout,</b> which is a very painful but treatable medical condition that damages the kidneys and joints.|$|E
50|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The toxic effect of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.Lead poisoning inhibits excretion of the waste product urate and causes a predisposition for gout, in which urate builds up.
