Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go into <b>sleep</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E

Dell calls this feature PowerShare, while Toshiba calls it USB Sleep-and-Charge. On Acer Inc. and Packard Bell laptops, sleep-and-charge USB ports are marked with a non-standard symbol (the letters USB over a drawing of a battery); the feature is simply called Power-off USB. On some laptops such as Dell and Apple MacBook models, {{it is possible to}} plug a device in, close the laptop (putting it into <b>sleep</b> <b>mode)</b> and have the device continue to charge.|$|E
5|$|Characters can {{continue}} to level up through activities within the Peristylium while the PSP is in <b>sleep</b> <b>mode,</b> the game's UMD is running, and the PSP is charging. The multiplayer function, activated through the game's configuration screen, allows two other players to jump into another host player's game via an online connection. The allotted time for multiplayer {{is limited to a}} few minutes, with transitions between zones triggering the end of a multiplayer section. The time limit can be extended by players helping their current host. The first and last segments of the game are not open to multiplayer. There is also a function called Magical Academy Assist, in which NPCs named after members of the game's production team are summoned into battle to assist the cadets.|$|E
30|$|In this study, a power {{consumption}} model {{as a function}} of the traffic is developed for macrocell base stations based on measurements on an actual base station. This model allows us to develop energy-efficient wireless access networks by combining the Green radio access network design (GRAND) tool designed by the authors, which develops an always-on network with a minimal {{power consumption}} for a predefined area, and an algorithm that introduces power reducing techniques in the network such as <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming. Green-field deployments and optimization of existing networks are investigated. For a green-field deployment, it was found that introducing <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming in the network can reduce the power consumption by up to 14.4 % compared to the network without <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming. Optimizing existing networks by applying GRAND (without <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming) results in a power consumption reduction of 34.5 % compared to the original network. A careful selection of base station locations already results in a significant energy saving. Introducing <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming to the current networks results in a saving of 8 %. <b>Sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming are promising energy-saving techniques for future wireless networks.|$|R
30|$|Figure 10 d {{shows the}} {{optimized}} network when <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> (<b>sleep</b> threshold of 0.1) and cell zooming are activated. 18 BSs can sleep when the traffic {{is below the}} sleep threshold of 0.1 (Table 2). This results in a daily power consumption of 4641.4 kWh (Table 2) which is 1.9 % lower than the optimized network without activating <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and 33.4 % lower than the original operator network. Again it is concluded that it is recommended to add <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming into the networks. Today’s operator networks are currently thus not optimized towards power consumption.|$|R

5|$|Battles {{come in two}} types: random {{encounters}} with standard enemies, and staged boss battles. The battle system revolves around turn-based combat: each side is allowed to perform an action or multiple actions, with each character having independent movements and commands: these actions include attacking with the equipped weapon, using magic, or using an item. The party also has the option to escape from most battles. Key to the battle system are the Bravely and Default options. Brave Points (BP) dictate the number of actions a character or enemy can take within a turn, along with being needed for the execution of certain abilities. Party members can utilize BP down into negative figures, enabling up to four actions within a single turn. When the BP gauge is into negative figures, they must wait for the BP counter to reach zero before they can act again. BP are naturally recovered once per turn. Alternately, a chosen character can Default, which accumulates BP and reduces the damage taken by enemy strikes. An additional power is Bravely Second, an ability which freezes time for the enemy, allowing a party member to move four times in a single turn with no cost. Bravely Second requires SP, a currency which is either replenished while the 3DS is in <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> or through buying regenerative SP Drinks using microtransactions. Battle speed during combat can be sped up or returned to normal by the player's choice.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>mode</b> and {{hibernation}} can be combined: The {{contents of}} RAM are copied to the non-volatile storage {{and the computer}} enters <b>sleep</b> <b>mode.</b> This approach combines the benefits of <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> and hibernation: The machine can resume instantaneously, and its state, including open and unsaved files, survives a power outage. Hybrid sleep consumes as much power as <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> while hibernation powers down the computer.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{introduces}} a new Hybrid Sleep power-saving mode that combines hibernation and <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> functionality. When active, Hybrid Sleep saves {{information from a}} computer's memory to a hibernation file on disk, but instead of turning off the computer, it initiates <b>sleep</b> <b>mode.</b> Traditionally, systems that lose power while in <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> will also lose all data resident in memory. However, since systems that resume from Hybrid Sleep do so by retrieving information from a hibernation file on disk, they offer the benefits of quickly resuming when in <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> and improved reliability {{in the event of}} power loss.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} impact of <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> {{capabilities}} on the lifetime of backbone devices. We first define a model that integrates <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> in the device lifetime. We then derive {{a model for the}} network topology to compute the average network lifetime. Finally, we consider a realistic case study driven by operator feedback. Results indicate that the application of <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> can increase the average network lifetime. However, frequent power state transitions of network devices can deteriorate the network lifetime. Thus, we argue that the design and the management of energy-aware networks need {{to take into account the}} device lifetime. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

30|$|Also the {{possibilities}} of <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> to reduce the power consumption in wireless access networks is already established {{in a number of}} studies[7 – 10]. These studies discuss how <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> can be implemented and supported by the network. However, in[7 – 9], the energy savings in a realistic network deployment are not investigated. Our study tries to determine how much power can be saved by introducing <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> in a realistic network. In[10], the effect of <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> for different operator networks in a certain area is investigated which is a similar study as ours. However, {{it is also important to}} investigate what the energy savings are when <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> are introduced in a network with a minimal power consumption (here resulting from the GRAND tool). In this way, the most energy-efficient solution for the area is considered. The algorithm developed in[10] is similar to ours, but it is assumed that the cell size of the active (non-sleeping) BSs is maximized. In our algorithm, the cell size of the active BSs is expanded as much as needed which does not necessarily correspond with the maximum cell size. Note that in this study it is not discussed how <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming should be supported by the hardware, nor the protocols that will be needed, e.g., for waking up the BS when necessary. This is the scope of some other studies[8 – 12].|$|R
25|$|Many systems {{also support}} a {{low-power}} <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> {{in which the}} processing functions of the machine are powered down, using a little power to preserve the contents of RAM and support waking up. Instantaneous resumption {{is one of the}} advantages of <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> over hibernation. A hibernated system must start up and read data back to RAM, which typically takes time. A system in <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> only needs to power up the CPU and display, which is almost instantaneous. On the other hand, a system in <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> still consumes power to keep the data in the RAM. Detaching power from a system in <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> results in data loss, while cutting the power of a system in hibernation has no risk; the hibernated system can resume when and if the power is restored. Both shut down and hibernated systems may consume standby power unless they are unplugged.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista {{introduced}} a hybrid sleep feature, which saves {{the contents of}} memory to hard disk but instead of powering down, enters <b>sleep</b> <b>mode.</b> If the power is lost, the computer can resume as if hibernated.|$|E
25|$|Operating system updates are {{designed}} to be received wirelessly and installed automatically during a period in <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> in which Wi-Fi is turned on. A user may install firmware updates manually by downloading the firmware for their device and copying the file to the device's root directory. The Kindle operating system uses the Linux kernel with a Java app for reading e-books.|$|E
30|$|Two {{cases are}} investigated. In the first case, a {{completely}} new LTE network is developed for the city center of Ghent. By introducing <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming in this network, the power consumption can be reduced up to 14.4 % (depending on the used sleep threshold) compared to the network without <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming. In the second case, an existing operator network for Brussels capital region is optimized. Applying GRAND on this network results in a reduction of 34.5 % for the daily power consumption. The introduction of <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming causes an additional saving of 2.5 % compared to the optimized network. A careful selection of the base station locations can already result in a significant saving (34.5 % {{as shown by the}} results from the GRAND tool). In current networks, this can be done by site sharing. For future networks, it is recommended that <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and cell zooming are supported.|$|R
30|$|In {{light of}} the {{requirement}} for both increasing bit rates and reduced energy consumption in mobile access networks, the introduction of <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> is a key element. As {{it is difficult to}} analytically predict the energy saving potential that can be achieved by using <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> in mobile access network deployments, we have derived a heuristic that can serve as a design tool for establishing a baseline.|$|R
30|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>modes</b> in {{wireless}} {{networks are}} already used in multiple situations. For example, {{the requirement of}} providing a certain coverage while certain nodes can sleep is a well known problem in sensor networks [7, 8]. The authors of [6] give a good overview of the different techniques {{that can be used}} in wireless contexts. Due to the requirement for long battery life times, <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> were also introduced in the mobile subscriber devices [9, 10].|$|R
25|$|As the {{produced}} {{energy from}} the solar panels was lowering due to the setting sun and dust the Deep <b>Sleep</b> <b>Mode</b> was introduced. In this mode the rover was shut down completely during the night {{in order to save}} energy, even if the instruments would fail. The route was selected so that the rover's panels were tilted as much as possible towards the winter sun.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency {{launched}} Energy Star, {{a voluntary}} labeling {{program that is}} designed to promote and recognize energy efficiency in monitors, climate control equipment, and other technologies. This resulted in the widespread adoption of <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> among consumer electronics. Concurrently, the Swedish organization TCO Development launched the TCO Certification program to promote low magnetic and electrical emissions from CRT-based computer displays; this program was later expanded to include criteria on energy consumption, ergonomics, and the use of hazardous materials in construction.|$|E
25|$|A dock {{can allow}} some laptop {{computers}} {{to become a}} substitute for a desktop computer, without sacrificing the mobile computing functionality of the machine. Portable computers can dock and undock hot, cold or standby, depending on {{the capabilities of the}} system. In a cold dock or undock, one completely shuts the computer down before docking/undocking. In a hot dock or undock, the computer remains running when docked/undocked. Standby docking or undocking, an intermediate style used in some designs, allows the computer to be docked/undocked while powered on, but requires that it be placed into a <b>sleep</b> <b>mode</b> prior to docking/undocking.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultra-low}} power C8051 MCUs {{are designed}} to minimize power consumption across active and <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> and to provide the fastest wake-up times possible.|$|R

30|$|Due to {{the small}} cell size, {{femtocell}} access networks appear to be better suitable than macrocell networks for introducing <b>sleep</b> <b>modes.</b> At user densities between 100 and 1000 users the optimal active base station fraction for high bit rate networks is below 20 %. Thus, covering areas for high bit rates with sleep-enabled femtocells has a high potential for being less power consuming than using macrocells. However, also in macrocell networks there are opportunities for introducing <b>sleep</b> <b>modes,</b> especially when users have a preference for lower bit rates.|$|R

25|$|The usual {{technique}} for authorities, either public entities such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) {{that they believe}} is being used improperly is to first physically separate the suspect user from the computer enough {{that he or she}} cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once they have done so, they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions of a mouse, touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going into <b>sleep</b> <b>mode,</b> from which it would usually return to a lock screen which would require a password. One program commonly used for this purpose is Mouse Jiggler.|$|E

The software provided more real-time information to help motivate users. The app also suggests goals based on user's habits. Live notifications are provided on the UP24 so users will get push notifications when they get close to their goals. A new activity log gives a snapshot of a user's day and when the UP24 last synced.

25|$|Humans possess both {{slow wave}} and REM sleep, in both phases both {{eyes are closed}} and both hemispheres of the brain involved. Sleep has also been {{recorded}} in mammals other than humans. One interesting study showed that echidnas possess only slow wave sleep (non-REM). This {{seems to indicate that}} REM sleep appeared in evolution only after therians. But this has later been contested by studies that claim that sleep in echidna combines both modes into a single sleeping state. Other studies have shown a peculiar form of sleep in odontocetes (like dolphins and porpoises). This is called the unihemispherical slow wave sleep (USWS). At any time during this <b>sleep</b> <b>mode,</b> the EEG of one brain hemisphere indicates sleep while that of the other is equivalent to wakefulness. In some cases, the corresponding eye is open. This might allow the animal to reduce predator risk and sleep while swimming in water, though the animal may also be capable of sleeping at rest.|$|E
25|$|Xbox One {{consoles}} {{ship with}} {{an updated version}} of Kinect; the new Kinect uses a wide-angle time-of-flight camera, and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment. The new Kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active IR sensor. It has a 60% wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor, compared to six feet for the original Kinect, and can track up to 6 skeletons at once. It can also detect a player's heart rate, facial expression, the position and orientation of 25 individual joints (including thumbs), the weight put on each limb, speed of player movements, and track gestures performed with a standard controller. The color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the viewing screen, allowing for a broad range of scenarios. In addition to improving video communications and video analytics applications, this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications. Kinect's microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation, starting games, and waking the console from <b>sleep</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
30|$|When {{optimising}} {{a system}} for energy efficiency, the introduction of <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> {{is one of the}} most commonly used approaches and is already well known in other wireless communication systems such as sensor networks [6]. In this article, we will demonstrate the introduction of <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> is essential if we want to deploy mobile access networks with a high coverage for large bit rates. Moreover, we will provide a method to establish the best-effort active base station fraction in such a network. We will limit our discussion to LTE implementations as this is the emerging standard designed for high bit rate applications [5]. This can be used as a baseline to evaluate the energy efficiency of practical implementations.|$|R
30|$|In mobile {{technologies}} two {{trends are}} competing. On the one hand, the mobile access network requires optimisation in energy consumption. On the other hand, data volumes and required bit rates are rapidly increasing. The latter trend requires {{the deployment of}} more dense mobile access networks as the higher bit rates are available at shorter distance from the base station. In order to improve the energy efficiency, the introduction of <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> is required. We derive a heuristic which allows establishing a baseline of active base station fractions {{in order to be}} able to evaluate mobile access network designs. We demonstrate that <b>sleep</b> <b>modes</b> can lead to significant improvements in energy efficiency and act as an enabler for femtocell deployments.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{the power}} {{consumption}} in a femtocell base station network is investigated using optimized heuristic algorithm and is compared with power consumption using heuristic algorithm for various bit rates, different user density, different base station density and different boundary areas.

Reducing the power consumption of cellular wireless access networks is not only necessary for the global environment but also makes commercial sense for telecommunication operators.
