50|$|This is an F-type main {{sequence}} star with a stellar classification of F6 V Fe-0.7 CH-0.4. The <b>suffix</b> <b>notation</b> indicates that absorption lines {{of iron and}} the carbon-hydrogen G-band are abnormally weak. It has an estimated 1.42 times {{the mass of the}} Sun and 1.4 times the Sun's radius. The star is around 3.67 billion years old, and is spinning with a leisurely projected rotational velocity of 4.7 km/s.|$|E
5000|$|This is an evolved G-type giant {{star with}} a stellar {{classification}} of G7 IIIa Fe-1, where the <b>suffix</b> <b>notation</b> indicates an underabundance of iron in the spectrum. The measured angular diameter is [...] At the estimated distance of Pi Tauri, this yields a physical size of about 21 times the {{radius of the}} Sun. It possesses nearly four times {{the mass of the}} Sun and is radiating 229 times the Sun's luminosity at an effective temperature of 5,086 K.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-hued primary, {{component}} A, is an evolved G-type giant {{star with}} a stellar classification of G6 IIIb CN-0.5, where the <b>suffix</b> <b>notation</b> indicating it has anomalously weak lines of cyanogen. At {{the age of}} 1.88 billion years, is a red clump star that is generating energy through the fusion of helium at its core. The primary has nearly double {{the mass of the}} Sun and is radiating 69 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,876 K.|$|E

5000|$|The {{commonly}} used reference sound pressure in air iswhich is often considered as {{the threshold of}} human hearing (roughly {{the sound of a}} mosquito flying 3 m away). The proper notations for sound pressure level using this reference are [...] or , but the <b>suffix</b> <b>notations</b> , , dBSPL, or dBSPL are very common, even if they are not accepted by the SI.|$|R
50|$|The atom O is {{used for}} a (0,0) step, i.e. a turn pass. Bex {{notation}} also defines a method to indicate long-range leapers for which the original Betza notation did not define an atom; they can be written in coordinate notation, e.g. (1,4) for the giraffe. It also allows specification of what a piece can promote to, by <b>suffixing</b> the move <b>notation</b> with = and a comma-separated list of pieces. Bex uses y to indicate royalty.|$|R
50|$|This is a single-lined spectroscopic {{binary system}} with an orbital period of 4.5 years and an {{eccentricity}} of 0.59. The primary, component A, is an evolved K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III Ba0.1. The <b>suffix</b> <b>notation</b> indicates {{this is a}} weak barium star, showing slightly stronger than normal lines of singly-ionized barium. This star has an estimated 2.34 times {{the mass of the}} Sun and, at an estimated age of 1.24 billion years, has expanded to 25 times the Sun's radius.|$|E
50|$|Zeta Gruis (ζ Gruis) is a solitary, orange-hued {{star in the}} {{southern}} constellation of Grus. It is {{visible to the naked}} eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.12. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 29.96 mas as seen from the Earth, the system is located about 109 light years from the Sun. This is an evolved K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K1 III Fe−1.2 CN−0.5, where the <b>suffix</b> <b>notation</b> indicates abnormally low abundances of iron and cyanogen in the spectrum.|$|E
50|$|This is a astrometric {{binary star}} system. The best {{fit to the}} radial {{velocity}} data yields an orbital period of roughly 13,770 days (37.7 years) with an eccentricity of around 0.28. The semimajor axis of their computed orbit is about 13 au, or 13 times {{the distance of the}} Earth from the Sun. The primary, component A, is an evolved K-type subgiant star with a stellar classification of K2 V Fe-1.3 CH-0.8, where the <b>suffix</b> <b>notation</b> indicates the absorption lines of iron and the carbon-hydrogen bond are abnormally weak. However, classifications earlier than Gray et al. (2006) consistently showed it as type G5 IV, matching the subgiant categorization.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a robust}} {{exploitation}} of autocorrect, including chemical notation, the deployment could transcends the perceived [...] "disadvantage" [...] of autocorrect. The simple {{use of a}} shortcut suffix denoting chemical glossaries would be deployed. For example, using [...] "campx" [...] for [...] "cAMP" [...] and [...] "camp¥" [...] for [...] "cyclic adenosine monophosphate" [...] and [...] "camp¥x" [...] for [...] "C10H12N5O6P" [...] corresponding sub-script or super-script as needed the shortcut [...] "campx" [...] with [...] "cAMP"; furthermore if/when the full expression was needed, the developer could invoke ¥ to be the <b>suffix</b> for chemical <b>notation,</b> e.g., substitute.|$|R
