5|$|Queer as Folk 2 was {{broadcast}} in February 2000 and {{was driven by}} the plot element of Vince's half-sister's wedding. The specials place emphasis on Vince and Stuart's relationship, and ends with their departure for another gay scene in a pastiche of Grease, as Nathan took the role {{as the leader of}} the Manchester scene's next generation. On the heels of the special, Davies pitched the spin-off Misfits, a late-night soap opera set in a boarding house owned by Vince's mother, Hazel, and The <b>Second</b> <b>Coming,</b> a series that depicted the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ in contemporary Manchester. Misfits was rejected in December 2000 and The <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> was initially approved by Channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel. Instead of contesting the cancellation of The <b>Second</b> <b>Coming,</b> he left Channel 4 and vowed to not work with them again.|$|E
5|$|The AG {{considers}} salvation, baptism in the Holy Spirit {{with the}} evidence of speaking in tongues, divine healing and the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ to be its four core beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{moved into}} writing adult {{television}} dramas in 1994. His early scripts generally explored concepts {{of religion and}} sexuality among various backdrops: Revelations was a soap opera about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar; Springhill was a soap drama about a Catholic family in contemporary Liverpool; The Grand explored society's opinion of subjects such as prostitution, abortion and homosexuality during the interwar period; and Queer as Folk, his first prolific series, recreated his experiences in the Manchester gay scene. Following this, his adult series in the 2000s include Bob & Rose, which portrayed a gay man who {{fell in love with}} a woman; The <b>Second</b> <b>Coming,</b> which focused on the <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> and deicide of Jesus Christ from a mostly non-religious point of view; Mine All Mine, a comedy about a family who discover they own the entire city of Swansea; and Casanova, an adaptation of the complete memoirs of Venetian adventurer Giacomo Casanova.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, he {{met with}} the BBC to discuss the revival of the show and {{producing}} The Second Coming; the BBC were unable to commit to either, and he again declined to work for them. After the BBC rejected The <b>Second</b> <b>Coming,</b> Shindler proposed that the series should be pitched to ITV. Despite the story's controversial message, the critical success of Bob & Rose encouraged the channel to commission the series for broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{adoption}} of the article of faith on the baptism of the Holy Spirit in 1908, the Pentecostal Holiness Church has taught the following beliefs as their five cardinal doctrines: justification by faith, entire sanctification, the baptism in the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues, Christ's atonement (including divine healing), and the premillennial <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The Assemblies of God holds to a conservative, evangelical and Arminian {{theology}} {{as expressed}} in the Statement of Fundamental Truths and position papers, which emphasize such core Pentecostal doctrines as the baptism in the Holy Spirit, speaking in tongues, divine healing and the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ. It defines for itself a fourfold mission to evangelize others, worship God, disciple believers, and show compassion.|$|E

5|$|The PHC {{believes}} in the imminent, personal, premillennial <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> of Jesus Christ. It will occur in two stages: the first stage will be the rapture of the saints before the Tribulation, and the second stage {{will be at the}} end of the Tribulation when Christ will return to defeat the Antichrist, judge the nations of the world, and begin his millennial reign.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} in Aachen's academy, Holtby signed a {{professional}} contract with the club during the 2007–08 season. He was then handed his first-team debut {{at the age of}} 17 by caretaker manager Jörg Schmadtke in December 2007, coming on as a second half substitute for Mirko Casper in a 2–2 draw with FC St. Pauli. His debut was one of only two appearances for the season, with his <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> in a 3–1 loss to TuS Koblenz on the last match day of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|As he lies dying {{under the}} abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to {{encounter}} Mrs Grales/Rachel, a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve and Jesus, exempt from original sin, and may even be the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E

5000|$|In the New Testament, the [...] "day of the Lord" [...] {{may also}} {{refer to the}} writer's own times, or it may refer to {{predicted}} events in a later age of earth's history including the final judgment and the World to Come. The expression may also have an extended meaning in referring to both the first and <b>second</b> <b>comings</b> of Jesus Christ.|$|R

5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E
5|$|Growth in the Northeast was {{accompanied}} by the creation of moral reform organizations, such as Sunday schools, temperance associations, tract and Bible societies, and orphanages. The proliferation of voluntary organizations was encouraged by postmillennialism, {{the belief that the}} <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Christ would occur {{at the end of an}} era of peace and prosperity fostered by human effort. The 1815 General Assembly recommended the creation of societies to promote morality. Organizations such as the American Bible Society, the American Sunday School Union, and the American Colonization Society, while theoretically interdenominational, were dominated by Presbyterians and considered unofficial agencies of the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-final, the U.S. faced Costa Rica. During {{the second}} half, the U.S. scored two goals, the <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> from Lloyd. The U.S. beat Costa Rica 3–0 with Lloyd named {{player of the}} match for the second game in a row. During the final match against Canada, the U.S. {{defeated}} Canada at home 4–0 {{to move on to}} the Olympics as the CONCACAF champions. Lloyd finished the tournament with six goals and three assists and tied for the team lead in goals scored.|$|E

During the Flash's semifinal match against Sky Blue FC, Lloyd scored both of the Flash's game-winning goals: one in the 33rd minute and the <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> during stoppage time. Her two goals resulted in a 2–0 win that advanced the Flash to the championship final against the Portland Thorns FC. The Flash were defeated 2–0 during the final.|$|E
5|$|Scully is {{eventually}} {{captured by the}} townspeople and the worm is inserted into her body. Eventually, Doggett finds Scully, cuts the worm out of her, and shoots the creature dead. Later, Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about {{the trial of the}} cult members; they are offering little defense except that they claim that they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. Scully muses that they thought the worm was the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to never do it again.|$|E
5|$|Shindler {{continued}} to pitch The <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> to other television networks while Davies sought other ventures. His next series {{was based on}} a gay friend who married a woman and fathered a child. He saw the relationship as a promising concept for an unconventional love story and asked the couple about their relationship to develop the show. After developing the series around the prejudice that he and his gay friends had shown, he realised he was creating caricatures for the purpose of exposing them, and instead focused on telling a traditional love story and gave the couple the traditionally British names of Bob Gossage and Rose Cooper.|$|E
50|$|The <b>second</b> album, <b>Coming</b> Home, was {{recorded}} at Abbey Road Studios in London {{and was released}} in January 2012.|$|R
5000|$|A beep is also {{considered}} a colloquialism {{to describe a}} <b>second</b> telephone call <b>coming</b> in on the same phone line as someone is currently speaking, either on a landline or mobile phone.

5|$|The <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> was {{controversial}} {{from its}} conception. When {{it was a}} Channel 4 project, it {{was the subject of}} a Sunday Express article a year before its original projected transmission date of late 2001. The series would again receive criticism when it was rumoured it would be broadcast over the Easter weekend of 2003. The series was eventually broadcast over consecutive nights on 9–10 February 2003 to 6.3million and 5.4million viewers respectively, and received mixed reactions from the audience: Davies reportedly received death threats for its atheistic message and criticism for its anticlimactic ending, as well as two nominations for Television Awards and one for a Royal Television Society Award.|$|E
5|$|The series {{centers on}} FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Scully, working alone, pursues a cult that worship a slug-like organism and {{believe it to be}} the <b>Second</b> <b>Coming</b> of Jesus Christ; but in her efforts to save an injured stranger, she discovers she is in over her head.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the match}} results were {{encouraging}} {{for such a}} young and inexperienced team, Craig scored only 103runs at 14.71. Despite his contributions as a leader, this was not up to standard. He had trouble with his defence, being bowled eight times in 17innings. In the 12 matches {{in the last three}} months of the tour, Craig passed fifty only once in 13 innings. However, the selectors did not have to reverse their youth policy: Craig contracted a bout of hepatitis before the start of the 1958–59 season. He returned to cricket at the beginning of the season, but was underprepared, scoring two ducks in his only two innings of the season, the <b>second</b> <b>coming</b> against the touring England team. Craig declared that he was not ready for a return to Test cricket and relinquished the captaincy, which the selectors handed to Benaud. Benaud went on to defeat England 4–0; as England were widely regarded as the best team at the time, this established him as captain of a resurgent Australia.|$|E
