5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in the gangster film Picture <b>Snatcher</b> (1933): in one scene, he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the backseat of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, RKO {{stood out}} among the industry's Big Five for its focus on B pictures. From a latter-day perspective, {{the most famous of}} the major studios' Golden Age B units is Val Lewton's horror unit at RKO. Lewton {{produced}} such moody, mysterious films as Cat People (1942), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Body <b>Snatcher</b> (1945), directed by Jacques Tourneur, Robert Wise, and others who would become renowned only later in their careers or entirely in retrospect. The movie now widely described as the first classic film noir—Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), a 64-minute B—was produced at RKO, which would release many additional melodramatic thrillers in a similarly stylish vein. The other major studios also turned out a considerable number of movies now identified as noir during the 1940s. Though many of the best-known film noirs were A-level productions, most 1940s pictures in the mode were either of the ambiguous programmer type or destined straight for the bottom of the bill. In the decades since, these cheap entertainments, generally dismissed at the time, have become some of the most treasured products of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E
5|$|Much {{more than}} the other Big Five studios, RKO relied on B {{pictures}} to fill up its schedule. Of the thirty-one features released by RKO in 1944, for instance, ten were budgeted below $200,000, twelve were in the $200,000 to $500,000 range, and only nine cost more. In contrast, a clear majority of the features put out by the other top four studios were budgeted at over a half a million dollars. A focus on B pictures limited the studio's financial risk; while it also limited the potential for reward (Dmytryk's extraordinary coups aside), RKO had a history of making better profits with its run-of-the-mill and low-cost product than with its A movies. The studio's low-budget films offered training opportunities for new directors, as well, among them Jacques Tourneur, Mark Robson, Robert Wise, and Anthony Mann. Robson and Wise received their first directing assignments with producer Val Lewton, whose specialized B horror unit also included the more experienced director Jacques Tourneur. The Lewton unit's moody, atmospheric work—represented by films such as Cat People (1942), I Walked with a Zombie (1943), and The Body <b>Snatcher</b> (1945)—is now highly regarded. Richard Dix concluded his lengthy RKO career with the 1943 Lewton production The Ghost Ship. Tim Holt was RKO's cowboy star of the era, appearing in forty-six B Westerns and more than fifty movies altogether for the studio. In 1940, Chester Lauck and Norris Goff brought their famous comic characters Lum and Abner from radio to RKO for a six-film run. The Falcon detective series began in 1941; the Saint and the Falcon were so similar that Saint creator Leslie Charteris sued RKO. The Falcon was first played by George Sanders, who had appeared five times as the Saint. He bowed out after four Falcon films and was replaced by his brother, Tom Conway. Conway had a nine-film run in the part before the series ended in 1946. Johnny Weissmuller starred in six Tarzan pictures for RKO between 1943 and 1948 before being replaced by Lex Barker.|$|E

25|$|Kojima's love of film is {{noticeable}} in his games {{where he}} pays homage through his stories and characters, sometimes {{to the point}} of pastiche, as in <b>Snatcher.</b> He cited a contrast between films and games as while in his games he intends to portray violence like in a movie, in the game {{it is up to the}} player to decide.

25|$|He also {{received}} inspiration from anime. His early works, particularly the cyberpunk adventure game <b>Snatcher</b> (which uses anime-style art), {{were influenced by}} cyberpunk anime, most notably Akira (mentioned above). In a recent interview, he mentioned that his Zone of the Enders series was inspired by mecha/robot anime, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Mecha anime were also an inspiration for the Metal Gear series, which features mecha robots, such as Metal Gear REX and Metal Gear RAY; this is referenced in Metal Gear Solid, where Otacon mentions mecha anime as an influence on his Metal Gear REX designs.|$|E
25|$|Blade Runner has {{influenced}} adventure games {{such as the}} 2012 graphical text adventure Cypher, Rise of the Dragon, <b>Snatcher,</b> the Tex Murphy series, Beneath a Steel Sky, , Bubblegum Crisis (and its original anime films), the role-playing game Shadowrun, the first-person shooter Perfect Dark, and the Syndicate series of video games. The film is also cited as {{a major influence on}} Warren Spector, designer of the computer-game Deus Ex, which displays evidence of the film's influence in both its visual rendering and plot. The look of the film, darkness, neon lights and opacity of vision, is easier to render than complicated backdrops, making it a popular choice for game designers.|$|E
25|$|Following , Kojima {{produced}} {{his next}} graphic adventure, Policenauts (1994), a point-and-click adventure notable {{for being an}} early example of extensive voice recording in video games. It also featured a hard science fiction setting, a theme revolving around space exploration, a plot inspired by the ancient Japanese tale of Urashima Taro, and some occasional full-motion video cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to <b>Snatcher,</b> but {{with the addition of}} a point-and-click interface and some first-person shooter segments. Policenauts also introduced summary screens, which act to refresh the player's memory of the plot upon reloading a save, an element Kojima would later use in Metal Gear Solid.|$|E

25|$|In , Kojima was {{involved}} in the productions of two MSX2 games: a spinoff of <b>Snatcher</b> titled SD Snatcher; and a sequel to Metal Gear titled , which further evolved the stealth game genre. The player had more abilities, such as crouching, crawling into hiding spots and air ducts, distracting guards by knocking on surfaces, and using a radar to plan ahead. The enemies had improved artificial intelligence (AI), including a 45-degree field of vision, the detection of various different noises, being able to move from screen to screen, and a three-phase security alarm. The game also had improved graphics and a complex storyline dealing with themes such as the nature of warfare and nuclear disarmament.|$|E
25|$|Hideo Kojima (of Metal Gear fame) was {{inspired}} by Portopia to enter the video game industry, and produce his own adventure games. After completing the stealth game Metal Gear, his first graphic adventure was released by Konami the following year: <b>Snatcher</b> (1988), an ambitious cyberpunk detective novel graphic adventure that was highly regarded at the time for pushing the boundaries of video game storytelling, cinematic cut scenes, and mature content. It also featured a post-apocalyptic science fiction setting, an amnesiac protagonist, and some light gun shooter segments. It was praised for its graphics, soundtrack, high quality writing comparable to a novel, voice acting comparable to a film or radio drama, and in-game computer database with optional documents that flesh out the game world.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, {{he stated}} {{he was working}} on a new {{intellectual}} property with Goichi Suda, tentatively titled Project S, and preparing new projects. On July 8, 2011, Kojima announced that Project S was a radio-show sequel to <b>Snatcher,</b> titled Sdatcher as a reference to the show's producer Suda. The show would air on Fridays on Kojima's bi-weekly Internet radio show, starting with episode #300 which was broadcast in August 2011. In October, Kojima announced that he would be collaborating with Suda and 5pb. director Chiyomaru Shikura in producing a new adventure game visual novel. It was initially speculated that the game would be the third entry in 5pb.'s Science Adventure series, but was later confirmed to be a separate title.

500|$|The North American {{version was}} {{released}} {{a month later}} on October 20. Changes and additions were made to this version, such as a choice of three difficulty settings when starting a new game (with a fourth setting that is unlocked after completing the game once), an alternate tuxedo outfit for Snake (which the character wears on every third playthrough on the same save file), and a [...] "demo theater" [...] mode where the player views every cutscene and radio conversations relevant to the main story. Jeremy Blaustein, who previously worked on the English localization of <b>Snatcher</b> for the Sega CD, wrote the English version of the script. One change in the English script was the addition of Western sources and authors to Mei-Ling's pool of motivational quotes; originally the character only cited Chinese proverbs natively, providing an explanation afterward in Japanese, but this prove difficult to adapt during the translation. The games detected by Psycho Mantis when he reads the player's memory card were also changed, due to certain titles (such as the Tokimeki Memorial series) not being released outside Japan. This resulted in Kojima's cameo (in which he thanks the player for supporting his work via a voiceover) being cut from the Western versions, as save data from two PlayStation titles not available outside Japan, <b>Snatcher</b> and Policenauts, needed to be present on the player's memory card for this Easter egg to appear.|$|E

Terminator 2 was {{the first}} external game {{to work with the}} Menacer, the only one confirmed as of December 1992. Terminator programmers, Probe Software, later began work on another Menacer-compatible game. Terminator 2 has a two-player mode that uses one Menacer light gun and one controller. Sega Force reported that Menacer gameplay registered faster than the Genesis controller. Mad Dog McCree, a live action Wild West shoot 'em up for the Sega CD, used either a controller or a choice of several light guns: the Menacer, the Konami Justifier, or the game developer's own compatible light gun. In the 1994 Body Count, the player defends Earth from an alien invasion. The Irish Times wrote that the game is [...] "ideally suited for the ... Menacer" [...] and is [...] "to be avoided" [...] otherwise. The Menacer is also compatible with Corpse Killer and American Laser Games' other titles, such as Who Shot Johnny Rock?
