5|$|Written by Chris Boucher, {{this story}} was, like The Dreamer of Phados, written to an idea brief from Holmes and Hinchcliffe. It {{was to be}} set on a space ship which has been home to <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> a civilization. The script was turned down on 30 October 1975.|$|E
5|$|Colt set up {{libraries}} and educational programs within his armories for his employees which were seminal training grounds for <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing {{efforts of the}} next half century. Prominent examples included Francis A. Pratt, Amos Whitney, Henry Leland, Edward Bullard, Worcester R. Warner, Charles Brinckerhoff Richards, William Mason and Ambrose Swasey.|$|E

5|$|Widespread {{travel by}} naturalists in the early-to-mid-19th century {{resulted}} in a wealth of new information about the diversity and distribution of living organisms. Of particular importance {{was the work of}} Alexander von Humboldt, which analyzed the relationship between organisms and their environment (i.e., the domain of natural history) using the quantitative approaches of natural philosophy (i.e., physics and chemistry). Humboldt's work laid the foundations of biogeography and inspired <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> scientists.|$|E
5|$|Written by Chris Boucher, was {{submitted}} {{at some point}} after The Silent Scream had been rejected in early 1975. It {{was based on a}} premise that Hinchcliffe and Holmes wanted to use in which people and machines are controlled by a computer that malfunctions. It was to be set on a space ship which has been home to <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> a civilization.|$|E
5|$|Yet Moore had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> sculptors of both British and international reputation. Among the artists who have acknowledged Moore's importance to their work are Sir Anthony Caro, Phillip King and Isaac Witkin, all three having been assistants to Moore. Other artists whose work was influenced by him include Helaine Blumenfeld, Drago Marin Cherina, Lynn Chadwick, Eduardo Paolozzi, Bernard Meadows, Reg Butler, William Turnbull, Robert Adams, Kenneth Armitage, and Geoffrey Clarke.|$|E

5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|It passed {{onto his}} younger brother, George, who entertained Queen Anne and Prince Henry there in 1603, and onto George's grandson, Henry, who hosted James I three times between 1612 and 1617, and Charles I in 1634. The gardens were redeveloped, {{probably}} {{to provide a}} suitable venue for these royal visits. By now, however, <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> excessive expenditure meant that the family estates had been much diminished, and the family was having trouble maintaining their lavish lifestyle and former prominence in the region.|$|E
5|$|The Clemuel Ricketts Mansion (also {{known as}} the Stone House, the William R. Ricketts House, and Ganoga) is a Georgian-style house made of sandstone, built in 1852 or 1855 {{on the shore of}} Ganoga Lake in Colley Township, Sullivan County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It was home to <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> the Ricketts family, {{including}} R. Bruce Ricketts and William Reynolds Ricketts. Originally built as a hunting lodge, it was also a tavern and post office, and served as part of a hotel for much of the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|It {{was also}} widely {{believed}} that if Aboriginal people whose descendants had children with whites for <b>several</b> <b>generations,</b> successive <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> descendants would be less and less distinguishable from whites.|$|R

5|$|The final {{bearers of}} the Paralympic flame {{represented}} <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> Paralympic athletes. Joe Townsend, a Royal Marine who lost {{both of his}} legs after stepping on a land mine on duty in Afghanistan (who represented the future, as he plans to compete in Rio), delivered the flame to Olympic Stadium via a zipline from the ArcelorMittal Orbit tower. He passed the flame to long-time British Five-a-side football captain David Clarke, who then passed it to the lighter of the Paralympic cauldron, Margaret Maughan, who was the winner of Britain's first {{gold medal at the}} first official Paralympics, in Rome.|$|E
5|$|A {{strain of}} truly domesticated red foxes was {{introduced}} by Russian geneticist Dmitry Belyayev who, over a 40-year period, bred <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> silver morph foxes on fur farms, selecting only those individuals that showed the least fear of humans. Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a population of foxes whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included piebald coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.|$|E
5|$|Among Auerbach's accomplishments {{during his}} 20-year {{professional}} coaching career were eleven Eastern Division titles (including nine {{in a row}} from 1957–65), 11 appearances in the finals (including ten in a row from 1957–66), and nine NBA championships. With a total of 16 NBA championship rings in a span of 29 years (1957–86) as the Celtics coach, general manager, and team president, Auerbach is the most successful team official in NBA history. He is credited with creating <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> championship Boston Celtics teams, including the first Celtics dynasty with Bill Russell, which won an NBA record eight titles in a row (1959–66). As Celtics general manager, he created championship-winning teams around Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens in the 1970s and Larry Bird in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{focus of}} physics of failure {{techniques}} {{tended to be}} limited to degradation mechanisms in integrated circuits. This was primarily because the rapid evolution of the technology created a need to capture and predict performance <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> ahead <b>of</b> existing product.|$|R

5|$|During World War II, Jasienica (then, Leon Beynar) {{fought in}} the Polish Army, and later, the Home Army resistance. Near {{the end of the}} war, he was also working with the anti-Soviet resistance, which later led to him taking up a new name, Paweł Jasienica, to hide from the {{communist}} government of the People's Republic of Poland. He was associated with the Tygodnik Powszechny weekly and several other newspapers and magazines. He {{is best known for his}} 1960s books on Polish historyon the Kingdom of Poland under the Piast Dynasty, the Jagiellon Dynasty, and the elected kings of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Those books, still popular, played an important role in popularizing Polish history among <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> readers.|$|E
5|$|Possession of Bodiam Castle {{passed through}} <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> Dalyngrigges, until their line became extinct, when the castle passed by {{marriage}} to the Lewknor family. During the Wars of the Roses, Sir Thomas Lewknor supported the House of Lancaster, and when Richard III of the House of York became king in 1483, a force was despatched to besiege Bodiam Castle. It is unrecorded whether the siege went ahead, but {{it is thought that}} Bodiam was surrendered without much resistance. The castle was confiscated, but returned to the Lewknors when Henry VII of the House of Lancaster became king in 1485. Descendants of the Lewknors owned the castle until at least the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Tunnels, {{originally}} {{built for}} water drainage, passed beneath the railroad and ran between the Thompson Block and the businesses on Cross Street, and {{were used as}} hiding places by escaped slaves, who hid by day and then rode boats down the Huron River by night. Leonard Chase, a known abolitionist, also operated a station on the Underground Railroad from 1841 to 1860, hiding escaped slaves in his home near the depot. Also during the American Civil War, the Norris Block {{was used as a}} barracks by two regiments: the Fourteenth Michigan Infantry Regiment in early 1862, and the Twenty-Seventh Michigan Infantry Regiment in 1863. Oliver E. Thompson bought the building in 1869, and as it passed down through <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> the Thompson family, it eventually became known as the Thompson Block.|$|E
50|$|After the Spanish {{conquest of}} the Aztec Empire, the area became part of an encomienda given to Juan Salcedo, with the family {{controlling}} the lands for <b>several</b> <b>generations.</b> Evangelization <b>of</b> the same area {{was done by the}} Augustinians starting in 1537 and constructed the first hermitage here.|$|R
50|$|With Julius von Hann (1839-1921), he was {{the author}} of the Hann/Süring: Lehrbuch der Meteorologie, a {{textbook}} that was used for <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> by students <b>of</b> meteorology.|$|R
5000|$|Westermann Verlag (English: [...] "Westermann Publishing") is a German {{publishing}} firm, {{founded in}} the 19th century in Braunschweig, Duchy of Brunswick by George Westermann (23 February 1810 in Leipzig; 7 September 1879 in Wiesbaden). <b>Several</b> other <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> the Westermann family succeeded him.|$|R
5|$|Simulations suggest that, {{while the}} disk had a {{relatively}} high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tenths of a percent) {{of the mass of}} Jupiter captured from the Solar nebula was processed through it. However, the disk mass of only 2% that of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites. Thus there may have been <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> Galilean-mass satellites in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons would have spiraled into Jupiter, due to drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the Solar nebula. By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned out {{to the point that it}} no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits. The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io.|$|E
5|$|Sir Thomas Lewknor was a {{supporter}} of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses, which began in 1455. When Richard of the House of York ascended to the throne as Richard III in 1483, Lewknor was accused of treason and of raising men-at-arms in southeast England. In November 1483, Lewknor's uncle and Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, were given permission to levy men and besiege Bodiam Castle, where Lewknor was based. It is not recorded whether the siege went ahead, and Thackray suggests that Lewknor surrendered without much resistance. His property was confiscated, and Nicholas Rigby was made constable of the castle. On Henry VII's accession to the English throne the attainder was revoked, and Bodiam Castle was returned to Lewknor. However, not all the surrounding land was returned to the family until 1542. Possession of Bodiam Castle passed through <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> the Lewknor family. Although the inheritance of the castle can be traced through the 16th and 17th centuries, there is little to indicate how it was used in this period, or if the family spent much time in it.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the Cliffords began {{spending}} more time at their other castles, particularly Skipton Castle in Yorkshire. Brougham descended through <b>several</b> <b>generations</b> <b>of</b> Cliffords, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, {{it was in a}} state of disrepair, as George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland was {{spending more}} time in southern England due to his role as Queen's Champion. The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King James I of England was entertained there in 1617. In 1643, Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estates, including the castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Brough, and set about restoring them. Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time, after Lady Anne's death in 1676; however, Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, who had inherited the Clifford estates, sold the furnishings in 1714. The empty shell was left to decay, as it was too costly to maintain. As a ruin, Brougham Castle inspired a painting by J. M. W. Turner, and was mentioned at the start of William Wordsworth's poem The Prelude, as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth's Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors. The castle was left to the Ministry of Works, in the 1930s, and is today maintained by its successor, English Heritage.|$|E
