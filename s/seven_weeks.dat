40|$|BACKGROUND—Pulmonary {{rehabilitation}} programmes {{have been}} shown to improve both exercise tolerance and health status in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The optimal duration for a pulmonary rehabilitation programme is, however, unknown. To assess whether the current pulmonary rehabilitation programme could be shortened a randomised controlled trial was conducted in 44 patients with COPD who were allocated to either a <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> or a four week course.  METHODS—Patients were randomised to either our standard <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> twice weekly outpatient based programme or a comparable but shortened four week course. They were assessed at baseline and at completion by the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ), the Breathing Problems Questionnaire (BPQ), the incremental shuttle walking test (SWT), and the treadmill endurance test (TET).  RESULTS—Twenty one patients (61 % men) of mean (SD) age 68 (9. 2) years and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 1. 08 (0. 4) l completed a conventional <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> course and 23 (67 % men) of mean (SD) age 69 (8. 8) years and FEV 1 1. 03 (0. 3) l completed a shortened four week course. Patients who completed the <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> rehabilitation programme had greater improvements in all outcome measures than those undertaking the four week course. These differences reached clinical and statistical significance for the total CRQ score, which was the primary outcome variable (mean difference (95 % confidence intervals (CI) of difference) - 0. 61 (- 0. 15 to - 1. 08), p< 0. 05), and the CRQ domains of dyspnoea (- 0. 80 (95 % CI - 0. 13 to - 1. 48), p< 0. 05), emotion (- 0. 89 (95 % CI - 0. 33 to - 1. 45), p< 0. 005), and mastery (- 0. 84 (95 % CI - 0. 10 to - 1. 58), p< 0. 05). There were also trends towards greater improvements in exercise assessments in the <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> group but the differences did not reach statistical significance (SWT: mean difference - 16. 9 (95 % CI 24. 8 to - 58. 6), p= 0. 41; TET: geometric mean difference - 1. 21 (95 % CI - 0. 60 to - 2. 47), p= 0. 56).  CONCLUSIONS—A <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> course of pulmonary rehabilitation provides greater benefits to patients than a four week course in terms of improvements in health status. Larger prospective studies are required to determine the optimal duration of a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of Study {{one was to}} {{investigate}} the effects of a once per week strength and conditioning program conducted over a <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> period on golf swing performance and musculoskeletal screening measures. Study two focused on the quantifying the relationship between changes in musculoskeletal screening measures and golf swing performance that occurred after the <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> exercise program described in Study one. The current thesis adds to the current literature on the effectiveness of exercise programs in golf in several ways. It demonstrates that a once a <b>week,</b> <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> exercise program can be successful in improving a number of musculoskeletal screening measures, although no significant changes were detected for any golf swing performance measure. However, results of this thesis also provide some insight into what aspects of the exercise prescription may most contribute to improved golf swing performance. Results supported the importance of the trunk with improved trunk rotation range of motion and lateral trunk flexion endurance significantly related to accuracy and overall Combine test score, respectively. Collectively, these results suggests that golfers can obtain benefits with reduced strength and conditioning frequency and duration and that increases in trunk range of motion and muscular endurance may contribute to improved golf swing performance...|$|R

5|$|In the {{developed}} world, {{the majority of}} the poultry reared for meat is raised indoors in big sheds, with automated equipment under environmentally controlled conditions. Chickens raised in this way are known as broilers, and genetic improvements have meant that they can be grown to slaughter weight within six or <b>seven</b> <b>weeks</b> of hatching. Newly hatched chicks are restricted to a small area and given supplementary heating. Litter on the floor absorbs the droppings and the area occupied is expanded as they grow. Feed and water is supplied automatically and the lighting is controlled. The birds may be harvested on several occasions or the whole shed may be cleared at one time. A similar rearing system is usually used for turkeys, which are less hardy than chickens, but they take longer to grow and are often moved on to separate fattening units to finish. Ducks are particularly popular in Asia and Australia and can be killed at <b>seven</b> <b>weeks</b> under commercial conditions.|$|E

40|$|Age-related {{changes in}} the {{absorption}} and distribution patterns of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine were studied following oral or subcutaneous administration of 15 mg/kg of the drug combination in calves. Following oral administration, {{the time course of}} trimethoprim/sulfadiazine appearance and dissipation in serum, synovial fluid and urine was followed for periods up to 48 hours in calves one day, one week and six weeks of age. The profiles of drug appearance-disappearance in these body fluids were also determined after subcutaneous administration in <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> old calves. The peak serum and synovial fluid levels of trimethoprim/sulfadiazine achieved following oral administration were substantially lower with increasing maturation. In ruminating (six and <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> old) calves, subcutaneous or oral administration of the combination led to high serum levels of sulfadiazine but little or no serum trimethoprim was detected in animals at this age. The data indicate that, while therapeutic concentrations and optimum ratios of the drugs may be achieved for extended time periods in neonatal life, this dosage is unable to produce optimum serum and synovial fluid concentrations as the calves mature...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if occupational therapy combined with Lovaas therapy was more effective in treating fine and gross motor skills and sensory processing deficits in a child with autistic spectrum disorder, than Lovaas therapy alone. The subject was a four year old child diagnosed with autistic spec-trum disorder who was enrolled in Lovaas therapy through Wisconsin Early Autism Project. He was assessed with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales and the Sensory Profile. Test scores were compared after a <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> control period where Lovaas alone was provided and after a <b>seven</b> <b>week</b> intervention period where Lovaas and occupational therapy sensory integration activities were provided in combination. Results showed no overall significant changes in fine and gross motor skills and sensory processing skills, however there were areas of improvement in a few of the sub-systems measured. The significance of this study is that it points to an increased need for the exploration of the areas of occupational therapy interven-tion with and without collaboration for children with autism and autistic spectrum disorders...|$|R
