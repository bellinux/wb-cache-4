2500|$|Casting is a {{group of}} {{manufacturing}} processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The <b>solid</b> <b>casting</b> is then ejected or broken out to complete the process, although a final stage of [...] "cold work" [...] may follow on the finished cast. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that cold set after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. The oldest surviving casting is a copper Mesopotamian frog from 3200 BC. Specific techniques include lost-wax casting, plaster mold casting and sand casting.|$|E

In 2006 Nangle was awarded a Fellowship at Wheaton arts and Cultural Center. Nangle made one of the largest blown glass soda bottles along with glass artist Deborah Czeresko. Nangle produced a line of sculptures for the artist H.R. Giger (until his death) with whom he worked closely with at his studio outside of Zurich, Switzerland. Outcaststudios is Located in a 120 year old Foundry in the Kensington section of Philadelphia, the foundry has been in use for over 100 years producing general castings in bronze and brass. In 2011 WHYY in Philadlephia interviewed Nangle at the foundry about his work. In 2012 Nangle launched his second company, a joint venture, that produces a line of architectural glass castings, located in New York City. In 2013 Nangle started his third venture [...] "Deadman Guitar" [...] which specializes in producing cast aluminium neck through body guitars, a variation on a design immortalized by the late Clifford Travis Bean. Nangle's Bass Guitar design instead uses a <b>solid</b> <b>casting</b> providing a neck-through body design that is paired with all hand made components including, Purple Heart Wood fretboards, stainless steel frets and custom tuning machines. The transducers are hand made by Lindy Fralin. Nangle's design allows the end user to [...] "customize" [...] the shape of the instruments body due to its modular construction. The body cavity of the instrument is naturally shielded, as it is also cast in aluminum, whose structure also blocks electromagnetic interference. Nangle's artwork deals with themes of: Not drawing a distinction between fine art and craft, contrasting materials, science and mathematics.|$|E

40|$|Rapid Slurry Forming (RSF) is a {{new process}} for {{manufacturing}} of cast components. The process is based on enthalpy exchange between at least two alloy systems having different enthalpies. The aim is to get semi-solid slurry.

It is not necessary to accurately control the heat flux to surrounding media such as crucible or mould. Globular microstructure of primary aluminum dendrites could thus be achieved by RSF process which ensure improved foundry characteristics. The results indicate that the RSF process is suitable for producing high quality metal slurries economically which may be a break through for semi – <b>solid</b> <b>casting</b> processes...|$|E

40|$|Modelling and {{targeted}} experimentation {{are used to}} quantify the processing conditions which cause recrystallization in a single-crystal superalloy. The plasticity needed is traced to the differential thermal contractions of the metal and its ceramic mould during processing. For typical cooling rates, the plasticity causing recrystallization is induced above 1000 °C, thus over a temperature interval of approximately 300 °C after solidification is complete. The total accumulated plastic strain needed for recrystallization {{is estimated to be}} in the range of 2 - 3 %. Modelling is used to rationalize the influence of mould thickness, stress concentration factor and geometry on the induced plasticity. Negligible plastic strains were predicted in a <b>solid</b> <b>casting</b> with no stress concentration features, as found experimentally. However, recrystallization occurred in thin-walled sections, particularly beneath shroud-like features due to the plasticity induced there. The model provides the foundation for a systems-based approach which enables recrystallization to be predicted and thus avoided in new designs of turbine blade aerofoil. © 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.
