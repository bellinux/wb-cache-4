50|$|During the Cold War, the British {{government}} {{proposed a}} communications network that (it was hoped) would survive a nuclear attack. Radio stations (including the Heaton Park Tower) would maintain {{national and international}} communications before, during and after a nuclear emergency, transmitting microwave radio signals in a network known as Backbone. <b>Spurs</b> <b>feeding</b> into the network were provided at three location; London (BT Tower) , Manchester (Heaton Park Tower) and Birmingham (BT Tower (Birmingham)). Whether the plan for the Backbone network was realized is information protected by the Official Secrets Act 1911 but, during the planning process, HM Government denied in Parliament that there was anything secretive about the tower or its function.|$|R
2500|$|Spur 527 is a [...] spur {{route in}} Midtown Houston in the U.S. state of Texas. [...] The roadway is a freeway <b>spur</b> that <b>feeds</b> traffic from the Southwest Freeway (Interstate 69/U.S. Highway 59) into Downtown Houston.|$|R
50|$|Initially, WMATA {{engineered}} the Red Line to accommodate existing railroad uses in the corridor, bisecting the existing rail line and preserving {{many of the}} Metropolitan Branch sidings. In 1988, a decade after WMATA purchased and widened the active tracks, Montgomery County, Maryland purchased the Georgetown Branch of the B&O, a single track <b>spur</b> <b>feeding</b> into the Metropolitan Branch from the north, for transportation use including {{an extension of the}} Capital Crescent Trail. The remaining disused portions of the Metropolitan Branch spanned the distance parallel to the Red Line between the Georgetown Branch and Union Station, including sizable gaps north of Franklin Street, where the railroad had been widened by WMATA; the only available right-of-way for a trail in these areas was on adjacent parkland, or streets parallel to the railroad tracks.|$|R
50|$|However the {{collapse}} of the apple industry after 1945 and the growth of paved roads eroded traffic in the 1950s. After several years of application, the Dominion Atlantic abandoned most of the CVR lines in 1961. Tracks were cut back to Mill Village, (Steam Mill), 2 miles north of Kentville which became a <b>spur</b> serving <b>feed</b> mills and a fertilizer plant at Mill Village.|$|R
50|$|P. maidis are an {{economically}} important pest of maize. Infestations will physically damage the host plant because the insect breaks through the vascular tissue with its tibia <b>spur</b> and <b>feeds</b> on the sap exuded. The physical {{results on the}} plant includes wilting, yellowing of the leaves, stem weakness, and even death. Damage is more severe in young or drought-stressed plants. In addition to physical damage, P. maidis can also introduce mold and infection to the plant while piercing the tissues. P. maidis feeding behaviour alone {{can result in a}} 10-15% crop loss.|$|R
50|$|The {{pipeline}} system now {{consists of a}} total of 1185 km of high pressure gas pipelines, including 326 km of laterals. The main lateral spurs are the one to Port Pirie and Whyalla and the one to Angaston. The Angaston <b>spur</b> can also <b>feed</b> gas into the Riverland Pipeline owned by Envestra, which supplies gas to Murray Bridge, Berri and Mildura.|$|R
40|$|We present multi-wavelength (interferometer and single-dish CO J= 1 - 0, Halpha, {{broadband}} {{optical and}} near-infrared) {{observations of the}} classic barred spiral NGC 5383. We compare the observed central gas and dust morphology to the predictions of recent hydrodynamic simulations. In the nuclear region, our observations reveal three peaks lying along a S-shaped gas and dust distribution. In contrast, the model predicts a circumnuclear ring, not the observed S-shaped distribution; moreover, the predicted surface density contrast between the central gas accumulation and the bar dust lanes is {{an order of magnitude}} larger than observed. The discrepancies are not due to unexplored model parameter space or a nuclear bar but are probably due to the vigorous (7 solar masses per year) star formation activity in the center. As is common in similar bars, the star formation rate in the bar between the bar ends and the central region is low (~ 0. 5 solar masses per yr), despite the high gas column density in the bar dust lanes; this is generally attributed to shear and shocks. We note a tendency for the HII regions {{to be associated with the}} <b>spurs</b> <b>feeding</b> the main bar dust lanes, but these are located on the leading side of the bar. We propose that stars form in the spurs, which provide a high column density but low shear environment. HII regions can therefore be found even on the leading side of the bar because the ionizing stars pass ballistically through the dust lan...|$|R
50|$|This species likely has a {{lifespan}} of over 5 years. Sexual maturity {{is attained}} around {{three years of}} age or at a length around 110 millimeters. It grows in size and weight most rapidly in spring due to increased <b>feeding</b> <b>spurred</b> by the impending spawning season. It spawns over gravel in pools and riffles. Typically when spawning, one female is flanked on each side by two males. Once eggs are released and fertilized there is no parental care invested and they hatch after ten days.|$|R
50|$|The two spurs {{found on}} the back of a Diascia flower (from which it gets the common name twinspur) contain a special oil, which is {{collected}} in the wild by at least 8 species of bees of the genus Rediviva. The bees appear to have coevolved with the plants, as the females have developed unusually long, hairy forelegs with which they collect the oil from Diascia <b>spurs</b> to <b>feed</b> their larvae (and sometimes to line their nests with). The spurs vary in average length from 5.3 mm to as much as 13.9 mm, mainly between species (although those of D. capsularis can vary widely between populations); the bees' forelegs vary similarly. The spurs of Diascia longicornis are about 25 mm in length, but the existence of a suitably equipped pollinator, Rediviva emdeorum, with forelegs of the same length, was only confirmed in the 1980s. Rediviva longimanus has also been observed pollinating D. longicornis in the Western Cape.|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{research}} was to determine the response of green catfish (Hemibagrus nemurus) fry on the use of chickpea leaves (Vigna sinensis) fermented in the <b>feed</b> to <b>spurred</b> growth and <b>feed</b> efficiency and to find out the best given percentage of chickpea leaves to the maximum growth of green catfish fry. This research used Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with one factor, five treatments and three replications. The substitution ratio of soybean flour with chickpea leaves flour were P 1 = 100 % : 0 %; P 2 = 95 % : 5 %; P 3 = 90 % : 10 %; P 4 = 85 % : 14 % and P 5 = 80 % : 20 %. The parameters were observed concsist of digestibility of feed, feed efficiency, protein retention and specific growth rate of green catfish fry. The result showed that the chickpea leaves fermented in feed can replace soybean flour as a protein source in green catfish feed. The treatment in P 4 (85 % - 15 %) were the best treatment with digestibility of feed 45, 95 %, feed efficiency 34, 25 %, protein retention 26, 98 % specific growth rate 4, 18 % and for feed cost analysis was Rp. 796...|$|R
