The square welds are the most economical for pieces thinner than 3/8”, because they don’t require the edge to be prepared. [...] Double-groove welds are the most economical for thicker pieces because they require less weld material and time. The use of fusion welding is common for closed single-bevel, closed <b>single</b> <b>J,</b> open <b>single</b> <b>J,</b> and closed double J butt joints. The use of gas and arc welding is ideal for double-bevel, closed double-bevel, open double-bevel, single-bevel, and open single-bevel butt welds.|$|R

40|$|A 66 -year-old male {{patient was}} {{referred}} to our hospital for bilateral renal pelvic tumors. Ureteroscopic biopsy revealed urothelial carcinoma (UC) of low grade (G 1) of the renal pelvis. Renal sparing treatment with systemic chemotherapy and percutaneous tumor resection was performed. However, during subsequent follow up, a recurrent tumor was foundon the left ureter. After ureteroscopic laser ablation of the tumor, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) perfusion therapy (once a week, total 6 weeks) was performed via a <b>single</b> <b>J</b> ureteral catheter with no adverse events. Later, another recurrent recurrence {{was found on the}} right ureter, and was managed by ureteroscopic laser ablation followed by BCG perfusion therapy via a <b>single</b> <b>J</b> ureteral catheter. However, the patient developed high fever with chill from the day after initial BCG perfusion therapy on the right side. Although we started antibiotics, high fever continued. Then antituberculous drugs were administered and his condition was improved. Computed tomographic scan revealeda right renal mass 57 mm in diameter, which was consistent with tuberculous granuloma. The tuberculous granuloma persisted despite the continuation of anti-tuberculous drugs. In exceptional cases of upper tract UC such as single kidney andbilateral tumor, BCG perfusion therapy has been usedas adjunctive treatment to cure or prevent UC. However, dosages and administration methods of BCG perfusion therapy for upper tract UC still remain to be standardized.
