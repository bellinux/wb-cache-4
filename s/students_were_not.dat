5|$|Early {{on in the}} school's history, the Vanderlips {{decided to}} change the school's system from the Montessori method to a more formal {{approach}} with more discipline, although students still had more freedom than the average school. In the 1930s, the school was considered progressive: <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> graded and were instructed to work at their own speed. As enrollment grew, another building was built for younger children, which burnt down in 1959. In addition, a lunchroom, shop, and studio were built early in the school's history. Frank Vanderlip enjoyed teaching simplified political economy at the school; he would act out Swiss Family Robinson on an imaginary island with students to demonstrate the development of capitalism. Narcissa Vanderlip ran the school lunchroom, and it is recorded that she served good simple food. She named some of her foods artistically (rice pudding with raisins was called Bête Noire a la Bolshevik).|$|E
5|$|In mid-1967, New York City mayor John Lindsay {{sought to}} develop closer ties {{with leaders of}} impoverished neighborhoods. Prompted in part by {{concerns}} voiced by the New York Police Department (NYPD), the mayor dispatched one of his aides, Barry Gottehrer, to meet with Clarence13X. Belying his fearsome reputation, Clarence13X had a congenial meeting with Gottehrer, during which he requested more bus routes and school funding. Clarence13X subsequently attended a meeting of black leaders at Gracie Mansion, the mayor's official residence. The city provided buses for Five Percenters to travel to a Long Island park, and {{with help from the}} National Urban League, obtained an abandoned storefront for use as a school. It became known as the Allah School in Mecca and aimed to prepare young people for college preparatory schools. Tensions soon formed between the Five Percenters and the school's overseers; Clarence13X desired more control over the curriculum and had difficulty finding qualified teachers. Police regularly visited the school to ensure that the <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> being radicalized. In 1975, Gottehrer chronicled his friendship with Clarence13X in The Mayor's Man. The book was well received by some Five Percenters, who republished portions of it after it went out of print. They have not reprinted the entire book, owing to a passage in which Gottehrer relates that Clarence13X offered to allow him to sleep with his teenage daughter.|$|E

Therefore, the analysis of the inability to resolve the word problem needs to be conducted to determine the students' problem-solving process in solving word problems.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1962 Littleton once again {{traveled}} to Europe, this time to research how glass was taught in universities there. He found nothing that he could bring back to the U.S. to help him educate art students at the University of Wisconsin. At that time, European glass programs were geared solely toward industrial production. <b>Students</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> taught hands-on techniques with the material; the craft of working with hot glass was still taught at the factories, under the apprenticeship system. What Littleton did find in Europe was a kindred spirit in glass art, the German Erwin Eisch, who is recognized today as a founder of European studio glass. [...] Eisch {{had set up a}} small work area in his family’s glass factory in Frauenau for the production of his own glass art. [...] Trained as a fine artist in the academies of Germany, he was largely self-taught as a glass blower and at the time produced his work {{with the help of the}} factory’s craftsmen. The friendship begun when Littleton visited Eisch in Frauenau in 1962 lasted for the rest of Littleton’s life, and had profound influence on the work of each. [...] The two spent some of almost every summer together for the next thirty years.|$|E
