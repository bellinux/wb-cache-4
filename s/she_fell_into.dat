5|$|Upon {{the end of}} World War I and {{withdrawal}} of the Armed Forces of Central powers, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> {{the hands of the}} Whites under the support of the Triple Entente in November 1918. She had her engines sabotaged in April 1919 by order of the British when the Whites temporarily lost control of Sevastopol. She was further damaged by the explosion of a mine when the Whites abandoned the Crimea in 1920. Once <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> Soviet hands she spent several years under repair, which required parts and material from her sisters that were even more damaged. She was given the proper revolutionary name of Komintern, after the Communist International on 31 December 1922 and was recommissioned in June 1923.|$|E
5|$|Rice {{returned}} to the Catholic Church in 1998 after decades of atheism. On December 14, 1998, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a coma, later determined {{to be caused by}} diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and nearly died. She was later diagnosed with Diabetes mellitus type 1, and is now insulin-dependent. In 2003, following the recommendation of her husband and shortly after his death, Rice underwent gastric bypass surgery and shed 103 pounds.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptologist Wilfried Seipel has {{proposed}} that this pyramid was initially intended for queen Meresankh IV, whom he and Verner {{see as a}} wife of Djedkare. Seipel contends that Meresankh was finally buried in a smaller mastaba in Saqqara North after <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> disgrace. Alternatively, Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton have proposed {{that she was a}} wife of the preceding king, Menkauhor Kaiu.|$|E
60|$|Venetia {{tried to}} rise; her limbs refused their office; <b>she</b> tottered; <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> again <b>into</b> her seat with an hysteric cry.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> also <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> {{the arms}} of Grace, and kissed her with effusion; and John saw the sisterly union, which he had anticipated, auspiciously commencing.|$|R
60|$|The {{wife was}} advancing, but Vivian {{waved his hand}} to her to withdraw, and <b>she</b> {{accordingly}} <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the background; but her fixed eye did not leave her husband for a second.|$|R
5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} that she be treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E
5|$|On {{their return}} to Russia, they settled into a 200-room palace (the former Baryatinsky mansion) at 46 Sergievskaya Street (today Tchaikovsky Street), Saint Petersburg. The palace, a gift from Tsar Nicholas II to his sister, now houses the Saint Petersburg Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Olga and Peter had {{separate}} bedrooms {{at opposite ends of}} the building, and the Grand Duchess had her own art studio. Unhappy in her marriage, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> bouts of depression that caused her to lose her hair, forcing her to wear a wig. It took two years for her hair to regrow.|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, {{the storm}} {{produced}} a storm tide of 3.6feet (1.1m) above normal in Norfolk. Sustained winds peaked at 60mph (95km/h) in Langley Air Force Base, while gusts reached 71mph (114km/h) in Norfolk. The bands {{of the storm}} spawned an F1 tornado near Portsmouth and Chesapeake, damaging twelve homes and downing hundreds of trees. Damage from the tornado amounted to $250,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Rainfall from Doria was moderate, peaking at 6.44inches (164mm) at a location 2miles (3.2km) south-southeast of Halifax. One person drowned in Alexandria when <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a draining ditch. The storm severely damaged a large warehouse in Norfolk, as well. Damage in Virginia totaled $375,000 (1971USD, $ USD). Floodwaters from Doria clogged sewage systems near Norfolk, Virginia with sand and silt. This forced the sewage to be dumped into the Chesapeake Bay, resulting in the closure of several beaches for days.|$|E
60|$|In {{a minute}} or two, however, Amenche's {{attendant}} ran down the steps to Roger and, telling him to follow her, {{led the way to}} the apartment where the princess was waiting him. <b>She</b> <b>fell,</b> crying, <b>into</b> his arms.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{the lady}} had warmly grasped {{his hand with}} both of her own, which were imprisoned in tight new gloves, while her bonnet spoke of regardlessness of expense and recent prodigality. <b>She</b> <b>fell</b> back <b>into</b> the client's chair.|$|R
60|$|Before Evelyn {{could more}} than gasp he was gone. <b>She</b> <b>fell</b> limply <b>into</b> {{a chair and}} dropped her head into her hands. She must think, think; but the strain had been {{unbearable}} and the reaction threatened to overwhelm her.|$|R
5|$|Morgan {{learned to}} swim at Bankstown {{at the age}} of 7. She was {{initially}} slow to learn, and her coach used a long pole attached to a rope and belt to maintain her safety. This allowed him to fish her out of the water if <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> difficulty. Due to her slow learning, Morgan was given twice the number of lessons as the other students. At the age of eight, she won the district championship, and in 1953, aged 11, she won the New South Wales (NSW) Primary School Championships. In February 1956, aged 13, she was taken for serious training. Her father transferred her to the tutelage of Frank Guthrie in Enfield. At the time, Guthrie was {{regarded as one of the}} best coaches in the state; his students included Gary Chapman, Kevin O'Halloran and Lorraine Crapp. All three (plus Morgan) would win medals at the 1956 Summer Olympics. Her mother had to drive her to Enfield, as her father was busy with the plumbing business.|$|E
5|$|With Max Capricorn dead, the Heavenly Host divert to {{the next}} highest authority, the Doctor, and aid him in quickly {{reaching}} the bridge. Together with Midshipman Frame, he uses {{the heat from the}} entry into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's auxiliary engines. The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a teleport bracelet when <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the engine. In an emergency, the teleport bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but the machine is too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud {{in order to get a}} job with the company, teleport to Earth and find that the TARDIS has landed unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision. Mr. Copper is left to live on Earth with a credit card preloaded with Â£1,000,000, thanks to the Doctor.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} to Ramsay Street, Bridget makes friends with Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) {{and she joins}} his {{football}} team, despite opposition from bully Justin Hunter (Chris Toohey). Bridget joins Declan Napier when he begins joyriding. During a race with Justin, they are pursued by the police. They return home thinking they escaped, {{only to find the}} police waiting for them. Bridget is banned from seeing Declan, but she sneaks out to meet him at the park, where they argue. On her way home, Bridget trips and falls into the road in front of a car being driven by Susan Kennedy. Susan blacks out, a result of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and hits Bridget. She drives off, unaware of what she has done. Bridget is found and rushed to the hospital, where she undergoes emergency surgery for a bleed on her brain. She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot feel anything down the left side of her body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court. During a rehabilitation class at the swimming pool, Bridget meets Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). Following a disastrous date with Declan, where Bridget is given the impression that Declan cannot handle her disability, Bridget begins dating Josh. Following a roof collapse at an illegal dance party, Bridget and Josh are both trapped in rubble. Declan carries Josh out before coming back for Bridget. Another collapse traps Declan and Bridget together and Declan tells her that he does not have a problem with her disability. Shortly after, Bridget begins to walk without her walking aid and her mobility returns.|$|E
60|$|Winnifred, still half inanimate with fright, {{turned to}} her rescuer, and saw before her the form and lineaments of the Unknown Stranger, who had thus twice stood between her and disaster. Half fainting, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> swooning <b>into</b> his arms.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 90s, Bibie {{continued}} her career, but {{enthusiasm of the}} public for her songs {{was no longer the}} same. As many other French female singers of the 1980s such as Sabine Paturel or Desireless, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> again <b>into</b> anonymity.|$|R
60|$|Somebody {{opened the}} door with difficulty, and as {{it seemed to be}} very dark within Thomas struck a match, by the light of which Dorcas peered into the interior. Next second <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> back <b>into</b> his arms with a little scream.|$|R
25|$|Carson married Singing Grass. She {{tended to}} his needs, {{and went with}} him on his {{trapping}} trips. They had a daughter named Adaline (or Adeline). Singing Grass died after giving birth to Carson's second daughter. This child did not live long. In 1843, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a kettle of boiling soap in Taos, New Mexico. Waanibe died about 1841.|$|E
25|$|The late Novaya Gazeta {{journalist}} Anna Politkovskaya, who had negotiated {{during the}} 2002 Moscow siege, was twice prevented {{by the authorities}} from boarding a flight. When she eventually succeeded, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a coma after being poisoned aboard an aeroplane bound to Rostov-on-Don. American journalist Larisa Alexandrovna of The Raw Story has suggested that Politkovskaya might have been later murdered in Moscow because she had discovered evidence of the Russian government's complicity in Beslan.|$|E
25|$|Davison {{retired from}} her {{position}} as special {{officer with the}} Hawaii Humane Society in 1912 due to her illness. A trip to California with her sister Emma did little to improve her health and she returned to Honolulu {{a few weeks before}} her death. Two weeks before her death, she was strong enough to visit and inspect stables and barns on Oahu. <b>She</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a coma and died at her home in the MÄnoa Valley, on May 26, 1913.|$|E
6000|$|... "At last I heard a faint {{shouting}} {{that reached}} {{me through the}} wall of rock. I answered as loud as I could. You know the rest; and oh, my dear husband, thank God! thank God!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> weeping <b>into</b> my arms.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he shouted}} {{the same thing}} again, and yet again, but she never moved in her place; and at last he grew angry, threw the glass in her face, so that <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> back <b>into</b> the cart, for she was not tied in her place.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a cold-blooded}} barbarian it is! Don't hit a woman when she's down. Can't we do anything? She was simply {{dropping}} with starvation. <b>She</b> almost <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> my arms, {{and when she}} got to the food she ate like a wild beast. It was horrible." ...|$|R
25|$|When Anne-ThÃ©rÃ¨se was 15, tragedy {{struck the}} family {{when her father}} was killed by bandits as he {{traveled}} home to his family. The grief proved {{to be too much}} for her mother, who already had lost two children, and <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a deep and incapacitating depression. For many years, Anne-ThÃ©rÃ¨se accepted the responsibility of caring for her mother and sister, as well as the family's home and garden. At the age of 20, Anne-ThÃ©rÃ¨se asked her mother's blessing to join a religious order, but Isabelle â still unable to cope with her loss â refused. Five years later, Isabelle recognized the depth of Anne-ThÃ©rÃ¨se's devotion and permitted her to leave.|$|E
25|$|One day the moon, {{hearing of}} this, {{pulled on a}} black cloak over her yellow hair and went to see for herself. <b>She</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a pool, and a snag bound her there. She saw a man coming toward the pool and fought to be free until the hood fell off; the light helped the man make his way to safety and scared off the evil creatures. She {{struggled}} to follow until the hood fell back over her hair, and all the evil things {{came out of the}} darkness, trapping her under a big stone with a will-o'-the-wyke to sit on the cross-shaped snag and keep watch.|$|E
25|$|Julia {{died before}} a breach between {{her husband and}} father had become inevitable. At the {{election}} of aediles in 55 BC, Pompey {{was surrounded by a}} tumultuous mob, and his gown was sprinkled with blood of the rioters. A slave carried the stained toga to his house on the Carinae and was seen by Julia. Imagining that her husband was slain, <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> premature labor, and her constitution received an irreparable shock. In August of the next year, 54 BC, she died in child birth, and her infantâa son, according to some writers, a daughter, according to others,âdid not survive and died along with Julia. Caesar was in Britain, according to Seneca, when he received the tidings of Julia's death.|$|E
6000|$|Her mother {{persuaded her}} to go to bed, and watched by her. Through the day and half the night <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> {{continually}} <b>into</b> fits of shrieking, but cried in the midst of them to her mother, [...] "Don't be afraid. I shall live. I mean to live." ...|$|R
60|$|Eight, {{nine and}} ten struck from the tower-clock far away: she heard these sounds as in a dream. Tired, cold and hungry her {{vitality}} {{at that moment}} was at its lowest ebb--and, with her back resting against the wall <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> presently <b>into</b> a torpor-like sleep.|$|R
50|$|Plot : Josephine {{comes to}} the aid of Veronica, who is crushed under the debts of her husband. Having no money left, <b>she</b> {{eventually}} <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> prostitution.

25|$|On 4 July 1862, in a {{rowing boat}} {{travelling}} on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow {{for a picnic}} outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story. As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> a rabbit-hole. The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell asked Mr. Dodgson {{to write it down}} for her. He promised to do so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.|$|E
500|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} to the Far East Squadron (...) under Admiral Courbet when it was formed by the amalgamation of the Tonkin Coast and Far Eastern Divisions in June 1884 in preparation for the Sino-French War of 1884â85. In early September 1884 Atalante was in Huáº¿, but she carried Admiral Courbet to Keelung on 23 September. The ship was paid off into reserve in Saigon in 1885 and condemned two years later. <b>She</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> such a state of disrepair that [...] "she [...] one night and gradually sank into the mud." ...|$|E

Years {{after her}} death, Aaliyah said her grandmother supported {{everyone in the}} family and always wanted to hear her sing, as well as admitting that she [...] "spoiled" [...] her and her brother Rashad [...] "to death." [...] She also enjoyed Aaliyah's singing and would have Aaliyah to sing for her. Aaliyah stated that she thought of her grandmother whenever <b>she</b> <b>fell</b> <b>into</b> depression. Aaliyah's hands reminded her of her aunt, who died when she was [...] "very young" [...] and Aaliyah referred to her as an [...] "amazingly beautiful woman".|$|E
