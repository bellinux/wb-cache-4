40|$|Pharmacokinetics of {{a single}} gavage dose <b>of</b> 14 C-labeled <b>dihydrocapsiate</b> (10 mg/kg) were {{investigated}} in male rats. Maximal plasma concentration was achieved in 40 minutes and exhibited an apparent half-life of 2. 4 hr.

Highest tissue concentrations were achieved in the kidney, liver and blood; the data indicates accumulation of radioactivity in the tissues following daily exposure at these doses is unlikely. Radioactivity in the plasma was associated with several dihydrocapsiate metabolites and their conjugates (not dihydrocapsiate itself) probably vanillyl alcohol, vanillic acid, glucuronide of vanillyl alcohol, sulphate of vanillyl alcohol, and sulphate of vanillic acid.

40|$|Abstract:- Several {{languages}} for <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> {{various aspects}} of semantics, such as quality of service (QoS), of XML Web services have appeared recently. However, none of them is widely accepted by industry. On the other hand, WS-Policy (a general framework for the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> policies for Web services) has strong industry support, but currently lacks detailed <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> ontological meaning, QoS, and other important aspects of semantics. We propose extending WS-Policy with comprehensive <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> semantics of Web services. First, we discuss <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> semantics with policies.

In particular we focus on (a) contractually used components, (b) the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> components with variable contracts and interfaces, and (c) of quality of service. Interface descriptions including these aspects allow powerful static interoperability checks. Unfortunately, the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> constant component interfaces hinders the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> quality attributes and impedes automated component adaptation. This is because, especially quality attributes heavily depend on the components context. To enable the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> quality attributes, we demonstrate the inclusion of parameterised contracts within a component specification framework. These parameterised contracts compute adapted, context-dependent component interfaces (including protocols and quality attributes). This allows to take context dependencies into account while allowing powerful static interoperability checks. ...|$|R

40|$|A <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> {{mortality}} or survivorship provides respective explicit {{details about}} mortality’s or survivorship’s relationships {{with one or}} more other variables (e. g., age, sex, etc.). Previous studies have discovered and analyzed diverse <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> mortality or survivorship; these discoveries and analyses suggest that additional <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> mortality or survivorship have yet to be discovered and analyzed. In consistency with previous research, multivariable limited powered polynomials regression analyses of mortality and survivorship of selected humans (Swedes, 1760 – 2008) and selected insects (caged medflies) show age-specific, historical-time-specific, environmental-context-specific, and sex-specific mortality and survivorship. These analyses also present discoveries of hitherto unknown lifespan-specific, contemporary-aggregate-size-specific, and lifespan-aggregate-size-specific mortality and survivorship. The results of this investigation and results of previous research help identify variables for inclusion in regression models of mortality or survivorship. Moreover, these results and results of previous research strengthen the suggestion that additional <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> mortality or survivorship have yet to be discovered and analyzed, and they also suggest that <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> mortality and survivorship indicate corresponding <b>specifications</b> <b>of</b> frailty and vitality.

40|$|Abstract. Understanding the collaborations {{that arise}} between the {{instances}} of classes in object-oriented programs {{is important for}} the analysis, optimization, or modification of the program. Relationships have been proposed as a programming language construct to enable an explicit representation of these collaborations. This paper introduces a relational model that allows the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> systems composed of classes and relationships. These specifications rely in particular on member interposition (facilitates the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> relationship-dependent members of classes) and on relationship invariants (facilitate the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> the consistency constraints imposed on object collaborations). The notion of a mathematical relation is the basis for the model. Employing relations as an abstraction <b>of</b> relationships, the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> a system can be formalized using discrete mathematics. The relational model allows thus not only the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> object collaborations but also provides a foundation to reason about these collaborations in a rigorous fashion. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} publications, {{the authors}} have proposed an approach to the formal <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> real-time systems based on a principle of maintaining a separation of concerns.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate this approach by studying the <b>specification</b> <b>of</b> a lip synchronisation algorithm, firstly, using a classical timed LOTOS and, secondly, by using a new technique based on the principle of maintaining a separation of concerns. The paper highlights a number of benefits resulting from maintaining a separation of concerns.
