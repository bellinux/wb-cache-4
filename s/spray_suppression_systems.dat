This paper outlines parts of that work. Preliminary results were encouraging. The work has progressed to a second phase, which will include large-scale validation...|$|R
40|$|With halon phase-out, {{there has}} been a major thrust to find new {{advanced}} fire <b>suppression</b> <b>systems</b> in recent years.

40|$|A {{computer}} program for straylight <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> design and analysis {{was developed to}} analyze various proposed LST straylight <b>suppression</b> <b>systems.</b> Simultaneously, experimental measurements are being made on a simplified LST straylight <b>suppression</b> <b>system</b> in a unique facility. The experimental measurements {{are being used to}} verify and improve the {{computer program}}. The facility represents the state-of-the-art in straylight suppression measurements, and transmission factors of 10 to the minus 12 th power have been measured...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} fire {{benchmark}} water suppression tests were performed that may provide guidance for dispersal {{systems for the}} protection of high value assets. The test results provide boundary and temporal data necessary for water <b>spray</b> <b>suppression</b> model development and validation. A review of fire suppression in presented for both gaseous suppression and water mist fire suppression. The experimental setup and procedure for gathering water suppression performance data are shown. Characteristics of the nozzles used in the testing are presented. Results of the experiments are discussed...|$|R
