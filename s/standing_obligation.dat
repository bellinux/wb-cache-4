5000|$|Traditional Arab society, {{which is}} clan-based, {{strongly}} adheres {{to the concept}} of collective responsibility. Bedouins recognize two main forms of penalty for a crime against a member. These are blood revenge, referred to as Qisas (قصا, [...] "revenge") and blood money, Diyya (دية, [...] "blood money"/"ransom"). In cases of severe crimes such as murder and rape, blood revenge is the proscribed punishment. If a murder occurs, clansmen of the victim have the right to kill the murderer or one of his male clansmen with impunity. Certain crimes are liable for multiple acts of revenge, for example, the murder of women and children is avenged fourfold. Crimes considered treacherous, such as the murder of a guest, are also avenged fourfold. Alternatively, a crime punishable by blood revenge can be commuted to a severe fine if the family of the offended party agrees to it. Blood money is paid jointly by the clan of the offending member to the clan of the victimized member. Bedouins differentiate between crimes in which the group must pay as a <b>standing</b> <b>obligation</b> without reimbursement from the perpetrator of the offense, and crimes where the latter must reimburse them. Crimes where the clan is obligated to pay a joint fee without any reimbursement are murder, violent assault, or insults and other offenses committed during a violent conflict. The collective payment of fines for such crimes is viewed as a justified contribution to the welfare of the injured party, rather than a penalty to the perpetrator. Other offenses given a blood-price are crimes against property and crimes against honor. Concepts based on the Arabian laws of blood revenge and blood money are found in Islamic Sharia law, and are thus variously adhered to in Islamic states.|$|E

Problems to be addressed included inadequate equipment, poor broadcast location, insufficient funding, and a haphazard planning of station content.

50|$|Barako Bull {{was in the}} {{financial}} binge since 2009 after team management admitted that they are having difficulties in making the payroll of the team. The team even requested for a co-sponsorship with Harbour Centre {{for the duration of}} the 2010 Fiesta Conference to ease their financial difficulties. Alex Crisano and John Arigo even escalated the issue regarding their delayed salaries to then Commissioner Sonny Barrios. After Crisano went public with his accusations, team management did not renew his contract after the 2009-10 season ended and had difficulty in getting his back pay. Current members also expressed their grievances that their salary and their bonuses were not yet paid since December 2010, with some players as late as August 2010. Commissioner Chito Salud gave guidelines to Barako Bull for them to pay their <b>standing</b> <b>obligations</b> with the team members in lump sum.|$|R

40|$|Section A Similarities and {{contrasts}} During {{the years}} 1970 - 1976 Oman {{was once again}} a theatre of operations in which the Sultan's forces, supported by pro-Western powers, succeeded in defeating the insurgent forces seeking to destroy the established power structure of Oman. In many respects, the political configuration of this second war bore many close resemblances to the first 1. One had, as in the first campaign of 1957 - 1959, the active military participation of Britain; {{in terms of both}} leadership and the active involvement of British units (including the Special Air Service Regiment - SAS - who, as in the first Omani campaign, were to playa major role in the war). One also has the same motivation underlying British participation; viz. the determination to retain Oman's crucial strategic position (centring upon the Musandam Peninsula, and its control of the Straits of Hormuz). Moreover, as in the first Campaign, one observes the active participation of neighbouring states of the Middle East in support of the Sultan; in the war of 1957 - 1959 these states comprised the Trucial Oman States, to which Britain was closely related via long <b>standing</b> treaty <b>obligations,</b> and whose active military support was manifested {{in the presence of the}} Trucial Oman Scouts (TOS). In the latter Campaign of 1970 - 1976, the support emanated from Jordan and Iran. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the first attempt to study in detail. Thackeray's attacks on Bulwer in various {{periodicals}} and news-papers during the years 1837 - 47, and to consider how the ideals for novel-writing expressed in these, were later practised in his novels. Such previous discussion of the subject as there has been has concentrated on the personal rather than the literary implications, but Thackeray's attacks on Bulwer illuminate his attitude to the novels of his time, and to novel-writing in general. The introduction describes Bulwer's standing as a novelist {{at the time when}} Thackeray's attacks began, along with that of the different genres of novel he had attempted. Chapters I-III deal with three of these genres, respectively the Newgate, the fashionable, and the historical novel. The attitudes of the two writers to these genres are compared, and considered in the context of contemporary periodical criticism. Bulwer's various prefaces and revisions to his novels are discussed, and Thackeray's attitudes are revealed through his later treatment of similar themes, as well as through his attacks on Bulwer's treatment of such themes. Chapter IV deals with the two writers' respective semi-autobiographical novels, and, as well as contrasting their use of their material, considers their opposing views on the <b>standing</b> and <b>obligations</b> of their profession. Chapter V attempts to summarize Thackeray's ideals for novel-writing expressed in his attacks on Bulwer by showing how he held to them in the writing of his own novels. Appendix A lists the attacks chronologically, and Appendix B considers Thackeray's attitude to Bulwer's "fine writing. "<p...|$|R
40|$|This article {{begins to}} {{undertake}} a human rights analysis of {{the increasing number of}} migrants who die annually while trying to cross the borders of Europe in an irregular manner. Over the past 20 years, border policies increasingly focus on (pro-active, extraterritorial, privatized, and securitized) border management instead of on classical (reactive, territorial, and public) border control. On the basis of existing data, it seems plausible to assume that the increasing migrant mortality is an unintended side-effect of this shift from control to management. The article argues {{that it is possible to}} collect data, which are more reliable than those presently available, and presents data from a pilot project carried out on Sicily in November 2011. Presuming better data can be collected; two diverging human rights approaches are developed - a conventional approach holding that European states are not accountable under human rights law for these side-effects and a functional approach holding that human rights law does impose obligations on European states in this context. On all four doctrinal issues which are relevant to the problem (jurisdiction, positive <b>obligations,</b> <b>standing,</b> and collective state responsibility), these diverging approaches lead to diverging doctrinal positions. A choice between the two approaches implies not only legal but also moral, ethical, and political choices...|$|R
40|$|The {{governing}} {{bodies of the}} association of owners of (residential) units and their decision/making This thesis deals with the {{governing bodies}} of the asscociation of owners of (residential) units, their position in Czech legal order and their decision-making. Thesis is focused on the performance of decision making in practise and problems which are associated with it. It focuses primarily on the enactment of Act No. 72 / 1994 Coll., Act on ownership of (residential) units, including government regulation No. 371 / 2004 Coll., where are defined standard Articles of owners of (residential) units, which focuses on the problematic provisions or lack of legislation. The thesis consists of four chapters. The first chapter is introductory, there are defined goals of the work, postition of ownership of units in the Czech legal system, its historical development and definition of key terms. The second chapter describes the association of owners of (residential) units as a legal person, its origin, the rights and <b>obligations</b> <b>standing</b> in the legal system, including membership, which takes a closer view of the conditions, rights and obligations of individual members, and way of termination of membership. The third chapter describes the governing bodies {{of the association of}} owners of (residential) units. This [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{contributes}} to the ongoing debate regarding extraterritorial human rights obligations with a specific focus on development cooperation. Various international human rights instruments enshrine the obligation to take steps through international assistance and cooperation towards the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights, yet the legal <b>standing</b> of the <b>obligation</b> remains contested, {{and a number of}} gaps remain as regards our understanding and application of the obligation. This study first considers the legal foundations of the obligation of international assistance and cooperation, reaffirming its existence as a legal duty, not just a moral one. With reference to the output of treaty bodies, reports of UN Special Procedures and relevant academic commentary, the various aspects the obligation are clarified and placed within the context of international development cooperation. Specific extraterritorial duties in relation to the rights to education and health are also. identified. In order to provide contextual description of the obligation and means of its implementation, examination and comparison of development activities of American and British bilateral development agencies in Ghana is undertaken. Legislation, policies and activities of the United States and United Kingdom are explored to ascertain {{the degree to which they}} are consistent with elements of the obligation of international assistance and cooperation, and to assess the impact that their aid initiatives have on the exercise of the rights to education and health elsewhere. Although neither the US nor UK recognise the legal character of the obligation of international assistance and cooperation, there are some encouraging signs with regard to implementation of its various components. However, the analysis also makes apparent that as the obligation continues to evolve there remain a number of significant challenges to its acceptance and wider implementation.
