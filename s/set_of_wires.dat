5|$|Full-featured USB3.1 Type-C cables are {{electronically}} marked cables {{that contain}} a full <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> and a chip with an ID function {{based on the}} configuration data channel and vendor-defined messages (VDMs) from the USB Power Delivery 2.0 specification. USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5A and 3.0A over the 5V power bus in addition to baseline 900mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line or they can support the full Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.|$|E
25|$|Drums with {{cylindrical}} shells can be open {{at one end}} (as is {{the case}} with timbales), or can have two drum heads, one head on each end. Single-headed drums typically consist of a skin stretched over an enclosed space, or over one of the ends of a hollow vessel. Drums with two heads covering both ends of a cylindrical shell often have a small hole somewhat halfway between the two heads; the shell forms a resonating chamber for the resulting sound. Exceptions include the African slit drum, also known as a log drum as it is made from a hollowed-out tree trunk, and the Caribbean steel drum, made from a metal barrel. Drums with two heads can also have a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires,</b> called snares, held across the bottom head, top head, or both heads, hence the name snare drum. On some drums with two heads, a hole or bass reflex port may be cut or installed onto one head, as with some 2010s era bass drums in rock music.|$|E
5000|$|A {{precursor}} to the flip-top, the [...] "bail" [...] or [...] "Kilner" [...] closure was invented in 1859, where a lid with gasket was held by a wire harness and sealed by a separate <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Parallel ports send {{multiple}} bits {{at the same}} time over several <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A 110 {{block is}} a type of punch block used to connect <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> in a {{structured}} cabling system.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wiring</b> {{diagrams}} may {{be required}} by the electrical inspection authority to approve connection of the residence to the public electrical supply system.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "flip-top" [...] or [...] "swing-top" [...] {{consists}} of a plastic or ceramic stopper {{held in place by}} a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires.</b> Prior to the invention of the crown cork, this was the dominant method of sealing bottles that contained carbonated liquid.|$|E
50|$|The code {{is based}} on the method of moments {{solution}} of the electric field integral equation (EFIE) for thin wires and the magnetic field integral equation (MFIE) for closed, conducting surfaces. It uses an iterative method to calculate the currents in a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires,</b> and the fields that result.|$|E
50|$|At times, while {{songs were}} being sung by Agnes Bernelle, the curtain was an opaque surface, {{like a white}} chalk board, and at other times, the curtain became transparent, {{revealing}} {{a scene from the}} play behind (see photos, right). The curtain was suspended on a simple <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires,</b> and parted in the middle to reveal each scene.|$|E
50|$|Unable to {{overtake}} other trolleybuses - Trolleybuses cannot overtake {{one another in}} regular service unless two separate <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> with a switch are provided or the vehicles are equipped with off-wire capability, with the latter an increasingly common feature of new trolleybuses.|$|R
50|$|A coil tap is a wiring feature {{found on}} some {{electrical}} transformers, inductors and coil pickups, all <b>of</b> which are <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> coils. The coil tap(s) are {{points in a}} wire coil where a conductive patch has been exposed (usually on a loop <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> that extends out of the main coil body).|$|R
50|$|The {{method was}} created by John Gaughan, who {{described}} how the trick works in US Patent #5,354,238. The illusion utilises a series <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> controlled by a complex computer-controlled rig above the stage. In the glass box demonstration, {{the top of the}} box is threaded between the two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> in a vertical position.|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s, {{to solve}} {{communication}} problems between different control systems in cars, the German company Robert Bosch GmbH first developed the Controller Area Network (CAN). The concept of CAN was that every device can be {{connected by a}} single <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires,</b> and every device that is connected can freely exchange data with any other device. CAN soon migrated into the factory automation marketplace (with many others).|$|E
50|$|Concurrent {{computing}} developed out {{of earlier}} work on railroads and telegraphy, from the 19th and early 20th century, and some terms date to this period, such as semaphores. These arose {{to address the}} question of how to handle multiple trains on the same railroad system (avoiding collisions and maximizing efficiency) and how to handle multiple transmissions over a given <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> (improving efficiency), such as via time-division multiplexing (1870s).|$|E
5000|$|Instead of {{the energy}} needed to move the {{controls}} being supplied by an external hydraulic supply, it is supplied over normal electrical wiring, albeit larger wiring than what would {{be found in a}} fly-by-wire system. The speed of the motion is controlled through the use of pulse-code modulation. The result is a [...] "power-by-wire" [...] system, where both the control and energy are sent through a single <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|E
50|$|Trailing {{switches}} (where two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> merge) do {{not require}} action by the operator. The frog runners are pushed into the desired position by the trolley shoe, or the frog is shaped so the shoe is guided onto the exit wire without any moving parts.|$|R
50|$|In the sci-fi {{television}} series Fringe, human/machine hybrids utilize a device which {{consist of a}} control box attached to two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> with three prongs on the ends. The prongs are inserted {{on the roof of}} victims and shapeshifters mouth and when switched on, the shapeshifter will be able to acquire the shape and form of the victim.|$|R
30|$|The {{proposed}} method {{consists of}} two procedures. The procedure for converting the wire matrix by considering the sums and differences <b>of</b> the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> two <b>wire</b> tensions <b>of</b> the DAMs is described first. The procedure for judging a candidate mechanism using the components <b>of</b> the <b>wire</b> matrix that relate the resultant forces and {{the combination of the}} sums <b>of</b> the <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> two <b>wire</b> tensions <b>of</b> the DAMs is presented in the following section.|$|R
50|$|In the inter-war {{years there}} was a tram service along Wellington Road {{operated}} jointly by Manchester and Stockport corporation. Stockport used 460v DC and Manchester 400 volts so the Manchester trams would need another resistance in the circuit. The Stockport trams {{would probably have been}} able to manage without swapping, they would just be on a slightly lower voltage. The trams stopped at the Levenshulme/ Heaton Chapel border so the resistances could be changed and the collectors manually changed from one <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> to the others.|$|E

50|$|The R4000 used a 64-bit {{system bus}} called the SysAD bus. The SysAD bus was an address and data {{multiplexed}} bus, that is, it {{used the same}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> to transfer data and addresses. While this reduced bandwidth, it was also less expensive than providing a separate address bus, which would have required more pins and increased {{the complexity of the}} system. The SysAD bus can be configured to operate at half, a third or a quarter of the internal clock frequency. The SysAD bus generates its clock signal by dividing the operating frequency.|$|E
5000|$|The Delay Skew test {{tests for}} the {{difference}} in propagation delay between the fastest and slowest <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> pairs. An ideal skew is between 25 and 50 nanoseconds over a 100-meter cable. The lower this skew the better; less than 25 ns is excellent, but 45 to 50 ns is marginal.(100 meters in a cable electromagnetic wave passes behind 334ns) ...|$|R
5000|$|Aesthetics - The jumble <b>of</b> {{overhead}} <b>wires</b> {{may be seen}} as unsightly. Intersections {{often have}} a [...] "webbed ceiling" [...] appearance, due to multiple crossing and converging <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> trolley <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{simplest}} NIDs {{are essentially}} just a specialized <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wiring</b> terminals. These will typically {{take the form}} of a small, weather-proof box, mounted on the outside of the building. The telephone line from the telephone company will enter the NID and be connected to one side. The customer connects their wiring to the other side. A single NID enclosure may contain termination for a single line or multiple lines.|$|R
50|$|The missile is {{launched}} {{from a simple}} metal box, which is connected to an operator station. An individual operator station can control up to 10 launcher boxes. The operator manually steers the missile {{by means of a}} small joystick. These course corrections are transmitted to the missile via a thin <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> that trail behind the missile - see MCLOS. Like many early ATGMs, the missile had a large minimum range (see AT-3 Sagger) due to the time it took to get up to flight speed and come under operator control.|$|E
50|$|The R5000 had an {{integrated}} L2 cache controller that supported capacities of 512 KB, 1 MB and 2 MB. The L2 cache shares the SysAD bus with the external interface. The cache was built with custom synchronous SRAMs (SSRAMs). The microprocessor uses the SysAD bus {{that is also}} used by several other MIPS microprocessors. The bus is multiplexed (address and data share the same <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires)</b> and can operate at clock frequencies up to 100 MHz. The initial R5000 did not support multiprocessing, but the package reserved eight pins for the future addition of this feature.|$|E
5000|$|Older cycling power meters use a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> to {{transmit}} power {{information to a}} computer mounted on the bicycle; this system has a serious disadvantage of having fine electrical cables being run all over the bicycle, making it harder to clean as well as using {{a fair number of}} fasteners to hold them up. However, since 2009 there is a general trend to move towards wireless systems. Power meters generally transmit data over ANT+ or Bluetooth protocols and can be paired to standard bike computers that display information about the power output generated by the rider ...|$|E
40|$|This <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> chamber planes shaped as a {{cylinder}} sector was installed inside the magnet of a polarized spin target modified to allow as well momentum {{analysis of the}} produced particles. The experiment (S 126) {{was set up by}} the CERN-Trieste Collaboration in the PS beam m 9 to measure spin effects in the associated production of of a positive kaon and a positive Sigma by interaction of a positive pion with polarized protons...|$|R
50|$|A large {{electrical}} substation {{is in the}} area, {{and power}} lines (Path 66 and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> connecting <b>wires</b> to Path 15) run through the town.|$|R
50|$|The baryton is a bowed string {{instrument}} of the viol family played in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. It has six or seven strings of gut, arranged over a fretted fingerboard, plus a lower <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> strings. When the gut strings are bowed, the wire strings vibrate sympathetically, enriching the tone. The wire strings may also be plucked by the performer's left thumb, creating a contrasting tonal quality. For full information, see baryton.|$|R
50|$|A flip-top, swing-top, or Quillfeldt stopper (after the inventor, Charles de Quillfeldt) {{is a type}} {{of closure}} {{frequently}} used for bottles containing carbonated beverages, such as beer or mineral water. The mouth of the bottle is sealed by a stopper, usually made of porcelain or plastic, fitted with a rubber gasket and held in place by a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires.</b> The bottle can be opened and resealed repeatedly and without the use of a bottle opener, with the wires acting {{in the same way as}} a latch clamp. The flip-top was the dominant method of sealing beer and mineral water bottles prior to the invention of the crown cork.|$|E
5000|$|While it {{is usually}} assumed that a supergun will {{automatically}} play JAMMA-compatible arcade boards, many systems support additional features not provided by JAMMA. The most common additional feature is wirings for extra buttons. This {{can be done with}} an extra <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> that directly connect the supergun to the arcade board (called a [...] "kick harness") or by wiring the extra buttons to some unused pins on the JAMMA connector itself. Regardless of the method used, these extra connections fall into the generic name JAMMA+. JAMMA only provides for three buttons per controller, but games requiring wiring for extra buttons have become common enough that many superguns support this out of the box as well.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{contender}} was General Electric's Penetron, {{which used}} three stacked layers of phosphor {{and attempted to}} change {{the power of the}} electron beam to write to the correct one. More common were attempts to use a secondary focussing arrangement just behind the screen to produce the required accuracy. Paramount Pictures worked long and hard on the Chromatron, which used a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wires</b> behind the screen as a secondary [...] "gun", further focussing the beam and steering it towards the correct color. Philco's [...] "Apple" [...] tube used additional stripes of phosphor that released a burst of electrons when the electron beam swept across them, by timing the bursts it could adjust the passage of the beam and hit the correct colors.|$|E
25|$|Keating's Lincoln Savings {{failed in}} 1989, costing the federal {{government}} over $3 billion and leaving 23,000 customers with worthless bonds. In the early 1990s, Keating was convicted in both federal and state courts of many counts of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. He served {{four and a half}} years in prison before those convictions were overturned in 1996. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to a more limited <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>wire</b> fraud and bankruptcy fraud counts, and sentenced to the time he had already served.|$|R
50|$|To {{complete}} the front dial display, two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> curved <b>wires</b> are mounted {{in front of}} the planisphere. One <b>set</b> <b>of</b> two <b>wires</b> indicates lines <b>of</b> equal altitude 36° and 59.5° and supplements the edge of the horizon plate (altitude 0); they cross a vertical north-south wire to indicate the sun's meridian altitude at the equinoxes and solstices respectively. The second set, in addition to the north-south element, forms a complete circle and the sectors of two larger circles; all four wires intersect at the centre of the horizon plate (nadir) and a point {{near the top of the}} north-south line (zenith).|$|R
