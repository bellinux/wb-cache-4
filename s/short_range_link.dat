40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{advocate}} to exploit terminal coop-eration to stabilize IP communication using header compression. The terminal cooperation {{is based on}} direct communication between terminals using short range communication and simulta-neously being connected to the cellular service access point. The <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>link</b> is than used to provide first aid information to heal the decompressor state of the neighboring node {{in case of a}} packet loss on the cellular link. IP header compression schemes are used to increase the spectral and power efficiency loosing robustness of the communication compared to the uncompressed version. By introducing the terminal cooperation supporting header compression the robustness is increased. Within this article we will show that header compression should be applied to reduce the energy consumption of the terminals and moreover the header compression should be supported by cooperation to increase the robustness in terms of a decreased packet loss rate.

40|$|Heterogeneous ad hoc {{networks}} are proposed {{as a solution}} to the scalability problem in pure ad hoc networks. Some of the links in heterogeneous networks have a much longer wireless transmission range (in one or more of their channels) than the other links. We study simple approaches for adaptive operation and performance optimization of such networks. Our study includes the following: (a) Use of very simple functions of observed performance for adaptive control; (b) Accommodation of an operational constraint imposed by a higher layer in the network. In this case, traffic from a forwarding node to a neighboring node, meant for an eventual destination, can be multiplexed over either long <b>range</b> <b>links</b> or over <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>links</b> but not both; (c) Route selection using extremely simple, predetermined criteria; (d) Performance comparison of the above three simplified approaches to the original algorithm of Reference [4].

40|$|Abstract — In {{this work}} a {{performance}} evaluation of network coding for cooperative wireless networks is carried out. Im-plementing network coding on commercially available mobile devices, the performance {{is presented in}} terms of throughput, delay and energy consumption. In contrast to purely cellular systems, where the mobile devices are only connected to the base station, in cooperative wireless networks, the mobile device, {{in addition to the}} cellular communication, establishes <b>short</b> <b>range</b> <b>links</b> to neighboring mobile devices within its proximity. In prior work {{it has been shown that}} the newly formed cooperative cluster, also referred as wireless grid, can offer each participating mobile device a better performance in terms of data rate, delay, robustness, security, and energy consumption in contrast to any stand alone device. To improve the performance within the cooperative cluster even more, network coding seems to be a promising technology as it decreases the number of packets to be interchanged among cooperative mobile devices leading to a decreased packet delay. The energy saved by fewer packet transmissions is confronted with the energy needed to carry out the network coding and related overhead. The findings of this paper show that network coding is always beneficial in terms of throughput and delay for the cooperative cluster. I...|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{modeling}} of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) scattering channels {{and the corresponding}} communication link performance. The research focuses on the channel impulse response and path loss models based on extensive field measurements and theoretical characterization. In NLOS UV scattering environments, transmitted signals suffer from severe atmospheric attenuation and fading before arriving at a receiver, such as absorption, scattering, and turbulence. The thesis is devoted to development of analytical and experimental models to characterize NLOS UV communication channels. The author conducts comprehensive channel measurements for <b>short</b> communication <b>ranges</b> up to a few hundred meters and proposes an empirical path loss model. Meanwhile, an algorithm is developed to simulate the NLOS UV channel impulse response and path loss based on photons stochastic migration in the atmosphere. Effects of atmosphere conditions on single scattering and multiple scattering are investigated. An empirical curve-fitting model is developed to simplify the modeling work. Monte Carlo simulations provide good channel prediction for field tests in many scenarios. Then <b>short</b> <b>range</b> communication <b>link</b> performance is studied based on the theoretical models, and limitations by power and channel bandwidth are examined. Link budget results are also extended to long <b>range</b> communication <b>links</b> up to 5 kilometers.

Another possible way of improving the <b>short</b> <b>range</b> optical interconnect is to used better, more advanced modulation formats. Advanced modulation formats {{in the context of}} <b>short</b> <b>range</b> optical communication are the topic of this thesis. A broad spectrum of modulation formats have been studied, starting with pulse amplitude modulation, through conventional subcarrier modulation, to a new class of three-dimensional subcarrier modulation. Although these modulation formats are very diverse, they also have one aspect in common; they can be implemented in systems using intensity modulation and direct detection. The modulation formats were investigated experimentally in an optical link using a directly modulated vertical cavity surface emitting laser as a transmitter, photodiode for direct detection in the receiver and multimode ber as the transmission medium. The relatively simple pulse amplitude modulation was the easiest one to implement at high bit-rates; 30 Gbps error free real time transmission was demonstrated. The subacarrier modulation is more complex and required o-line signal processing, however operation at bit-rates as high as 37 Gbps were demonstrated. Finally, modulation formats for IM/DD links with improved sensitivity were investigated, showing 0. 6 dB better sensitivity and the same spectral efficiency as OOK.
