5|$|The {{newly created}} xylem is the <b>sapwood.</b> It is {{composed}} of water-conducting cells and associated cells which are often living, and is usually pale in colour. It transports water and minerals from the roots to the upper parts of the tree. The oldest, inner part of the <b>sapwood</b> is progressively converted into heartwood as new <b>sapwood</b> is formed at the cambium. The conductive cells of the heartwood are blocked in some species, and the surrounding cells are more often dead. Heartwood is usually darker in colour than the <b>sapwood.</b> It is the dense central core of the trunk giving it rigidity. Three quarters of the dry mass of the xylem is cellulose, a polysaccharide, {{and most of the}} remainder is lignin, a complex polymer. A transverse section through a tree trunk or a horizontal core will show concentric circles or lighter or darker wood - tree rings. These rings are the annual growth rings There may also be rays running at right angles to growth rings. These are vascular rays which are thin sheets of living tissue permeating the wood. Many older trees may become hollow but may still stand upright for many years.|$|E
5|$|Trees {{chosen for}} nest holes have soft {{heartwood}} and tough <b>sapwood,</b> the former often due to parasites or diseases that weaken the tree's core. It {{is not certain}} how suitable trees are selected, {{although it may be}} by drumming, since woods with differing elastic modulus and density may transmit sound at different speeds. A Japanese study found nests in trees from many families; these included grey alder, Japanese white birch, Japanese hop-hornbeam, Japanese tree lilac, willows, Japanese larch and Sargent's cherry. The Mongolian oak and prickly castor-oil tree were rarely if ever used.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} also been {{identified}} in living <b>sapwood,</b> though it is latent at this time, and {{it is probable that}} it waits until the wood begins to die (when it is drier, but contains more oxygen) before the mycelia begin to grow. When the species was inoculated into living wood, it did grow, but only around the inoculation wound; the species did not spread as it would have done on dead wood. Another study found that the species actively colonised partially living branches, causing white rot. However, the species had little effect on the cambium, and was mostly limited to the ends of branches.|$|E
5|$|This ceiling conceals the mediaeval trusses of {{the fifteenth}} century ceiling. The wagon roof over the chancel was boarded or plastered, as slots in the {{principals}} show, in 1491 by William Stratford, DTh, Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey (in post 1476â€“1516, with gaps); the exact dating was derived from the timbers, which retain complete <b>sapwood.</b> The original ceiling can still be reached from the ringing chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch-braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five cross-ribs equally spaced on the soffit of the four-centred moulded arch. The truss had slots for the panels of a boarded ceiling (a wagon roof).|$|E
5|$|Daedaleopsis confragosa is a lignicolous fungus that {{produces}} a decay of <b>sapwood.</b> It causes white rot, a type of wood decay in which lignin is degraded and cellulose remains as a light-colored residue. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups, sometimes in tiers, in the wounds of living trees. Its preferred host is willow, {{but it has also}} been found on birch and other hardwoods. Fruiting usually occurs from June to December, but the hard shelves can persist year-round. In North America, the species is most common in eastern locales, but rare in western regions. It is common in Europe, {{and is one of the}} 100 most common fungi in the United Kingdom. Its European range extends east to the Urals. In Asia it is widely distributed, having been recorded from China, western Maharashtra (India), Iran, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|The beak of the kakapo {{is adapted}} for {{grinding}} food finely. For this reason, the kakapo {{has a very}} small gizzard compared to other birds of their size. It is generally herbivorous, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the <b>sapwood</b> of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kakapo food. It is particularly fond of {{the fruit of the}} rimu tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo has a distinctive habit of grabbing a leaf or frond with a foot and stripping the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter.|$|E
5|$|Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea {{superfamily}} {{attack the}} dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses {{and to make}} furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from {{the outside of the}} timber, but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the <b>sapwood</b> of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacture.|$|E
25|$|No {{definite}} relation {{exists between}} the annual rings of growth {{and the amount of}} <b>sapwood.</b> Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the <b>sapwood</b> is very roughly proportional {{to the size of the}} crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the <b>sapwood</b> must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. <b>Sapwood</b> is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.|$|E
25|$|In species {{which show}} a {{distinct}} difference between heartwood and <b>sapwood</b> the natural color of heartwood is usually darker {{than that of}} the <b>sapwood,</b> and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above). This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances, so that a dramatic color variation does not imply {{a significant difference in the}} mechanical properties of heartwood and <b>sapwood,</b> although there may be a marked biochemical difference between the two.|$|E
25|$|The term {{heartwood}} derives {{solely from}} its position {{and not from}} any vital importance to the tree. This {{is evidenced by the}} fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live <b>sapwood,</b> while in others the change comes slowly. Thin <b>sapwood</b> is characteristic of such species as chestnut, black locust, mulberry, osage-orange, and sassafras, while in maple, ash, hickory, hackberry, beech, and pine, thick <b>sapwood</b> is the rule. Others never form heartwood.|$|E
25|$|The timber may be {{attacked}} by furniture beetles, termites and powder-post beetles (<b>sapwood).</b> It is resistant to effective preservative treatments.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the insects}} {{of the forests}} have been {{reliably}} inventoried, but more than 70 species of insect are already inscribed {{on the list of}} species endangered in Sweden. The presence of dead wood favors the presence of numerous insects. Most of the forest insects live in the <b>sapwood</b> or between the <b>sapwood</b> and the bark. In particular, the Norway spruce and the English oak are the trees supporting the greatest richness in insects.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sapwood</b> {{is white}} {{with a light}} yellow tinge {{becoming}} creamy yellow on exposure and is not clearly differentiated from the heartwood.|$|E
25|$|Wood: Pale yellow, <b>sapwood</b> white; heavy, strong, very tough, hard to split, not durable {{in contact}} with the soil. Used for turnery. Sp. gr., 0.6353; weight of cu. ft., 39.59.|$|E
25|$|As a {{tropical}} species, it is frost sensitive. The pinnate leaves with opposite leaflets give a billowing {{effect in the}} wind. Tamarind timber consists of hard, dark red heartwood and softer, yellowish <b>sapwood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Different {{pieces of}} wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, {{particularly}} if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late {{in the life of}} a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and <b>sapwood.</b> In a large log the <b>sapwood,</b> because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no current}} {{commercial}} market for bigcone Douglas-fir wood due to limited distribution and access. It is heavy, hard, and fine grained but not durable. There is less <b>sapwood</b> than heartwood, {{and the latter}} contains pockets of resin.|$|E
25|$|Tamarind lumber {{is used to}} make furniture, carvings, turned objects, {{chopping}} blocks, {{and other}} small specialty wood items. Tamarind heartwood is reddish brown, sometimes with a purplish hue. The heartwood in tamarind tends to be narrow and is usually only present in older and larger trees. The pale yellow <b>sapwood</b> is sharply demarcated from the heartwood. Heartwood {{is said to be}} durable to very durable in decay resistance, and is also resistant to insects. Its <b>sapwood</b> is not durable and is prone to attack by insects and fungi as well as spalting. Due to its density and interlocked grain, tamarind is considered difficult to work. Heartwood has a pronounced blunting effect on cutting edges. Tamarind turns, glues, and finishes well. The heartwood is able to take a high natural polish.|$|E
25|$|When a tree is {{very young}} it {{is covered with}} limbs almost, if not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older {{some or all of}} them will {{eventually}} die and are either broken off or fall off. Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently, the <b>sapwood</b> of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of <b>sapwood,</b> because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sapwood</b> may {{range in}} colour from straw to grey-white with clear {{demarcation}} from the heartwood. The heartwood is golden to dark brown with chocolate growth rings. The timber is generally straight grained {{but may be}} wavy or interlocked. Quartersawn surfaces may produce an attractive fiddleback figure. The wood is lustrous and possesses a fine to medium texture.|$|E
25|$|Heartwood {{is often}} {{visually}} {{distinct from the}} living <b>sapwood,</b> and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings. For example, it is sometimes much darker. However, other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood, even in woody plants that do not form heartwood, which may lead to confusion.|$|E
25|$|This {{class of}} insects attacks living, dead, and felled trees, {{as well as}} sawlogs, green lumber, and stave-bolts, often causing serious {{economic}} loss from the pinhole and stained-wood defects caused by their brood galleries. The galleries are excavated by the parent beetles in the sound <b>sapwood,</b> sometimes extending into the heartwood, and the young stages feed on a fungus growth {{on the walls of}} galleries. The young depend on this ambrosia-like fungus for food, which is induced or controlled by the parent beetles.|$|E
25|$|Differences in {{moisture}} content between {{the surface and}} the centre (gradient, the chemical potential difference between interface and bulk) move the bound water through the small passageways in the cell wall by diffusion. In comparison with capillary movement, diffusion is a slow process. Diffusion is the generally suggested mechanism for the drying of impermeable hardwoods (Keey et al., 2000). Furthermore, moisture migrates slowly {{due to the fact}} that extractives plug the small cell wall openings in the heartwood. This is why <b>sapwood</b> generally dries faster than heartwood under the same drying conditions.|$|E
25|$|Secondary xylem is commercially {{important}} as wood. The seasonal variation in growth from the vascular cambium is what creates yearly tree rings in temperate climates. Tree rings {{are the basis}} of dendrochronology, which dates wooden objects and associated artifacts. Dendroclimatology {{is the use of}} tree rings as a record of past climates. The aerial stem of an adult tree is called a trunk. The dead, usually darker inner wood of a large diameter trunk is termed the heartwood and is the result of tylosis. The outer, living wood is termed the <b>sapwood.</b>|$|E
25|$|It is {{remarkable}} that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since {{in many cases}} it is hundreds, {{and in a few}} instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that <b>sapwood</b> may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.|$|E
25|$|After {{landing on}} a {{suitable}} tree, an ambrosia beetle excavates a tunnel {{in which it}} releases spores of its fungal symbiont. The fungus penetrates the plant's xylem tissue, digests it, and concentrates the nutrients on and near {{the surface of the}} beetle gallery. The majority of ambrosia beetles colonize xylem (<b>sapwood</b> and/or heartwood) of dying or recently dead trees, but some attack live trees. Species differ in their preference for different parts of trees, different stages of deterioration, and in the shape of their tunnels ("galleries"). However, the majority of ambrosia beetles are not specialized to any taxonomic group of hosts, unlike most phytophagous organisms including the closely related bark beetles.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} have been employed to clear or kill woody plants in savannas. Early pastoralists used felling and girdling, {{the removal of}} a ring of bark and <b>sapwood,</b> {{as a means of}} clearing land. In the 1950s arboricides suitable for stem injection were developed. War-surplus heavy machinery was made available, and these were used for either pushing timber, or for pulling using a chain and ball strung between two machines. These two new methods of timber control, along with the introduction and widespread adoption of several new pasture grasses and legumes promoted a resurgence in tree clearing. The 1980s also saw the release of soil-applied arboricides, notably tebuthiuron, that could be utilised without cutting and injecting each individual tree.|$|E
25|$|Movement {{of water}} {{takes place in}} these passageways in any direction, {{longitudinally}} in the cells, as well as laterally from cell to cell until it reaches the lateral drying surfaces of the wood. The higher longitudinal permeability of <b>sapwood</b> of hardwood is generally caused {{by the presence of}} vessels. The lateral permeability and transverse flow is often very low in hardwoods. The vessels in hardwoods are sometimes blocked by the presence of tyloses and/or by secreting gums and resins in some other species, as mentioned earlier. The presence of gum veins, the formation of which is often a result of natural protective response of trees to injury, is commonly observed on the surface of sawn boards of most eucalypts. Despite the generally higher volume fraction of rays in hardwoods (typically 15% of wood volume), the rays are not particularly effective in radial flow, nor are the pits on the radial surfaces of fibres effective in tangential flow (Langrish and Walker, 1993).|$|E
25|$|Wood {{surfaces}} are occasionally affected by various organic and inorganic stains. Sometimes such stains enhance the colour and appearance of wood. For example, oak wood {{affected by the}} beef-steak fungus has a deep rich, attractive, brown colour {{and there is no}} reason to remove the stain from the wood prior to finishing. The same applies to spalted wood whose attractive appearance is again caused by fungi. On the other hand some fungal stains and those caused by the reaction of iron with wood can disfigure wood. These stains can be removed from wood using bleach. Bleaches are also occasionally used to reduce the difference in colour between lighter <b>sapwood</b> and heartwood and also colour variation within heartwood. Such bleaching make it easier to achieve a uniformly coloured wood when the wood is subsequently coloured with pigmented stains and dyes (see below). Furthermore, the natural colours of wood fade when wood is exposed to sunlight, and more permanent colours can be created by bleaching wood to remove its natural colour and then re-colouring the wood using artificial, light-fast, stains.|$|E
25|$|After {{the tree}} {{to be used}} for the totem pole is selected, it is cut down and moved to the carving site, where the bark and outer layer of wood (<b>sapwood)</b> is removed. Next, the side of the tree to be carved is chosen and the back half of the tree is removed. The center of the log is {{hollowed}} out to make it lighter and to keep it from cracking. Early tools used to carve totem poles were made of stone, shell, or bone, but beginning in the late 1700s, the use of iron tools made the carving work faster and easier. In the early days, the basic design for figures may have been painted on the wood to guide the carvers, but today's carvers use paper patterns as outlines for their designs. Carvers use chain saws to make the rough shapes and cuts, while adzes and chisels are used to chop the wood. Carvers use knives and other woodworking tools to add the finer details. When the carving is complete, paint is added to enhance specific details of the figures.|$|E
500|$|Trees {{that are}} {{infected}} by A.luteobubalina show characteristic symptoms both {{above and below}} ground. Above the ground, {{the base of the}} tree develops inverted V-shaped lesions, and the infected wood undergoes white rot, a fungal wood decay process where the cellulose and lignin of the <b>sapwood</b> are both broken down, leaving the wood stringy. The bark of the stem dies and becomes discoloured up to [...] above the ground. Clusters of fruit bodies appear {{at the base of the}} tree in autumn. Crowns may show gradual deterioration, or tree death may occur suddenly. Below the ground, characteristic symptoms of infections include rotting the ends of tree roots, white-rotted <b>sapwood,</b> and the presence of fan-shaped areas of white mycelium below dead or infected bark.|$|E
500|$|Eggs are {{deposited}} between bark crevices, flakes, or {{cracks and}} hatch {{about two weeks}} later. Eggs are approximately [...] in diameter, and are initially white, but later turn reddish-brown if fertile. After hatching, larvae chew through the bark to the inner phloem, cambium, and outer xylem where they feed and develop. Emerald ash borer has four larval instars. By feeding, larvae create long serpentine galleries. Fully mature fourth-instar larvae are [...] long. In fall, mature fourth-instars excavate chambers about [...] into the <b>sapwood</b> or outer bark where they fold into a J-shape. These J-shaped larvae shorten into prepupae and develop into pupae and adults the following spring. To exit the tree, adults chew holes from their chamber through the bark, which leaves a characteristic D-shaped exit hole. Immature larvae can overwinter in their larval gallery, but can require an additional summer of feeding before overwintering again and emerging as adults the following spring. This two-year life cycle {{is more common in}} cool climates, such as European Russia.|$|E
500|$|Research in {{the late}} 19th century lead to what Rishel {{describes}} as [...] "one of the thorniest conundrums {{in the study of}} Early Netherlandish art", as efforts were made to establish authorship and date the panels in terms of precedence. The panels are neither signed nor dated, and have proved especially difficult to attribute. Establishing an approximate date of completion is usually {{one of the most important}} factor in attributing an old master painting. Dendrochronological analysis of the Philadelphia panel dated its growth rings to between 1225 and 1307. It was established that the board was cut from the same tree as the wood of two known panels by van Eyck, the Portrait of Baudouin de Lannoy (c.1435) and Portrait of Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini (1438). These have tree-rings that developed between 1205 and 1383, and 1206 and 1382, respectively. Examination of the <b>sapwood</b> suggests a felling date of around 1392. Assuming a typical 10 years of seasoning before use, any of the paintings could have begun from around 1408 onwards. The Turin version is painted on two glued boards, vertical to the image. The rings from board I are dated between 1273 and 1359, those of board II from 1282 to 1365.|$|E
500|$|Many insects also {{engage in}} mutualistic {{relationships}} with fungi. Several groups of ants cultivate fungi {{in the order}} Agaricales as their primary food source, while ambrosia beetles cultivate various species of fungi in the bark of trees that they infest. Likewise, females of several wood wasp species (genus Sirex) inject their eggs together with spores of the wood-rotting fungus Amylostereum areolatum into the <b>sapwood</b> of pine trees; {{the growth of the}} fungus provides ideal nutritional conditions {{for the development of the}} wasp larvae. At least one species of stingless bee has a relationship with a fungus in the genus Monascus, where the larvae consume and depend on fungus transferred from old to new nests. Termites on the African savannah are also known to cultivate fungi, and yeasts of the genera Candida and Lachancea inhabit the gut of a wide range of insects, including neuropterans, beetles, and cockroaches; it is not known whether these fungi benefit their hosts. Fungi ingrowing dead wood are essential for xylophagous insects (e.g. woodboring beetles). They deliver nutrients needed by xylophages to nutritionally scarce dead wood. [...] Thanks to this nutritional enrichment the larvae of woodboring insect is able to grow and develop to adulthood. The larvae of many families of fungicolous flies, particularly those within the superfamily Sciaroidea such as the Mycetophilidae and some Keroplatidae feed on fungal fruiting bodies and sterile mycorrhizae.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Sapwood</b> (or alburnum) is the younger, {{outermost}} wood; in {{the growing}} tree it is living wood, and its principal functions are to conduct water from the roots to the leaves and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, {{by the time they}} become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as <b>sapwood.</b> The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of <b>sapwood</b> required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker <b>sapwood</b> for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, [...] or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth hickory, or open-grown pines.|$|E
2500|$|The wood {{is light}} yellow to brown, and the <b>sapwood</b> creamy white; light, soft, brittle, close, straight-grained. Specific gravity: 0.4230; density: [...]|$|E
