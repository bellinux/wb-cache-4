40|$|An {{audio system}} has a {{circular}} microphone array {{with a number}} of microphones arranged on a circle for receiving a sound field. A digital signal processor is provided for processing output signals from these microphones. To establish well controlled and <b>sharp</b> <b>directivity</b> patterns the audio system performs a weighted integration of the sound field on predetermined portions of the circle. The weighted integration can be performed in a pre-processor reducing the number of channels by creating a smaller number of virtual microphones or by selecting specially designed microphone...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In recent years, {{various types}} of {{diagnostic}} imaging methods, such as CT, MRI, PET and Ultrasound, have been developed rapidly and become indispensable as clinical diagnostic tools. Among these imaging modalities, CT, MRI and PET all apply electromagnetic waves like radiation rays. In contrast, an ultrasound imaging method uses a completely different mechanical pressure wave: ‘‘sound’’. Ultrasound has various features, including inaudible sound at very high frequencies, which allows its use in medical diagnoses. That is, ultrasound techniques can be applied in transmission, reflection and Doppler methods. Moreover, the <b>sharp</b> <b>directivity</b> of an ultrasound beam can also improve image resolution. Another big advantage of diagnostic ultrasound {{is that it does}} not harm the human body or cause any pain to patients. Given these various advantages, diagnostic ultrasound has recently been widely used in diagnosing cancer and cardiovascular disease and scanning fetuses (Fig. 1) as well as routine clinical examinations in hospitals. In this paper, I outline my almost 50 -year history of diagnostic ultrasound research, particularly that performed at the early stage fro...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the radiation pattern of an optical rod antenna {{and found that}} it had many features compared with its conventional radio-wave equivalents. After defining a parameter Λ = λeff /λ, which was the ratio of the effective wavelength of the rod antenna to the incident wavelength, we found that Λ had a great influence on the radiation pattern. Even the radiation pattern with a higher resonant order is without side lobes and results in a <b>sharper</b> <b>directivity,</b> which provides new design flexibilities in improving the directivities of the optical antennas.

40|$|The {{theory for}} sound {{reproduction}} of parametric arrays {{is based on}} nonlinear acoustics. Due to the nonlinearity of the air, a finite amplitude ultrasound interacts with itself and generates audible secondary waves in the sound beam. A special feature of this loudspeaker is its <b>sharper</b> <b>directivity</b> compared to conventional loudspeakers of the same aperture size. This paper describes {{the basis of the}} theory used for parametric arrays, and presents the influence of the main parameters, e. g., carrier frequency. It also describes some signal pre-processing needed to obtain the desired audible sound. A PVDF (polyvinylidenefluoride) film transducer is also studied in order to produce a prototype to confirm the theory. ...|$|R
