50|$|The {{apparent}} {{paradox of}} the actual toxicology of the substance suggests the possibility of serious gaps {{in the understanding of}} the action of gold in physiology. Only salts and radioisotopes of gold are of pharmacological value, since elemental (metallic) gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the body (i.e., ingested gold cannot be attacked by stomach acid). Some gold salts do have anti-inflammatory properties and at present two are still used as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of arthritis and other similar conditions in the US (<b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> and auranofin). These drugs have been explored as a means to help to reduce the pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis, and also (historically) against tuberculosis and some parasites.|$|E
40|$|The {{place of}} sulphasalazine in the {{management}} of rheumatoid arthritis over prolonged periods of time has been compared and contrasted with that of <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate.</b> One hundred and forty-three patients (59 on sulphasalazine, 84 on <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate)</b> have been treated for periods of up to 42 months. Sulphasalazine is highly effective for some patients, though probably less frequently than <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate.</b> However, its safety profile is far superior, and very long-term treatment with sulphasalazine is a safe option for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Ninety {{patients}} randomly {{allocated to}} receive auranofin, matching placebo, or <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> have been followed up for three years. Inefficacy led to cessation of treatment in 14 patients receiving auranofin, 27 receiving placebo, and one receiving <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate.</b> Twenty {{seven of the}} patients receiving placebo were reallocated within the study and 16 continued therapy at three years. This group showed similar statistically significant improvement in clinical and laboratory parameters at one, two, and three years to those on an active drug from the outset. Patients who discontinued auranofin because of inefficacy were offered <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> therapy [...] eight patients in this group completed three years of treatment on <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> and showed significant improvement in some but not all parameters. A hand radiograph erosion score showed a deterioration in 80 % of patients remaining on auranofin, 75 % of those on <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate,</b> and 80 % of the original placebo group who continued an active drug for three years. Although more patients discontinued auranofin over the study period because of inefficacy, no difference could be shown between the degree of improvement in the subgroup who remained on auranofin and those receiving <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate.</b> No disadvantage in outcome could be shown for patients originally assigned to placebo...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{inflammation}} was {{induced by}} injecting carrageenan into a 6 day old air pouch in mice. <b>Sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> was then given twice {{to each of}} three groups of mice via different routes. It {{was found that the}} mice injected intravenously with <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> showed the most striking {{reduction in the number of}} exudate leucocytes in the inflammatory cavity, although the amount of gold found in their inflamed pouch lining tissue was the least. The amount of gold in plasma was highest in the mice injected intravenously with <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> and the least amount of gold was found in the mice injected directly into the air pouch with <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate.</b> The amount of gold in the inflamed pouch lining tissue reached its peak at 24 hours after injection and a significant decrease of exudate leucocytes was only seen 24 and 72 hours after injection. The amount of gold in the exudate fluid was negligible at all the times studied. No significant difference was noted in the degree of inflammatory suppression when increasing doses of <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> were injected into the air pouch. These findings show that there is no direct correlation between the gold concentration in the inflamed tissue and suppression of the inflammatory reactions in the cavity. Chemotactic and phagocytic analysis of leucocytes in the exudate showed that there was a significant suppression of the neutrophil activities in all the mice treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate.</b> It is therefore concluded that the significant reduction in the number of exudate leucocytes at the carrageenan induced inflammatory site after treatment with <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> is most likely due to the direct action of gold on the functional activities of circulating neutrophils...|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that cells {{with a high}} content of the gold-binding protein metallothionein (MT) are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of gold(III) chloride and auranofin. To investigate whether MT confers resistance to <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> two cell lines of cultured human epithelial (HE) cells were used; the parental cell line (HE) and a substrain (HE 100) containing high levels of cytosolic MT. <b>Sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> and thiomalic acid without gold both caused a dose-dependent growth inhibition of both cell lines when used in the concentration range 25 - 300 mumol/l culture medium and for four days' exposure. MT, despite binding about {{one third of the}} cytosolic gold, did not protect against the antiproliferative effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate.</b> The gold and the thiomalate moieties were distributed differently within the cells; 30 % of the cellular gold and 80 % of the thiomalate were recovered in the cytosol. Gold was mainly protein bound in both cell lines, as shown by G 75 Sephadex gel filtration of the cytosols. In the HE 100 cells about 30 % of the gold eluted with MT. The thiomalate eluted mainly with substances with molecular weights less than 1000. Cellular synthesis of MT was not observed during <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> treatment. The results indicate that the <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> molecule dissociates and support the suggestion that the thiomalate moiety is, in part, responsible for the antiproliferative effect of the drug...|$|E
40|$|Uncontrolled {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that sulphasalazine may be an effective second line agent in rheumatoid arthritis. Sulphasalazine was therefore compared with placebo and intramuscular <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> in 90 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. After six months' treatment both sulphasalazine and <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> had produced significant clinical and laboratory benefit, whereas placebo had produced no significant change in any variable. Thirteen patients stopped taking the placebo because of lack of effect whereas only two patients stopped taking sulphasalazine and one <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> for this reason. The major toxicity encountered in the group treated with sulphasalazine was nausea or vomiting, or both; this may be related to slow acetylator phenotype. Sulphasalazine appears to be an effective second line agent, and further pharmacokinetic studies might prove useful in diminishing gastrointestinal side effects...|$|E

Colony formation was reduced during the neutropenia and returned to normal after recovery. The rheumatoid process itself did not impair colony formation even in patients with Felty's syndrome. <b>Sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> inhibited colony formation by normal marrow in a dose-dependent manner. Bone marrow colonies from patients who had recovered from neutropenia induced by <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> were not abnormally sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the drug in vitro. The metabolism of gold is probably altered in a small proportion of patients, which causes high local concentrations within the bone marrow leading directly to marrow depression...|$|E
40|$|Human {{peripheral}} blood mononuclear cells in adherent cultures {{have been shown}} to synthesise and secrete collagenase. In the present study we have examined the modulation of collagenase production in these cultures by several antirheumatic agents. Incubation of monocytes in serum free medium with <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> in concentrations varying from 7. 7 X 10 (- 7) to 7. 7 X 10 (- 3) mol/l resulted in marked dose dependent inhibition of the collagenase production. This inhibition was apparently selective in that total protein synthesis or the viability of the cells were not affected. Similar inhibition of the collagenase production was also noted with auranofin, aurothioglucose, and chloroauric acid. The inhibition with auranofin was achieved with a concentration as low as 7. 4 X 10 (- 8) mol/l. To examine the mechanisms of the inhibition of the collagenase activity induced by <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> the production of prostaglandin E 2 was also measured in the same cell cultures. <b>Sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> in concentrations greater than 7. 7 X 10 (- 4) mol/l significantly inhibited the prostaglandin E 2 production; the prostaglandin E 2 production was not inhibited, however, in 7. 7 X 10 (- 5) mol/l concentration, while the collagenase production was reduced by 51. 0 %. Also, exogenous prostaglandin E 2 added to the cultures only slightly reversed the inhibition of the collagenase production by <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate.</b> Thus the inhibition of collagenase production by <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> in human adherent mononuclear cell cultures appears to be independent of the inhibition of prostaglandin E 2 production. The inhibition of collagenase produced by monocyte-macrophages, as shown here in vitro, may contribute to the clinical efficacy of the compounds tested in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis...|$|E
40|$|Cultured human {{epithelial}} cells (HE), grown as monolayers, acquired resistance to otherwise lethal concentrations (300 mumol/l, culture medium) of <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> during five months' exposure to stepwise increased concentrations of the drug. The resistance acquired was shown {{by exposure to}} drug concentrations ranging from 25 to 300 mumol/, resulting in 100 % of the resistant cells (HeMyo) surviving compared with controls. Only 13 % of the sensitive parent cells survived when exposed to 300 mumol/l for four days. The HeMyo cells were also resistant to the antiproliferative effects of equimolar concentrations of thiomalic acid without gold. The cytosolic gold concentration and the association of 199 Au with cytosolic proteins after gel filtration were similar in both cell lines after <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> exposure to the exponentially growing cells. No synthesis of gold binding proteins of metallothionein character was observed in the HEMyo cells. The concentration of free thiomalate in the sonicates and cytosols of the HeMyo cells was decreased to 25 - 30 % of the concentration found in the HE cells. Comparison with previous data for the cytosolic concentration of total thiomalate in the HE cells suggests {{that most of the}} cytosolic thiomalate present was free thiomalate. We conclude that the cells can develop resistance to the antiproliferative effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate,</b> and that the resistance may be due to their capacity to maintain low concentrations of free thiomalate in the sonicates and cytosols. The results support previous findings that <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> appears to dissociate within cells...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Premature {{death of}} Plasmodium -infected {{erythrocytes}} {{is considered to}} favourably influence the clinical course of malaria. Aurothiomalate has previously been shown to trigger erythrocyte death or eryptosis, which is characterized by cell membrane scrambling leading to phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface. Phosphatidylserine-exposing cells are rapidly cleared from circulating blood. The present study thus tested whether <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> influences the intraerythrocytic parasite development in vitro and the clinical course of murine malaria in vivo. Methods Human erythrocytes were infected with Plasmodium falciparum BinH in vitro and mice were infected (intraperitoneal injection of 1 × 10 6 parasitized murine erythrocytes) with Plasmodium berghei ANKA in vivo. Results Exposure to aurothiomalate significantly decreased the in vitro parasitemia of P. falciparum -infected human erythrocytes without influencing the intraerythrocytic DNA/RNA content.

40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> {{has been}} shown to {{participate}} in exchange reactions leading to the inhibition of trypsin; for this exchange to take place it was necessary to include in the test system a suitable thiol, such as N-acetyl-cysteine. Neither N-acetyl-cysteine nor aurothiomalate on their own had any inhibitory action on trypsin. The results indicate that aurothiomalate dissociates {{in the presence of a}} carrier to form thiosuccinate and gold. The gold is responsible for trypsin inhibition since independent experiments demonstrated that the total concentration of thiosuccinate was insufficient to cause the observed inhibition of trypsin. Bovine serum albumin was shown to act as a carrier in place of N-acetyl-cysteine. It is known that histidine in the active centre of trypsin binds heavy metal ions with consequent inhibition of the enzyme. In this study, imidazole was shown to act as a carrier for gold from aurothiomalate to trypsin resulting in inhibition. This inhibition by gold was reversed when higher concentrations of imidazole were added to the test system due to competition for the trypsin-bound gold by imidazole. Conversely, the thiol enzyme papain was re-activated in the presence of low concentrations of <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> and inhibited by higher concentrations of this reagent in a biphasic manner.

Gait {{analysis was used to}} examine the role of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in the development of pain. Body weights were also measured to monitor the progression of disease and the systemic antiarthritic effects of the test compounds used in this study, as well as their systemic toxicity.

No reduction in the body weights were observed in the arthritic rats treated with azothioprine, chloroquine, <b>sodium</b> <b>aurothiomalate</b> and methotrexate. D-Penicillamine (12. 5 mg/kg/day), however, showed a significant reduction (P < 0. 03) in the body weights of the arthritic rats over a period of 22 days; furthermore, it was unable to show any reduction in arthritic score (P < 0. 1). In earlier experiments, chloroquine and methotrexate failed to suppress carageenan-induced edema, suggesting that the mode of antiarthritic action may be different from those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. Since these disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are reported to have an immunomodulatory role, especially the gold salt, which influences the monocyte–macrophage system, it is suggested that the observed antiarthritic effects of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs may be partly attributed to their immunomodulatory activity...|$|E
