5000|$|Mason almost {{exclusively}} has written his own material. A sampling of his humor is his commentary on doctors: [...] "That's a great profession, a doctor. Where {{else can you}} ask a woman to get undressed and then send the bill to her husband?" [...] And his commentary on what is important in life: [...] "Money is not important. Love is important. Fortunately, I love money." [...] As well as his ruminations on pleasing people: [...] "You can't please everyone. I have a girlfriend. I think she's the most wonderful person in the world. That's to me. But to my wife ..." [...] And on trust: [...] "My grandfather always said that I shouldn't watch my money. That I should watch my health. So while I was watching <b>my</b> health, <b>someone</b> <b>stole</b> <b>my</b> money. It was my grandfather." [...] And on fidelity: [...] "Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe." ...|$|R
500|$|Two remixes of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] are {{included}} on the DVD version of Rings Around The World. The first, by the Super Furry Animals themselves, is 3 minutes 23 seconds in length and largely follows {{the arrangement of the}} original with lengthy instrumental passages between each verse and chorus. Electronic drums and keyboards play alongside Gruff Rhys's vocals with barely any recognisable instrumentation from the version of the track which appears on Rings Around the World. The second remix by Lesser is 3 minutes 22 seconds long and begins with a short sample of Rhys singing the words [...] "All the people that you hate" [...] before breaking down to finger clicking and clapping. Rhys's vocals enter again, singing the title phrase, before samples of the original's string section and drums enter at 1 minute 11 seconds. The rest of the track continues with Rhys's vocals backed by disjointed drum and string samples, breaking down towards the end to just the lead vocals and a harp. The remix ends with Rhys singing the line [...] "Til <b>someone</b> <b>stole</b> <b>my</b> name" [...] a cappella.|$|R
5000|$|But {{instead of}} staying fixed {{in the conference}} room, the film offers a glimpse into Amnon and Hani’s {{personal}} lives to expose the roots of their political beliefs. Breaking from his discussions with Amnon, Hani goes to visit his childhood home in Haifa, which has now become the holy site of Elija’s tomb. The day trip stirs up resentment and frustration in Hani, who is forced to remember his bitter, violent departure from the home {{that had been the}} peaceful sanctuary of his youth. Walking beside the stone walls, he remembers how Israeli Haganah soldiers spoke disrespectfully to his mother and abused him before forcing the family to leave their home. “Amnon always talks of trust,” Hani says, “but how can I trust <b>someone</b> who <b>stole</b> <b>my</b> land and who takes {{a little bit more of}} it every day?” ...|$|R
