50|$|The {{inserted}} cart {{acts as a}} 'boot' cartridge. The N64 boots the CD64 BIOS {{using the}} 6102 CIC in the boot cartridge. The CD64 then boots a program from its cartridge emulator memory using a built-in boot emulator. This presents problems for running programs which have <b>secondary</b> <b>protections</b> against boot emulators, because unlike the V64 and V64Jr, and due to the necessity of the CD64 BIOS to launch a program, {{it is impossible to}} use a cartridge with a different boot CIC than the 6102 with the CD64.|$|R
50|$|When a lamp is {{operated}} past its rated lifespan, the efficiency declines significantly, the lightcast may become uneven, and the lamp starts to operate extremely hot, {{to the point}} that the power wires can melt off the lamp terminals. Eventually, the required startup voltage will also rise to the point where ignition can no longer occur. <b>Secondary</b> <b>protections</b> such as a temperature monitor may shut down the projector, but a thermally overstressed quartz arc tube can also crack and/or explode. However, practically all lamp housings contain heat-resistant barriers (in addition to those on the lamp unit itself) to prevent the red-hot quartz fragments from leaving the area.|$|R
50|$|In a {{presentation}} given at 44con in September 2011, bypassing Trusteer Rapport's keylogger protection {{was shown to}} be relatively trivial. Shortly thereafter Trusteer confirmed that the flaw was corrected and said that even if a hacker {{were able to use}} the flaw to disable anti-keylogging functions in Rapport, other <b>secondary</b> security <b>protection</b> technologies would still be in play.|$|R
50|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>protection</b> {{refers to}} early {{detection}} of disease, potentially while still asymptomatic, to allow positive interference to prevent, delay, or attenuate the symptomatic clinical condition. This includes the following:Retinoids (e.g. tretinoin),Antioxidants (e.g. topical vitamin C, oral supplements, CoQ10, Lipoic acid),Estrogens, andGrowth factors and cytokines.|$|E

5000|$|Large Diesel {{engines are}} {{sometimes}} {{fitted with a}} <b>secondary</b> <b>protection</b> device that actuates if the governor should fail. [...] This consists of a flap valve in the air intake. If the engine overspeeds, the air flow through the intake will rise to an abnormal level. This causes the flap valve to snap shut, starving the engine of air and shutting it down.|$|E
50|$|Low-level {{controlled}} fixed RNAV routes have {{dimensions of}} 4 NM of primary obstacle protection area, plus 2NM of <b>secondary</b> obstacle <b>protection</b> area {{on each side}} of the centreline.

50|$|Post-treatment {{consists}} of preparing {{the water for}} distribution after filtration. Reverse osmosis is an effective barrier to pathogens, but post-treatment provides <b>secondary</b> <b>protection</b> against compromised membranes and downstream problems. Disinfection by means of ultra violet (UV) lamps (sometimes called germicidal or bactericidal) may be employed to sterilize pathogens which bypassed the reverse osmosis process. Chlorination or chloramination (chlorine and ammonia) protects against pathogens which may have lodged in the distribution system downstream, such as from new construction, backwash, compromised pipes, etc.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} known for its ability to combat venomous snakes. It {{primarily}} achieves this through tiring the snake out, by enticing it to make multiple strikes which it acrobatically avoids. <b>Secondary</b> <b>protection</b> against the venomous bite includes the stiff rigid hair, which is excited at such times, the thick loose skin and specialised acetylcholine receptors render it resistant or immune to snake venom.When dealing with scorpions, no measures are taken to disable the sting, and they are picked up in any manner.|$|E

50|$|Any {{protection}} {{contract is}} essentially providing a hedge {{to the owner}} against declining home prices. The provider (protection seller) of the contract will generally have a significant reserve in place and will also hedge their risk using housing futures from the CBOE Chicago Board Options Exchange & CME Chicago Board of Trade and other real estate short strategies to help mitigate losses. Some providers utilize reinsurance from A rated carriers to provide more durable <b>secondary</b> risk <b>protection.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{protected}} areas are under private ownership, {{which tends to}} limit access. However, in many cases, land trusts work to eventually open up the land in a limited way {{to the public for}} recreation in the form of hunting, hiking, camping, wildlife observation, watersports, or other responsible outdoor activities. This is often with the assistance of community groups or government programs. Some land is also used for sustainable agriculture or ranching, or for sustainable logging. While important, these goals can be seen as <b>secondary</b> to <b>protection</b> of the land from development.|$|R
50|$|The {{mission was}} unique in its {{approach}} to Aboriginal people in the late 19th Century in that, unlike other Christian missions at the time, the Jesuits wanted to preserve the language {{and culture of the}} local people. Conversion to Christianity was only <b>secondary</b> to the <b>protection</b> of Aborigines from Western influence.|$|R
5000|$|In Hellenistic and Roman times, the {{musculature}} of {{the male}} torso was idealized {{in the form of}} the muscle cuirass or [...] "heroic cuirass" [...] (in French the cuirasse esthétique) sometimes further embellished with symbolic representation in relief, familiar in the Augustus of Prima Porta and other heroic representations in official Roman sculpture. As parts of the actual military equipment of classic antiquity, cuirasses and corsets of bronze, iron, or some other rigid substance were used. <b>Secondary</b> <b>protection</b> for the breast was worn in earlier times by men-at-arms in addition to mail hauberks and reinforced coats. It was not until the 14th century that the plate armour became an established part of medieval armour.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the HANS device {{is to keep the}} head from {{whipping}} forwards and backwards in a crash, (while also preventing excessive rotational movement, as <b>secondary</b> <b>protection)</b> without otherwise restricting movement of the neck. In other words, it allows the wearer to move their head as normal, but prevents/restricts head movements during a crash that would otherwise exceed the normal articulation range of the skeletal/muscular system and cause severe injury. In any kind of crash, the person's body, which isn't protected, is decelerated by the seatbelt with the head maintaining velocity until it is decelerated by the neck. The HANS device maintains the relative position of the head to the body, in addition to transferring energy to the much stronger chest, torso, shoulder, seatbelts, and seat as the head is decelerated.|$|E
50|$|Welding {{and cutting}} processes, {{including}} arc welding and cutting, {{as well as}} brazing produce intense ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR) and visible light wavelengths. The UV and IR wavelengths cannot be seen and can produce eye injury without the victim realizing it immediately. Extremely dark filters of the proper sort are needed for the welder {{to be able to}} look at the intensely glowing metal being welded. An approved face shield or welding helmet can also have filters for optical radiation protection, and offer additional protection against debris and sparks. UV blocking protective spectacles with side shields or welding goggles are considered primary protection, with the face shield or welding helmet considered <b>secondary</b> <b>protection.</b> This way, the eyes are still protected even when the face shield or helmet is lifted up.|$|E
30|$|A large-diameter double {{telescopic}} shock-resistance prop and a 1000  min− 1 large flow {{safety valve}} quick unloading device have been developed, which improve the shock-resistance of hydraulic support; an articulated front beam and high reliable telescopic beam with a <b>secondary</b> wall <b>protection</b> structure have been developed, which overcomes the wall spalling problem at LLTCC coalfaces; {{and a strong}} disturbance-type top coal discharge device with high efficiency and high top coal recovery has been developed, which improves coal recovery. On {{the basis of the}} developments presented above, a 5.2  m cutting height LLTCC hydraulic support has been developed.|$|R
50|$|GE's design {{capitalized}} upon hardware {{almost ready}} to fly: a bullet-shaped descent module, carried between a conical mission module cabin containing life support and avionics, and the cylindrical propulsion module. The entire craft was 33.4 ft long, with one innovation: a cocoonlike wrapping for <b>secondary</b> pressure <b>protection</b> in case of cabin leaks or meteoroid puncture. Had this configuration been selected, the payload sent to the Moon would have resembled the nose cone flown on the early Saturn I rockets. Although GE did not estimate the final costs in its summary, the company was confident of achieving circumlunar flight {{by the end of}} 1966 and lunar-orbital flight shortly thereafter.|$|R
30|$|Under the {{construction}} of smart substation, relay protection technology is undergoing a thorough and extensive reform. The last similar reform was occurred in 1990 when the microcomputer-based protection was developed {{to be the main}} solution. With a broader scope, this reform takes digitalized protection as the main solution, and includes instrument transformers and <b>secondary</b> circuits besides <b>protection</b> device itself [4].|$|R

30|$|The {{paper is}} {{organized}} as follows. Section 2 presents the necessary background and establishes a stochastic {{model in which}} security indices are embedded. Security indices are formally defined in the section. Their relations to diagnosis, estimation, and control are delineated. Section 3 examines the computational issues associated with evaluating the indices through {{an example of a}} three-area power system. Section 4 presents the results of a simulation study on the performance robustness of the proposed <b>secondary</b> <b>protection.</b> Section 5 draws conclusions on the technology readiness for implementing the <b>secondary</b> <b>protection.</b> The Appendix provides an aggregated discrete-state stochastic model used for reliability analysis, a typical continuous-state classical swing model used for transient stability analysis, and a typical electric transmission network model used for diagnosis.|$|E
30|$|A hybrid {{simulation}} {{program is}} developed {{to assess the}} performance of the <b>secondary</b> <b>protection.</b> Here, hybrid refers to the integration of both continuous-state simulation and discrete event simulation. The discrete event simulation is modeled as a finite state automaton based on Fig. 2 b, where most transitions occur randomly based on the inter-event distributions whose parameters are given in Table 1 of [22].|$|E
50|$|Restrictions {{are also}} useful to control {{dealings}} with the land as a <b>secondary</b> means of <b>protection.</b> For example, a person with an option to purchase land (e.g. a developer) should protect that interest {{by means of a}} Notice. However, they may also enter a restriction to prevent, or to be alerted to, any attempt to transfer the land in breach of the option.|$|R
40|$|It {{was shown}} {{experimentally}} that anisotropic sintered fiber structures provide a verv interesting combination of specific surface area, pressure drop and heat conductivity for certain applications where fast heat transfer from a flowing gas to a solid structure (and vice versa} is required. Easy adjustement of the porosity and the fiber diameter allows to quickly after {{the performance of}} the open-porous fiber structures and thus cover a wide range of experimental conditions. Excellent performance was obtained both in the application as a regenerator in a Stirling engine, as well as for <b>secondary</b> explosion <b>protection</b> in gas sensors. Currently ten Ericsson engines are being built by Enerlyt Technik Gmbh and field testing will commence in summer 2009...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} contractual protection of unsecured financial creditors in US credit markets. Borrowers and lenders in the United States contract against a minimal legal background that imposes {{the burden of}} protection on the lender. A working, constantly updated, set of contractual protections has emerged in response. But actual use of available contractual technology varies widely, depending {{on the level of}} risk and the institutional context. The credit markets sort borrowers according to the degree of the risk of financial distress, imposing substantial constraints only on the borrowers with the most dangerous incentives. At the same time, the contracting practice is sticky and lumpy, never quite managing to conform to the predictions of first generation agency theory. Levels of protection vary with institutional contexts. Exhaustive contracts providing something approaching complete protection against agency costs prove feasible only in relational contexts conducive to ongoing renegotiation over time due to small numbers of lenders operating under reputational constraints. The public bond markets do not hold out such a process context, and accordingly shut out the riskiest borrowers. The larger, less risky firms that do gain access to the bond markets borrow under contracts offering incomplete protection, with the level of protection roughly correlating to the borrower’s risk level. This leaves bondholders confronting a residuum of agency costs and relying on <b>secondary</b> <b>protections</b> like monitoring, exit, diversification, and hedging. This has worked reasonably well in practice, subject to an historical exception concerning the risk of high-leverage restructuring. The bond markets searched for two decades for a stable solution to this problem, finally settling on across-the-board contractual protection only in recent years...|$|R
30|$|This paper {{builds on}} a {{stochastic}} framework first proposed in [18] to tackle recovery from a protection misoperation through a selective secondary protective control under a maximum security criterion. Protective control actions may include high-speed fault clearing, high speed reclosing, regulated shunt/series switching of reactive devices [14]. The qualifier selective to be suppressed {{in the following}} development, refers {{to the fact that}} the availability of PMU-like sensors may allow only partial implementation of the <b>secondary</b> <b>protection.</b> Primary protection and <b>secondary</b> <b>protection</b> are used hereafter to distinguish the existing and newly introduced protection mechanisms. The desired secondary protective control takes no action when the primary protection operates correctly, and a corrective action when the primary protection fails to trip or falsely trips. This approach is highly cost-effective, as it keeps the primary protection scheme intact, which has been both ingeniously and painstakingly designed to benefit the dependability, while exploiting new technologies to offer the needed security.|$|E
30|$|The {{necessity}} for including fault diagnosis in the <b>secondary</b> <b>protection</b> {{has been established}} in 3.2. The multiple-model filtering method [34, 35] is applied to fault mode diagnosis for the 9 -bus system equipped with a network of 3 PMU-like sensors in [22]. More specifically, a bank of Kalman filters corresponding to different fault modes are executed in parallel. Each filter is built on a design model based on a particular configuration of the electric network.|$|E

Since the EIS control is initiated by blocking all power electronic devices on the parallel transformer ET’s <b>secondary</b> side, the <b>protection</b> of the switching circuit {{is not part of}} this study. Then the overvoltage analysis is performed to check the tolerability of both of the TCPST transformers during the proposed EIS control.|$|R
