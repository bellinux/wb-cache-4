40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} {{our first}} work on terrain-based navi-gation of autonomous underwater vehicles using sidescan sonars and sidescan <b>sonar</b> <b>maps.</b> It consists in estimating {{the state of}} the vehicle from its inertial proprioceptions and sidescan extero-ceptions using a particle filter. The novelty is the use of sidescan acoustic perceptions and sidescan <b>sonar</b> <b>maps</b> instead of single-beam bottom-looking acoustic perceptions and bathymetric maps. Also, the approach is not landmark-based. Our first simulations, although conducted under simplifying hypotheses, show that the approach is valid and may be applied to more complex situations.

40|$|A physically-based {{simulation}} {{model for a}} sonar navigation system is described, in which the reflecting elements consist of walls, corners and edges arranged in a floor plan. When the transducer is operating in the pulselecho mode, each element that falls in the transducer field-of-view contributes to the reflected signal through its impulse response. The floor plan is represented as a two-dimensional grid of visibels, that indicate which elements are visible from a particular location. A visibel is represented by a word in computer memory, each bit of which is assigned to a particular element (corner, wall or edge) in the floor plan. The advantage of this conceptually simple approach {{is that it allows}} the transducer to move through the floor plan effi-ciently. This efficiency results because the visibel values are set prior to signal generation, thus allowing a variety of transducer types or transducer locations to be examined quickly. Examples of simulated <b>sonar</b> <b>maps</b> using the time-of-flight ranging system are shown for two floor plans, one simple and the second more complicated. The simulations are verified by comparing them with actual <b>sonar</b> <b>maps</b> obtained with the Polaroid sensor...|$|R

40|$|An {{inspection}} of the Mercury capsule, Liberty Bell 7, and its contents was made on September 1 and 2, 1999.

40|$|Species {{distributions}} {{are influenced}} by spatial structure in environmental factors, but the scales at which these dependencies occur {{and the effect of}} habitat patch diversity, connectivity and spatial arrangement have rarely been investigated in deep-sea settings. In this study, spatially-limited photographic transects collected from Rockall Bank, Northeast Atlantic, were combined with sidescan and multibeam <b>sonar</b> <b>maps</b> to model spatial patterns in species distribution and biodiversity. Sediment interpretation maps were created and canonical ordination techniques were used to examine relationships between fine-scale sediment characteristics extracted from the digital stills as well as landscape metrics describing the patch mosaic structure of the surrounding areas. Fine-scale sediment characteristics explained 45. 1 % and 63. 8 % of the variation in species composition and biodiversity (H?) respectively. This survey effectively captured variation in species distribution resulting from iceberg ploughmarks, occurring at a scale of < 50 m which would normally go undetected by traditional ship-based studies.
