500|$|Lyrically, [...] "You Lost Me" [...] {{talks about}} a [...] "cheating" [...] man, who has left Aguilera's world [...] "infected". Amar Toor from AOL Radio thought that its lyrical content [...] "perfectly captures {{one of the most}} {{difficult}} experiences young lovers have to go through". The song begins with a [...] "somber orchestral" [...] piano opening, followed by the lines [...] "I am done, smoking gun/ We've lost it all, the love is gone" [...] sung by Aguilera. During the chorus, she sings, [...] "I feel like our world's been infected/ And <b>somehow</b> <b>you</b> left me neglected". Toward the ending, Aguilera's [...] "painful" [...] and [...] "catharsis" [...] voice [...] "crescendos dramatically". According to Jon Pareles from The New York Times, Aguilera [...] "barely" [...] holds back her tears in the song. The Village Voice critic Drew Hinshaw thought that Aguilera is [...] "less vexed by what he did than what he lost".|$|E
2500|$|Bowie {{would claim}} that the album has [...] "strong smatterings of Diamond Dogs ... The idea of this post-apocalyptic {{situation}} is there, <b>somehow.</b> <b>You</b> can kind of feel it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meier {{explained}} {{the story behind}} [...] "Domingo", saying, [...] "Domingo is a false preacher who, with a few sentences, is trying to impress the people there, and then the choir chants 'Domingo, you showed us just nothing like no one before', it means 'you didn't show us anything either, it's all nonsense what you said, but <b>somehow</b> <b>you</b> did it right'. Domingo de Santa Clara actually existed. There was an Abraham a Sancta Clara, he was some religious fanatic. I don't know where I got it from, but the name pleased me very much: Abraham a Sancta Clara. And since the name Domingo pleases me as well, I called him Domingo." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Perhaps he's {{taking it}} out of you this way for {{treading}} on his corns <b>somehow.</b> Have <b>you</b> been milling with this gentle youth lately?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have always}} thought, <b>somehow,</b> that <b>you</b> had the part {{especially}} under your protection. I feel that I'm a very bold woman to attempt it." ...|$|R
2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. <b>Somehow</b> <b>you</b> float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved {{to know what was going}} on inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that <b>somehow</b> <b>you</b> are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered, [...] "though <b>somehow</b> <b>you</b> {{concentrate}} it; I {{have never}} seen things, or, rather, this thing, quite so sharply." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I forgot!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Knight, with a sneer, [...] "you {{have come}} into money <b>somehow,</b> have <b>you</b> not, and doubtless {{consider}} yourself independent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should like," [...] {{she whispered}} very softly, [...] "to hear of them. But I fancy <b>somehow</b> that <b>you</b> {{will never be}} my instructor. What of your ward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he exclaimed}} at last, as if shaking {{himself out of}} an {{unpleasant}} reverie, [...] "I guess we shall get along, <b>somehow.</b> Do <b>you</b> like pork and beans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought, <b>somehow,</b> <b>you</b> {{would come}} to me first," [...] said the portly Clodd, {{advancing}} with out-stretched hand. [...] "And this is--?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--I--I don't know" [...] floundered Diana. [...] "It doesn't seem just right, <b>somehow.</b> <b>You</b> know it's rather dreadful {{to laugh}} in church." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What does it matter?" [...] responded Michael, [...] "they'll chuck you out {{sooner or}} later. <b>Somehow</b> <b>you</b> don't give {{the effect of}} being a good magistrate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bedad, I should fare mighty badly, Terence; {{still as}} I don't see {{anything}} else for you, I must try and take <b>you</b> <b>somehow,</b> even if <b>you</b> {{have to go}} as a drummer. I will talk it over with the colonel, though I doubt whether he has forgotten that sparrow yet." ...|$|R
60|$|His lordship {{said that}} <b>somehow,</b> don't <b>you</b> know, there didn't {{seem to be}} a chance, you know. He had several times been on the point--but--well, some-how--well, that's how it was.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never was}} in Berlin and don't know any family hotel there. [...] I should be glad I didn't, {{if it would}} keep you from going. You [...] deserve to put up at the Sign of the Savage in Vienna. Really, it's [...] a great blow to me to hear of that prospected sojourn. It's a [...] shame. I must see <b>you,</b> <b>somehow,</b> before <b>you</b> go. I'm in dreadfully [...] low spirits about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a man, Sir Julien. You must be thirty-five--perhaps older. Yet <b>somehow</b> <b>you</b> {{have the}} look {{to me of}} one who has never cared at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{shook his}} head. 'Oh, no. I couldn't climb at all. I must be lifted, <b>somehow.</b> <b>You</b> had better {{go back to}} Lungern and bring men to help you.' ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. [To LORD ILLINGWORTH.] Do {{speak to}} my mother, Lord Illingworth, before {{you go into the}} music-room. She seems to think, <b>somehow,</b> <b>you</b> don't mean what you said to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "It hurts a little, {{but it will}} go off. It wasn't the jump, but I twisted my foot <b>somehow.</b> If <b>you</b> look so unhappy, I'll get up {{and jump}} back again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] exclaimed the man, with {{affected}} surprise, [...] "then I'm afraid this castle can't be {{a strong}} one, or it ain't well guarded, for `Imperence' got into it <b>somehow</b> when <b>you</b> entered." ...|$|R
6000|$|He sighed {{a little}} wistfully. [...] "I'd {{like to talk}} to you," [...] he said simply, [...] "but <b>somehow</b> to-night... <b>you</b> know it was much easier when you were a {{journalist}} from the 'Hour'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose there's {{some truth}} in that; {{you really did}} give us some trouble. <b>Somehow</b> <b>you</b> were different--you wouldn't fit in--though I believe the same thing applied to me, for that matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{glanced at}} the clock with him, and then desisted. [...] "If he does, I'm {{determined}} to excuse you <b>somehow.</b> <b>You</b> ought never to have gone near him, Clarence. You've brought it upon yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose there's {{some truth}} in that. You really did give us trouble, you know. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>you</b> were different--you wouldn't fit in; though I believe {{the same thing}} applied to me, for that matter." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{head was}} if any thing small; and heaped with thick {{clusters}} of tendril curls, half overhanging the brows and delicate ears, it <b>somehow</b> reminded <b>you</b> {{of a classic}} vase, piled up with Falernian foliage.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe in}} the conscience," [...] she answered. 'This is sheer obstinacy. You have made up your mind that I should be {{interested}} in that money <b>somehow,</b> and <b>you</b> can't bear to suffer defeat." ...|$|R
6000|$|The actor laughed {{like a man}} {{of small}} humor, mellowly, but hollowly. [...] "No, no! We must have the love-affair end happily. You can manage that <b>somehow.</b> Have <b>you</b> got the play roughed out at all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I kind of thought, <b>somehow,</b> <b>you</b> didn't like me," [...] he explained. [...] "Wasn't {{it funny}} {{for me to}} make such a mistake?" [...] And at the thought he held his sides with laughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "But all the same, I'd sooner have forty {{acres at}} a hundred an acre than four at a thousan' an acre. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>you</b> know, I'd be scared stiff on four acres--scared of fallin' off, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well"--my {{amusement}} {{was difficult}} to explain--"you're not very sociable, and yet <b>somehow</b> <b>you</b> are. Mrs. Peck is, at any rate, and thought that ought {{to make it easy}} for you to enter into conversation with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} came over me," [...] she confessed. [...] "I was {{suddenly}} afraid {{that you might}} misunderstand my coming to you like this, without invitation, so late. <b>Somehow,</b> with <b>you,</b> it didn't seem to count." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If it was {{my voice}} you cared for I should have {{to live up to}} it, <b>somehow,</b> before <b>you</b> cared for me. I'm not certain that I ever could. And if I couldn't? You see, don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{not as a}} {{woman to}} fall in love with. I understood. And that <b>somehow</b> made <b>you</b> all the dearer to me. If you had been a girl like other girls, I should n't have cared for you." ...|$|R
