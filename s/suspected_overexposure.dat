40|$|In {{this project}} an {{operating}} model {{was developed to}} situations where occupational radio frequency (RF) field overexposure is suspected. The model gives guidance how to react quickly and correctly to possible overexposure situations. Clear instructions will help to deal with unexpected exposures systematically in the workplace, occupational health care and, if necessary, specialized care. In the project the whole process was taken into account from the technical measures to the occupational health service guidelines, medical examinations and communication at work. These guidelines allow the <b>suspected</b> <b>overexposure</b> situations {{to be dealt with}} in a transparent and documented way, so that the workers safety can be ensured and possible adverse effects detected...|$|E
40|$|Greenberg, 1 {{the authors}} elegantly {{describe}} a 37 -year-old woman with clinically <b>suspected</b> <b>overexposure</b> to mercury from her mercury-containing dental amalgam fillings. She also had thyroid dysfunction. In this con-text, concerns regarding {{the risk of}} mercury amalgam were raised by her wellness doctor after the adminis-tration of the intravenous chelating agent dimercapto-succinic acid, resulting in a marked increase of urinary excretion of mercury. 1 Although the authors presented data indicating that the urinary mercury levels during re-evaluation were within the normal reference range (4 g/L; upper limit value, 20 g/L), 1 we are surprised that the authors {{did not include the}} results of mercury concentrations in whole blood that could have confirmed the absence of continuous overexpo...|$|E
40|$|Cytogenetical {{findings}} in 18 cases of <b>suspected</b> <b>overexposure</b> to ionizing radiations are shown. Despite {{the fact that}} in almost every case a number of aberrations was described, it was possible the estimation of biological doses in only two of them. Six persona (students working with x-rays in a practice) received very localized, high doses in fingers and eyes because of the incredibly erroneous use of an X­ ray diffraction machine, being their biological doses to whole body not relevant at all. Typical radiation-induced chromosomal damage (which is useful for biological dosimetry) is the appearance of dicentric chromosomes, chromosomal rings and acentric fragments, but the greatest amount of cytogenetical abnormalities found in this group are chromosomal breaks and gaps, chromatid aberrations, translocations, deletions, and radial figures (grouped as "others" in Table 1). This led us to suppose a. high number of background chromosomal aberrations in this people, probably because of wrong application of radiation protection rules...|$|E
40|$|The DIS- 1 {{personal}} dosimeter {{is approved}} for assessment of personal dose Hp(10) and Hp(0. 07) from γ and β radiation. Dose measurement in the DIS- 1 {{is based on}} miniaturized ionization chambers. In mixed radiation fields with components other than photons and electrons, the dosimeter will not indicate personal dose, but the ionization chambers will produce a spurious signal that will add to the signal from γ and β radiation. The {{purpose of this paper}} is the evaluation of the magnitude of the spurious signal from other radiation types. For this purpose, irradiations of DIS- 1 dosimeters were performed in a neutron calibration field and two mixed radiation fields at a particle accelerator. The results show, that the DIS- 1 dosimeter indicates absorbed dose in arbitrary radiation fields. This property of the DIS- 1 dosimeter can give critical information after accidental exposures or when investigating <b>suspected</b> <b>overexposures...</b>|$|R
