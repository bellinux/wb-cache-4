2500|$|Although the , , and [...] {{points are}} {{nominally}} unstable, there are (unstable) periodic orbits called [...] "halo" [...] orbits around these {{points in a}} three-body system. A full n-body dynamical system such as the Solar System does not contain these periodic orbits, but does contain quasi-periodic (i.e. bounded but not precisely repeating) orbits following Lissajous-curve trajectories. These quasi-periodic Lissajous orbits are what most of Lagrangian-point space missions have used until now. Although they are not perfectly stable, a modest effort of <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> keeps a spacecraft in a desired Lissajous orbit for a long time. Also, for Sun–Earth- missions, it is preferable for the spacecraft {{to be in a}} large-amplitude (...) Lissajous orbit around [...] than to stay at , because the line between Sun and Earth has increased solar interference on Earth–spacecraft communications.

2500|$|Early radio {{had no real}} {{rules or}} regulations; there was no Federal Radio Commission until 1927 (the Federal Communications Commission succeeded it in 1934). Anyone with some {{technical}} knowledge and equipment could set up a radio station; early 1923 records show there were 20 radio stations {{on the air in}} Chicago alone. While it was then possible for anyone to start a radio <b>station,</b> <b>keeping</b> the station on the air meant {{that it had to be}} profitable. [...] Most of these smaller radio stations faded out because of money issues. The Chicago stations that are or had been on the dial for many years had a business or organization behind them which was willing and able to weather the early times when having a radio station did not mean making a profit. WMAQ had the financial backing of the Chicago Daily News, but it also had a very capable general manager, Judith Waller, who was in charge of the station until it was purchased by NBC. At that point Waller became the director of public affairs programming for NBC's central division, holding that title until her retirement in 1957.|$|E

2500|$|Moreover, it {{has since}} emerged that {{detailed}} study on a Soviet space-based LASER system began no later than 1976 as the Skif, a 1 MW Carbon dioxide laser along with the anti-satellite Kaskad, an in-orbit missile platform. With both devices reportedly designed to pre-emptively destroy any US satellites that might be launched in the future which could otherwise aid US missile defense. In 1987 a disguised Mir space station module was lifted on the inaugural flight of the Energia booster as the Polyus and {{it has since}} been revealed that this craft housed a number of systems of the Skif laser and it was intended that they clandestinely be tested in orbit, {{if it had not}} been for the spacecraft's attitude control system malfunctioning upon separation from the booster and it failing to reach orbit. More tentatively, it is also suggested that the Zarya module of the International Space Station, capable of <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> and providing sizable battery power, was initially developed to power the Skif laser system. Soviet motivations behind attempting to launch components of the Skif laser were, according to interviews conducted years later, more for propaganda purposes in the prevailing climate of focus on US SDI, than as an effective defense technology, as the phrase [...] "Space based laser" [...] has a certain political capital.|$|E

Other children were sometimes brought to her to be adopted, and when entirely made over by their parents were baptized and bred up as Christians. The general trust in Mr. Robertson's skill as a doctor brought many people under his influence, and likewise gave some, though very slight assistance, in combating the belief in witchcraft, the worst enemy with which Christianity has to contend.|$|E
60|$|If you {{had passed}} through Milby on the coach at that time, {{you would have had}} no idea what {{important}} people lived there, and how very high a sense of rank was prevalent among them. It was a dingy-looking town, with a strong smell of tanning up one street and a great shaking of hand-looms up another; and even in that focus of aristocracy, Friar's Gate, the houses would not have seemed very imposing to the hasty and superficial glance of a passenger. You might still less have suspected that the figure in light fustian and large grey whiskers, leaning against the grocer's door-post in High Street, was no less a person than Mr. Lowme, one of the most aristocratic men in Milby, said to have been 'brought up a gentleman', and to have had the gay habits accordant with that <b>station,</b> <b>keeping</b> his harriers and other expensive animals. He was now quite an elderly Lothario, reduced to the most economical sins; the prominent form of his gaiety being this of lounging at Mr. Gruby's door, embarrassing the servant-maids who came for grocery, and talking scandal with the rare passers-by. Still, it was generally understood that Mr. Lowme belonged to the highest circle of Milby society; his sons and daughters held up their heads very high indeed; and in spite of his condescending way of chatting and drinking with inferior people, he would himself have scorned any closer identification with them. It must be admitted that he was of some service to the town in this station at Mr. Gruby's door, for he and Mr. Landor's Newfoundland dog, who stretched himself and gaped on the opposite causeway, took something from the lifeless air that belonged to the High Street on every day except Saturday.|$|E

For the next few months the trains had an average delay percentage of 10, causing outcry among frequent passengers and a massive drop in rating.

50|$|The last {{national}} all-news radio {{service in}} the United States, the audio feed of CNN Headline News, began a long phaseout in 2007. Headline News's audio feed was popular among some all-news stations, particularly after the AP disbanded the format in 2005, until the TV network decided in 2006 to abandon its all-news format and add talk-show programming in prime time, when many smaller stations do not have air staff and rely on a network feed. Most of the Headline News affiliates became talk-radio stations, {{with a handful of}} daytime-only <b>stations</b> <b>keeping</b> the feed. CNN also for a time offered a second all news-channel with the hour filled with CNN Radio newscasts on the hour and half-hour and business, sports and feature segments from CNN Radio and Headline News at specific points each hour, plus time segments for local news to be inserted. Many smaller affiliates, however, preferred Headline News audio which was more suited to turn-key (or unattended, automated) operation. CNN Radio ceased operations April 1, 2012although CNN continues to stream an ad-supported audio simulcast of CNN on TuneIn Radio.|$|R
