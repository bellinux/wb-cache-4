5000|$|The Court of Appeal held {{unanimously}} {{that the}} claim was not <b>statute</b> <b>barred.</b> Until a customer demanded repayment from the bank, the debt was not due and payable, and thus limitation periods would not run. Bankes LJ held: ...|$|R
5000|$|The debtor filed {{a further}} {{appeal to the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, but that court held that it lacked jurisdiction, because the removal <b>statute</b> <b>barred</b> the Court of Appeals from hearing appeals of remand orders. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the dismissal.|$|R
5000|$|By June 1900, his lease {{had been}} taken over by John Chipper. Chipper {{successfully}} sued member of parliament Mathieson Jacoby MLA for [...] "buying votes with beer" [...] after one of his staff refused to pay his <b>bar</b> <b>debt.</b>|$|R
50|$|Collins v Tesco Stores Ltd 2003 EWCA Civ 1308, the Court of Appeal (Pill LJ {{giving the}} lead judgment) agreed that Mrs Jan Collins' claim for some £24,000 for a {{workplace}} injury was <b>statute</b> <b>barred.</b> Because {{she had not}} brought the claim within 3 years of knowing the injury to be significant she was too late.|$|R
5000|$|... 1. A California <b>statute</b> <b>barring</b> {{issuance}} of commercial fishing licenses to persons [...] "ineligible to citizenship," [...] which classification included resident alien Japanese and precluded such a one from earning his {{living as a}} commercial fisherman in the ocean waters {{off the coast of}} the State, held invalid under the Federal Constitution and laws. pp. 412-422.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, in {{applying}} Marcotte (BMO), Desjardins breached its obligations under section 12 of the CPA and [...] in not disclosing {{the existence of}} the conversion charge until it issued a monthly statement showing such charges. Reimbursement of such charges is the appropriate remedy, but the rules on prescription mean that some cardholders' claims are now <b>statutes</b> <b>barred,</b> as notice began upon publication of such statement.|$|R
50|$|At {{the hearing}} at first {{instance}} the plaintiffs' case failed {{on the basis that}} it was <b>statute</b> <b>barred</b> as the cause of action arose on the first sale of a maisonette by the owner, more than six years before an action was commenced. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeals on the basis that the cause of action arose when the damage was discovered or ought to have been discovered.|$|R
50|$|The Department of Defense has {{repealed}} certain <b>statutes</b> <b>barring</b> the Forgotten Widows, a vocal {{minority in}} recent years, from receiving compensation. In 2001, the DoD allowed widows of servicemembers who retired from active service before September 21, 1972 and died before March 21, 1974 {{to receive a}} monthly stipend, {{on the condition that}} the widow has not remarried. Any spouses of armed forces reserve members who died before October 1, 1978 are also eligible.|$|R
50|$|On {{appeal to}} the High Court, Neilson succeeded. In six {{separate}} judgments, {{the majority of the}} High Court found in favour of Neilson on the basis that the Australian choice of law rule referred to the whole of the law of the place of the wrong. Secondly, that this meant that the applicable law was referred back to Australia and the Australian limitations statute applied, meaning that Neilson's claim was no longer <b>statute</b> <b>barred.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, {{two women}} {{challenged}} the all-male grill {{in the popular}} Southern Trace Country Club of Shreveport. They argued that the grill is a [...] "public" [...] facility under the law, and therefore subject to Louisiana <b>statutes</b> <b>barring</b> discrimination based upon sex. The club raised privacy concerns to justify its exclusionary policy. Judge Brun ruled that the all-male policy in the club's Men's Grille did not violate the state constitution {{because it did not}} constitute “arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable discrimination based on sex.” ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the above}} list {{exhausts}} all the dynastic {{members of the}} present Royal House of former king Michael I, the line would not continue with the German Hohenzollerns mentioned above. In fact, this private Statute through Addendum I, explicitly allows only direct descendants of King Michael as dynasts; unlike the old succession rules, the German Hohenzollerns are no longer mentioned as potential dynasts. Contrary to a specific provision of the 1923 Constitution, the private <b>Statute</b> <b>bars</b> from the succession any prince from another, foreign dynasty.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Jones {{presided over}} Deb Whitewood et al. v. Michael Wolf, {{a case in}} which the plaintiffs sought relief from Pennsylvania's Marriage Laws (23 Pa. C.S. § 1102). He {{delivered}} an opinion striking down the Pennsylvania <b>statute</b> <b>barring</b> same-sex marriage on May 20, 2014, on grounds that it unconstitutionally infringed the plaintiffs rights of due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He did not attach a stay to his order, so the decision would be immediately effective.|$|R
50|$|Although not {{all states}} have such laws, some states track {{violations}} of debt collection practices laws. Some states <b>bar</b> <b>debt</b> collectors {{from engaging in}} collection activity against residents of the state unless the collection agency has complied with state licensing or bonding requirements, while others exempt out-of-state collectors from those requirements. Many state fair debt collection laws provide for a private right of action (consumers can sue the debt collector) by consumers against debt collectors that violate their provisions.|$|R

Advises mortgagees on the benefits of limiting rights to possession to only become actionable when mortgagors are in default to avoid claims becoming statue barred. [From Legal Journals Index...|$|R
50|$|Taylor secured {{employment}} {{within the}} United States Department of the Treasury through Secretary Harry Dexter White in 1941. The Treasury Department {{sent him to}} China and later Lisbon for the Foreign Economic Administration. Taylor also {{was a member of}} the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA), in violation of federal employment <b>statutes</b> <b>barring</b> membership in an organization seeking the violent overthrow of the United States Government. As a CPUSA member and allegedly of the secret apparatus known as the Silvermaster group, Taylor is believed to have supplied information orally and in document form to Soviet intelligence.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{originating}} pleading is issued, {{the plaintiff}} is usually required {{to work with}} all deliberate speed to determine {{the names of the}} fictitious defendants through discovery of the defendants it is aware of. If the plaintiff delays too long, the court generally will not allow amendment of the claim to substitute the names of the appropriate party, and any valid claims against those defendants may become <b>statute</b> <b>barred.</b> However, the plaintiff may not, through the action of the fictitious defendants or the other defendants to the lawsuit, be prejudiced by any delay caused by obstruction or refusal to reveal the identities of the fictitious witnesses.|$|R
5000|$|The Federal Circuit {{held that}} the {{dismissal}} [...] "was correct {{as a matter of}} law," [...] because the <b>statute</b> clearly <b>bars</b> appeal of the USPTO's decision to institute a CBM proceeding was correct as a matter of law.|$|R
50|$|Common law {{legal systems}} can include a statute specifying {{the length of}} time within which a {{claimant}} or prosecutor must file a case. In some civil jurisdictions (e.g., California), a case cannot begin after the period specified, and courts have no jurisdiction over cases filed after the statute of limitations has expired. In some other jurisdictions (e.g., New South Wales, Australia), a claim can be filed which may prove to have been brought outside the limitations period, but the court will retain jurisdiction in order to determine that issue, and the onus is on the defendant to plead it as part of their defence, or else the claim will not be <b>statute</b> <b>barred.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Delaney Clause, {{the most}} famous federal health <b>statute,</b> <b>bars</b> Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approval}} of any carcinogenic food additive. In an era when scholars and politicians are again voicing concern about the propensity of legislatures to delegate broad power to administrators, the Delaney Clause is an exceptional illustration of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to enact specific laws. The Clause seems to express the unequivocal judgment that consumers should not be exposed to food ingredients shown to cause cancer, regardless of the benefits the ingredients might provide or {{the magnitude of the}} risk that they might present. Like many extreme policies, the Delaney Clause has proved increasingly difficult to administer...|$|R
50|$|To limit removal {{jurisdiction}} {{pursuant to}} 28 U.S.C. §1441, the Ohio legislature enacted a <b>statute</b> that <b>barred</b> any out-of-state insurance company from {{doing business in}} the state for three years if the insurer removed a case to federal court. The Sixth Circuit held that the statute was unconstitutional.|$|R
40|$|The Montana Supreme Court {{held that}} the {{district}} court erred {{as a matter of}} law and abused its discretion when it granted a preliminary injunction preventing Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife 2 ̆ 6 Parks (DFWP) from subsequently transferring some Yellowstone quarantined bison from Ft. Peck tribal lands to Ft. Belknap tribal lands. DFWP did not violate the DFWP-specific <b>statute</b> <b>barring</b> it from transferring bison to “public and private lands” without landowner consent, a management plan, and public hearings because tribal lands are neither public nor private lands. Tribal lands are in a special class, and the United States and Tribes retain jurisdiction. Furthermore, DFWP did not violate the law because the Legislature had expressly granted the state authority to transfer bison to Tribes elsewhere in the Montana Code. The Court reversed the district court and vacated the preliminary injunction...|$|R
5000|$|After {{a decade}} of {{relative}} tranquility in immigration law, the outbreak of World War I fueled anti-alien sentiments yet again; this time, German immigrants were targeted. Pushed by the anti-alien fervor, Congress even more restrictive immigrations statutes in 1917 and 1920; these <b>statutes</b> <b>barred</b> even more groups {{on the basis of}} ideology. [...] "Sabotage and destruction of property were added to the list of forbidden beliefs, deportation, unbounded by any statute of limitations, had been introduced as a means, separate and distinct from exclusion, of controlling alien radicalism; teaching and advising had joined belief and advocacy as grounds for exclusion or deportation; membership in, or affiliation with, forbidden organizations ... had become grounds for exclusion and deportation; and writing, publishing, circulating, distributing, printing, ... displaying possessing for the purpose of distribution written materials advocating forbidden doctrines had become grounds for exclusion or deportation...." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{executing}} 26 people, Vermont put {{its last}} convict {{to death in}} 1954. The first 21 were executed by hanging, the last five by the electric chair. Vermont abolished {{the death penalty in}} 1965. As of 2015, Vermont is one of eight states along with Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Maine, West Virginia, and Wyoming in the Union to allow any adult to carry a concealed firearm without any sort of permit. There is no <b>statute</b> <b>barring</b> public nudity in Vermont unless it constitutes [...] "open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior", however local ordinances may bar disrobing in public. In 2010, the state enacted a law requiring that a DNA sample be taken from everyone arraigned on a felony, which is entered into a database controlled by the FBI. The age of consent in Vermont is 16.|$|R
2500|$|In San Remo Hotel v. City and County of San Francisco (2005), the Court {{held that}} the Full Faith and Credit <b>Statute</b> <b>bars</b> relitigating a Fifth Amendment takings claim in federal court, after just {{compensation}} has been denied in state court proceedings. This seemed to bear out the views of commentators who saw Williamson County's second prong as extinguishing federal takings claims, rather than ripening them. Writing for a four-justice concurrence, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted {{that the impact of}} the Court's holding could preclude aggrieved property owners from having their federal takings claim considered by any court, and called for the Court to reconsider Williamson County's state procedures requirement [...] "in an appropriate case." [...] Although the issue has been presented in several petitions for certiorari since then, however, the Roberts Court has denied certiorari and has shown no interest in pursuing the late Chief Justice's proposal.|$|R
40|$|The Nevada Supreme Court {{held that}} (1) under NRS 200. 710 (2), knowingly using a minor {{as the subject}} of a sexual {{portrayal}} in a performance, the proper unit of prosecution is one conviction per each distinct minor appearing as {{the subject of a}} sexual portrayal in a performance; (2) under NRS 200. 730, the “simultaneous possession at one time and place of [multiple] images depicting child pornography constituted a single violation of NRS 200. 730 ”; (3) the <b>statute</b> <b>barring</b> the “sexual portrayals” of minors are not overbroad and do not violate the First Amendment or the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution because the statute is clearly defined to penalize only unprotected expression; and (4) the act of kissing a minor on the mouth, in public, without consent, is insufficient to sustain a conviction of lewd conduct without further testimony regarding the nature of the kiss...|$|R
50|$|On May 15, 2008, the California Supreme Court {{ruled in}} a 4-3 {{decision}} that laws directed at {{gays and lesbians}} are subject to strict scrutiny and same-sex couples' access to marriage is a fundamental right under Article 1, Section 7 of the California Constitution. The court found that two <b>statutes</b> <b>barring</b> same-sex marriage in California, one enacted in 1977 by the legislature {{and the other in}} 2000 by state voters (Proposition 22), were unconstitutional. The decision was the first in the United States to establish sexual orientation as a suspect classification. On June 4, 2008, the court denied a request for rehearing and a request to put a hold on the ruling, affirming that the decision would take effect as scheduled. The writ of mandate directing the state government to comply with the ruling and grant same-sex marriages was issued by the Superior Court of California on June 19, 2008.|$|R
5000|$|In Robinson v. California, , the Court {{decided that}} a California law authorizing a 90-day jail {{sentence}} for [...] "being addicted {{to the use of}} narcotics" [...] violated the Eighth Amendment, as narcotics addiction [...] "is apparently an illness," [...] and California was attempting to punish people based on the state of this illness, rather than for any specific act. The Court wrote: [...] "To be sure, imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a punishment which is either cruel or unusual. But the question cannot be considered in the abstract. Even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a common cold." [...] However, in Powell v. Texas, , the Court upheld a <b>statute</b> <b>barring</b> public intoxication by distinguishing Robinson on the basis that Powell dealt with a person who was drunk in public, not merely for being addicted to alcohol.|$|R

5000|$|In State of Florida v. Globe Communications Corp., 648 So.2d 110 (Fla. 1994), the Florida Supreme Court {{held that}} a Florida {{criminal}} statute that prohibited the media from identifying the names of sexual assault victims violated the First Amendment. In that case, Globe Communications Corp. twice published the name and identifying information of a sexual assault victim, violating the Florida statute. The paper had lawfully learned the victim's name through investigation. The Florida Supreme Court relied on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Florida Star v. B.J.F., finding that the Florida <b>statute</b> <b>barring</b> any media publication of a rape victim's name was unconstitutional because it was [...] "overbroad"; that is, it punished the media even if, for example, {{the name of the}} victim was already known in the community. It also found that the statute was [...] "underinclusive" [...] in that it punished only media publication and not acts by a private person.|$|R
