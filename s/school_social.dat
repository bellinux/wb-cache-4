5|$|The Village {{was almost}} {{completely}} self-contained, {{with its own}} shops, public hall, post office, police station, <b>school,</b> <b>social</b> club, and sports facilities. Three corrugated iron churches were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (Church of England) in 1902, and the Roman Catholic St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development {{was close to the}} pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as slums in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining.|$|E

500|$|The chorus {{talks about}} a woman “working at the pyramid tonight”. The track lyrically {{features}} intricate imagery that depicts a fantasy-like scenario, and the length gives the song the ability to change tempo with [...] "patience, with suave, like a furthering of the foreplay". The first half details an account of ancient history, [...] "even your junior high <b>school</b> <b>social</b> studies teacher would blush over", with the second half containing a narrative where Ocean serves as Cleopatra’s pimp but through years of working together, he eventually {{falls in love with}} her. Through the [...] "unwritten bylaws of their profession", however, his love is no match for the [...] "rules of the game which were established long before he or she rose to power." [...] The narrative of [...] "Pyramids" [...] was inspired by real events in Ocean's life. When the singer lived in Los Angeles, he lived alongside pimps, and in an interview the singer mused that [...] "it was fantasy built off that dynamic … but you can only write what you know to a point." [...] The storytelling scope of the song has been compared favorably to Bob Dylan's [...] "The Hurricane", and has been described as an anthem [...] "for the Drake generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Monica and Rachel have {{remained}} best friends since high school, {{they are very}} much opposites. While both characters share similar economic backgrounds, they grew up on [...] "different ends of the high <b>school</b> <b>social</b> order," [...] with Rachel being a popular cheerleader and Monica [...] "deal with body and control issues due to being an overweight child and teen." [...] Sabienna Bowman of This Was TV observed that [...] "Monica’s struggles ultimately left her more confident than Rachel, {{as well as more}} prepared for adulthood." [...] Among her defining qualities, Monica has had a passion for cooking ever since childhood, stemming from when she received her first Easy-Bake Oven. A chef, the character has had several cooking-related jobs throughout the series, having worked at five different restaurants, a trend that nearly coincides with her constant rotation of boyfriends in an ongoing search for the [...] "perfect match". Michael Hogan of The Guardian believes that the character's [...] "competitive, perfectionist, obsessive-compulsive nature made her ideally suited to a career as a chef." [...] However, her love of cooking and food is also responsible for her having been extremely overweight as a child, throughout high school and college. The running gag of an overweight Monica is often used as a recurring backstory for the character throughout the series, first explored in the second-season episode [...] "The One With the Prom Video" [...] via flashback. One of the character's childhood nicknames was [...] "Big Fat Goalie" [...] when she played field hockey. While overweight, Monica is depicted as having very low self-esteem, binge eating often, and constantly seeking attention. While in college, Monica is embarrassed into losing weight permanently after overhearing her then-crush Chandler make fun of her appearance. Media and the Rhetoric of Body Perfection: Cosmetic Surgery, Weight Loss and Beauty in Popular Culture author Dr. Deborah Harris-Moore believes that Monica's tendency to come off as a control freak originates from her childhood struggles with weight gain, explaining that the character ate excessively in order [...] "to cope with her emotions." ...|$|E
