2500|$|Slewing: The amplifier's {{output voltage}} reaches its maximum rate of change, the slew rate, usually {{specified}} in volts per microsecond. When <b>slewing</b> occurs, further {{increases in the}} input signal {{have no effect on}} the rate of change of the output. <b>Slewing</b> is usually caused by the input stage saturating; the result is a constant current [...] driving a capacitance [...] in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its frequency compensation); the slew rate is limited by [...]Slewing is associated with the large-signal performance of an op-amp. [...] Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10. [...] Let the input be a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1 V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] After 10x amplification, the output should be a 10 V, [...] 100kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1 V per microsecond. [...] However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5 V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5 V, 100kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10 V, 100kHz sawtooth.Next consider the same amplifier and 100kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100 mV rather than 1 V. [...] After 10x amplification the output is a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] In this instance the 741 with its 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly.Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000 V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5-100 V per microsecond. [...] For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a slew rate of 13 V per microsecond. [...] As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op-amps have low slew rates. [...] As an example, the LT1494 micropower op-amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001 V per microsecond slew rate.|$|E

6000|$|MY DEAR BOB, - My {{extremely}} foolhardy venture {{is practically}} over. [...] How foolhardy it was I don't think I realised.

We have twice had all we wanted in the way of squalls: once, as I came on deck, I found the green sea over the cockpit coamings and running down the companion like a brook to meet me; at that same moment the foresail sheet jammed and the captain had no knife; this was the only occasion on the cruise that ever I set a hand to a rope, but I worked like a Trojan, judging the possibility of haemorrhage better than the certainty of drowning. Another time I saw a rather singular thing: our whole ship's company as pale as paper from the captain to the cook; we had a black squall astern on the port side and a white squall ahead to starboard; the complication passed off innocuous, the black squall only fetching us with its tail, and the white one <b>slewing</b> off somewhere else. Twice we were a long while (days) in the close vicinity of hurricane weather, but again luck prevailed, and we saw none of it. These are dangers incident to these seas and small craft.

The head of the mainmast hung over so that hands were afraid to go to the helm; and less than three weeks before - I am not sure it was more than a fortnight - we had been nearly twelve hours beating off the lee shore of Eimeo (or Moorea, next island to Tahiti) in half a gale of wind with a violent head sea: she would neither tack nor wear once, and had to be boxed off with the mainsail - you can imagine what an ungodly show of kites we carried - and yet the mast stood. The very day after that, in the southern bight of Tahiti, we had a near squeak, the wind suddenly coming calm; the reefs were close in with, my eye! what a surf! The pilot thought we were gone, and the captain had a boat cleared, when a lucky squall came to our rescue. My wife, hearing the order given about the boats, remarked to my mother, 'Isn't that nice?
