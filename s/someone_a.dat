5|$|Keating reaped {{benefits}} from the move to Arizona, a wide-open territory in both a physical and business sense that allowed <b>someone</b> <b>a</b> fresh start. He turned the now-renamed American Continental Corporation around, adding various operations and divisions in a structure somewhat reminiscent of American Financial. As chairman and controlling stockholder, Keating relied heavily upon family members, employing his son and four of his sons-in-law in prominent positions. Charles Keating III had a fast career rise within the company.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{have had}} a strong {{presence}} in many cultures, especially in areas where they form {{the most common type}} of livestock. In the English language, to call <b>someone</b> <b>a</b> sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led. In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the Los Angeles Rams football team and the Dodge Ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, Ovis canadensis.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, 2009, Helms {{was drafted}} to the ECW brand {{as part of}} the 2009 Supplemental Draft. Helms made his ECW debut as a {{backstage}} interviewer on April 28, 2009, reverting to his Gregory Helms ring name, interviewing Evan Bourne. He started a storyline where, while he was interviewing <b>someone,</b> <b>a</b> scripted accident would occur, leading to Helms leaving the interview seconds before the person in distress was saved by The Hurricane. On the August 11, 2009 episode of ECW, Helms was attacked by Paul Burchill after Helms denied being The Hurricane. The Hurricane later attacked Burchill in the ring dressed in his Hurricane attire, to save Yoshi Tatsu. The next week on ECW, he made his in-ring debut for the brand as The Hurricane, and defeated Burchill. He continued to feud with Burchill, who attempted to expose The Hurricane's true identity, until the November 17 episode of ECW when The Hurricane defeated Burchill in a mask versus career match.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{each person}} was {{determined}} by how many divine generals they had at their disposal, and {{by the number of}} divine scriptures they had obtained. These divine generals were used to fight wandering demons that could bring misfortune or illness on <b>someone.</b> <b>A</b> person received their first general at the age of six years, and in subsequent ceremonies would be given more and generals and achieve a higher ranking until a full complement was achieved at the age of nineteen. Marriage would unite two sets of generals, thus giving a couple use of 150 divine generals. After marriage, further increases in ranking could only be achieved by religious achievement.|$|E

25|$|These {{individuals}} {{may be trying}} to reenact unresolved issues with their parents. A history of frequent illnesses may also {{contribute to the development of}} this disorder. In some cases, individuals afflicted with FD are accustomed to actually being sick, and thus return to their previous state to recapture what they once considered the 'norm.' Another cause is a history of close contact with <b>someone</b> (<b>a</b> friend or family member) who had a severe or chronic condition. The patients found themselves subconsciously envious of the attention said relation received, and felt that they themselves faded into the background. Thus medical attention makes them feel glamorous and special.|$|E
25|$|Identity fusion, a {{psychological}} construct rooted in social psychology and cognitive anthropology, {{is a form}} of alignment with groups in which members experience a visceral sense of oneness with the group. The construct relies on a distinction between the personal self and the social self. The personal self refers to the characteristics that make <b>someone</b> <b>a</b> unique person (e.g., tall, old, intelligent), while the social self pertains to the characteristics that align the person with groups (e.g., American, fraternity brother, student council member, etc.). As the name suggests, identity fusion involves the union of the personal and social selves. When fusion occurs, both the personal and social selves remain salient and influential but the boundaries between them become highly permeable. In addition, the theory proposes that fused persons come to regard other group members as “family” and develop strong relational ties to them as well as ties to the collective. Therefore, fused persons are not just bound to the collective; they are tied to the individual members of the collective.|$|E
25|$|Reduplication is {{also used}} for expressing verbal number. Verbal number {{indicates}} that {{the action of the}} verb is repeated; in the case of ASL it is apparently limited to transitive verbs, where the motion of the verb is either extended or repeated to cover multiple object or recipient loci. (Simple plurality of action can also be conveyed with reduplication, but without indexing any object loci; in fact, such aspectual forms do not allow objects, as noted above.) There are specific dual forms (and for some signers trial forms), as well as plurals. With dual objects, the motion of the verb may be made twice with one hand, or simultaneously with both; while with plurals the object loci may be taken as a group by using a single sweep of the signing hand while the verbal motion is being performed, or individuated by iterating the move across the sweep. For example, 'to ask <b>someone</b> <b>a</b> question' is signed by flexing the index finger of an upright G hand in the direction of that person; the dual involves flexing it at both object loci (sequentially with one hand or simultaneously with both), the simple plural involves a single flexing which spans the object group while the hand arcs across it, and the individuated plural involves multiple rapid flexings while the hand arcs. If the singular verb uses reduplication, that is lost in the dual and plural forms.|$|E

Of these, using the classification devised by Sabina Halupka-Resetar, and Biljana Radic, lamb was always used positively; cow and vixen referred to a person's appearance; pig indicated a person's eating habits; calling <b>someone</b> <b>a</b> fox or a turkey related to their intelligence, or lack of it; and names like cat, snake, worm, monkey, dog, mouse, chicken, lamb and rat were used to indicate a person's character.|$|E

500|$|In Islamic {{countries}} and cultures, a gesture involving exposing only the thumb in a vertical orientation – a thumbs up – {{is used in}} lieu of the finger to express roughly the same sentiment. A similarly obscene gesture is extending all five digits with the palm facing forward, meaning [...] "you have five fathers", thus calling <b>someone</b> <b>a</b> bastard. This is similar to a gesture known in Greece as the Moutza, where the five fingers are spread wide and the palm is pushed towards the recipient. More commonly in Turkish or Slavic regions, the fig sign (also known as nah or shish) serves as the equivalent to the finger, meaning [...] "you won't get it"/"in your dreams". The gesture is typically made with the hand and fingers curled and the thumb thrust between the middle and index fingers. This gesture is also used similarly in Indonesia, Turkey and China.|$|E
