These protocols ensure that data transferred between two parties remains completely confidential.

5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying {{gratification}} as {{an adaptive}} skill. It {{has been shown}} that learning to delay gratification promotes positive social behavior, such as <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay gratification are better able to complete their assigned activities. To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E

The band's initial popularity came from fan-made demo tapes and online file <b>sharing,</b> <b>and</b> were heralded {{as one of}} the first acts to come to the public attention via the Internet. Commentators suggested at the time that they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed.

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state recourse. Women began to form their own networks of resource <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E
5|$|It {{introduced}} {{training for}} {{police officers and}} anti-human-trafficking service providers in communities that are particularly susceptible to human trafficking. The plan also includes an increase in training for prosecutors, border guards, and judges. The plan launched a nationally integrated law enforcement team tasked specifically with combatting human trafficking, {{the first of its}} kind in Canada. The team combines the forces of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), CBSA, and local police. Due to difficulties encountered by Canadian law enforcement when investigating human trafficking before the establishment of the NAP-CHT, this model of law enforcement integration, emulating successful teams combatting human trafficking in the United States, was included. This law enforcement integration model is intended to optimize information <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> facilitate proactive investigation. The NAP-CHT allocates substantial funds to the RCMP Human Trafficking National Coordination Centre (HTNCC), which is based in Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|Proposed {{transportation}} {{management strategies}} {{are aimed at}} keeping traffic into Aspen at the baseline 1993 level through 2015. There are three levels or strategic response: The first would be when that baseline is equaled or slightly exceeded. It would consist of promoting ride <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> more extensive transit use, among other informational measures. At Level 2, when traffic reaches a few percentage points above that level, more transit service would be added, and parking rates raised slightly to fund the additional buses required to reduce headways. Level 3 would be implemented when traffic levels had exceeded the baseline by 5–10%, and would use more forceful measures such as steeper increases in parking fees, deliberately {{limiting the number of}} spaces available, and making some parts of downtown Aspen car-free zones.|$|E
5|$|The Raptors were {{eventually}} seeded {{third in the}} Eastern Conference, marking {{one of the biggest}} turnarounds in NBA history in terms of league standing and defensive ranking. Throughout the season, they were lauded for playing solid defense and good <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> moving of the ball. José Calderón, Bargnani, Dixon and Morris Peterson turned in reliable performances from the bench while Ford and Bosh ran the offence with consistent numbers. And in Parker and Garbajosa, the Raptors had two very versatile players who could both defend and attack. Furthermore, in contrast to previous seasons, the Raptors were able to win games despite injuries to key players such as Bosh, Bargnani, Parker, Ford and Garbajosa. Colangelo, Gherardini and Mitchell were also largely credited for transforming Toronto's fortunes.|$|E

5|$|In February 1974, President Nixon {{proposed}} {{more comprehensive}} health insurance reform—an employer mandate to offer {{private health insurance}} if employees volunteered to pay 25 percent of premiums, replacement of Medicaid by state-run health insurance plans available to all with income-based premiums and cost <b>sharing,</b> <b>and</b> replacement of Medicare with a new federal program that eliminated the limit on hospital days, added income-based out-of-pocket limits, and added outpatient prescription drug coverage. In April 1974, Kennedy and Mills introduced a bill for near-universal national health insurance with benefits identical to the expanded Nixon plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through payroll taxes—both plans were criticized by labor, consumer, and senior citizen organizations because of their substantial cost sharing. In August 1974, after Nixon's resignation and President Ford's call for health insurance reform, Mills tried to advance a compromise based on Nixon's plan—but with mandatory participation by employers and employees through premiums to private health insurance companies—but gave up when unable to get more than a 13–12 majority of his committee to support his compromise plan.|$|E
5|$|The FairTax is a {{national}} tax, but can be administered by the states rather than a federal agency, which may have a bearing on compliance as the states' own agencies could monitor and audit businesses within that state. The 0.25% retained by the states amounts to $5 billion the states would have available for enforcement and administration. For example, California should receive over $500 million for enforcement and administration, {{which is more than}} the $327 million budget for the state's sales and excise taxes. Because the federal money paid to the states would be a percentage of the total revenue collected, John Linder claims the states would have an incentive to maximize collections. Proponents believe that states that choose to conform to the federal tax base would have advantages in enforcement, information <b>sharing,</b> <b>and</b> clear interstate revenue allocation rules. A study by the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that, on average, states could more than halve their sales tax rates and that state economies would benefit greatly from adopting a state-level FairTax.|$|E
