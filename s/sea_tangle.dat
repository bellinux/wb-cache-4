40|$|Abstract The antihyperlipidemic and {{antioxidant}} {{activities of}} dietary supplementation of <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> from Goseong and the alginate-free residue of <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> were investigated in Sprague Dawley rats {{treated with a}} high-fat diet, streptozotocin, poloxamer 407, and bromobenzene. The alginate-free residue of Goseong <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> induced {{a significant reduction in}} triglycerides and total cholesterol levels, as well as a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Alginate-free Goseong <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> residue reduced the activities of the phase I enzymes aminopyrine N-demethylase and aniline hydroxylase, which had been increased by intraperitoneal injection of bromobenzene. Pretreatment with Goseong <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> residue prevented a bromobenzene-induced decrease in epoxide hydrolase activity. Bromobenzene reduced hepatic glutathione content and increased hepatic lipid peroxide levels. Pretreatment with alginate-free Goseong <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> residue prevented lipid peroxidation induced by bromobenzene, but pretreatment with Goseong <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> did not. These results suggest that Goseong <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> residue exerted antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant activities that were higher than those induced by alginate-containing <b>sea</b> <b>tangle.</b> Therefore, the alginate-free residue may contain physiologically unknown active components, other than alginic acid, which may potentially be used to prevent hyperlipidemic atherosclerosis...|$|E

40|$|Breakfast {{sausages}} containing 1, 2, 3, and 4 % <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> powder (Lamina japonica) were prepared. No {{differences were}} found in moisture, protein, and fat contents among the control and treatments. However, the ash content increased with increasing amounts of <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> powder (p< 0. 05). The pH levels in the treated samples were lower than the control in both the meat batters and the breakfast sausages (p< 0. 05). The L * and a * values of the meat batters and breakfast sausages were decreased by the addition of the <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> powder, and the control had the highest b * value (p< 0. 05). The added <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> powder improved cooking loss and improved emulsion stability. The T 4 sample (containing 4 % <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> powder) was shown to have the lowest cooking loss and water loss (p< 0. 05). The hardness, gumminess, and chewiness of the treatments increased compared to the control due to the presence of dietary fibers in the <b>sea</b> <b>tangle.</b> In the sensory evaluations, the 1 % <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> powder treatment received a lower color score, but received significantly higher scores for flavor, tenderness, and juiciness (p< 0. 05). Collectively, the breakfast sausage containing 1 % <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> powder was determined to have the highest overall acceptability.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} {{to determine the effect}} of temperature condition on growth of juvenile abalone Haliotis discus hannai with the different feeds. Two types of feed (dry <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> and experimental diet) at water temperatures of 20 and 23 ℃, and 23 and 26 ℃ were applied to experimental abalone twice. Forty-five juvenile abalone averaging 10. 1 g in the first feeding trial and 11. 5 g in the second feeding trial were randomly stocked into 6 of 50 L plastic rectangular containers each. Fishmeal, soybean meal and shrimp head meal was used as the primary protein source in the experimental diet. And dextrin and wheat flour, and soybean oil were used as the primary carbohydrate and lipid sources in the experimental diet, respectively. The dry <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> and experimental diet were fed to abalone once a day at the ratio of 1. 5 - 2. 0 % total biomass of abalone with a little leftover in each experimental condition. Weight gain of abalone was significantly affected by feed type, but not by water temperature in the first feeding trial. Regardless of water temperature, weight gain of abalone fed the experimental diet was significantly higher than that of abalone fed the dry <b>sea</b> <b>tangle.</b> However, weight gain of abalone was significantly affected by water temperature, but not by feed type in the second feeding trial.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to assess knowledge, self-efficacy, and perceived barriers on a low-iodine diet among thyroid cancer patients and to identify strategies for nutrition education. A self-administered questionnaire was developed based on a review of literature and pilot-tested. A total of 121 female thyroid cancer patients participated in a survey and 117 responses were used for data analysis. An average knowledge score of the thyroid cancer patients was 4. 5 point (available score: 0 - 10 point). Majority of the respondents knew that seaweeds such as lavers, brown seaweeds, and <b>sea</b> <b>tangles</b> contain large amount of iodine. However they mistook the low iodine diet as a low salt diet and were not aware of foods and seasonings that are al-lowed on the low iodine diet. While self-efficacy related to consuming various fruits and vegetables, to choosing potatoes and sweet potatoes for snacks, and restricting consumption of eggs, milk and milk products, and processed foods was rated highly, self-efficacy for preparing foods without using sea salts was rated low. The self-efficacy score increased as their interest on the dietary life and perceived cooking skills were greater. Most perceived barriers toward practicing the low iodine diet were re-lated to preparation of the low iodine menus. As their interest in the dietary life and cooking and perceived cooking skills were greater, the patients perceived barriers on practicing the low iodine diet less.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} change of major nutrient components in boiled broth of anchovy, fish paste, <b>sea</b> <b>tangle,</b> and radish subjected to the boiling processing. The crude protein, fat, ash, and carbohydrates in anchovy boiled broth were 0. 1 %, 0. 04 %, 0. 1 %, and 0 % respectively as against 0. 04 %, 0. 1 %, 0. 2 %, and 0. 4 % in fish paste boiled broth. The protein content in the anchovy boiled broth, the fat and carbohydrate in the fish paste boiled broth, and the ash in the <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> boiled broth were high. Major components of the minerals were sodium plus potassium and the boiled broth in anchovy and fish paste had the contents of 19. 41 plus 16. 19 and 76. 77 plus 10. 41 mg, respectively. Especially, the potassium in boiled broth of the <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> was shown the highest content of 85. 94 mg.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of a body weight control program with supplementation of <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> (20 g/day) on 22 female college students. The contents of the program for 8 weeks contained diet therapy, exercise and behavioral modification through nutrition education. Body composition, dietary habit scores, serum lipid profiles, daily nutrient intakes and the quality of life were assessed at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the program. Average age of subjects and height were 20. 8 years and 161. 9 cm, respectively. After 8 weeks, there were significant reductions in body weight, body fat mass, percent body fat, waist-hip ratio and BMI. The dietary habit score such as a balanced diet, regularity of mealtime, overeating, eating while watching TV or using the computer and eating salty food were increased significantly. Serum lipid levels such as total cholesterol level, LDL-cholesterol level and triglyceride level were decreased but not significantly. There were decreases in intake of energy, protein and fat and increases in intakes of dietary fiber, folic acid, calcium and potassium from the beginning to the end of the program. There were significant improvements on subcomponents of quality of life; physical functioning, general-health and vitality. The limitation of this study was the fact that there was no control group, but an overall evaluation suggests the 8 -week body weight control program consisting of diet therapy, exercise and behavioral modification with supplementation of <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> would be helpful to improve the body composition, dietary habits, daily nutrient intakes and quality of life in Korean female college students.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Sea</b> <b>tangle</b> (Laminaria japonica) is {{well known}} as having anti-diabetic and hypolipidemic effects in animals {{as well as in}} humans. In this study, we {{evaluated}} the effects of sea tangle-added patty on postprandial blood glucose and lipid profiles in borderline-hypercholesterolemic (cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL) adults. Eleven subjects volun-tarily participated in the experiment, and each subject provided written consent. Experimental patty (E) was made by adding 2. 25 g of <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> powder as a substitution to 1. 125 g each of pork and chicken. In the first week, 200 g of Control patty (C) was provided to each subject, who had fasted more than 12 hours. In the second week, the same amount of E patty was supplied under the same conditions. Serum glucose levels increased significantly less at 30, 60, and 120 min after consumption of E patty compared to the levels at all time points after eating C patty. Thus, the change in the area under curve (ΔAUC) of serum glucose levels through 120 minutes was lower when consuming E patty compared to C patty. Although serum C-peptide concentrations were not significantly different at all time points between the two patties, the ΔAUC of serum C-peptide concentrations through 120 minutes was lower when consuming E patty compared to C patty. However, there were no differences in serum levels of triglyceride...|$|E

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the matrix {{interference}} for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of inorganic arsenic species in seaweed by ion chromatography (IC) combined with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The matrix of seaweed has {{a significant effect on}} the determination of inorganic arsenic species. In particular, the retention times of inorganic arsenic species in the in the standard solution were different from those in seaweed because of the matrix interference. Thus, it was not suitable to use the chromatographic method for the determination of the arsenic species in seaweed. We investigated an alternative method for the determination of inorganic arsenic species in seaweed. The method was applied for the seaweed samples such as laver, green laver, <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> and sea mustard.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the physiological effects of seaweed supplementation on blood glucose levels, lipid profile, and antioxidant enzyme activities in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Subjects were randomized into either a control group or a seaweed supplementation group. Pills with equal parts of dry powdered <b>sea</b> <b>tangle</b> and sea mustard were provided to the seaweed supplementation group {{three times a day}} for 4 weeks. Total daily consumption of seaweed was 48 g. We found that total dietary fiber intake was 2. 5 times higher in subjects receiving seaweed supplementation than in the control group. Accordingly, fasting blood glucose levels (p< 0. 01) and 2 -hour postprandial blood glucose measurements (p< 0. 05) were decreased significantly in those ingesting seaweed. Furthermore, the serum concentrations of triglycerides were decreased and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was increased significantly in seaweed supplement group (p< 0. 05). However, the concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not affected by seaweed supplementation. The level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in erythrocytes was significantly lower with seaweed supplementation compared to controls (p< 0. 05). Catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities with seaweed supplementation were higher than the controls (p< 0. 05), but superoxide dismutase activity was not affected.

There were six replicates and five ducklings in each replication. The five dietary treatments were control, antibiotic, and 0. 1 %, 0. 5 %, and 1 % STC supplemented diets. No {{significant differences were found}} on ADG, ADFI, and gain:feed among treatments in different weeks. The overall (0 to 3 weeks) ADFI decreased in antibiotic treatment (p< 0. 05) whereas the gain:feed increased significantly upon 1. 0 % STC supplementation compared to control (p< 0. 05). No significant variation was found in meat chemical composition except crude fat content which was high in 1. 0 % STC dietary group (p< 0. 05). Meat cholesterol was reduced in 0. 1 % STC group (p< 0. 05) compared to other dose levels while serum cholesterol was unaffected. High density lipoprotein (HDL) content was high in 1. 0 % STC (p< 0. 05) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) was low in 0. 1 % and 1. 0 % STC dietary groups (p = 0. 06). No significant effect was found on the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) of fresh meat, whereas the TBARS value of meat preserved for 1 week was reduced significantly in STC dietary groups (p< 0. 05). The 0. 1 % STC dietary group showed an increased myristic acid (p = 0. 07) content whereas, the content of eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids increased in STC supplementation than antibiotic group (p< 0. 05). An increased concentration of omega- 3 fatty acids and a reduced ratio of n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA ratio was found upon 1. 0 % STC supplementation compared to antibiotic dietary group (p< 0. 05).
