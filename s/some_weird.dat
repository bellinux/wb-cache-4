25|$|The vibrato {{sound is}} incredible, {{and it took}} a long time. I put down the rhythm track on an Epiphone Casino through a Fender Twin Reverb without vibrato. Then we played the track back through four old Twins, one on each side. We had to keep all the amps {{vibrating}} in time to the track and each other, so we had to keep stopping and starting the track, recording it in 10-second bursts... I wish I could remember exactly how we did the slide part – not writing it down is one of the banes of my life! We did it in three passes through a harmonizer, set to <b>some</b> <b>weird</b> interval, like a sixth. There was a different harmonization for each pass. For the line in harmonics, I retuned the guitar so that I could play it all at the 12th fret with natural harmonics. It's doubled several times.|$|E

For all of his screaming {{and all of his}} darkness, he was just lovable."

500|$|Bo Welch, Burton's {{collaborator}} on Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, replaced Anton Furst as production designer, since Furst {{was unable}} to return for the sequel due to contractual obligations.

An iron maiden was used for Bruce Wayne's entry into the Batcave. Stan Winston, who worked with Burton on Edward Scissorhands, designed Danny DeVito's prosthetic makeup, which took two hours to apply.

500|$|Musically, Love's {{work with}} Hole and her solo {{efforts have been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had [...] "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, if you go back... what'll sound like <b>some</b> <b>weird</b> Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework".|$|E

Elliott described the album as a [...] "mythological cartoon about love written from <b>some</b> <b>weird</b> spaces", and explained it as [...] "sort of a mood swing into the world that was around us at the time. It was sort of dissolving into this drug culture. So the music became very ethereal, mystic, and mysterious". In contrast with the band's generally straightforward recordings for the Autumn label, Triangles lyrics are more abstract, containing Tolkienesque fantasy elements and dream-like characters, such as the gypsy in [...] "Only Dreaming Now", the [...] "Painter of Women", [...] "The Keeper of Time", and [...] "The Wolf of Velvet Fortune", {{as well as the}} destination of [...] "Magic Hollow".|$|E
500|$|In a 1995 interview, Guitar World writer Jeff Gilbert {{described}} Vitalogy as [...] "strange" [...] and [...] "very eclectic." [...] McCready agreed, saying, [...] "There is <b>some</b> <b>weird</b> {{stuff on}} there." [...] McCready attributed the album's sound {{to the group}} recording it on tour. During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, [...] "Vitalogy {{is the first one}} where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more punk feel to it. Simple songs recorded really quickly." [...] The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, [...] "Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; {{it was more of a}} rhythmic album." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Beck {{had been}} {{impressed}} with the Chess studio's history and sound, he {{had been unable to}} complete a guitar solo to his satisfaction. [...] "I kept changing guitar sounds all the way through. So we did two or three takes of my guitars and blended them all together. But the solo on [...] "Shapes of Things" [...] was pretty honest up until that feedback note that comes in over it", he recalled. [...] During the recording, [...] "there was mass hysteria in the studio when I did that solo. [...] They weren't expecting it and it was just <b>some</b> <b>weird</b> mist coming from the East out of an amp. [...] Giorgio was freaking out and dancing about like some tribal witch doctor". [...] Beck played the solo on one string(G), using a 1954 Fender Esquire guitar he had purchased before the tour. Relf also benefitted from multi-tracking—two vocal tracks were recorded, allowing him to harmonise the vocal line.|$|E

The Guardians Geoffrey Cannon viewed Parks' lyrics as [...] "pretentious", believing that Parks [...] "messed Brian up" [...] during Smiley Smile. Pastes Bryan Rolli ranked it at number 2 in {{a list of the}} [...] "10 Most Disappointing Follow-Up Albums", calling it a [...] "disjointed collection of minimalist recordings and a capella bits that are not so much songs as fragments of a shattered psyche". In the 2004 edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, the reviewer described Smiley Smile as [...] "inconsistent" [...] and said that, given the context of its release in September 1967, [...] "the album was like a strange throwback – it highlighted how out of touch these suburban California surfers had become with the psychedelic times." ...|$|E
500|$|Peirce {{wanted to}} tell the story from Brandon's perspective. She was {{familiar}} with Brandon's desire to wear men's clothing: [...] "I started looking at all the other coverage {{and a great deal of}} it was sensational. People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people. Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not <b>some</b> <b>weird</b> person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person." [...] Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public were generally misinformed: she said, [...] "People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that's really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence that we live in". Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title Take It Like a Man.|$|E

The members of the Kinks were featured as the band performing at the palais {{at the end of the}} video, with the spiv character solemnly watching the performance. Temple said of this scene, [...] "I was standing behind [...] Scorcese at a bar, and he was going on about that shot, saying it was one of his favorites ever.

500|$|Favreau {{planned to}} cast a {{newcomer}} in the title role, as [...] "those movies don't require an expensive star; Iron Man's the star, the superhero is the star. The success of X-Men and Spider-Man without being star-driven pieces reassures [...] that the film does have an upside commercially." [...] However, in September 2006, Robert Downey, Jr. was cast in the role. Favreau chose Downey, {{a fan of the}} comic, because he felt the actor's past made him an appropriate choice for the part, explaining [...] "The best and worst moments of Robert's life have been in the public eye. He had to find an inner balance to overcome obstacles that went far beyond his career. That's Tony Stark." [...] Favreau faced opposition from Marvel in casting Downey, but would not take no for an answer, saying, [...] "It was my job as a director to show that it was the best choice creatively ... everybody knew he was talented [...] certainly by studying the Iron Man role and developing that script I realized that the character seemed to line-up with Robert in all the good and bad ways. While preparing for filming, Favreau and Downey were given a tour of SpaceX by Elon Musk.

500|$|Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave a {{positive}} review of both Liz and Jack's plot, {{but was not}} favorable towards Jenna and Tracy's, opining that [...] "Floyd" [...] {{was one of those}} episodes of 30 Rock where their plot [...] "really dragged the show down." [...] He reported that he felt bad for Liz [...] "because of all the guys [...] has dated over these four seasons, 's the one she should end up with." [...] Sassone hoped the episode would have concluded with the two finding out [...] "something horrible" [...] about Floyd's fiancée [...] "or maybe we'd find out that Floyd did all of this just to get close to Liz again in <b>some</b> <b>weird</b> way". Like Sassone, Time contributor James Poniewozik said that the Floyd character [...] "was one of the better drawn boyfriends for Liz". Further in his recap, Poniewozik was [...] "a little disappointed" [...] that the episode brought him back [...] "to get sloppy drunk, to tell off Liz... and to get engaged to a vapid-seeming 'ab model.'" [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger commented that Sudeikis's return gave Tina Fey's Liz [...] "one of her more down-to-earth and relatable stories in a while", and enjoyed the Frank, Toofer, and Lutz rivalry with Jack and Danny, as well as Pete's involvement in the Jenna and Tracy story. Overall, Sepinwall said that the episode did not [...] "really hang together for me." ...|$|E
500|$|Kid Icarus had shipped 1.76 {{million copies}} {{worldwide}} by late 2003, and {{has gained a}} cult following. Game Informer ranked it the 83rd best game ever made in 2001. They claimed that despite its high level of difficulty and frustration, it was fun enough to be worth playing. The game has been met with mixed reviews from critics over the years. In October 1992, a staff writer of the UK publication Nintendo Magazine System said that Kid Icarus was [...] "pretty good fun", but did not [...] "compare too well" [...] to other platform games, owing in part to its [...] "rather dated" [...] graphics. Retro Gamer magazine's Stuart Hunt called Kid Icarus an [...] "unsung hero of the NES" [...] that [...] "looks and sounds pretty". He described the music by Hirokazu Tanaka as [...] "sublime", and the enemy characters as [...] "brilliantly drawn". Although he considered the blend of gameplay elements from different genres a success, he said that Kid Icarus suffered from [...] "frustrating" [...] design flaws, such as its high difficulty level. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com expressed his disagreement with the game's status as an [...] "unfairly forgotten masterpiece" [...] among its substantial Internet following. He found Kid Icarus to be [...] "underwhelming", [...] "buggy" [...] and [...] "pretty annoying", and noted that it exhibited [...] "shrill music loose controls and <b>some</b> <b>weird</b> design decisions". Notwithstanding his disapproval of these elements, Parish said that the game was [...] " [...] terrible, or even bad – just a little lacking." [...] He recommended players to buy the Virtual Console version, if only because it allowed them to experience Kid Icarus [...] "with a fresh perspective".|$|E
