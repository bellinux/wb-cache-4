50|$|While AGM cells do {{not permit}} {{watering}} (typically {{it is impossible to}} add water without drilling a hole in the battery), their recombination process is fundamentally limited by the usual chemical processes. Hydrogen gas will even diffuse right through the plastic case itself. Some have found that it is profitable to add water to an AGM battery, but this must be done slowly to allow for the water to mix via diffusion throughout the battery. When a lead-acid battery loses water, its acid concentration increases, increasing the corrosion rate of the plates significantly. AGM cells already have a high acid content in an attempt to lower the water loss rate and increase <b>standby</b> <b>voltage,</b> and this brings about short life. If the open circuit voltage of AGM cells is significantly higher than 2.093 volts, or 12.56 V for a 12 V battery, then they have a higher acid content than a flooded cell; while this is normal for an AGM battery, it is not desirable for long life.|$|E

40|$|Estimation {{of static}} and dynamic energy of caches is {{critical}} for high-performance low-power designs. Commercial CAD tools performing energy estimation statically {{are not aware of}} the changing operating and environmental conditions which makes the problem of energy estimation more dynamic in nature. It is worsened by process induced variations of low level parameters like threshold voltage and channel length. In this paper we present MODEST, a proposal for estimating the static and dynamic energy of caches taking into account spatial variations of physical parameters, temporal changes of supply voltage and environmental factors like temperature. It can be used to estimate the energy of different blocks of a cache based on a combination empirical data and analytical equations. The observed maximum and median error between MODEST and HSPICE energy-estimates for 22, 500 samples is around 7. 8 % and 0. 5 % respectively.

40|$|Abstract — scaling is an {{efficient}} technique to reduce SRAM leakage power during standby mode. The data retention voltage (DRV) defines the minimum {{that can be}} applied to an SRAM cell without losing data. The conventional worst-case guard-banding approach selects a fixed <b>standby</b> supply <b>voltage</b> at design time to accommodate the variability of DRV, which sacrifices potential power savings for non-worst-case scenarios. We have proposed a canary-based feedback to achieve aggressive power savings by tracking PVT variations through canary cell failures. In this paper, we show new measured silicon results that confirm the ability of the canary scheme to track PVT changes. We thoroughly analyze the adaptiveness of the canary cells for tracking changes in the SRAM array, including the ability to track PVT fluctuations. We present circuits for robustly building the control logic that implements the feedback mechanism at subthreshold supply voltages, and we derive a new analytical model to help tune the canary cells in the presence of variations. To realistically quantify the potential savings achievable by the canary scheme, we assess the impact of various sources of over-head. Finally, we investigate the performance of the canary based scheme in nanometer technologies, and we show that it promises to provide substantial standby power savings down to the 22 nm node.

The problem of short lifetime was traced to evaporation of silicon, used in the tungsten alloy to make the heater wire easier to draw. Elimination of silicon from the heater wire alloy (and more frequent replacement of the wire drawing dies) allowed production of tubes that were reliable enough for the Whirlwind project. The tubes developed for Whirlwind were later used in the giant SAGE air-defense computer system. SAGE computers were dual installations, with one operating, {{and the other in}} standby. To locate potential tube failures in the <b>standby</b> computer, heater <b>voltages</b> were reduced, which caused failures of tubes which would otherwise fail in service.

40|$|Abstract: Leakage {{components}} is {{very important}} for estimation and reduction of leakage power, especially for low power applications. This provides the motivation to explore the design of low leakage SRAM cells. High leakage currents in deep submicron regimes are becoming a major contributor to total power dissipation of CMOS circuits as the threshold voltage, channel length and gate oxide thickness are scaled. Memory leakage suppression is critically important for the success of power-efficient designs, especially for ultra- low power applications. As the channel length of the MOSFET reduces, the leakage current in the SRAM increases. One method is to reduce the <b>standby</b> supply <b>voltage</b> (VDD) to its limit, which is the Data retention voltage (DRV), leakage power can be substantially reduced. Also, lower operating voltage will lower the stability of SRAM cell resulting in lower value of static noise margin. To reduce the sub-threshold leakage further, an adaptive voltage level (AVL) circuit is added to this cell, which controls the effective voltage across the SRAM cell in inactive mode. Two schemes are employed; one in which the supply voltage is reduced and the other in which the ground potential is increased. CADENCE Simulations are performed with 90 nm CMOS technology process file and the leakage currents of all the cells are measured and compared. Simulation results revealed that there is a significant reduction in leakage current for this proposed cell with the AVL circuit reducing the supply voltage...|$|R

In {{order to minimize}} leakage power while preserving data reliably, existing low-power design methods use a worst-case <b>standby</b> supply <b>voltage.</b> This worstcase voltage {{is larger than the}} highest DRV among all cells in an SRAM.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{reducing}} power during data-retention in a standby {{static random access memory}} (SRAM). For successful data-retention, the supply voltage of an SRAM cell should be greater than a critical data retention voltage (DRV).

For reliable data retention, the existing low-power design uses a worst-case technique in which a <b>standby</b> supply <b>voltage</b> that is larger than the highest DRV among all cells in an SRAM is used.

This paper presents {{a description of the}} facility and the measurement method, as well as results from two new products of ASP, Laupen, Switzerland with 150 and 250 W(AC) output power and input voltages of 12 and 24 VDC, respectively. Both are sinusoidal-type inverters, producing grid-quality power, suitable for all applications. Maximum efficiencies of 89 and 90 % were measured, indicating large improvement in performance during the last 15 years. Both efficiencies closely agree with the manufacturer's specification of 90 and 92 %. The output voltage at nominal output power was 213 and 221 VAC, i. e. somewhat too low for the 12 VDC inverter. The standby losses were found to be 1. 8 and 3. 3 W, respectively. The latter is 32 % higher than specified by the manufacturer. Improvements are suggested regarding the reduction of losses and the cooling of the transistors. The question as to whether pulsating current withdrawal from battery storage, caused by sinusoidal inverters, has a negative impact on the battery's lifetime, cannot be answered from the tests performed so far. The specific retail prices (excluding Value Added Tax, VAT) of the inverters tested are 1. 1 and 0. 84 Dollars per Watt output power for the 12 and 24 V inverter, showing a cost reduction of approximately a factor of two over the last 15 years.

In this research, the combined effect of NBTI and PBTI on power gated SRAM is analyzed. Optimal source biasing in the standby mode is presented as an effective method for guard-banding against the aging effects. The simulations results in a predictive 32 nm technology shows maximum of 1. 6 % reduction in standby SNM over 5 year lifetime. For optimum operation, by decreasing the <b>standby</b> source bias <b>voltage</b> by only 0. 012 volts, the SNM is safely margined for 5 year life time. This guard-banding comes at an insignificant power overhead of 0. 6 % for applied worse case scenarios. Given the insignificant power overhead with such guard-banding, it is concluded that adaptive tuning of the source biasing voltage is not required, given the not so negligible complexity and overhead associated with adaptive techniques. Furthermore we present a perspective for using CNTFET technology on SRAM cells, and quantify our results by comparing the performance parameters of 6 T SRAM Cell between lOnm CNTFET technology and 16 nm (PTM) CMOS.

A behavioral level {{framework for the}} synthesis of data-paths with low leakage power is presented. There has been minimal work done on the behavioral synthesis of low leakage datapaths. We present a fast architectural simulator for leakage (FASL) to estimate the leakage power dissipated by a system described hierarchically in VHDL. FASL uses a leakage power model embedded into VHDL leafcells. These leafcells are characterized for leakage accurately using HSPICE. We present results which show that FASL measures leakage power significantly faster than HSPICE, {{with less than a}} 5 % loss in accuracy, compared to HSPICE. We present a comprehensive framework for synthesizing low leakage power data-paths using a parameterized Multi-threshold CMOS (MTCMOS) component library. The component library has been characterized for leakage power and delay as a function of sleep transistor width. We propose four techniques for minimization of leakage power during behavioral synthesis: (1) leakage power management using MTCMOS modules; (2) an allocation and binding algorithm for low leakage based on clique partitioning; (3) selective binding to MTCMOS technology, allowing the designer to have control over the area overhead; and (4) a performance recovery technique based on multi-cycling and introduction of slack, to alleviate the loss in performance attributed to the introduction of MTCMOS modules in the data-path. Finally, we propose two iterative search based techniques, based on Tabu search, to synthesize low leakage data-paths. The first technique searches for low leakage scheduling options. The second technique simultaneously searches for a low leakage schedule and binding. It is shown that the latter technique of unified search is more robust. The quality of results generated bytabu-based technique are superior to those generated by simulated annealing (SA) search technique...|$|R
