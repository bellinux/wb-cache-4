50|$|Entelurus aequoreus, the <b>Snake</b> <b>{{pipefish}},</b> is {{a species}} of pipefish native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean where they are generally found amongst algae close in to shore. This species grows to a length of 60 cm TL for females and 40 cm TL for males with most individuals reaching a length of about 45 cm TL for females and 32 cm TL for males. This species is the only known member of its genus. This species is a popular denizen of public aquariums.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 2000 s routine fish surveys have {{recorded}} {{increasing numbers of}} <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Entelurus aequoreus, in the northeast Atlantic. Fishermen and divers have also commented on this increase and pipefish have started {{to appear in the}} diet of seabirds and other marine predators. This paper collates information from these diverse sources and assesses the current status of <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish.</b> We found compelling evidence of a dramatic and continuing increase in the abundance of <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> starting around 2003. The population is probably still increasing rapidly and expanding northwards to Spitzbergen and the Barents Sea. In 2004 and 2005 <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> were also recorded in the diet of many species of seabird, breeding in colonies around the coast of the UK, and in Norway, Iceland and the Faeroe Islands. Information on the nutrient value of <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> is currently lacking but their rigid, bony structure makes them difficult for young seabirds to swallow and there are numerous records of chicks choking to death. Thus for seabirds, at least, it appears unlikely that increased abundance of <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> will provide a useful alternative prey during the breeding season. The reason for the rapid and dramatic increase in numbers of <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> is currently unclear but such events are characteristic of marine ecosystems and will almost certainly have an effect on food web dynamics.

40|$|In 2004, {{a sudden}} mass {{occurrence}} of <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> Entelurus aequoreus {{took place in}} the Northeastern Atlantic and the abundance has been increasing since. Before 2004, <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> were mainly found in coastal areas and have been reported only occasionally in oceanic waters. The oceanic form lives free in the water column while the coastal form is found among sea weeds or in sea grass beds. Abundance indices (numbers per hour fishing) from inshore surveys have remained at the same level, while those from offshore surveys show a very strong increase since 2004. The length distributions differ significantly between surveys, with coastal snake pipefishes being larger. Although the outward appearance of the coastal pipefishes seems different from the pelagic specimens, no differences were found when comparing taxonomic features. Apart from appearance the habitat is different for the two types of <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> Entelurus aequoreus is {{a member}} of the Syngnathidae family. The open water species is {{distributed}} in the eastern Atlantic, from the Azores to Iceland and Norway, including the Baltic Sea. Concentrations of <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> were observed for the first time in the Barents Sea in August–October 2005, after which both their distribution area and average density have increased substantially in 2006. The area inhabited by these fish increased three-fold from 2005 to 2006, using data from pelagic trawling. The density in these areas rose from an average of 2. 4 to 9. 3 caught fish per nautical mile of trawling. However, using trawl data to measure abundance may not be the most adequate method due to little knowledge of the behavioural patterns of this fish species. <b>Snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> have historically usually been associated with warmer temperate waters, so it is interesting to note that the increase in numbers may coincide with exceptionally high sea surface temperatures for that time of year. We plan to investigate this relationship in further detail with collection of relevant data in 2007. Keywords: Snake pipefish; distribution pattern; Barents Sea: climate change...|$|E
40|$|Ecological {{forecasts}} {{predict the}} immigration of boreal species into Arctic waters as one consequence of rising sea temperatures. Here, we report {{the finding of}} Atlantic <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> (Entelurus aequoreus) off the western coast of Spitsbergen at 79 °N in August 2006. This syngnathid fish species, which was presumed to be confined to waters south of Iceland, has dramatically increased in population size in its core distribution area in the northeastern Atlantic since 2002, probably in response to greater reproduction success due to higher water temperatures. We conclude that our finding {{is an indication of}} the predicted northward extension of the distribution range of boreal species...|$|E
40|$|Pipefish (Syngnathidae) have {{occurred}} with unprecedented frequency in Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) samples {{to the west}} of the British Isles from 2003 to 2005. Identification by mtDNA sequencing established that they were <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Entelurus aequoreus. The geographical range of the records were from the outer continental shelf of the Celtic Sea and north-west of Ireland to the mid-Atlantic Ridge between 40 ° and 57 °N, with the greatest abundance near the shelf edge and adjacent oceanic waters south of Ireland and west of Brittany. There were records in every month from February to November but most were in late spring and summer. A proposed mechanism for the increase in abundance of the species is that recent climate change has had beneficial impacts on the reproduction of adults and the survival of larvae and juveniles...|$|E
40|$|We report {{unprecedented}} {{numbers of}} juvenile <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Entelurus aequoreus, in continuous plankton {{records of the}} Northeastern Atlantic since 2002. Increased sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the Northern Hemisphere, linked to global warming, are a likely cause. Analysis of a long-term time-series of SST data in the Northeastern Atlantic shows a rise in winter, spring and summer sea temperatures (January–September), when the eggs of E. aqueoreus, which are brooded by the male, are developing and the larvae are growing in plankton. From what is known of the reproductive biology of closely related species, we suggest that the increased abundance of larval and juvenile E. aequoreus in the plankton as far west as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge may reflect the impact of temperature on abundance, through its effects on the operational sex ratio and potential reproductive rate, {{the onset of the}} breeding season and juvenile survival in this sex role reversed fish...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal time-series of {{temperature}} and salinity around Iceland have been collected, with repeat observations at stations, {{since the start}} of the 1970 s. After fairly cold years during the early 1990 s, a reversal occurred during the mid- 1990 s and the period from 1996 to 2010 was one with warmer, more saline water in shelf seas around Iceland. Temperatures and salinities have been frequently above the long-term mean in the waters to the south and west of the country, and these conditions have also influenced the shelf area north of the country. Marked changes have also been observed in the distribution of many fish species during this warm period. Southern commercial species have extended farther north (e. g. haddock, monkfish, mackerel), a northern species is retreating (capelin), rare species and vagrants have been observed more frequently (e. g. greater fork beard, blue antimora, <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish,</b> sea lamprey, Ray’s bream), and 31 species, from both shelf and oceanic waters, have been recorded for the first time since 1996. The most obvious explanation for these changes in the ecosystem has to be the warming of 1 – 28 C in the waters south and west of Iceland during the past 15 years...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{analysis}} of Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) samples is enabling greater taxonomic resolution {{and the study}} of plankton population structure. Here, we present some results from the genetic {{analysis of}} CPR samples collected in the North Sea and north-eastern Atlantic that reveal the impacts of climate on benthic-pelagic coupling and the food web. We show that pronounced changes in the North Sea meroplankton are related to an increased abundance and spatial distribution of the larvae of the benthic echinoderm, Echinocardium cordatum. Key stages of reproduction in E. cordatum, gametogenesis and spawning, are influenced by winter and spring sea temperature (January-May). A stepwise increase in sea temperature after 1987, which has created warmer conditions earlier in the year, together with increased summer phytoplankton, may benefit the reproduction and survival of this benthic species. Competition between the larvae of E. cordatum and other holozooplanlcton taxa may now be altering the trophodynamics of the summer pelagic ecosystem. In the north-eastern Atlantic the genetic analysis of fish larvae sampled by the CPR has revealed an unprecedented increase in the abundance of juvenile <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish,</b> Entelurus aequoreiis since 2002. We argue that increased sea surface temperatures in winter and spring when the eggs of E. aqueoreus, which are brooded by the male, are developing and the young larvae are growing in the plankton are a likely cause. The increased abundance of this species in Atlantic and adjacent European seas already appears to be influencing the marine food web...|$|E
40|$|Local {{differences}} in feeding conditions {{have been suggested}} {{as a cause of}} regional variation in seabird demography but multi-colony comparisons of diet are rare. In UK waters the main fish eaten by seabirds during the breeding season belong to three families: Ammodytidae, Clupeidae and Gadidae. Climate change and fishing are affecting these fish stocks and so probably impact on predators such as seabirds. We used standardized observations of prey brought in for chicks to make the first integrated assessment of the diet of Common Guillemot Uria aalge chicks at a UK scale. Chick diet varied markedly among the 23 colonies sampled between 2006 and 2011. Sandeels (Ammodytidae), probably Lesser Sandeels Ammodytes marinus, were the commonest prey. Their contribution to the diet varied both latitudinally and among marine regions, with the proportion significantly higher for a given latitude on the west coast compared to the east. The non-sandeel component of the diet showed latitudinal changes, with small clupeids, probably Sprats Sprattus sprattus, predominant at southern colonies whereas juvenile gadids were the main alternative to sandeels in the north. Comparison of our Guillemot chick diet with data collected 15 – 30 years earlier suggests that the proportion of sandeels in the diet has decreased at colonies bordering the North Sea. No significant change was apparent in Atlantic colonies but historical data were limited. The early years of our study coincided with a population explosion of <b>Snake</b> <b>Pipefish</b> Entelurus aequoreus in the Northeast Atlantic and North Sea. Pipefish were recorded in Guillemot chick diet at several northern and northwestern colonies in 2006 and 2007 but have been absent since 2009. Spatial and temporal variation in chick diet accorded broadly with patterns expected as a result of rising sea temperatures and impacts of fishing. Guillemot chick diet could potentially be a useful indicator of changes in the distribution and abundance of forage fish. ...|$|E
40|$|Abundances of warm-water {{fish species}} (e. g. red mullet, john dory, triggerfish) have {{increased}} in UK waters during recent decades, while many coldwater species have experienced declines. There has been a massive influx of <b>snake</b> <b>pipefish</b> to UK waters since 2004, but unusual fish occurrences or sudden proliferations of species cannot definitively be attributed to climate change. A number of commercial and non-commercial fish species are suggested to have exhibited shifts in mean latitude over the past 25 years. Poor ‘recruitment’ in traditional fishery target species such as cod, plaice and herring {{may be related to}} a shift in the composition of zooplankton, which are a key prey for developing larvae. In some parts of the southern North Sea, cold-water species, such as cod and eelpout, have been shown to experience metabolic stress during warm years, as evidenced by slower growth rates and difficulties in supplying oxygen to body tissues. Climate change will have far-reaching impacts on the dynamics of fish populations, however knowledge of underlying mechanisms is rather limited, especially in non-commercial species. Excessive fishing pressure has caused fish populations to become more vulnerable to short-term natural climate variability by removing the oldest individuals, and making such populations less able to ‘buffer’ against occasional poor year classes. In the short term, climate change will have little influence on fish stock recovery, which depends instead upon reducing fishing effort to allow existing year classes to survive to maturity. Climate-related shifts in species distribution, behavior and depth preference may affect the ‘catchability’ of certain stocks to fishing fleets. Long-term climate change may affect the overall productivity of fish stocks in a given area. Some species may be adversely affected leading to reductions in sustainable yield whilst others, for example seabass, red mullet and John Dory, may be positively affected leading to enhanced fishing opportunities...|$|E
