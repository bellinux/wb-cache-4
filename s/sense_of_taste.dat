5|$|Porpoises are {{not thought}} {{to have a good}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste,</b> as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some have {{preferences}} between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.|$|E
5|$|Horses have an {{advanced}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste,</b> which {{allows them to}} sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat, and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.|$|E

5|$|The sperm whale's {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} in all mammalia, both in absolute and relative terms. The olfactory system is reduced, suggesting that the sperm whale has a poor <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell. By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. The pyramidal tract is poorly developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste.</b> They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E
5|$|Part {{of the new}} {{genre of}} the Romantic travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors {{demonstrate}} their desire to develop a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and distinguish themselves from those around them. The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical politics to nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise of Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> {{and smell}} {{are not very}} {{important}} to the diver in the water but more important to the saturation diver while in accommodation chambers.

5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills. Probably {{as a result of these}} factors and overwork, in 1963, when she was 49, David suffered a cerebral haemorrhage. She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E
25|$|The {{alterations}} in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste,</b> usually a metallic taste, and sometimes smell {{are the only}} symptoms. The duration of the symptoms of dysgeusia depends on the cause. If the alteration in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> is due to gum disease, dental plaque, a temporary medication, or a short-term condition such as a cold, the dysgeusia should disappear once the cause is removed. In some cases, if lesions {{are present in the}} taste pathway and nerves have been damaged, the dysgeusia may be permanent.|$|E
25|$|Dysgeusia, {{also known}} as parageusia, is a {{distortion}} of the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste.</b> Dysgeusia is also often associated with ageusia, which is the complete lack of taste, and hypogeusia, which is a decrease in taste sensitivity. An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, {{or it may be}} the primary symptom. The distortion in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> is the only symptom, and diagnosis is usually complicated since the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> is tied together with other sensory systems. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Different drugs could also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.|$|E
25|$|Martineau began {{losing her}} <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell {{at a young}} age, {{becoming}} increasingly deaf and having to use an ear trumpet.

25|$|Dolphins are {{not thought}} {{to have a good}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste,</b> as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether. However, some have {{preferences}} between different kinds of fish, indicating some sort of attachment to taste.|$|E
25|$|Saliva is very {{important}} in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste.</b> It is the liquid medium in which chemicals are carried to taste receptor cells (mostly associated with lingual papillae). Persons with little saliva often complain of dysgeusia (i.e. disordered taste, e.g. reduced ability to taste, or having a bad, metallic taste at all times).|$|E
25|$|In humans, the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> is {{conveyed}} via {{three of}} the twelve cranial nerves. The chorda tympani is responsible for taste sensations from the anterior {{two thirds of the}} tongue, the glossopharyngeal nerve (IX) is responsible for taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the vagus nerve (X) carries some taste sensations {{from the back of the}} oral cavity.|$|E
5000|$|Flavor (American English) or Flavour (British English; see {{spelling}} differences) is {{the sensory}} impression of food or other substance, and is determined {{primarily by the}} chemical <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell. The [...] "trigeminal senses", which detect chemical irritants in the mouth and throat, as well as temperature and texture, are also important to the overall gestalt of flavor perception. The flavor of the food, as such, can be altered with natural or artificial flavorants which affect these senses.|$|R

50|$|Dr. Kare taught {{physiology}} at Cornell University, North Carolina State University and the University of Pennsylvania. Although {{his early}} research focused on muscle biochemistry and metabolism, he became increasingly {{interested in the}} <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell and how these senses contribute to nutrition and food choice across species. Kare is best remembered for founding the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a multidisciplinary basic research institute devoted to the science <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He served as the Center’s first Director from 1968 {{until his death in}} 1990, at which point Dr. Gary Beauchamp took over.|$|R
25|$|Bender Bending Rodriguez (John DiMaggio) – Bender is a foul-mouthed, heavy-drinking, cigar-smoking, kleptomaniacal, misanthropic, egocentric, ill-tempered robot {{manufactured}} by Mom's Friendly Robot Company. He is originally programmed to bend girders for suicide booths, and is later designated as assistant sales manager and cook, despite lacking a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste.</b> He is Fry's {{best friend and}} roommate. He must drink heavily to power his fuel cells and becomes the human equivalent of drunk when low on alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Earth's {{surface is}} {{situated}} fairly {{deep in a}} gravity well. The escape velocity required {{to get out of}} it is 11.2 kilometers/second. As human beings evolved in a gravitational field of 1g (9.8m/s²), an ideal propulsion system would be one that provides a continuous acceleration of 1g (though human bodies can tolerate much larger accelerations over short periods). The occupants of a rocket or spaceship having such a propulsion system would be free from all the ill effects of free fall, such as nausea, muscular weakness, reduced <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste,</b> or leaching of calcium from their bones.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} further {{classify}} {{the extent of}} dysgeusia and clinically measure the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste,</b> gustatory testing may be performed. Gustatory testing is performed either as a whole-mouth procedure or as a regional test. In both techniques, natural or electrical stimuli can be used. In regional testing, 20 to 50 µL of liquid stimulus is presented to the anterior and posterior tongue using a pipette, soaked filter-paper disks, or cotton swabs. In whole mouth testing, small quantities (2-10 mL) of solution are administered, and the patient is asked to swish the solution around in the mouth.|$|E
50|$|Although {{food is a}} {{basic and}} {{frequently}} experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into gastronomy. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire our <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell using spices, diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to drinking water, there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including odour, colour, total dissolved solids and clarity. There are numerical standards in the U.S. for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters.|$|R

25|$|In most cases, {{the first}} symptom of {{narcolepsy}} to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin {{alone or in}} combination months or years after {{the onset of the}} daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not. A rare subset of narcoleptics also experience a heightened <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell known as the supertaster phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> {{is based}} on the {{detection}} of chemicals by specialized taste cells in the mouth. The mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus all have taste buds, which are replaced every ten days. Each taste bud contains receptor cells. Afferent nerves make contact with the receptor cells {{at the base of the}} taste bud. A single taste bud is innervated by several afferent nerves, while a single efferent fiber innervates several taste buds. Fungiform papillae are present on the anterior portion of the tongue while circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae are found on the posterior portion of the tongue. The salivary glands are responsible for keeping the taste buds moist with saliva.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} {{weightlessness}} on humans {{is that some}} astronauts report a change in their <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> when in space. Some astronauts find that their food is bland, others find that their favorite foods no longer taste as good (one who enjoyed coffee disliked the taste so much on a mission that he stopped drinking it after returning to Earth); some astronauts enjoy eating certain foods {{that they would not}} normally eat, and some experience no change whatsoever. Multiple tests have not identified the cause, and several theories have been suggested, including food degradation, and psychological changes such as boredom. Astronauts often choose strong-tasting food to combat the loss of taste.|$|E
50|$|Most fish possess highly {{developed}} sense organs. Nearly all daylight fish have color vision {{that is at}} least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and <b>senses</b> the motion <b>of</b> nearby fish and prey. Sharks can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 Hz through their lateral line.|$|R
