50|$|The type-host {{and only}} {{recorded}} host of Pseudorhabdosynochus tumeovagina is the <b>Speckled</b> <b>hind,</b> Epinephelus drummondhayi (Serranidae: Epinephelinae). The type-locality and only recorded locality is Florida Middle Grounds, Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

50|$|Kritsky, Bakenhaster & Adams (2015) {{noted that}} the species was based on {{specimens}} obtained from one of two <b>speckled</b> <b>hind</b> examined for gill parasites and held in the ichthyology collection of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The infected <b>speckled</b> <b>hind</b> was collected in 1972 and was not fixed and preserved with its external parasites in mind. As a result, the specimens of Pseudorhabdosynochus tumeovagina from this fish were in generally poor shape, {{and many of the}} internal features, particularly those of the male and female reproductive systems, could not be determined. Nonetheless, the unique vaginal sclerite clearly indicated the species to be new to science.|$|E
50|$|Epinephelus drummondhayi is {{a species}} of fish in the family Serranidae. It is {{commonly}} called the calico grouper, kitty mitchell, <b>speckled</b> <b>hind,</b> or strawberry grouper. It is found in Bermuda and the United States. Its natural habitats are open seas, shallow seas, subtidal aquatic beds, and coral reefs. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E

Juvenile specimens tend to have yellow body color with white spots (Ross 1988). Speckled hinds are deep-water groupers: adults inhabit offshore rocky bottoms in depths of 80 to 1300 feet (25 to 400 m) but are most common between 200 and 400 feet (60 and 120 m) {{in many areas of}} the Western Atlantic.|$|E

40|$|There {{is broad}} {{interest}} {{in the development of}} efficient marine protected areas (MPAs) to reduce bycatch and end overfishing of <b>speckled</b> <b>hind</b> (Epinephelus drummondhayi) and warsaw grouper (Hyporthodus nigritus) in the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern U. S. We assimilated decades of data from many fishery-dependent, fishery-independent, and anecdotal sources to describe the spatial distribution of these data limited stocks. A spatial classification model was developed to categorize depth-grids based on the distribution of <b>speckled</b> <b>hind</b> and warsaw grouper point observations and identified benthic habitats. Logistic regression analysis was used to develop a quantitative model to predict the spatial distribution of <b>speckled</b> <b>hind</b> and warsaw grouper as a function of depth, latitude, and habitat. Models, controlling for sampling gear effects, were selected based on AIC and 10 -fold cross validation. The best-fitting model for warsaw grouper included latitude and depth to explain 10. 8 % of the variability in probability of detection, with a false prediction rate of 28 – 33 %. The best-fitting model for <b>speckled</b> <b>hind,</b> per cross-validation, included latitude and depth to explain 36. 8 % of the variability in probability of detection, with a false prediction rate of 25 – 27 %. The best-fitting <b>speckled</b> <b>hind</b> model, per AIC, also included habitat, but had false prediction rates up to 36 %. <b>Speckled</b> <b>hind</b> and warsaw grouper habitats followed a shelf-edge hardbottom ridge from North Carolina to southeast Florida, with <b>speckled</b> <b>hind</b> more common to the north and warsaw grouper more common to the south.

40|$|The Tortugas South Ecological Reserve, {{located along}} {{the margin of}} the {{southwest}} Florida carbonate platform, is part of the largest no-take marine reserve in the U. S. Established in July 2001, the reserve is approximately 206 km 2 in area, and ranges in depths from 30 m at Riley’s Hump to over 600 m at the southern edge of the reserve. Geological and biological information for the Tortugas South Reserve is lacking, and critical for management of the area. Bathymetric surveys were conducted with a Simrad EM 3000 multibeam echosounder at Riley’s Hump and Miller’s Ledge, located in the northern and central part of the reserve. Resulting data were used to produce basemaps to obtain geological ground truth and visual surveys of biological communities, including reef fishes. Visual surveys were conducted using SCUBA and the Phantom S 2 Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) at Riley’s Hump. Visual surveys were conducted using the ROV and the Deepworker 2000 research submersible along Miller’s Ledge, within and outside of the reserve. A total of 108 fishes were recorded during SCUBA, ROV, and submersible observations. Replicate survey transects resulted in over 50 fishes documented at Miller’s Ledge, and eight of the top ten most abundant species were planktivores. Many species of groupers, including scamp (Mycteroperca phenax), red grouper (Epinephelus morio), snowy grouper (E. niveatus), <b>speckled</b> <b>hind</b> (E. drummondhayi), and Warsaw grouper (E. nigritus), are present in the sanctuary. Numerous aggregations of scamp and a bicolor phase of the Warsaw grouper were observed, indicating the importance of Miller’s Ledge as a potential spawning location for both commercially important and rare deep reef species, and as a potential source of larval recruits for the Florida Keys and other deep reef ecosystems of Florid...|$|E
