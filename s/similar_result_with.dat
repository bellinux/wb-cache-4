5|$|In 2012, McDonald {{conducted}} a phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts incorporating data from new Eolambia specimens. Contrary to previous authors, he found instead that Eolambia was the sister group of Probactrosaurus. This close relationship {{was based on}} two shared characteristics: the quadrate being straight save for the top end, which is curved backwards; and {{the top and bottom}} margins of the scapular blade being nearly parallel. Wenjie Zheng and colleagues added Jintasaurus to the group in 2014, while José Gasca and colleagues recovered the original group in 2015. However, McDonald extensively revised his phylogenetic dataset further in preparation for the 2017 description of the FMNH specimens. As with Horner and colleagues, as well as Prieto-Márquez and Norell, McDonald and colleagues found that Eolambia was the sister group of Protohadros, with both of them being placed as basal hadrosauromorphs (results reproduced below). Using the 2012 version of the McDonald dataset, Francisco Verdú and colleagues independently recovered a <b>similar</b> <b>result,</b> <b>with</b> Eolambia being closely related to Protohadros and Jeyawati; however, McDonald and colleagues found the latter to be more derived in 2017.|$|E

60|$|The chief {{types of}} {{flowering}} plants have existed during {{the millions of}} ages of the whole tertiary period, and during this enormous lapse of time many of them may have been modified {{in the direction of}} insect fertilisation, and again into that of self-fertilisation, not once or twice only, but perhaps scores or even hundreds of times; and at each such modification a difference in the environment may have led to a distinct line of development. At one epoch the highest specialisation of structure in adaptation to a single species or group of insects may have saved a plant from extinction; while, at other times, the simplest mode of self-fertilisation, combined with greater powers of dispersal and a constitution capable of supporting diverse physical conditions, may have led to a <b>similar</b> <b>result.</b> <b>With</b> some groups the tendency seems to have been almost continuously to greater and greater specialisation, while with others a tendency to simplification and degradation has resulted in such plants as the grasses and sedges.|$|E

50|$|To {{comply with}} this, mopeds {{typically}} include some method of onboard speed restriction {{to prevent the}} machine exceeding the prescribed speed (on a flat road, in still air, with a rider of standard height and weight).

Other systems achieved a <b>similar</b> <b>result</b> <b>with</b> simple restrictor flaps in the air intake, much like those used to restrict the power output of full-size motorcycles.
