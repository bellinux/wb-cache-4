50|$|Tillmans {{exhibited}} {{his first}} abstract and damaged pictures as a Parkett edition in 1998. The edition, 60 unique works on color-negative photographic paper {{collected by the}} artist since he began colour printing in 1990, {{was a combination of}} true darkroom mistakes and years of darkroom experimentation that they inspired. The Silver works, which Tillmans has been creating since 1998, reflect the reaction of the photographic paper to light, as well as mechanical and chemical processes. The name Silver arises from the dirt traces and <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> <b>stains</b> that remain on the paper when the artist develops the photographs in a machine that is filled with water and has not been completely cleaned.|$|R
40|$|Cytochemical {{analyses}} {{was used}} to study the organization and content of cortical alveoli in eight species of Antarctic teleosts belonging to three different families of notothenioids: nototheniids, bathydraconids and channichthyids. Results indicated differences existed among the various species in alveolar size and distribution and in their content. In nototheniids, in particular, typical nucleoids were formed that could be large and single or small and multiple, according to the species considered. As demonstrated by the affinity to periodic acid‐Schiff (PAS) and lectin staining, these nucleoids were rich in glycoconjugates, whose nature was extremely varied in the different species, but not in lipo‐ or acidic proteins as indicated by Sudan Black B and <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> <b>staining.</b> Protein extracts, electrophoresed and stained with Sudan, PAS and two lectins demonstrated that the alveoli in the two species, Trematomus bernacchii and Trematomus newnesi, contained c. 80 kDa protein rich in N‐acetylglucosamine groups. By contrast, the typical hyosophorins, described as the major alveolar content in other fishes, were apparently present only in T. newnesi...|$|R
40|$|Benzylation of lithium, potassium, tetraethylammonium and <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> of the {{ambident}} formanilide anion {{under different}} reaction conditions has been studied. [...] The lithium, potassium and tetraethylammonium salts generally gave exclusively N-benzylation whereas the reaction with <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> occurred predominantly on oxygen. The choice of solvent, the halide of the benzyl halide, and the substituent on the alkylating agent and/or formanilide {{did not affect}} the site of alkylation of the alkali metal salts but the oxygen and nitrogen alkylation product distribution from the <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> alkylations did depend, to some extent, upon these factors. The highest O-alkylation {{in the case of the}} <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> was always obtained in dimethoxyethane, while the reaction in dimethylformamide gave comparatively high yields of N [...] alkylation product. Exceptional cases are reported where N-alkylation was predominate in <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> alkylations and these will be discussed. [...] A number of formiminoalkyl ethers and N-alkylformanilides were isolated and their spectra are compared...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} effects of <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> on biocompatible metals used for prostheses during the chemical reduction process {{to produce a}} silver antimicrobial layer on the metal’s surface. Samples of two biocompatible metals were obtained: Stainless Steel 316 L and ASTM F 75 Cobalt Chromium Alloy. Three different <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> were also acquired: silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, and silver chloride. Specimens of each metal were cut to size using a 4 - 1 / 2 inch aluminum oxide, 40 grit, cut off wheel for metal, attached to a Dewalt Angle Grinder. The biocompatible metal samples were then subject to either Solution 1, water with 10. 0 mg of <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> per liter of water, or Solution 2, water with 20. 0 mg of <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> per liter of water. Some samples were left untreated for comparison. The samples {{were removed from the}} solution after 5 days, rinsed, and examined using SEM. From these images, the corrosion of the metal, the increase in corrosion associated with the increase in <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> concentration, as well as the differences between each of the metal and salt solution combinations was observed. These images {{can be found in the}} Results section of this report...|$|R

50|$|In {{black-and-white}} {{photographic film}} {{there is usually}} one layer of <b>silver</b> <b>salts.</b> When the exposed grains are developed, the <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> are converted to metallic silver, which blocks light and appears as the black part of the film negative. Color film has at least three sensitive layers. Dyes, which adsorb {{to the surface of}} the <b>silver</b> <b>salts,</b> make the crystals sensitive to different colors. Typically the blue-sensitive layer is on top, followed by the green and red layers. During development, the exposed <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> are converted to metallic silver, just as with black-and-white film. But in a color film, the by-products of the development reaction simultaneously combine with chemicals known as color couplers that are included either in the film itself or in the developer solution to form colored dyes. Because the by-products are created in direct proportion to the amount of exposure and development, the dye clouds formed are also in proportion to the exposure and development. Following development, the silver is converted back to <b>silver</b> <b>salts</b> in the bleach step. It is removed from the film in the fix step. Fixing leaves behind only the formed color dyes, which combine to make up the colored visible image. Later color films, like Kodacolor II, have as many as 12 emulsion layers, with upwards of 20 different chemicals in each layer.|$|R

30|$|Plasmonic {{nanostructures}} demonstrating {{an activity}} in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy have been fabricated by an immersion deposition of silver nanoparticles from <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> solution on mesoporous silicon (meso-PS). The SERS signal intensity {{has been found to}} follow the periodical repacking of the silver nanoparticles, which grow according to the Volmer–Weber mechanism. The ratio of <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> concentration and immersion time substantially manages the SERS intensity. It has been established that optimal conditions of nanostructured silver layers formation for a maximal Raman enhancement can be chosen taking into account a special parameter called effective time: a product of the <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> concentration on the immersion deposition time. The detection limit for porphyrin molecules CuTMPyP 4 adsorbed on the silvered PS has been evaluated as 10 − 11  M.|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of silver particles, the nanocrystals are usually grown from Ag+ solutions. The silver ions come from a <b>salt</b> like <b>silver</b> nitrate (AgNO 3). The ions are first reduced to atoms {{by means of a}} {{reducing}} agent. The obtained atoms then nucleate in small clusters that grow into particles. Depending on the availability of atoms, which in turn depends on the <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> to reducing agent concentration ratio, {{the size and shape of}} the nanoparticles can be controlled. In this method, two elements are needed for the nanoparticle grow: a <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> and a reducing agent[34, 35].|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} methods {{described}} that use transition metals as catalyst, the Prévost and Woodward methods use iodine and a <b>silver</b> <b>salt.</b> However, {{the addition of}} water into the reaction directs the cis- and trans- addition of the hydroxyl groups. The Prévost reaction typically uses silver benzoate to produce trans-diols; the Woodward modification of the Prévost reaction uses silver acetate to produce cis-diols. In both the Prévost and Woodward reactions, iodine is first added to the alkene producing a cyclic iodinium ion. The anion from the corresponding <b>silver</b> <b>salt</b> is then added by nucleophilic substitution to the iodinium ion.|$|R
