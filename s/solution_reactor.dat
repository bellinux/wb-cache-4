40|$|In this thesis, {{heterogeneous}} photocatalysis {{is presented}} as a promising technology for water purification. Photocatalysis is revisited from an experimental and engineering point of view, comprising some theoretical fundamentals towards the commercialization of domestic appliances for water purification. Next, will be described briefly the research done in each experimental chapter. In Chapter 2, it is presented a novel and inexpensive 96 -well microplate photo-reactor, is presented suitable for high throughput screening. This method is applicable {{to a wide range of}} model organic contaminants and photocatalysts, and only requires very short reaction times, up to 15 min and the working volume of the reactor is only 200 µL. Finally, a very important aspect is that limitations in light penetration through the aqueous <b>solution</b> (<b>reactor</b> height is 1 cm) are absent, resulting in an efficient utilization of all the catalyst particles available within the reactor, providing a close to intrinsic value of the rate constant. One of the latest concerns in water purification technology, is the prevalence of pharmaceuticals in the environment and their potential detrimental effects on human health. High throughput screening of a pharmaceutical library with 1280 compounds was performed to evaluate ¬the ability of TiO 2 to degrade these new emerging contaminants and the results are described in Chapter 3. The high throughput screening performed previously in Chapter 3 also revealed that steroids are a class of compounds that are difficult to oxidize. For that reason, in Chapter 4, further studies were done with cortisone acetate (model compound) with focus on optimizing the mineralization parameters (pH, catalyst loading, etc), in a laboratory scale slurry reactor (50 ml). In Chapter 5, a study of photocatalytic degradation of mixtures of organic compounds in aqueous solution is described. Such study is very relevant for practical application of photocatalytic water treatment, since then simultaneous decomposition of several organic contaminants is required.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in polyolefin manufacture {{have focused on}} the production of differentiated commodity polyolefins, specialty polyolefins, and polyolefins hybrids. What differentiates these new polyolefin types from commodity polyolefins is that their molecular architectures are much more complex and often contain long chain branches (LCBs), leading to unique properties that make them competitive with specialty polymers. One approach to produce these novel polyolefins is to use one or two single-site catalysts in two CSTRs in series. The first CSTR is used to make semicrystalline polymer chains, some of which must be vinyl-terminated (macromonomers). These macromonomers are then incorporated, via terminal branching, onto the chains growing in the second CSTR, becoming LCBs. If the backbone and the macromonomer have different compositions, they are called cross-products. Since {{it is not possible to}} incorporate all macromonomers, the final polymer will consist of a complex mixture of linear chains made by the two catalysts, homogeneous-branched chains (that is, chains where the backbone and all LCBs are of the same type), and cross-product macromolecules. The cross-product will add rather special properties to the polymer and, depending on its molecular architecture, the final product may act as a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Developing polymer reactor models for different catalyst combinations can help understand the details of these complex syntheses and to control the properties and fractions of linear chains, homogeneous-branched chains, and cross-products. Two mathematical models were developed in this thesis for the solution polymerization of olefins with two single-site catalysts to predict the microstructure of long chain branched polyolefins. The first model was developed for a semi-batch reactor and the second one for two CSTRs in series. The models can predict the fractions of different polymer populations made in CSTRs and semibatch reactors, as well as their average chain lengths and LCB densities. Simulation results show that CSTRs are more efficient than semi-batch reactors to make polymers with high LCB densities and/or cross product fraction. Simulation results also show that to increase the weight percent of cross-product using a linear-catalyst and a LCB-catalyst, the rate of macromonomer formation of the linear-catalyst should be high. The fraction of cross-product can be increased even further when both catalysts are capable of incorporating macromonomers to form LCB-chains because; in this case, both catalysts can form cross-product chains. Monomer concentration has no effect on cross-product mass fraction and polydispersity index, but increasing monomer concentration will decrease LCB density and increase the average chain lengths. Catalyst deactivation also has a great impact on polymer properties: LCB density, polydispersity index, cross-product fraction, and average chain lengths will all decrease by increasing the catalyst deactivation rate of both catalysts. Simulation results for two CSTRs in series shows that increasing residence time in the second CSTR will lead to higher cross-product formation and LCB density. This rate of increase is more significant if the residence time in the second CSTR is similar to that of the first CSTR. The catalyst feed policy also has a great impact on polymer properties. We found out that feeding the linear-catalyst and the LCB-catalyst in equal amounts to the first CSTR and just adding the LCB-catalyst to the second CSTR is the preferred catalyst injection method for making polymer with a high mass fraction of cross-product, high chain length averages, and lower polydispersity index (PDI). These simulation studies indicate that detailed polymerization kinetics for each catalyst is needed in order to synthesize these novel polyolefins. In the experimental part of this thesis, ethylene polymerization kinetics studies were performed first with two individual metallocene catalysts, then with both of them simultaneously. First, ethylene polymerization with rac-Et(Ind) 2 ZrCl 2 /MAO was carried out in a semi-batch <b>solution</b> <b>reactor.</b> Reaction temperature, monomer, MAO, and catalyst concentrations were the factors studied to establish a framework to predict catalyst decay, polymer yield and molecular weight averages. The polymerization order with respect to ethylene and catalyst concentration was found to be first order. Chain transfer to monomer was the dominating chain transfer reaction while β-hydride elimination was negligible. An increase in MAO concentration led to a decrease in molecular weight. Catalyst decay could be described with a first order mechanism. At low MAO concentration this catalyst could make polymer with about one vinyl group per chain. A similar ethylene polymerization kinetics study using dimethylsilyl(N-tert-butylamido) -(tetramethylcyclopentadienyl) -titanium dichloride (CGC-Ti) /MAO system showed that the polymerization order with respect to catalyst concentration was first order, but first order catalyst decay failed to explain catalyst deactivation. The polymerization order with respect to ethylene concentration was not unity for the whole range of ethylene concentration. The trigger mechanism, along with reversible first order activation and deactivation with MAO and first order thermal decay, could explain the effect of time, monomer and catalyst concentration on the rate of polymerization. Decrease in MAO concentration increased the amount of polymer chains with terminal vinyl groups and consequently led to polymers with LCBs. Decreasing monomer concentration at low MAO concentration also led to production of polymer chain with more long chain branching. Ethylene homopolymerization and copolymerization with 1 -octene were conducted using combined catalysts system at low and high MAO concentrations. Reactivity ratios were calculated and polymer samples with bimodal MWDs were obtained but no increase in LCB frequency or cross product formation was detected using carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13 C NMR) and high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) coupled with a viscosity detector. In order to promote the formation of cross-product macromolecules, 1, 9 -decadiene was copolymerized with ethylene using the Et(Ind) 2 ZrCl 2 /MAO to make tailored macromonomers with pendant 1 -octenyl branches. The macromonomers ranged from having 1 to 6. 5 vinyl groups per chain. These macromonomers were then incorporated into growing ethylene/ 1 -butene or ethylene/ 1 -octene copolymer chains using a titanium-based constrained geometry catalyst (CGC-Ti) to form branch block polymer chains with amorphous main backbone having short chain branch density (SCBD) up to 50 per 1 000 carbon atoms, and high crystalinity long chain branches with SCBD up to 3 / 1000 C atoms (cross product). Increase in polymerization time or catalyst concentration in the second stage of polymerization was observed to increase the cross-product weight fraction. We also observed that an increase in ethylene pressure during the second stage of polymerization, while 1 -butene concentration was constant, favoured the formation of cross product. When 1 -octene was used as comonomer in the second stage of polymerization, the presence of more pendant vinyl groups in the macromonomer led to increased long chain branching...|$|E

40|$|The pHauxostat {{technique}} for process control was {{proposed in the}} late nineteen fifties with a theoretical explanation done by Martin and Hempfling in 1976. The theory was extended in 1985 (Rice&Hempfling), but concluded to be incomplete. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a theory for the pHauxostat and to investigate and explain the principles involved. This was done by investigating the pH, as the controlled output variable, and the control methodology with the feed system the manipulated input variable. Laboratory test work was conducted to verify a proposed theory by using a chemically defined substrate. The technique was thereafter applied in treating a petrochemical effluent in a demonstration plant, demonstrating the generality and applicability of the theory and the pHauxostat technique. The controlled pH of the <b>reactor</b> <b>solution</b> was found to be a function of the weak acids and bases in the <b>reactor</b> <b>solution</b> and the strong acids and bases added to the substrate, in combination with the chemical species removed from the substrate during biodegradation. A method proposed by Loewenthal et al. (1991) that was developed for chemical conditioning, utilising solution and subsystem alkalinities, proved to be successful in characterising the <b>reactor</b> <b>solution</b> in combination with traditional equilibrium chemistry. The pHauxostat control system was shown to keep the alkalinity constant, resulting in a controlled and constant difference in solution alkalinity between the reactor and the substrate solutions. The feed rate is controlled by this difference in combination with the alkalinity generation rate. The alkalinity generation rate is defined with a proposed alkalinity yield coefficient, linking water chemistry and growth kinetics. The alkalinity yield coefficient indicates the amount of alkalinity generated per substrate removed, similarly to the conventional growth yield. The alkalinity yield coefficient was successfully modelled by a theoretical alkalinity yield coefficient, based on oxidation-reduction half reactions as developed by McCarty (1975). This was shown to be true when the change in alkalinity is mainly due to substrate removal. The developed theory is based on alkalinity, modelling the pHauxostat technique by completing a mass balance on solution alkalinity. The model proved to accurately predict the results for the laboratory and the demonstration plant test work. The model is represented by the following formula, respectively for layouts of a chemostat and a CSTR with biomass separation: isXCOD YALK / Yobs = S ALK-SALK 0 and isXCOD YALK (t/q c) / Yobs S ALK-SALK 0 The growth limiting nutrient (S) may be a part of a weak acid/base subsystem or not, implicating two methods of control. pHauxostats were categorised on this basis, giving Category A pHauxostats with S = f(pH) and Category B pHauxostats with S ¹ f(pH). The process for Category A pHauxostats is controlled by the concentration of the growth limiting nutrient (determined by the set point pH and the substrate composition), in combination with the difference in the solution alkalinities between the substrate and <b>reactor</b> <b>solutions.</b> The growth limiting nutrient concentration for Category B pHauxostats, is not controlled but is a result of the control system which is determined by the feed rate of the growth limiting nutrient and the difference in the solution alkalinities.

The alkalinity yield coefficient is universal for biological processes in general.

For the purpose of model validation, the simulated results were compared with data obtained from experiments conducted using a continuous stirred tank reactor for production of nano-size TiO 2 particles. Product composition was analysed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and particle size was characterised scanning electron microscopy, zetasizer and image analysis. Good agreement between experimental and simulation results was achieved...|$|R
