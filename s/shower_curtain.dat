5|$|Krohn's {{analysis}} of the production of Psycho in his book Hitchcock at Work, while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, {{the fact that the}} killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the <b>shower</b> <b>curtain</b> being torn down, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo.|$|E
5|$|There are varying {{accounts}} whether Leigh was in {{the shower}} the entire time or a body double was used for {{some parts of the}} murder sequence and its aftermath. In an interview with Roger Ebert and in the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Leigh stated she {{was in the}} scene the entire time and Hitchcock used a stand-in only for the sequence in which Norman wraps Marion's body in a <b>shower</b> <b>curtain</b> and places it in the trunk of her car. The 2010 book The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock's Shower by Robert Graysmith contradicts this, identifying Marli Renfro as Leigh's body double for some of the shower scene's shots. Graysmith also stated that Hitchcock later acknowledged Renfro's participation in the scene.|$|E

25|$|Bill Krohn {{has noted}} that Bass's 48 story board panels for the scene {{introduced}} all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene – most notably, {{the fact that the}} attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the <b>shower</b> <b>curtain</b> torn down, a shot of the shower head from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the drain hole of the bathtub to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for Vertigo. Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of that scene.|$|E
25|$|The add-on side tent {{underwent}} a complete redesign. The new model (referred to in publicity materials as an Add-a-Room tent or a Motent) superficially resembles the late Split-windshield's framed tent in general shape and colors, but is otherwise quite different. For one, the tent's frame is now external, with the canvas supported by elastic loops and plastic hooks, somewhat like a <b>shower</b> <b>curtain.</b> Instead {{of a single}} opening front panel, there is a zippered screen door {{in the middle of}} the front (side away from the bus) with a small awning flap that can be lowered for wind and rain protection. This tent also features a waterproof floor, and the attachment method on the vehicle side results in a securely closable shelter (i.e., no more gap below the bus floor).|$|E
500|$|Kurt's father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) invites Finn (Cory Monteith) and {{his mother}} Carole Hudson (Romy Rosemont) {{to move in with}} them. Finn feels awkward sharing a room with Kurt, who has a crush on him and keeps trying to seduce him, and during an {{argument}} insults several items in his bedroom as being [...] "faggy" [...] after losing his temper. Burt overhears this and kicks Finn out for using the term, even if it costs Burt his relationship with Carole. Kurt is bullied for his Gaga costume by football players Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and Azimio (James Earl). Finn creates his own costume out of a <b>shower</b> <b>curtain,</b> and tells them he will not let them hurt Kurt, backed {{by the rest of the}} glee club.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{original}} trailer {{features a}} jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer {{on a tour}} of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is [...] "tracked" [...] with Herrmann's Psycho theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy The Trouble with Harry; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the <b>shower</b> <b>curtain</b> back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, [...] "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However, a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer.|$|E
500|$|Portal {{takes place}} in the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center—Aperture Science for short—which is a {{research}} facility responsible for the creation of the portal gun. According to information presented in Portal 2, the location of the complex is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Information about the company, developed by Valve for creating the setting of the game, is revealed during the game and via the real-world promotional website. According to the Aperture Science website, Cave Johnson founded the company in 1943 {{for the sole purpose of}} making shower curtains for the U.S. military. However, after becoming mentally unstable from [...] "moon rock poisoning" [...] in 1978, Johnson created a three-tier research and development plan to make his organization successful. The first two tiers, the Counter-Heimlich Maneuver (a maneuver designed to ensure choking) and the Take-A-Wish Foundation (a program to give the wishes of terminally ill children's parents to adults who are in need of dreams), were commercial failures and led to an investigation of the company by the U.S. Senate. However, when the investigative committee heard of the success of the third tier, a person-sized ad-hoc quantum tunnel through physical space with possible applications as a <b>shower</b> <b>curtain,</b> it recessed permanently and gave Aperture Science an open-ended contract to continue its research. The development of GLaDOS, an artificially intelligent research assistant and disk-operating system, began in 1986 in response to Black Mesa's work on similar portal technology. A presentation seen during gameplay reveals that GLaDOS was also included in a proposed bid for de-icing fuel lines, incorporated as a fully functional disk-operation system that is arguably alive, unlike Black Mesa's proposal, which inhibits ice, nothing more. Roughly thirteen years later, work on GLaDOS was completed and the untested AI was activated during the company's first ever bring-your-daughter-to-work day in May 2000. Immediately after activation, the facility was flooded with deadly neurotoxin by the AI. Events of the first Half-Life game occur shortly thereafter, presumably leaving the facility forgotten by the outside world due to apocalyptic happenings. Wolpaw, in describing the ending of Portal 2, affirmed that the Combine invasion, chronologically taking place between Half-Life and Half-Life 2, occurred during Portals events.|$|E

The body was discovered by two men driving on a dirt road, one of whom was an off-duty police officer. Examiners determined that the blade of the weapon, believed to be an ice pick, that was used to stab the victim was around three inches long. The body appeared to have been washed and fragments of a <b>shower</b> <b>curtain</b> were nearby.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band was}} {{originally}} formed in 1980 as The Filberts (after local football team, Leicester City's former Filbert Street ground), although {{they would also}} occasionally appear as The Psychedelic Filberts. Their main influences come from the West Coast sound of 1960s bands such as Moby Grape, Buffalo Springfield and Love. The main creative force in the band is Butler, who writes nearly all the band's material. Butler and Moth (who had also drummed for Leicester bands Legay and then Gypsy) had previously played together in a short-lived band called The Flicks, releasing one album in 1979 called Go for the Effect. Three Psychedelic Filberts tracks were released – a cover of The Byrds' [...] "Lady Friend" [...] on the Obscure Independent Classics Volume 2 album; a cover of The Beatles' [...] "Rain" [...] which was included on Yeah Yeah Noh's final release, the Temple of Convenience EP; and [...] "Atlantis 1968", which appeared on the He Didn't Even Draw A Fish on My <b>Shower</b> <b>Curtain</b> compilation album.|$|E
2500|$|Leave It to Beaver {{is unique}} in 1950s {{television}} sitcom history for its extraordinary number of bathroom scenes. Beaver and Wally have an en-suite bathroom, and many scenes are set in it. One early episode, [...] "Child Care", is set almost entirely in their bathroom. Other episodes include major scenes set in the boys' bathroom. Additionally, in almost every scene set in the boys' bedroom, the bathtub, <b>shower</b> <b>curtain,</b> or vanity can be seen through the open bathroom door. Beaver uses the bathroom several times to escape his brother when angry, slamming the door to express his emotions. At such times, June and Ward {{are called upon to}} order Beaver to vacate his refuge. In [...] "Beaver's Good Deed", a scene is set in Ward and June's bathroom.

2500|$|The KlangBogen Wien Festival {{commissioned}} Austrian {{film and}} theatre director Michael Schottenberg {{to rewrite the}} operetta's book for its performance at the 2005 festival. Although Schottenberg's re-working remains faithful to the basic plot and retains most of the original dialogue, the setting was changed to Vienna in the 1950s. The Graf von Luxemburg is now René Graf, a struggling novelist whose nickname is [...] "The Count". His bohemian friend Manfred (Armand in the original) is a student, while their beloveds, Angelika (Angèle) and Julie (Juliette), are dancers in a sleazy Hawaiian revue. Prince Basilowitsch is now Dr. Basil Basilovich-Kokosov, the Russian consul to Vienna, who is saddled with an estranged nymphomaniac wife, Anastasia. René and Angelika's sham wedding takes place in Manfred's bathroom, with René hiding behind the <b>shower</b> <b>curtain.</b> Larry L. Lash, who reviewed the live performance for Opera News wrote that the production [...] "zipped along with a manic 'Springtime for Hitler' fall-out-of-your-seat humor that had me laughing out loud for days after." [...] Immediately following the festival performances at the Theater an der Wien, Schottenberg's production transferred to the Vienna Volksoper where it remained in repertory as of 2011.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 6, the {{collective}} began unloading several large, heavy boxes from a white station wagon and bringing them into the townhouse. [...] A few minutes before noon, {{an explosion in the}} townhouse basement tore the building apart. [...] Two more large explosions followed, collapsing the front of the building. The ruptured gas mains below the building caught fire, consuming part of the structure. Robbins and Oughton, presumably assembling a bomb in the basement, died in the blast. Gold was trapped under falling beams and died from asphyxiation. Boudin, taking a shower at the time, fled the building naked. Wilkerson, who was dressing, ran from the rubble clad only in jeans. [...] Anne Hoffman, wife of actor Dustin Hoffman and the Wilkerson's next-door-neighbor (the Hoffman apartment was partially damaged in the blast), grabbed a <b>shower</b> <b>curtain</b> and covered Boudin with it. Susan Wager, ex-wife of actor Henry Fonda, rushed up the street and helped the two women to her home. Wager gave them both some clothes, but the two women fled. Jacobs was not in the townhouse at the time, and went into hiding after the blast.|$|E
2500|$|Describing the {{increase}} in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, he stated he had been [...] "completely swept along" [...] with his compulsion to kill, adding: [...] "It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long." [...] When asked {{as to why he}} had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated {{he had been in the}} process of constructing a private altar of victims' skulls which he had intended to adorn upon the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims. This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. Incense sticks were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights. The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque <b>shower</b> <b>curtain,</b> in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair. When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: [...] "Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home." [...] He further described his intended altar as a [...] "place for meditation," [...] from where he believed he could draw a sense of power, adding: [...] "If this [...] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found." ...|$|E
