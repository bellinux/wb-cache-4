5|$|The {{precursors}} for systemin and AtPEP1 are both processed to yield one active peptide from the C-terminus of the precursor. It {{has been speculated}} that ProAtPEP1 is processed by CONSTITUTIVE DISEASE RESISTANCE 1, an apoplastic aspartic protease. The precursors to HypSys are processed into more than one active peptide. In tobacco, it is processed into two peptides, in petunia into three, and in <b>sweet</b> <b>potato,</b> possibly into six. At 291 amino acids long, the precursor to HypSys in <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> is the longest precursor described. The production of multiple signalling peptides from one precursor is a common feature found in animals.|$|E

5|$|The {{cane toad}} was {{introduced}} into New Guinea {{to control the}} hawk moth larvae eating <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> crops.

Initial reports argued the toads were effective in reducing the levels of cutworms and <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> yields were thought to be improving. As a result, these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of the region, although their effectiveness on other crops, such as cabbages, has been questioned; when the toads were released at Wau, the cabbages provided insufficient shelter and the toads rapidly left the immediate area for the superior shelter offered by the forest. A similar situation had previously arisen in the Australian cane fields, but this experience was either unknown or ignored in New Guinea. The cane toad has since become abundant in rural and urban areas.|$|E

In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in <b>sweet</b> <b>potato</b> (Ipomoea batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora).

40|$|Background: strenuous {{physical}} activity can increase oxygen consumption 100 - 200 -fold {{due to the}} increased metabolism in the body. Increased use of oxygen mainly by contraction of the muscle, causes an increase of electron leakage from the mitochondria that will produce ROS. If the levels of free radicals is too high such as when doing strenuous {{physical activity}}, the ability of endogenous antioxidant to neutralize free radicals become inadequate resulting in an unbalanced state between free radicals and antioxidants called oxidative stress. One of the flavonoid components of the herbs that can act as antioxidants are natural pigments called anthocyanins. Purple <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b> contain high anthocyanins levels at 110 mg- 210 mg / 100 g.

Methods: This research is true experimental with post test only control group design in rats. The treatment given is fermented purple <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b> extracts (Ipomoea batatas L.) and provision of maximum physical activity in rats, while the output is MDA rats blood. Results: Posthoc LSD test showed no significant difference (P= 0, 916) of plasma MDA levels between the group of rats given maximal physical activity (MDA K 2 = 15, 84 nmol/l) and control (MDA K 1 = 15, 77 nmol/l). Meanwhile, there was significant difference (P= 0, 008) of plasma MDA levels between the group of rats given fermented purple <b>sweet</b> <b>potatoes</b> extract (MDA K 3 = 13, 73 nmol/l) and control (MDA K 1 = 15, 77 nmol/l).
