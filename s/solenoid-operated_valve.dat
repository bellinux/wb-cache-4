50|$|Most {{automatic}} transmissions include some means of forcing a downshift (Throttle kickdown) into {{the lowest possible}} gear ratio if the throttle pedal is fully depressed. In many older designs, kickdown is accomplished by mechanically actuating a valve inside the transmission. Most modern designs use a <b>solenoid-operated</b> <b>valve</b> that is triggered by a switch on the throttle linkage or by the engine control unit (ECU) {{in response to an}} abrupt increase in engine power.|$|E
50|$|In {{the final}} version of the GWR system, the {{locomotives}} were fitted with a <b>solenoid-operated</b> <b>valve</b> into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the brake valve was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the brake valve in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the brake valve solenoid would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning and apply the brakes under his own control.|$|E
40|$|Semi-natural {{tests for}} active {{pneumatic}} suspension of a 18 -tonne tourist bus {{with the system}} of automatic body stabilization of the mobile machine and feed-back coupling according to kinematics parameter. The test have been executed in the cases when the bus is stocked with an automatic hydro-mechanical transmission {{in the process of}} speed picking up, gear-changing or road braking which is assigned by accidental road humps. A computer simulation of dynamic structures in combination with virtual devices and real objects (HIL – Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation) has been carried in the paper. Personal computers, software, programmed logic controller, frequency generator, <b>solenoid-operated</b> <b>valve</b> have been used for the investigation process. The paper proposes an unconventional method for improvement operational characteristics which is based on integrated control of a suspension and automatic hydro-mechanical transmission. A mathematical model includes systems of automatic transmission, suspension and module for generation of accidental road humps. The model has been considered as a basis for semi-natural laboratory bench with industrially-manufactured controller, other components of automatic systems and standard control organs. The most efficient method for body stabilization is control of the suspension according to the parameter of angular rate during vertical turn of an automobile’s center line with {{a turning point in the}} center of mass. The developed algorithm and stabilization system according to angular rate of body’s center line turning have made it possible to improve dynamics of the bus while making gear-changing and to reduce fuel consumption during starting-up and speed picking-up processes. During the braking process such system simultaneously decreases oscillation amplitude of some parameters more than two-fold. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for in situ diagnostic testing of dc-actuated <b>solenoid-operated</b> <b>valves</b> (SOVs) by analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the transient current waveform accompanying valve actuation. This waveform, which is used to identify abnormal operation, is obtained inductively by a small split-core current transformer clamped around one of the valve`s solenoid leads. The digitized waveforms are subsequently compared with similar waveforms obtained when the valve was known to be operating normally, and the results used to detect faulty valve operation. This methodology is noninvasive because direct access to the SOV is not required; also, the current transformer has negligible effect on the solenoid current and does not require the lifting of any electrical leads. Analysis is performed by first extracting various waveform features. A subset of these features is examined by diagnostic algorithms, tuned to identify faults for that valve type, that compare the features with those obtained from a previously acquired waveform for the particular valve under examination. Two methods of analysis have been examined. One utilizes fuzzy logic in an expert system diagnostic. The other performs pattern recognition using an artificial neural network approach. The overall analysis is robust in that it can deal with minor deviations of the waveform shape experienced during repeated operation of a normal valve while successfully identifying abnormal valve operation. In the present application, analysis has been specialized to SOVs used on space-based systems; however, the methodology has sufficient flexibility to be applicable {{to a wide variety of}} valves and other industrial electrically controlled components...|$|R
40|$|<b>Solenoid-operated</b> <b>valves</b> (SOVs) {{are widely}} used {{components}} {{in a variety of}} industries and systems. Though they are small components, their failure can lead to catastrophic failure of the system in which they are placed. Past studies have revealed the electromagnetic coil insulation to be a weakness, and prior work in the AC motor community on twisted pairs has shown that insulation capacitance measurements can reveal useful diagnostic information. Yet, no studies have tracked the impedance spectrum over an aging/degradation period, no methods are available to identify frequencies in the impedance spectrum to be used, there discussion about how to employ coil impedance to determine a degradation mechanism, nor has there been any quantifications of the mechanical properties due to degradation. This paper develops a method of detection of the aging of insulation in low-voltage electromagnetic coils when subjected to elevated temperature environmental conditions by assessing changes in the impedance spectrum. In this experiment, a solenoid valve was powered and subjected to an operating environment equal to its maximum operating temperature. The valve was periodically removed from the temperature chamber and the impedance spectrum measured. The complex impedance was split into its real and imaginary parts and the Spearman correlation coefficient was used to find regions of interest within the impedance spectrum. The results indicate that resistance and reactance provide information that can assist in condition-based maintenance procedures for electromagnetic coils. Furthermore, mechanical properties of the insulation are investigated and reveal differences in degradation due to environmental conditions. <br type="_moz" /...|$|R

40|$|Nanosatellites offer frequent, {{low-cost}} space {{access as}} secondary payloads on launches of larger conventional satellites. We summarize the payload {{science and technology}} of the Microsatellite in-situ Space Technologies (MisST) nanosatellite for conducting automated biological experiments. The payload (two fused 10 -cm cubes) includes 1) an integrated fluidics system that maintains organism viability and supports growth and 2) a fixed-focus imager with fluorescence and scattered-light imaging capabilities. The payload monitors temperature, pressure and relative humidity, and actively controls temperature. C. elegans (nematode, 50 m diameter x 1 mm long) was selected as a model organism due to previous space science experience, its completely sequenced genome, size, hardiness, and the variety of strains available. Three strains were chosen: two green GFP-tagged strains and one red tdTomato-tagged strain that label intestinal, nerve, and pharyngeal cells, respectively. The integrated fluidics system includes bioanalytical and reservoir modules. The former consists of four 150 L culture wells and a 4 x 5 mm imaging zone the latter includes two 8 mL fluid reservoirs for reagent and waste storage. The fluidic system is fabricated using multilayer polymer rapid prototyping: laser cutting, precision machining, die cutting, and pressure-sensitive adhesives it also includes eight <b>solenoid-operated</b> <b>valves</b> and one mini peristaltic pump. Young larval-state (L 2) nematodes are loaded in C. elegans Maintenance Media (CeMM) in the bioanalytical module during pre-launch assembly. By the time orbit is established, the worms have grown to sufficient density to be imaged and are fed fresh CeMM. The strains are pumped sequentially into the imaging area, imaged, then pumped into waste. Reagent storage utilizes polymer bags under slight pressure to prevent bubble formation in wells or channels. The optical system images green and red fluorescence bands by excitation with blue (473 nm peak) and amber (587 nm peak) LEDs it achieves 8 m lateral resolution using a CMOS imaging chip (as configured for serial data speeds) or 4 m resolution using USB imaging chips. The imager consists of a modified commercial off-the-shelf CMOS chip camera, amber, blue and white LEDs, {{as well as a}} relay lens and dual-band filters to obviate moving parts while supporting both fluorescence wavelengths...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{deployment}} of an in situ flow injection (FI) monitor for high temporal resolution monitoring of phosphate in the River Frome, Dorset, UK, is described. The monitor incorporates solenoid, self-priming micropumps for propulsion, <b>solenoid-operated</b> switching <b>valves</b> for controlling the fluidics and a miniature CCD spectrometer for full spectrum (200 - 1000 nm) acquisition and operates in a graphical programming environment. A tangential filtration unit {{is attached to}} the sample inlet line to remove suspended particulate matter and prevent blockage of the micropumps and valves. Detection (at 7 10 nm) is based on molybdenum blue chemistry with tin(II) chloride reduction. The detection limit is 0. 67 muM PO 4 and the linear range can be adjusted by using different wavelengths for detection. Pump noise is eliminated by subtraction of the signal at a non-absorbing wavelength (447 nm). Data from an intensive (sample every 30 min) field trial on the River Frome performed in October 2000 are presented, and the implications of the data for refining an export coefficient model for phosphorus from the catchment are discussed.
