His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although <b>some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them.

5|$|After the United States entered World War II, Pan Gulf {{frequently}} sailed in convoys on the North Atlantic, {{as well as}} <b>some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.

5|$|Although <b>some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{front of}} the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis {{became one of the}} first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E

The church was of relatively simple construction, but of unusual size, and A. Bon proposes its identification with the church of the Franciscans, where assemblies of the nobles of Achaea were held in 1276 and 1289. The remaining portions of the church's walls were completely destroyed by the German Army during the Occupation.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880 presidential {{elections}} approached, many Democrats remained convinced Tilden had been robbed {{of the presidency}} in 1876. In the House, Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York sought {{an investigation into the}} 1876 election in Florida and Louisiana, hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party's candidate in 1880. The Democratic caucus, including Randall, unanimously endorsed the idea, and the committee convened in May 1878. <b>Some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> caucus wished to investigate the entire election, but Randall and the more moderate members worked to limit the committee's reach to the two disputed states.|$|E
5|$|Barcelona is one {{of three}} {{founding}} members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division, along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid. In 2009, Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga, Copa del Rey, and the UEFA Champions League, and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year, by also winning the Spanish Super Cup, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup. In 2011, the club became European champions again and won five trophies. This Barcelona team, which won 14 trophies in just 4 years under Pep Guardiola, is considered by <b>some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sport to be the greatest team of all time. By winning their fifth Champions League trophy on 6 June 2015, Barcelona became the first European club in history to achieve the continental treble twice.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between the Old and New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even <b>some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Old School camp had hoped for a more moderate course. The differences between the Old and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E
5|$|Britain, {{with its}} {{commitment}} to South Arabia and its base in Aden, considered the Egyptian invasion a real threat. Recognition of the republic posed a problem to several treaties Britain had signed with the sheiks and sultans of the South Arabian Federation. Saudi Arabia urged the British to identify themselves with the royalists. On the other hand, there were <b>some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Foreign Office who believed Britain could buy security for Aden by recognizing the republic. However, Britain eventually decided not to recognize. Iran, Turkey and most of western Europe also withheld recognition. The republic did receive the recognition of West Germany, Italy, Canada and Australia, {{as well as the}} remaining Arab governments, Ethiopia and the entire communist bloc.|$|E
5|$|Canterbury {{retained}} as suffragans, or subordinates, {{the bishops}} of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield. This listing, however, comes from the Gesta pontificum Anglorum of the later medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury, written in about 1120. Although the division is logical, William confuses Hygeberht with Hygeberht's successor Ealdwulf, and does not give a source for his list, which suggest {{that it may be}} untrustworthy. The creation of a third archbishopric was controversial, and the community at Canterbury Cathedral seems never to have accepted Hygeberht as an archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby speculates that there were always <b>some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mercian kingdom who disapproved of the elevation of Lichfield to an archdiocese.|$|E

5|$|Gliding did {{not return}} to the Olympics after the war for two reasons: a {{shortage}} of gliders, and the failure to agree on a single model of competition glider. (<b>Some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community feared doing so would hinder development of new designs.) The re-introduction of air sports such as gliding to the Olympics has occasionally been proposed by the world governing body, the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI), but has been rejected on the grounds of lack of public interest.|$|E
5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded as just one of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by <b>some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> community as an icon for ecological and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.|$|E
5|$|In July 1957, {{relations}} between Quwatli's ally Saudi Arabia and {{the governments of}} Iraq and Jordan, rivals of Syria, warmed considerably to the protestations of the leftist current in Syria, which viewed the growing ties between the region's conservative monarchies with distress. After a series of public criticisms of King Saud by an array of Syrian political figures, including al-Azm, Michel Aflaq and Akram al-Hawrani, Saud froze Syrian assets in Saudi Arabia and withdrew his ambassador from Syria in protest. In response to the crisis between the two countries, an alarmed Quwatli ordered Asali to publicly distance his government from the anti-Saudi views of <b>some</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Syrian Parliament and press, and to publicly apologize to Saud. In addition, Quwatli personally issued a government order {{to shut down the}} communist newspaper Al Sarkha.|$|E
