5|$|For a {{small number}} of people, taking aspirin can result in {{symptoms}} resembling an allergic reaction, including hives, <b>swelling,</b> <b>and</b> headache. The reaction is caused by salicylate intolerance and is not a true allergy, but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an overdose.|$|E
5|$|If the plantar fascia {{continues}} to be overused {{in the setting of}} plantar fasciitis, the plantar fascia can rupture. Typical signs and symptoms of plantar fascia rupture include a clicking or snapping sound, significant local <b>swelling,</b> <b>and</b> acute pain in the sole of the foot.|$|E

5|$|Prior to a 2006 {{match against}} Arminia Bielefeld in Munich, Michael Rensing {{peppered}} Kahn with practice shots. One shot hit Kahn {{squarely in the}} eye, causing enough <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> discoloration {{to keep him from}} playing. With Rensing in goal, Bayern Munich won the match 2–0.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|According to the behind-the-scenes {{documentary}} {{portions of}} the film's DVD, there were slight continuity problems during the filming of the fight. This {{was said to have}} been {{due to the fact that}} real punches were thrown by both Stallone and Tarver, resulting in some <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> nosebleeds earlier than scripted. The DVD release features an alternate ending in which Rocky wins the fight.|$|E

50|$|Buerenia is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Protomycetaceae. It was {{described}} in 1975. Species of Buerenia are parasitic on Apiaceae plants, on which they cause <b>swellings</b> <b>and</b> blisters on leaves and stems.|$|R
5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart. This situation {{is referred to as}} cor pulmonale, and leads to symptoms of leg <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> bulging neck veins. COPD is more common than any other lung disease as a cause of cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{produce a}} {{yellow-brown}} spore print. Spores are egg-shaped to ellipsoid, smooth, thin-walled, and measure 8.4–10.5 by 4.2–4.9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–35 by 7–9µm. Cystidia are present {{on both the}} tube walls (as pleurocystidia) and abundantly on the edges (as cheilocystidia). They are somewhat spindle-shaped, sometimes with a central <b>swelling,</b> <b>and</b> measure 45–70 by 7–12μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae, {{and all of the}} hyphae are inamyloid.|$|E
5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with tenderness and inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
50|$|Leaves {{and flowers}} of H. mutabilis are {{emollient}} and cooling, {{and are used}} to treat <b>swellings</b> <b>and</b> skin infections (Dasuki, 2001). Mucilage from flowers and leaves is used by midwives to facilitate delivery during labour.|$|R

5000|$|Some Plateau Indian tribes drink an {{infusion}} of Douglas maple {{as a treatment for}} diarrhea. Ramah Navajo use {{an infusion}} of the glabrum variety for <b>swellings,</b> <b>and</b> also as a [...] "life medicine", or panacea.|$|R
5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} {{of a brain}} haemorrhage, {{followed by}} competing reports {{that he had been}} mugged and even that he had drunk himself to death. Later, there was speculation about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death– pneumonia, brain <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises {{can produce}} a {{secretion}} on their brachial gland (a gland on their arm) which when mixed with their saliva creates a volatile, noxious toxin that can be, if necessary, delivered in a bite to an aggressor. A bite causes a painful <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> is slow to heal; the toxin is mild and not typically fatal, although an anaphylactic reaction is possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect to {{acetylcysteine}} treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions {{are more common}} in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Alaphylactoid reactions {{are more likely to}} occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial <b>swelling,</b> <b>and</b> even death.|$|E
5000|$|Fibrinolysis {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Defibrinating syndrome") {{is characterized by}} an acute hemorrhagic state brought about by inability of the blood to clot, with massive hemorrhages into the skin producing blackish, purplish <b>swellings</b> <b>and</b> sloughing.|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} types of {{inflammation}} that can cause knee pain, including sprains, bursitis, and injuries to the meniscus. A diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis can be made based on a physical examination {{and the presence of}} risk factors in the person's medical history; <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> tenderness {{at the front of the}} knee, combined with a profession that requires frequent kneeling, suggest prepatellar bursitis. Swelling of multiple joints along with restricted range of motion may indicate arthritis instead.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of poisoning from the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care, and patients with localised pain, <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> redness usually only require local application of ice and simple oral analgesia such as paracetamol. Pressure immobilisation of the wound site is not recommended. Keeping the victim still and calm is beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{mechanical}} {{breaking of}} the axonal cytoskeleton, DAI pathology also includes secondary physiological changes such as interrupted axonal transport, progressive <b>swellings</b> <b>and</b> degeneration. Recent studies have linked these changes to twisting and misalignment of broken axon microtubules, as well as tau and APP deposition.|$|R

50|$|Common (1-10% frequency) {{side effects}} include flushing, hypotension, anginal symptoms, aching or {{swelling}} joints, muscle aches, positive tests for ANP, stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea, <b>and</b> vomiting, <b>and</b> <b>swelling</b> (sodium <b>and</b> water retention).|$|R
5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to severe complications in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E
5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea), resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, <b>swelling</b> <b>and</b> tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial <b>swelling,</b> <b>and</b> rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} dynamic {{vulcanization}} on the thermal properties <b>and</b> <b>swelling</b> behaviour of vPE/rPE/EPDM blends were studied. The discarded polyethylene {{used in the}} study was obtained from local wire insulation industry. The thermal properties <b>and</b> <b>swelling</b> behaviour of the blends were analyzed. Results show that increasing of sulfur loading had improved the thermal stability of the blends. The <b>swelling</b> percentage <b>and</b> <b>swelling</b> index of vPE/rPE/EPDM blends also decreased, inversely proportional to the increasing of sulfur loading. Thus, the increased incorporation of sulfur loading had improved the chemical and oil resistance of the blends...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Birth trauma after {{prolonged}} deliveries and instrument-assisted extractions {{can result}} in skin lesions and reduced viability of the scalp. In these instances, scalp <b>swellings</b> <b>and</b> haematomas are often also seen. The classification and inter-relationship between these conditions might not, however, always be clear. This report describes three cases of neonates with scalp <b>swellings</b> <b>and</b> necrosis. Nomenclature, underlying causes, work up, treatment options, and outcomes are presented and discussed. The first case consisted of a newborn with a subgaleal haematoma and occipital pressure necrosis that healed by secondary intention. In the second case, an infected scalp haematoma led to scarring and alopecia that required secondary reconstruction with tissue expansion. The third neonate suffered from a subgaleal haematoma and a scalp lesion that required split skin grafting and secondary reconstruction with tissue expansion...|$|R
