5|$|By March 1962, the trilateral {{talks in}} Geneva had shifted to 18-party talks at the UN Disarmament Conference. On 27 August 1962, within that conference, the US and UK offered two draft {{treaties}} to the Soviet Union. The primary proposal included a comprehensive ban verified by control posts under national command, but international <b>supervision,</b> and required on-site inspections. This {{was rejected by}} the Soviet Union due to the inspection requirement. The alternative proposal included a partial test ban—underground tests would be excluded—to be verified by national detection mechanisms, without <b>supervision</b> by a supranational body.|$|E

In association with what remained of Kubrick's production unit, he directed the movie A.I.

5|$|In 1894, Marquis {{enrolled}} at University Medical College, Kansas City.

The practice was not very successful, so Marquis and his wife moved to Coloma where he worked under the <b>supervision</b> of another doctor. Marquis completed his studies with financial help from his wife's family and summer work as a printer in Anaconda. He graduated March23, 1898, and returned to Montana.

50|$|For {{the early}} years of Central, about 1970 to 1975, {{students}} remained mostly segregated by sex, with the girls at Lanier A and the boys at Lanier B, with each complex retaining the principals of the girls' and boys' schools. Eventually, girls were allowed to take some courses on the boys' campus (such as physics or German, courses not taught on the girls' campus). Finally, girls and boys were completely integrated in the courses, although their <b>supervisions</b> (homerooms) remained sex-segregated until 1981. By the 1980s, these vestiges of sex-segregation were completely eliminated. Lanier A ultimately housed mostly ninth-grade <b>supervisions,</b> while the upperclassmen were primarily in Lanier B; this arrangement persisted until Lanier A was torn down in 1997.|$|R

40|$|Patch-level image {{representation}} {{is very important}} for object classification and detection, since it is robust to spatial transformation, scale variation, and cluttered background. Many existing methods usually require fine-grained <b>supervisions</b> (e. g., bounding-box annotations) to learn patch features, which requires a great effort to label images may limit their potential applications. In this paper, we propose to learn patch features via weak <b>supervisions,</b> i. e., only image-level <b>supervisions.</b> To achieve this goal, we treat images as bags and patches as instances to integrate the weakly supervised multiple instance learning constraints into deep neural networks. Also, our method integrates the traditional multiple stages of weakly supervised object classification and discovery into a unified deep convolutional neural network and optimizes the network in an end-to-end way. The network processes the two tasks object classification and discovery jointly, and shares hierarchical deep features. Through this jointly learning strategy, weakly supervised object classification and discovery are beneficial to each other. We test the proposed method on the challenging PASCAL VOC datasets. The results show that our method can obtain state-of-the-art performance on object classification, and very competitive results on object discovery, with faster testing speed than competitors.
