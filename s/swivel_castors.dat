50|$|The D4 Premium also {{features}} a unique novel ring of blue LED's around the control dial that highlights visual suction speed according to motor speed. Lower models such as the D2 Storm, D2 Titan, and D2 Total only have a single LED next to the rotary power adjustment knob to indicate power on status. The D series features a mechanical piston bag full indicator next to the hose outlet, and 4 <b>swivel</b> <b>castors</b> on the underside for maximum movement in space restricted areas.|$|E
5000|$|The K1 and K3 series [...] "compact" [...] {{cylinder}} vacuum {{was launched}} in 2002, designed to offer domestic homes with a smaller version of the C series. Using a four layer filtration 3 litre dust bag, (also with the bag door forming part of {{the underside of the}} machine)and similar Hospital grade filter system developed on the C series, the K series was also awarded with the British Allergy Foundation seal of approval and carried on with the AirBelt Clean Air diffuser design. Unlike the C series, the K series has only 3 <b>swivel</b> <b>castors.</b> The K is designed to be space efficient and smaller than the C series. Initially fitted with an 1800 watt motor to compete in the market with rivals and featured a new 500gram lighter tube and hose system earned design awards for this model. Also equipped with a longer domestic market hose and 6 metres of cable length, the K series remains popular.|$|E
40|$|Trolley {{design has}} been of concern to {{industry}} and society for generations with trolleys used for ease of transportation of any type of object. Perhaps {{one of the most}} infamous examples is that of the shopping trolley. The concerns are related to a number of Ergonomic factors including the difficulty associated with steering a trolley with all <b>swivel</b> <b>castors,</b> excessive steering and operating forces, the inadequacy of the handles provided to interface with the user and the poor ergonomic design of the load space. Add irregular or carpeted surfaces and the problems are further compounded. Research into trolley design began as part of a consultancy project for a client with significant history of worker injury related to trolley use. Maximum forces related to the potential population of users were determined to assist with defining the problem. A first principles approach to the design was taken involving analysis of the forces involved in moving and steering trolleys. It was found that of the many factors affecting the trolley's dynamics the unresolved steering forces in the chassis were the major issue. A prototype trolley was manufactured to demonstrate the concepts of steering chassis design, ergonomically designed handles and load spaces. Further prototypes were manufactured to suit a number of tasks with the outcome being the commercial manufacture of a range of trolleys using the generic chassis which evolved from the project.

50|$|The third type is a {{combination}} of differential and steered. Two independent steer/drive motors are placed on diagonal corners of the AGV and <b>swivelling</b> <b>castors</b> are placed on the other corners. It can turn like a car (rotating in an arc) in any direction. It can crab in any direction and it can drive in differential mode in any direction.|$|R
