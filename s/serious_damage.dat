40|$|Background: Prolyl {{isomerase}} Pin 1 may {{be involved}} in innate immunity against microbial infection, but the mechanism how Pin 1 controls the innate immunity is poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings: Injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the mice induces inflammatory pulmonary disorder and sometimes the <b>serious</b> <b>damages</b> lead to death. Comparing to the wild-type (WT) mice, the Pin 1 2 / 2 mice showed more <b>serious</b> <b>damages</b> in lung and the lower survival rate after the LPS injection. We compared the levels of typical inflammatory cytokines. Pin 1 2 / 2 mice overreacted to the LPS injection to produce inflammatory cytokines, especially IL- 6 more than WT mice. We showed that Pin 1 binds phosphorylated PU. 1 and they localize together in a nucleus. These results suggest that Pin 1 controls the transcriptional activity of PU. 1 and suppresses overreaction of macrophage that causes <b>serious</b> <b>damages</b> in lung. Conclusions/Significance: Pin 1 may protect the mice from serious inflammation by LPS injection by attenuating th...|$|R
