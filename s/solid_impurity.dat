Many of the common atmospheric aerosols contain hygroscopic salts and therefore their physical state and composition are sensitive to the relative humidity. The phase of the aerosol particle will dramatically affect the relative rates of atmospheric reactions, and radiative properties such as scattering and optical activity. In order to understand these atmospheric processes and provide accurate input for global modeling, it is imperative that these phase tran-sitions be well defined.

It leads to raising the electric current of dehydrator and becoming worse of the deoiling and dehydrating {{properties of the}} treatment equipment, resulting in the serious influences on oil recovery. For the efficient treatment of the transition layer, it is necessary clearly to understand the structure and composition of the layer. In this paper, the physical structure and chemical composition of the layer were systematically, layer by layer and phase by phase, analyzed by modern instrumental methods The results show that (1 ）the layer is an emulsion which is composed of oil, water and suspended solids. The water phase has characteristics of weak alkaline, high salinity and viscous polymer. The oil phase contains many natural emulsifiers such as colloid, asphaltene and so on. The solid phase mainly concludes FeS particle which plays a decisive role in suspended solids; (2) the typical transition layer is composed of water and oil which accounts for above 90 %, the content of <b>solid</b> <b>impurity,</b> which controls the emulsion of the layer, is less than 10 %.

Conventionally, a chlorine/inert gas mixture is used for this purpose. However the potential leakage of chlorine and chemical reaction produce hydrogen chloride considered to be dangerous to society and faces the restriction in the new clean air regulation. So, {{in order to meet the}} requirement for the furnace emission and improve efficiency, mechanical agitation through impeller was widely used. In this research, the homogenization behaviour of both lance bubbling and mechanical agitation through two different impellers has been investigated experimentally (power drawn, decolourusation, PIV) and numerically. At equivalent mean specific energy dissipation rates, maximum velocities are higher and mixing times are shorter with the impellers, without to cause surface gas entrainment, the latter being detrimental to fluxing. Two different impellers have been analysed because one is designed to resist at high temperature, STAS, and its material (graphite) does not allow a standard shape, so it was necessary to compare its performance with a standard impeller, 3 PBT 30. In conclusion, the STAS impeller has been considered a good solution for this kind of cleaning process, in fact, despite the strange shape (very thick blades), the impeller shows nice properties like a standard impeller, 3 PBT 30.
