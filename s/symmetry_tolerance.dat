40|$|This {{technical}} report describes a new interconnection network for massively parallel systems {{referred to as}} star-connected cycles (SCC) graph. The SCC presents an I/O-bounded, fixeddegree structure that results in several advantages over variable-degree graphs like the star graph and the n-cube. The description of the SCC graph given in this report includes issues such as labeling of nodes, degree, diameter, <b>symmetry,</b> fault <b>tolerance</b> and Cayley graph representation. This report also presents an optimal routing algorithm for the SCC and efficient broadcasting algorithms with O(n) running time. A comparison with the cube-connected cycles (CCC) and other interconnection networks is included, indicating that for even n, an n-SCC and a CCC of similar sizes have about the same diameter. Also, we show that one-port broadcasting in an n-SCC graph can be accomplished with a running time better {{than or equal to}} that required by an n-star containing (n - 1) times fewer nodes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{demonstrates}} that the Thermal Coefficient of resonant Frequency (TCF) of a micro glass-blown Pyrex spherical resonator can be substantially reduced by {{the application of a}} titanium (Ti) coating. Finite Elements Analysis (FEA) is used to demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the Youngs modulus of the shell material is the dominant parameter affecting the TCF of the resonator, clearly suggesting the use of a metallic compensating layer. Experimental characterization {{demonstrates that}} the TCF of a Pyrex glass-blown resonator is reduced by 70 % (from 73 ppm/°C to 24 ppm/°C) by the application of a 1. 33 um thick layer of Ti. It is predicted by FEM that for a Ti layer thickness on the order of 2. 5 µm, the TCF will fall below 10 ppm, an acceptable value for high performance resonators. This investigation is a step forward in the quest to employ the desirable properties of micro-blown resonators, such as high <b>symmetry,</b> manufacturing <b>tolerances</b> and environmental robustness.

40|$|International audienceBubble-sort, macro-star, and {{transposition}} graphs are interconnection networks {{with the}} advantages of star graphs in terms of improving the network cost of a hypercube. These graphs contain a star graph as their sub-graph, and have node <b>symmetry,</b> maximum fault <b>tolerance,</b> and recursive partition properties. This study proposes embedding methods for these graphs based on graph definitions, and shows that a bubble-sort graph Bn can be embedded in a transposition graph Tn with dilation 1 and expansion 1. In contrast, a macro-star graph MS(2, n) can be embedded in a transposition graph with dilation n, but with an average dilation of 2 or under...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{structural}} {{properties of}} solid solutions based on EuMnO 3, in which Eu has been substituted by divalent Ca 2 + and Mn by the divalent cation Ni 2 + or the variable valence cation Co 2 +-Co 3 + {{have been studied}} by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). These substitutions lead {{to changes in the}} lattice parameters and the symmetry of the orthorhombic, O' perovskite-type of the pristine compound EuMnO 3. The structural changes depend on several factors. Solid solutions Eu(Mn,Ni) O 3 and Eu(Mn,Co) O 3 change from the O'-type to O-type orthorhombic perovskite symmetry when the content of the Mn 3 + cation decreases due to the progressive substitution by Ni and Co. This change occurs for a percentage of the Ni 2 + cation of 20 at%, whereas for the Co cation, only 10 at% are needed for such a transition. (Eu,Ca) MnO 3 solid solutions showed a different behaviour. Even at an amount as high as 50 at% Ca 2 + there is no transition from O' to O-type orthorhombic perovskite <b>symmetry.</b> The <b>tolerance</b> factor, t, increases monotonically for both Eu(Mn,Ni) O 3 and (Eu,Ca) MnO 3, while for Eu(Mn,Co) O 3 it first decreases and then increases. The increase is lower for Ni-based and Co-based samples than for the Ca-based ones...|$|R
40|$|For {{document}} visualization, folding techniques {{provide a}} focus-plus-context approach with fairly high legibility on flat sections. To enable richer interaction, we explore the design space of multi-touch document folding. We discuss several design considerations for simple modeless gesturing and compatibility with standard Drag and Pinch gestures. We categorize gesture models along {{the characteristics of}} Symmetric/Asymmetric and Serial/Parallel, which yields three gesture models. We built a prototype document workspace application that integrates folding and standard gestures, and a system for testing the gesture models. A user {{study was conducted to}} compare the three models and to analyze the factors of fold direction, target <b>symmetry,</b> and target <b>tolerance</b> in user performance when folding a document to a specific shape. Our results indicate that all three factors were significant for task times, and parallelism was greater for symmetric targets.

40|$|A 12 -bit 50 MS/s SAR ADC {{implemented}} in 65 nm CMOS technology is presented. The design employs redundancy to relax the DAC settling requirement {{and to provide}} sufficient room for errors such that the static nonlinearity caused by capacitor mismatches can be digitally removed. The redundancy is incorporated into the design using a tri-level switching scheme and our modified split-capacitor array to achieve the highest switching efficiency while still preserving the <b>symmetry</b> in error <b>tolerance.</b> A new code-density based digital background calibration algorithm that requires no special calibration signals or additional analog hardware is also developed. The calibration is performed by using the input signal as stimulus and the effectiveness is verified both in simulation and through measured data. The prototype achieves a 67. 4 dB SNDR at 50 MS/s, while dissipating 2. 1 mW from a 1. 2 V supply, leading to FoM of 21. 9 fJ/conv. -step at Nyquist frequency. MIT Masdar Progra...|$|R
40|$|The Macro-star graph {{which has}} the star graph as a basic module has node <b>symmetry,</b> maximum fault <b>tolerance,</b> and {{hierarchical}} decomposition property. And, it is an interconnection network which improves a network cost against the star graph. A Matrix-star graph also has such a good properties of the Macro-star graph and is an interconnection network which has a lower network cost than the Macrostar graph. In this paper, we propose a method to embed between the Macro-star graph and a Matrix-star graph. We show that the Macro-star graph MS(k,n) can be embedded into a Matrix-star graph MSk,n+ 1 with dilation 2. In addition, we show that a Matrix-star graph MSk,n can be embedded into the Macro-star graph MS(k,n+ 1) with dilation 4 and average dilation 3 or less as well. This result means that several algorithms developed in the star graph can be simulated in a Matrix-star graph at a lower cost. 1...|$|R

Las propiedades estructurales de las soluciones sólidas basadas en EuMnO 3, en donde Eu ha sido sustituido por Ca 2 +, y Mn por Ni 2 + o por un catión de valencia variable tal como Co, (II ó III) han sido estudiadas por Difracción de Rayos X, (DRX). Estas sustituciones llevan a cambios en los parámetros de red y en la simetría de la perovskita tipo O’ propia del compuesto EuMnO 3. Los cambios estructurales dependen de la cantidad y del tipo de catión sustituyente. Ni y Co inducen un cambio desde la estructura tipo O’ a la O para 20 at% Ni y 10 at% Co respectivamente. Por su parte, la incorporación de Ca en lugares A induce este cambio para x(Ca) > 50 at%. El factor de tolerancia de la estructura perovskita también muestra un comportamiento diferente en función del catión modificador...|$|R
