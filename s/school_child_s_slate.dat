40|$|Abstract Background Intestinal {{helminth}} {{infections are}} major parasitic diseases causing public health problems in Ethiopia. Although the epidemiology of these infections are well documented in Ethiopia, new transmission foci for schistosomiasis are being reported {{in different parts}} of the country. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni and other intestinal helminth infections among <b>school</b> <b>children</b> and determine the endemicity of schistosomiasis in Wolaita Zone, southern Ethiopia. Methods Cross-sectional parasitological and malacological surveys were conducted by collecting stool samples for microscopic examination and snails for intermediate host identification. Stool samples were collected from 503 children and processed for microscopic examination using Kato-Katz and formalin-ether concentration methods. Snails collected from aquatic environments in the study area were identified to species level and Biomphalaria pfeifferi snails, the intermediate host of S. mansoni,, were individually exposed to artificial light in order to induce cercariae shedding. Cercariae shed from snails were used to infect laboratory-bred Swiss albino mice in order to identify the schistosome to species level. Results The overall prevalence of intestinal helminth infections was 72. 2 % among <b>school</b> <b>children.</b> <b>S.</b> mansoni infection prevalence was 58. 6 %. The prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infections varied among schools and sex of children. Swimming was the only factor reported to be significantly associated with S. mansoni infection (AOR =  2. 954, 95 % CI: 1. 962 - 4. 449). Other intestinal helminth species identified were hookworms (27. 6 %), Ascaris lumbricoides (8. 7 %), E. vermicularis (2. 8 %), Taenia species (2. 6 %), T. trichiura (1. 2 %) and H. nana (0. 6 %). Only B. pfeifferi snails collected from streams shed schistosome cercariae and 792 adult S. mansoni worms were harvested from mice exposed to cercariae shed from B. pfeifferi on the 6 th week post-exposure. Conclusion The present study found high level of intestinal helminth infections in the study area. The study also confirmed autochthonous transmission and endemicity of S. mansoni as evidenced by both parasitological and malacological findings as well as by further establishing infections in lab-bred mice. Therefore, there is a need to include the area in the control programs with anti-helminth drugs and also consider other complementary measures including sanitation, provision of clean water supply, and snail control...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The study {{focus was}} to explore: the major {{challenges}} faced by teachers in the teaching: the teachers experiences in overcoming the challenges and then {{ways in which the}} teachers capacity can be improved in teaching and psychosocial needs support towards formerly abducted children (FAC). Qualitative approach was chosen with special reference to case study design. Three schools were the cases. The head-teachers and the classroom teachers were the main interviewees in the study process. Individual interview was carried out with the head-teachers and focus group discussions with the classroom teachers (the interviewees). The main reason to use the two instruments was based on the different roles being played by the head-teachers as administrators of the schools and teachers as the classroom curriculum implementers. Findings on challenges show the difficulties being experienced by teachers: in lesson preparations, disruptions of teaching-learning process, lack of teaching-learning materials, poor classroom management and the challenges that affect the personal lives of teachers. The challenges on the personal lives of teachers have directly influenced their commitment to teaching and support towards the war affected children. Teachers who are living in the IDPs do not have a conducive environment that can allow them to have ample time to make their schemes of work and plan lessons of the week. However, teachers in urban setting do not experience the same conditions of life when compared to teachers in the camps. The social emotional difficulties faced by teachers in their place of work cut across the three cases. Uncertainty and Increasing feelings of incompetence were some of the inclinations in the interviewees expressions. Teachers have continued to have no regard of support from both the Government of Uganda and the International communities to their situation of primary and secondary traumatic work related stress. Effects of occupational stressors on health outcomes of the teachers were reflected in the teachers conflicts with the children affected and inability to control their emotions. Nonetheless some humble and friendly approaches have been used in some situations to resolve the conflict between peers and teachers with their learners. Some trust was realised between teachers and the children. On the side of administration use of government policies has been useful. Teachers needed to be guided where they seem to go extreme with the <b>children</b> <b>s</b> behaviour difficulties. <b>School</b> rules and regulations also were applied as one way of curbing in indiscipline actions by children. Children who were once Commanders in the rebel ranks never wanted to take position of being a child in the classroom. They wanted to continue using their positions even when in the school. They were appointed as prefects in the <b>school.</b> <b>Children</b> <b>s</b> participation in the cultural activities was not very significant. Results show that children who walk from far away are not able to participate and others are not willing to participate. Play ground is lacking in IDP Schools. Rates of indiscipline were reduced. Others could be seen interacting with peers, drawing and making mats that were later used as seats for infant classes due to lack of desks. Child-Centred approach was not very prominent in the results. The findings tended to be more of academic experiences than interviewees practical experiences of the approach. Teachers are seen as change agents that can take a lead in the recovery process of children affected by war. Teachers need diverse approaches in terms of methodology and working with parents and communities. Parents need to be helped to be closer to teachers in order to combine effort in the recovery process of children in armed conflict. Policies with clear implications make people responsible and in this case mistreatments of children would not arise in the communities. Teachers need their abilities built if they are to fulfill the above aspects. This can be done through Continuous Professional Development (CPD). By and large psychosocial needs components should be included in both the Primary Teachers Colleges (PTC) curriculum and at University level. Teachers coming out of these institutions should have the ability to help learners under difficult circumstances especially the ones with psychosocial needs due to trauma...|$|R

Fluoride has been {{recognized as one of}} the most influential factor responsible for the observed decline of caries among children as well as adults of these countries. While fluoride is accepted as an effective method to prevent caries, the excessive consumption of fluoride can put teeth at risk of developing dental fluorosis. Aims and Objectives: To assess the prevalence of dental fluorosis among 12 – 15 years old government and private <b>school</b> <b>children</b> of Bharatpur city, Rajasthan. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out on total 1400 <b>school</b> <b>children,</b> out of which 700 <b>school</b> <b>children</b> were from government schools and 700 were from private schools. Simple random sampling methodology was used to select the sample. The subjects were examined for dental fluorosis according to WHO 1997 assessment form. Results: The prevalence of dental fluorosis was found higher among government <b>school</b> <b>children,</b> that is, 54. 5 % when compared to private <b>school</b> <b>children,</b> that is, 45. 5 % respectively, and this difference was found to be statistically significant (P ≤ 0. 05). Conclusion: The study showed the increased prevalence of dental fluorosis among government <b>school</b> <b>children</b> as compared to private <b>school</b> <b>children.</b> Dental fluorosis was found to be the major public health problem among both government and private <b>school</b> <b>children</b> of Bharatpur city which needed immediate attention.

In assessing peopleâs exposure to airborne lead, bio-monitoring techniques has been used as an indicator of chemical exposure. This study aims to determine the hair lead concentrations among <b>school</b> <b>children</b> in the province of Cavite and compare the hair lead concentrations of the <b>school</b> <b>children</b> living and studying in the urban and rural areas of the province of Cavite, Philippines. Consenting public and private <b>school</b> <b>children</b> of the municipalities of Bacoor and Alfonso were involved in the study. Hair strands were obtained from each student and analyzed for lead concentrations. Results of hair lead concentrations were compared for significant differences between the public and private schools in both areas using the t test under the significance level of p< 0. 05. A total of 922 consenting <b>school</b> <b>children</b> participated in this study. The hair lead concentrations (mean Â± SD) of all <b>school</b> <b>children</b> surveyed was 0. 2814 Â± 0. 1245 ppm. Hair lead concentrations of children studying in public schools were higher relative to those in private <b>schools.</b> <b>School</b> <b>children</b> residing in the urban areas had higher hair lead concentrations compared with those residing in the rural areas. Hair lead concentrations of <b>school</b> <b>children</b> living in urban and rural areas and those studying in private and public schools in Bacoor and Alfonso were found to be significantly different (t = 9. 096 and t = 6. 867, respectively; p< 0. 05).
