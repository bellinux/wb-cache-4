40|$|Abstract — Plasma is a {{variable}} load. It is a fourth state of matter. The plasma impedance varies {{over a wide}} range. This requires impedance matching with RF generator that is normally of 50 Ohm. An ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) system is an important system to heat plasmas and to drive anon-inductive current infusion devices. ICRF system will deliver 6 MW of RF power to plasma with a long-pulse length operation up to 300 s. Therefore, high-power RF transmission components are required to transmit a MW level of RF power continuously in the ICRF heating and current drive systems. For impedance matching network consists of <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> and phase shifter. A conventional <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> has moving arrangement. At high power moving arrangement is not suitable because of high current flowing through it. Finger contacts are used to make electrical contacts between different conductors Finger contact may burn due to high localized current. To avoid this problem, liquid <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> is the best option for the impedance matching. A liquid <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> makes use {{of the difference between}} the RF wave lengths in liquid and in gas due to the different relative dielectric constants. It is to be very reliable RF component for high power transmission systems. Changing the height of the liquid in the phase shifter varies the phase.

40|$|Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequency (ICRF) heating on the Large Helical Device (LHD) is {{characterized}} by high power (up to 12 MW) and steady state operation (30 minutes). The LHD is a helical device (with a major radius of 3. 9 m and a minor radius of 0. 6 m) with super-conducting coil windings (1 = 2, m= 10). The main purpose of physical research is to investigate currentless and disruptlon-free plasma. Research and development for steady state ICRF heating {{has been carried out}} in recent years: A high RF power transmission system consisting of stub tuners, a ceramic fee-through and an ICH loop antenna has been developed In addition, steady state operation of an RF oscillator has been achieved at a power higher than IMW. A liquid <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> has been proposed as an innovation. The liquid <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> makes use of the difference between the RF wave lengths in liquid and in gas due to the different relative dielectric constants. The liquid <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> has been experimentally proved to be a reliable RF component for high power transmission systems. Test results have quantitatively demonstrated that it can be used at high RF voltage: 6 lkV for 10 seconds and 50 kV for 30 minutes. Furthermore, the liquid surface can be shifted under high RF voltage without breakdown, which suggests that it can be employed as a feedback control impedance matching tool to keep reflected RF power at a low level with regard to a temporal variation of plasma loadlng resistance. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations of electron transport through stub-shaped waveguides or electron <b>stub</b> <b>tuners</b> (ESTs) in the ballistic regime. Measurements of the conductance G {{as a function}} of voltages, applied to different gates V_i (i=bottom, top, and side) of the device, show oscillations in the region of the first quantized plateau which we attribute to reflection resonances. The oscillations are rather regular and almost periodic when the height h of the EST cavity is small compared to its width. When h is increased, the oscillations become less regular and broad depressions in G appear. A theoretical analysis, which accounts for the electrostatic potential formed by the gates in the cavity region, and a numerical computation of the transmission probabilities successfully explains the experimental observations. An important finding for real devices, defined by surface Schottky gates, is that the resonance nima result from size quantization along the transport direction of the EST.

40|$|Quarter {{wavelength}} resonator (QWR) based deflecting cavities {{with the}} capability of supporting multiple odd-harmonic modes {{have been developed for}} an ultrafast periodic kicker system in the proposed Jefferson Lab Electron Ion Collider (JLEIC, formerly MEIC). Previous work on the kicking pulse synthesis and the transverse beam dynamics tracking simulations show that a flat-top kicking pulse can be generated with minimal emittance growth during injection and circulation of the cooling electron bunches. This flat-top kicking pulse can be obtained when a DC component and 10 harmonic modes with appropriate amplitude and phase are combined together. To support 10 such harmonic modes, four QWR cavities are used with 5, 3, 1, and 1 modes, respectively. In the multiple-mode cavities, several slightly tapered segments of the inner conductor are introduced to tune the higher order deflecting modes to be harmonic, and <b>stub</b> <b>tuners</b> are used to fine tune each frequency to compensate for potential errors. In this paper, we summarize the electromagnetic design of the five-mode cavity, including the geometry optimization to get high transverse shunt impedance, the frequency tuning and sensitivity analysis, and the single loop coupler design for coupling to all of the harmonic modes. In particular we report on the design and fabrication of a half-scale copper prototype of this proof-of-principle five-odd-mode cavity, as well as the rf bench measurements. Finally, we demonstrate mode superposition in this cavity experimentally, which illustrates the kicking pulse generation concept...|$|R

The present studied device is an electronic <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> modeled as S-Sm-S-Sm-S (S-superconductor, Sm-semiconductor). The thermo power of the present device is expressed in terms of the conductance of the system, which is derived by the technique based on Landauer-Büttiker equation. The influence of time-varying fields on the transport through such device has been taken into consideration and also the effect of magnetic field. The results show an oscillatory behavior of the dependence of the thermo power on both the magnetic field and frequency of the induced field. These oscillations appear as random fluctuation in peak heights. Analysis of these results shows that mesoscopic fluctuations obey Lorentzian distribution and under some conditions it is an exponential distribution.

40|$|The {{microwave}} electro thermal thruster (MET) is {{an electric}} propulsion concept that offers {{the promise of}} high performance combined with a long lifetime. A unique feature of this electric propulsion concept {{is its ability to}} create a microwave plasma discharge separated or floating away from any electrodes or enclosing walls. This allows propellant temperatures that are higher than those in resistojets and reduces electrode and wall erosion. It has been demonstrated that microwave energy is coupled into discharges very efficiently at high input power levels. As a result of these advantages, the MET concept has been identified as a future high power electric propulsion possibility. Recently, two additional improvements have been made to the coaxial MET. The first was concerned with improving the microwave matching. Previous experiments were conducted with 10 - 30 percent reflected power when incident power was in excess of 600 W(exp 6). Power was reflected back to the generator because the impedance of the MET did not match the 50 ohm impedance of the microwave circuit. To solve this problem, a double stub tuning system has been inserted between the MET and the microwave power supply. The addition of the double <b>stub</b> <b>tuners</b> reduces the reflected power below 1 percent. The other improvement has prepared the coaxial MET for hydrogen experiments. To operate with hydrogen, the vacuum window which separates the coaxial line from the discharge chamber has been changed from teflon to boron nitride. All the microwave energy delivered to the plasma discharge passes through this vacuum window. This material change had caused problems in the past because of the increased microwave reflection coefficients associated with the electrical properties of boron nitride. However, by making the boron nitride window electrically one-half of a wavelength long, power reflection in the window has been eliminated. This technical note summarizes the experimental performance of the improved coaxial MET when operating in nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen gases...|$|R

Even though disadvantages of this method is very long of stub (approximate 1 / 3 length of triangle edge).

40|$|Fast {{measurement}} of small currents and even smaller fluctuations in devices with large impedance is not trivial. Standard low frequency lock-in measurements suffer from stray capacitance {{of the order}} of nF reducing the bandwidth to merely kHz and a time resolution of ms. One approach of increasing the bandwidth is to connect the high-impedance device next to a low input impedance amplifier, though, the signal is decreased by the ratio of the impedances of the device and the amplifier, easily a factor of a thousand. Therefore, long averaging times are required to detect the small signal. Moreover, 1 /f noise still affects the measurements. The issues of small bandwidth, impedance mismatch and 1 /f noise can be simultaneously addressed using resonant LC circuits. The success of this impedance transformer lies in replacing the slow operation of applying voltages and measuring currents by applying fast radio frequency signals and measuring the reflectance. LC circuits remain appealing because of a rather simple assembly. Nonetheless, the challenge to reproducibly achieve the resonance frequencies in gigahertz (GHz) range while matching to high impedance still remains due to the large parallel stray capacitance of the measurement setup. Resonance frequency in GHz range is desirable for two reasons. Firstly, measurements are faster and 1 /f noise smaller. Yet more importantly, one can profit from the wide range of measurement techniques developed in the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics, such as FPGA based hardware and quantum limited Josephson parametric amplifiers. In this thesis, a matching circuit namely <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> based on coplanar transmission lines is designed, fabricated and integrated with mesoscopic devices. Owing to the simple design, we could predict the frequency response of a <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> in terms of the standard circuit model (Chapter 3). We initiated certain necessary fabrication adaptations to achieve integration of niobium circuits with devices. In particular, a reliable stamping of carbon nanotubes from the growth substrate to the target substrate was accomplished, improving both the device quality and yield (Chapter 4). RF reflectometry is employed to perform admittance measurements on CNT quantum dots. We could reliably deduce all circuit and device properties using the resonance response. The measurement bandwidth is shown to be in MHz range which is three orders of magnitude larger than that for DC measurements. In particular, using the phase response of the circuit, double-dot qubit energy and dephasing rate are studied (Chapter 5). We could even get rid of conventional contacts that could degrade the device properties, and still extract quantum capacitance and dissipation in graphene p-n junctions. The residual doping is shown to affect not only the mean free path but also the Fermi velocity. We further see that at small doping, electron-electron interactions could modify the Fermi velocity and that the dispersion relation could deviate from linearity (Chapter 6). In {{the second half of the}} scientific results, real strength of <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> is tested in transmission measurements. The large bandwidth and signal to noise ratio is utilized to measure extremely clean noise power densities at high speed and draw comparisons with the corresponding average current. Clear changes in the shot noise spectrum are seen when a transport channel is added or removed from the bias window of the quantum dot. We especially observe noise enhancement outside the Coulomb diamonds due to blocking states (Chapter 7). Finally, we investigate noise properties of quantum dots when leads are superconducting. Distinct charge transfers due to multiple Andreev reflections are visible in the shot noise. The main finding, however, was the thermal noise at zero bias. We observed its periodic suppression and emergence across the quantum dot resonance. In another device, shot noise due to the Kondo effect is found to be enhanced in the superconducting state when the Kondo temperature exceeds the value of the superconducting gap (Chapter 8). Simple design and reliable calibration of the GHz matching circuit in both reflectance and transmission pave a way for fast and non-invasive measurements of mesoscopic conductors. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} a fast {{high-frequency}} read-out of high impedance devices, such as quantum dots, necessitates impedance matching. Here we use a resonant impedance matching circuit (a <b>stub</b> <b>tuner)</b> realized by on-chip superconducting transmission lines to measure the electronic shot noise of a carbon nanotube quantum dot at a frequency close to 3 GHz in an efficient way. As compared to wide-band detection without impedance matching, the {{signal to noise ratio}} can be enhanced by as much as a factor of 800 for a device with an impedance of 100 kΩ. The advantage of the stub resonator concept is the ease with which the response of the circuit can be predicted, designed and fabricated. We further demonstrate that all relevant matching circuit parameters can reliably be deduced from power reflectance measurements and then used to predict the power transmission function from the device through the circuit. The shot noise of the carbon nanotube quantum dot in the Coulomb blockade regime shows an oscillating suppression below the Schottky value of 2 eI, as well an enhancement in specific regions.

40|$|We have modeled in one-dimension {{two-dimensional}} (2 -D) {{quantum wire}} structures: the notched electron <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> (NEST) and the double-notched electron <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> (D-NEST). The models consisted of square barriers representing the notches and square wells representing the stubs. We have calculated the transmission coefficient {{as a function}} of electron energy and/or device geometries to study electron transport through these quantum wire models. The transfer matrix method was used to calculate the transmission coefficient by utilizing a program written with Mathematica. The program and technique were verified using one-dimensional systems from the literature. We studied the principle of wave interference in the NEST model in the form of intersection points of several curves of the transmission coefficient versus barrier/well separation plotted with no offset. The creation of standing waves, in certain regions of the NEST model, by the interference of incident and reflected waves, gives rise to these intersection points. We have identified features in the conductance curves of the NEST and the transmission coefficient curves of the NEST model (the intersection points) that are very similar and may be explained by the same principle of wave interference. We have studied double-barrier resonant tunneling (DBRT) to assist in our study of the D-NEST model. The resonances in DBRT are attributed to the creation of standing waves between the two barriers for the tunneling and non-tunneling regimes. We attempted to prove the existence of these standing waves by studying the probability density in the D-NEST model. The well of the D-NEST model was scanned {{down the length of the}} double-barrier well region to investigate its effect on the transmission coefficient for this purpose. A small square barrier, used as a probe, was also used to study the probability density in the same way as the well was used. Initial scans of the probe above a simple square barrier gave us insight into the possibility of using it to scan for the probability density in the well region. The "over-the-barrier" resonances (attributed to standing waves) were studied in this case. We have developed knowledge of the transmission properties of these models that may aid in the understanding of the electron transport through the 2 -D devices. We believe that to "fine tune" the conductance output of the D-NEST device, the second notch should be placed at a location that permits the creation of standing waves, for a specific electron energy value, between the two notches of the device. The "fine tuning" of the conductance output into a square-wave pattern could improve the devices performance as a potential switching mechanism. Department of ChemistryThesis (M. S. ...|$|E

The Impurity problem was so completely overcome that the pulse length was easily extended to 68 sec at a power level of 0. 75 MW. The utility of a liquid <b>stub</b> <b>tuner</b> in steady state plasma heating was demonstrated in this shot. The energy confinement time of the ICRF heated plasma has the same dependences on plasma parameters as the ISS 95 stellarator scaling with a multiplication factor of 1. 5, which is a high efficiency comparable to NBI. Such an improvement in performance was obtained by applying various measures, including 1) scanning of the magnetic field intensity and minority concentration, 2) improvement of particle orbit due to a shift of the magnetic axis, and 3) reduction of impurities by means of Ti-gettering {{and the use of}} carbon divertor plates.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report {{was to create a}} low-cost, modest-power RF coupler for a SRF spoke cavity beam test of electrons test to be done at LANL. Developing the design for this magnetically-coupled SRF spoke cavity testing coupler was basically straightforward since the cavity coupling port needed {{to be one of the}} 1. 22 -inch ID ports, and the power level was limited by the available RF to less than 400 W TW power. In addition, the coupler would be immersed in bath cryostat filled with liquid helium, and ultimately used in a pulsed mode to accelerate beam, thereby significantly relaxing the thermal loads on the coupler. Combining the above considerations with the level of resources available for this task, emphasis was placed on rapidly developing a robust, reliable design that would use commercially-available components as available to save design, engineering, and fabrication costs. Analysis was also kept to a minimum. As such, the design incorporates the following features: (1) Use of a commercially-available Type-N ceramic feedthrough. For the power and frequency range of the test, with the feedthrough immersed in LHe, it was felt the Type-N feedthrough would provide a robust, low-cost vacuum window solution. (2) The coupler outer conductors would be solid OFE copper that is brazed into two 2. 75 -inch CFF, with the cavity-sde flange being rotatable to allow minor Qx adjustments by rotating the coupler. The braze joint shown has the copper brazed into a groove in the SST to ensure maximum strength for successive thermal cyclings. The outer wall of the copper between the two flanges serves as the heat sink for depositing coupler heat to the liquid helium.

A mass-reducing hole is placed down the center of the inner conductor to decrease thermal mass and weight.
