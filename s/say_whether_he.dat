5|$|In July 2014, Baker {{was criticized}} by Democrats {{for refusing to}} <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> {{supported}} {{a provision in the}} new gun control law that gave police chiefs discretion to deny firearms identification cards, which are required to purchase shotguns and rifles. He later stated in a debate that he would have signed the gun control bill as it was signed by Governor Patrick.|$|E
25|$|Some {{philosophers}} {{have seen}} ignosticism as {{a variation of}} agnosticism or atheism, while others have considered it to be distinct. An ignostic maintains that he cannot even <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> is a theist or an atheist until a sufficient definition of theism is put forth.|$|E
25|$|Bellamy {{stated that}} he would like to stay at Cardiff City beyond his loan spell to achieve his dream of them one day playing in the Premier League. After Cardiff manager Dave Jones' sacking, Bellamy became a {{surprise}} favourite to take over. However, the new Cardiff boss, Malky Mackay, who knew Bellamy from their days at Norwich, did not <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would attempt to sign Bellamy. Bellamy asked Manchester City to let him go on a free transfer after they put a £4,000,000 price tag on him.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the project, the real Blissett has been aware of the group taking his name. However, early reports differed widely in <b>saying</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> liked the attention he received because of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, I can't <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he's</b> {{happy or}} not. If he had {{got a new}} horse he would have written at much greater length about it. It seems, however, to be quite fixed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{not exactly}} hairy all over," [...] said Dick after a moment's thought, [...] "though it can't be denied he's {{got plenty of}} hair {{on his head and}} chin--like me. As for his looks, lad, it ain't easy to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he's</b> ugly or pritty, for men don't agree on sich pints, d'ye see?" ...|$|R
25|$|The bad {{election}} result in 2001 was quickly {{followed by a}} leadership battle between Jagland and Stoltenberg. Both Jagland, as leader, and Stoltenberg, as deputy leader, said they were open to be challenged for their positions at the party's congress in November 2002. Stoltenberg refused to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would challenge Jagland for the leadership position, which was seen by political commentators {{as a sign that}} he probably would seek the leadership position. In the beginning of February 2002, Jagland, who had been briefly hospitalized in January, and had a subsequent sick leave, said that he would not seek reelection as leader. In November 2002, Stoltenberg was unanimously elected new leader at the party's congress.|$|E
25|$|An Apostolic Visit {{is a rare}} {{event and}} it is also rare for a bishop to call for such an investigation. The Holy See sent Bishop Emeritus John Mortimer Smith, of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Trenton, New Jersey, to visit the Diocese. The July 11, 2011 press release also {{announced}} that Smith will submit a report to the Holy See. The last time such a public apostolic visitation occurred in the United States was in Seattle in 1983. Smith interviewed an estimated 25 to 30 people over five days. Pilla declined to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> met with Smith. After Smith left, it was not clear whether he finished his inquiry. Lakewood based FutureChurch, a church reform organization not affiliated with the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland, called on the Vatican to make Smith's findings public. Neither Smith nor the Diocese of Cleveland nor Diocese of Trenton further commented on Smith's visit.|$|E
25|$|Sigismund {{was officially}} deposed from {{the throne of}} Sweden by a Riksdag held in Stockholm on 24 July 1599. He was given six months to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> wanted to send his son, Prince Władysław Vasa, to Sweden as his successor, under the {{condition}} that the boy would be brought up in the Evangelical faith. Otherwise the Estates would look for a new king. In February 1600, Duke Charles summoned the Estates of the Realm to Linköping. Since Sigismund had not provided a reply, the Estates elected Duke Charles as King Charles IX of Sweden. The consequences for those who had supported Sigismund were devastating. The most prominent among them were killed by the new King in the Linköping Bloodbath. During the winter and spring of 1600, Charles also occupied the Swedish part of Estonia, as the castle commanders had shown sympathies towards Sigismund. Charles' invasion of Livonia led to a series of wars with Poland, starting with the Second Polish–Swedish War. Charles accepted the crown as Charles IX in 1604.|$|E
50|$|During the 2004 {{election}} campaign, Howard avoided <b>saying</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> {{would serve}} a full term if re-elected, saying only he would remain {{as long as}} his party supported him. The government's subsequent success in winning control of the Senate raised further speculation that Howard would delay his retirement, and the prospect of a Costello leadership succession appeared to recede.|$|R
60|$|Sewell was fulsomely grateful, {{as we all}} are in {{the like}} case, and at the station he used an urbanity with the captain which was perhaps not thrown away upon him, but which was {{certainly}} disproportioned to the trouble he was asking him to take in <b>saying</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> knew where he could find officer Baker.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you see, {{there is}} {{the risk of the}} things being lost or stolen on the way home, or being ruined by damp before they are wanted again. Besides, a man thinks there is no <b>saying</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> shall ever want them again, or how long the war will last, and is glad to take {{anything}} he can get to save himself any further bother about them." ...|$|R
25|$|The CIO then {{attempted}} {{to subvert the}} AA from within. If the AA changed its mind about organizing along industrial lines, Green and the AFL—which above all else respected each member union's autonomy—could do little to prevent the organizing campaign. The CIO approached President Tighe on April 15 and asked to speak to delegates at the AA's convention, but Tighe refused to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would permit a CIO address. Fewer than 100 delegates gathered at the AA's convention in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, on April 28, 1936. Tighe locked {{the doors of the}} convention hall to keep the CIO officials out. Tighe then asked the members to vote on whether they wished to hear the CIO offer. The delegates voted 42 to 43 (with seven abstentions) to refuse to hear the proposal. But the CIO found a way to end-run the AA leadership. When the Pennsylvania State Federation of Labor sent a delegation to deliver greetings to the AA, the delegation included John Brophy, the newly hired organizing director of the CIO. Tighe initially refused him entrance, but was forced to give Brophy access under pressure from the delegates. In his remarks, Brophy explained the offer of the CIO: $500,000 for the organization of the steel industry, provided the campaign occurred along industrial lines. A motion was made and carried to appoint a committee to study the proposal.|$|E
500|$|Historian Wolfgang Sauer {{says that}} [...] "although he was pedantic, dogmatic, and dull, Himmler emerged under Hitler as second in actual power. His {{strength}} {{lay in a}} combination of unusual shrewdness, burning ambition, and servile loyalty to Hitler." [...] Historian Peter Padfield opined that [...] "Himmler... appeared {{the most powerful man}} under Hitler. It is impossible to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was in practice, and meaningless to ask, since he was never prepared to use his power directly to change the course of events..." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the final}} {{story of the}} series, [...] "The Real Folk Blues", Julia comes out of hiding and {{sends a message to}} Spike through Faye: the two meet and resolve to flee as {{originally}} planned. Vicious, having staged a coup d'état and taken over the Red Dragon Syndicate, sends assassins after the two. During a battle, Julia is shot and killed. After saying his goodbyes to Jet and Faye, Spike storms the headquarters of the Syndicate and has a final confrontation with Vicious: Spike is severely wounded and Vicious is killed. Shortly after this, Spike walks into and collapses in the entrance hall. Spike's ultimate fate was deliberately left ambiguous, with Watanabe eventually unable to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> lived or died.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know nothing}} of him,' she sobbed, feeling for her pocket handkerchief. 'He left me when Maryann was a baby, went mining to America, and after about six months never wrote a line nor sent me a penny bit. I can't <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he's</b> alive or dead, the villain. All I've heard of him's to the bad--and I've heard nothing for years an' all, now.' She sobbed violently.|$|R
500|$|Thomas' {{identification}} with the bishop remains doubtful. A surviving letter by Pope Gregory IX directly to the chaplain of Nousiainen on 20 October 1232 makes the Finnish see appear vacant. The letter handled the same land dispute that Thomas himself addressed two years later. In some copies of the letter, the Bishop of Finland is {{also referred to as}} [...] "N.", while not directly <b>saying</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was still in office or not.|$|R
50|$|At Gigi's funeral, Tony contemplates {{promoting}} Vito, Eugene, Donny K., or Ralph. At Nuovo Vesuvio, Tony informs Ralph that he {{has been}} bumped up to capo, but refuses to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he's</b> being promoted on merit or just to replace Gigi. Later, Tony visits Gloria's dealership and asks if she will accompany him on a test drive. They end up on Tony's boat, where it is implied that they have sex. Gloria calls Dr. Melfi to cancel her session. Dr. Melfi hears a man's voice in the background.|$|R
500|$|On April 20 Hanover {{announced}} that she would soon be taking over the lead role in Eve Ensler's controversial play The Vagina Monologues. [...] Political observers speculated that Hanover was partly engaging in a political act against her husband, as Ensler was a friend and supporter of Hillary Clinton and the role would not go over well with social conservatives within the Republican Party. [...] Giuliani declined to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would attend one of her performances. [...] On April 22, the New York Post obtained photographs of Giuliani openly strolling on a Manhattan street with the other woman after they left a restaurant, but did not {{have more than a}} first name for her; the Post sat on the story, but it was clear the relationship was a personal one.|$|E
500|$|Late on {{the night}} of August 12, 1945, Major Kenji Hatanaka, along with Lieutenant Colonels Masataka Ida, Masahiko Takeshita (Anami's brother-in-law), and Inaba Masao, and Colonel Okitsugu Arao, the Chief of the Military Affairs Section, spoke to War Minister Korechika Anami (the army {{minister}} and [...] "most powerful figure in Japan besides the Emperor himself"), and asked him to do whatever he could to prevent acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration. General Anami refused to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> would help the young officers in treason. As much as they needed his support, Hatanaka and the other rebels decided they {{had no choice but to}} continue planning and to attempt a coup d'état on their own. Hatanaka spent much of August 13 and the morning of August 14 gathering allies, seeking support from the higher-ups in the Ministry, and perfecting his plot.|$|E
500|$|Andrey Lugovoy : A former [...] Federal Protective Service of Russia {{officer and}} millionaire {{who met with}} Litvinenko {{on the day he}} fell ill (1 November). He had visited London at least three times in the month before Litvinenko's death and met with the victim four times. Traces of polonium-210 have been {{discovered}} in all three hotels where Lugovoy stayed after flying to London on 16 October, and in the Pescatori restaurant in Dover Street, Mayfair, where Lugovoy is understood to have dined before 1 November; [...] and aboard two aircraft on which he had travelled. He has declined to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had been contaminated with polonium-210. The Crown Prosecution Service has charged him with murder and has sent an extradition request to Russia that includes a summary of the evidence, but the only third party to have seen the extradition request, American journalist Edward Epstein, has described the substantiation as [...] "embarrassingly thin".|$|E
5000|$|On 22-23 September 2007, {{an address}} by Duvalier to Haitians was {{broadcast}} by radio. Although he said exile had [...] "broken" [...] him, {{he also said}} that what he described as the improving fortunes of the National Unity Party had [...] "reinvigorated" [...] him, and he urged readiness among his supporters, without <b>saying</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> intended to return to Haiti. President René Préval rejected Duvalier's apology and, on 28 September, he said that, while Duvalier was constitutionally free to return to Haiti, he would face trial if he did so. Duvalier's radio broadcast address was given in French and not Haitian Creole, the language spoken by the majority of Haitians.|$|R
6000|$|My aunt {{turned to}} me with an aggrieved tone. It is a {{peculiarity}} of my aunt's--I have met it elsewhere--that if she is angry with Jones, and Jones is not present, she assumes a tone of injured asperity on his account towards Brown or Smith, or any other innocent person whom she happens to be addressing. [...] "Now, this is really too bad, Hubert," [...] she burst out, as if I were the culprit. [...] "Disgraceful! Abominable! I'm sure I can't make out what the young fellow means by it. Here he comes dangling after Daphne every day and all day long--and never once <b>says</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> means anything by it or not. In MY young days, such conduct as {{that would not have}} been considered respectable." ...|$|R
50|$|In a {{recording}} of Heck at a private event in October 2016, he said he believed Trump may hurt other Republicans' electoral bids. Prior to the election, <b>he</b> did not <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> or not <b>he</b> would vote for Trump.|$|R
500|$|Jean {{has stated}} that he [...] "does not know enough" [...] to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> approves of the {{legislation}} of medicinal marijuana, but none of The Simpsons writers use the drug. [...] "It's {{one of the most}} sober writing staffs I've ever encountered", staff writer Max Pross said in the episode's DVD commentary. When asked about what stance the episode holds regarding the legislation of medicinal marijuana, Jean said that series' staff wanted to explore both sides of the issue, rather than making an absolute statement. He added that the episode is rather a critique of legislations that are immediately criminalized after they are legitimized. [...] "The stance is that it seems ridiculous to legalize something and then criminalize it, which I have seen happen in various states", Jean said. He continued, [...] "It's just weird to take away a right or to grant people a liberty and then abandon it. I would say that's the strongest statement [...] makes." [...] The episode also criticizes the use of genetically modified foods. At the beginning of the episode, Marge announces that the family's dinner includes genetically modified vegetables, to which Lisa replies [...] "American corporations should stop playing god with nature." [...] She then notices that her potato starts eating her carrot. Even though the episode portrays genetic modifications in a negative light, none of The Simpsons writers were actually against the technique. After the scene was written, Reiss asked all the writers if they were against genetic modifications of food, and none of them were. [...] "Very often we take these stands on the show that we do not believe in at all", Reiss explained in the DVD commentary for the episode. The scene was originally three times longer, and was conceived during a rewrite session with the staff writers.|$|E
2500|$|Ratzinger did not {{directly}} <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend's assertions, but did say in this same context that [...] "It {{would be foolish to}} construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Brings Plenty, {{chairman}} of the Cheyenne River Lakota, agreed that the Lakota Freedom Delegation [...] "are not representative of the nation I represent" [...] but would not <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> agreed or disagreed with their goals and message, noting some value in the group's actions in raising awareness {{for the history of}} the Lakota people.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{thanks are due}} at all, Captain Barclay," [...] the old veteran said. [...] "You have well earned your promotion; and Gambetta--who {{speaks of}} you, I may say, in the highest terms--tells me that he promised you the step, if you got in. I need not <b>say</b> that, <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had done so or not, I should have given it to you.|$|R
5000|$|A memorable play {{occurred}} during the eighth inning of Game 3. The Senators' Sam Rice ran after an Earl Smith line drive hit into right center field. Rice made a diving [...] "catch" [...] into the temporary stands, but did not emerge with the ball for approximately fifteen seconds. The Pirates contested the play, saying a fan probably stuffed the ball into Rice's glove. The call stood and Rice parried questions about the incident {{for the rest of}} his life—never explicitly <b>saying</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had or had not really made the catch. His typical answer (including to Commissioner Landis, who said it was a good answer) was always [...] "The umpire said I caught it." [...] Rice left a sealed letter at the Hall of Fame to be opened after his death. In it, he had written: [...] "At no time did I lose possession of the ball." ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{visit was}} limited to two entire days. One was passed amidst all the sweets of love-making. With the pleasures of that no allusions were allowed to interfere. On the {{following}} morning he found himself alone with Lord Persiflage after breakfast. [...] "Delighted to have had you down here, you know," [...] began his lordship. To this Roden simply bowed. [...] "I haven't the pleasure of knowing your uncle personally, but there isn't a man in Europe for whom I have a higher respect." [...] Again Roden bowed. [...] "I've heard all about this romance of yours from D'Ossi. You know D'Ossi?" [...] Roden declared {{that he had not}} the honour of knowing the Italian Minister. [...] "Ah; well, you must know D'Ossi, of course. I won't <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he's</b> your countryman or not, but you must know him. He is your uncle's particular friend." ...|$|R
2500|$|Testifying {{again before}} HUAC in 1950, Lee Pressman named Witt {{as a member}} of the CPUSA and the [...] "Ware group." [...] Speaking before a HUAC {{subcommittee}} on September 1, Witt once more denied that he had engaged in espionage, again invoked his Fifth Amendment privileges when asked about his CPUSA and [...] "Ware group" [...] membership, and refused to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> knew Chambers, Bentley, or scores of others.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} Wikipedia administrators {{strongly}} believed an editor on Wikipedia to be Gilead Ini and blocked that user account indefinitely. In April 2008 Gilead refused to <b>say</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> {{was behind the}} Gni account, and in May 2008 he denied that the account belonged to him. Andre Oboler alleged that groups such as [...] "Wikipedians for Palestine" [...] have engaged in similar practices. Electronic Intifada co-founder Ali Abunimah insisted that his group would never encourage a similar e-mail campaign.|$|E
