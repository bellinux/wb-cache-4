40|$|Context With {{the rapidly}} growing demand for {{cellular}} networks’ capacityand coverage, effective planning of Network Infrastructure (NI) has been amajor challenge for the telecom operators. The mobility patterns of different <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups</b> in the networks {{have been found to}} be a crucialaspect in the planning of NI. For a telecom operator, it is important to havean estimate of the efficiency (in terms of the Network Capacity - numberof subscribers that the network can handle) of the existing NI. For thispurpose, Lundberg et. al., have developed an optimization based strategycalled as Tetris Strategy (TS), based on the standard subscriber groupingapproach called MOSAIC. The objective of TS is to calculate the upperbound estimate of the efficiency of the NI. Objectives The major objective of this thesis is to compare the efficiencyvalue of the NI when the <b>subscribers</b> are <b>grouped</b> (clustered) based on theirmobility patterns (characterized by a mobile trajectory) with the efficiencyvalue obtained when the <b>subscribers</b> are <b>grouped</b> based on the standardsubscriber grouping approach - MOSAIC. Methods Literature Review (LR) has been conducted to identify the stateof the art similarity/distance measures and algorithms to cluster trajectory data. Among the identified ones, for conducting experiments, LongestCommon Subsequences has been chosen as a similarity/distance measure,and Spectral and Agglomerative clustering algorithms have been chosen. All the experiments have been conducted on the subscriber trajectory dataprovided by the telecom operator, Telenor. The clusters obtained from theexperiments have been plugged into TS, to calculate the upper bound estimate of the efficiency of the NI. Results For the highest radio cell capacity, the network capacity valuesfor Spectral clustering, Agglomerative clustering and MOSAIC groupingsystem are 207234, 148056 and 87584 respectively. For every radio cellcapacity value, the mobility based clusters resulted in a higher network efficiency values than the MOSAIC. However, both spectral and agglomerativealgorithms have generated a very low quality clusters with the silhouettescores of 0. 0717 and 0. 0543 respectively.

30|$|As it was {{aforementioned}} in {{the previous}} sections, an operator may face at any moment congestion in the infrastructure. In order to overcome this problematic situation, our approach proposes the use of ONs for the infrastructure capacity extension through femtocells. Femtocells are fully featured but low power BSs that operate in licenced spectrum in order to connect mobile terminals to the network of an operator through residential broadband connections [16]. Therefore, the signal strength improves significantly resulting in better QoS. Moreover, there are different ways for a user to access a femtocell: the closed <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) model, where {{only a limited number}} of users have access to femtocell’s resources. These users are defined by the femtocell owner. The open <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (OSG) where all the operator’s customers have access to the femtocell.

The Femtocell is the right answer to fulfill the cellular telecommunication system requirements nowadays.

When using the Femtocell it can produces sometimes interference signals to the Macrocell in uplink {{as well as in}} downlink communication because not all of the users can be connected to the Femtocell in a Closed <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Group</b> Femtocell system. This thesis analyses and calculates how the Closed <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Group</b> Femtocell affects the Macrocell in both ways - in uplink to the Macrocell and also in downlink to the Macrocell User Equipment for the maximum power of the Femtocell with 21 dBm.

[...] School of Computing and Engineering. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2014 The demand for cellular communications is anticipated {{to continue its}} hasty growth in the forthcoming future, triggered by new bandwidth hungry applications such as voice over LTE, high-definition video streaming, and multimedia file sharing in mobile phones. This has placed enormous pressure on cellular communications in terms of demand for Quality of Service (QoS), capacity, and resource management. Henceforth, the apposite utilization of obtainable spectrum is required. Public Safety (PS) organizations’ capability to exchange information is crucial to meliorate the coordination in emergency junctures. Recent catastrophes have underlined the need to enhance broadband and seamless connectivity to the PS organizations. This thesis outlines the governing issues necessitated in this, and also additional requirements of the network are addressed regardless of dynamic channel conditions and locations. In this thesis, subscribers are divided into groups viz., PS <b>groups</b> and regular <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups.</b> A new scheme, beyond the type of services being used by subscribers, priorities and fairness, is developed. In order to abridge operational costs and efforts, SONs (Self Organizing Networks) are implemented in this thesis and the prospects have been discussed. Additionally, Group Scheduling is implemented to achieve better performance for PS and regular <b>subscribers</b> <b>groups.</b> An advanced scheduling algorithm for group scheduling is developed which provides better QoS for multi-services and a better trade-off between Quality of Service and radio resource management. This scheduling algorithm provides a better balance between multi-QoS purveying to support mixes of sensitive traffic and best effort traffic. This phenomenon is used to choose the best <b>subscriber</b> and the <b>group.</b> Several metrics have been devised and are used for this purpose. Extensive simulation results are shown for both the conditions viz., normal and emergency conditions.

40|$|To {{meet the}} surging demand for throughput, 5 G {{cellular}} networks {{need to be}} more heterogeneous and much denser, by deploying more and more small cells. In particular, the number of users in each small cell can change dramatically due to users' mobility, resulting in random and time varying uplink interference. This paper considers the uplink interference in a 5 G heterogeneous network which is jointly covered by one macro cell and several small cells. Based on the Lévy flight moving model, a mobility-aware interference model is proposed to characterize the uplink interference from macro cell users to small cell users. In this model, the total uplink interference is characterized by its moment generating function, for both closed <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) and open <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) femto cells. In addition, the proposed interference model is a function of basic step length, which is a key velocity parameter of Lévy flights.

Usage of broadcast/multicast bearers allows multiple receiving SUs to share downlink radio resources and receive the same data in parallel. Hence, this technology allows network operators reducing costs for delivering multimedia services, such as mobile IPTV, audio/video file-casting, mass software, and configuration updates. Further, multicast/broadcast transmission allows such services to scale well {{with the number of}} users, without modifying the network capacity even in case of extremely high service demand. Multicast services are more complex to be designed and maintained than broadcast services due to additional signaling exchange and content delivery authorization and management. For this reason, the implemented service, shown in what follows as a proof-of-concept of our architecture, focuses on multicast transmission of IPTV to WiMAX users.|$|R

30|$|Another {{important}} {{problem is}} the provision of high-quality services within vehicles on the move. One possible solution {{to address the problem}} in the future will be the deployment of a relay within the vehicle. The relay can be connected to the vehicular rooftop antenna, in order to establish a robust (relay/backhaul) link to the cellular network. On the other hand, relays allow for optimum coverage conditions inside the vehicle and a certain control of the consumed resources through the usage of closed <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups.</b> Since the use of a relay eliminates the vehicle penetration loss (VPL) and provides additional antenna gains due to better characteristics of the rooftop antenna, this solution improves significantly the link budget [20] and allows for a more efficient resource utilization of the cellular network. However, in current LTE networks, an additional overhead burden due to signaling exists (around 10 %), and therefore, the benefit from the use of those relays is to be demonstrated.|$|R
30|$|As {{a result}} of this {{sustained}} data traffic growth, some MNOs are finding themselves in a situation of approaching, in some areas, their network capacity limit. In an attempt to avoid or at least delay this from happening, some MNOs have started to limit or abolish completely their unlimited data plans [12]. At the same time network upgrades of various types are being carried out where necessary. In countries where licenses have already been auctioned off, operators have also started rolling out and testing LTE. By utilizing a more flexible frequency multiplexing technique (OFDM) and advanced antenna techniques, LTE can use different carrier bandwidths of up to 20 MHz, resulting in reduced latency, and a boost in data rates beyond the 100 Mbps mark [13]. Since the uptake of any new technology could take a number of years, until the penetration rate of LTE compatible devices reaches certain levels [14], traffic can still be expected to grow on the HSPA layer. As the number of network layers increases, MNOs have to manage and maintain all layers (including GSM) prioritizing different resources and service levels to a variety of <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{implementation}} of our interference coordination approach demands {{the exchange of}} control information between victim FUE and interfering FAP. In our system model, we consider that this signaling exchange is done over the air in a single-hop fashion, relaxing the requirement of having a backhaul femto gateway (FGW) connection that supports real time control message exchange using a two-hop approach (i.e., relaying the control information from serving to interfering FAP). Note that actually, 3 GPP Rel. 10 supports an X 2 -like interface between FAPs. However, the information exchange over X 2 is time constrained due to delay issues, especially when dealing with FAPs that belong to different closed <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups</b> (CSGs). Although {{it will take some}} years until Rel. 10 products become widely available in the market, the main limitation for using control messages over X 2 is that the quality of this interface is not expected to improve considerably in the future (especially for residential customers that use xDSL connections as backhaul). Thus, standardizing effective over the air control mechanisms is important, to be able to implement interference coordination schemes within femtocell environments in a simple way.|$|R

For example, it is not allowed that a user is offloaded to a cell for a closed <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) {{if it is not}} a member of the corresponding CSG [30].

30|$|The UL {{signalling}} based scheme {{introduced in}} this paper has several advantages {{with respect to the}} state-of-the-art scheme from [6]. First of all, the macro cell can use the reported information from small cells in the on state, e.g., their current system load, during the connection establishment procedure, to help selecting the best small cell candidate for a UE. Furthermore, the fact that the macro cell is responsible for the UE small cell connection triggering event makes it possible for the macro cell to send a wake-up signal configuration message to the UE before the UE sends the wake-up signal, which can limit the effect of the wake-up signal so that it only affects a limited number of small cells, such as small cells belonging to a specific closed <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG), or small cells offering a specific amount of bandwidth.|$|E
30|$|Femtocell base {{stations}} (FBSs) are low-power nodes to provide high throughput and customized services to users, and together with macrocells, they form heterogeneous networks (HetNets). Deploying femtocells {{is an effective}} and efficient way to increase wireless network capacity, and it provides great benefits to network operators by producing new services. Along with their small size, low cost, and plug-and-play features[1, 2], femtocells are considered as a big thing[3] in both existing and future mobile communications. On the other hand, with their marked development, femtocells tend to be large-scale and self-organized[4], which brings a big challenge for interference management. More specially, to satisfy femtocell occupants’ self-interests, most of them prefer to configure their networks as Closed <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Group</b> (CSG) mode, i.e., users cannot access a specific femtocell without authorization and hence will cause interference to nearby macrocell users (MUEs). Moreover, nearby femtocells would interfere with {{each other as they}} become denser, thereby deteriorating network performance.|$|E
40|$|In Long Term Evolution (LTE) /LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) networks, hybrid access femtocells {{have been}} {{introduced}} as a tradeoff between closed and open access femtocells.

Existing studies do not consider the LTE/LTE-A protocols and QoS priority of different traffic classes. In this work, a resource management scheme for prioritizing closed <b>subscriber</b> <b>group</b> (CSG) members and QoS provisioning in LTE/LTE-A hybrid access femtocells is proposed. Firstly, an admission control problem and a packet scheduling problem, which account for different user priority and QoS of different traffic classes, are formulated.

30|$|A more {{challenging}} interference situation is obtained {{by dividing the}} UEs and BSs into two closed <b>subscriber</b> <b>groups</b> (CSGs) operating on a shared band. The UEs of the two CSGs are still distributed evenly over the floor, but are only allowed to connect to own CSG BS, which may be much further away than the closest BS. Figure 4 (b) shows the resulting throughput distributions. As expected, the PF scheduler is struggling with coverage due to the very high amount of interference between the two CSGs. Interference awareness is able {{to get rid of}} the coverage issue completely and make the shared band operation for two CSGs possible. The difference between the IA scheduler and the global optimum is very small compared to the gain relative to PF scheduler, and we may conclude that very high gain in system utility can be obtained with the proposed distributed scheme. Note that one can estimate a rough upper bound on the performance of a system where the two CSGs use orthogonal bands by scaling the no CSG results of Figure 4 (a) by half. It can be seen that the shared band solution with IA scheduler would beat the orthogonal bands PF scheduler by a significant margin.|$|R
