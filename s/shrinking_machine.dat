50|$|Shrinking {{is often}} {{accomplished}} {{with a machine}} of some kind, as in the films Fantastic Voyage, Innerspace and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. In some works, the machine can enlarge as well; in Honey, I Blew Up the Kid, a <b>shrinking</b> <b>machine</b> makes a toddler 100 feet tall. Both types of machine normally {{have the ability to}} reverse the shrinking process (though sometimes, as in Fantastic Voyage, the reversal happens automatically after a certain period).|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1960s, RC {{started the}} design of a small {{integrated}} circuit-based computer system for industrial control and automation needs, initially to fill a request by a Danish company to automate a chemical factory they were building in Poland. The RC 4000 design emerged in 1966 and was completed for the factory the next year. When combined with appropriate peripherals, almost always including an RC 2000 along with several re-branded devices from other companies, the RC 4000 was a highly reliable minicomputer, and went on to be sold across Europe. The RC 8000 from the mid-1970s used newer-generation ICs to shrink the RC 4000 into a single rack-mount system. The last in the series, the RC 9000, further <b>shrunk</b> the <b>machine</b> and improved performance to about 4 MIPS, and was sold in versions that could run either RC 8000 programs, or Unix.|$|R

50|$|Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is a 1989 American comic {{science fiction}} film. The directorial debut of Joe Johnston and {{produced}} by Walt Disney Pictures, {{it tells the}} story of an inventor who accidentally shrinks his and his neighbor's kids to a quarter of an inch with his electromagnetic <b>shrinking</b> <b>machine</b> and throws them out into the backyard with the trash, where they must venture into their backyard to return home while fending off insects and other obstacles.|$|E

When he gallantly saves the hive, the Queen Bee, Reine Fleur de Miel 145 (Queen Honey Flower 145) knights him. Eventually, they organize the bees and other woodland animals to attack the castle and rescue (and restore) his trapped friends.|$|E

Fluffy tries to enlarge Captain Underpants (accidentally enlarging Cheeseball's right hand) {{to the size of}} Poopypants' gerbil machine. Captain Underpants then fights and defeats Professor Poopypants. Once Professor Poopypants is defeated, everyone's names revert to their original state. The boys use the <b>shrinking</b> and enlarging <b>machines</b> to bring the school and Captain Underpants back to normal size.

30|$|As the {{gap between}} human and <b>machine</b> <b>shrinks,</b> it becomes {{increasingly}} important to develop computer systems that incorporate or enhance existing Situation Awareness. However, these {{tend to focus on}} raw quantitative parameters, such as position and speed of objects. When these situations are governed by human actors, such parameters leave significant margins of uncertainty. In this paper, we discuss the potential of applying the characteristics intrinsic to the human actors that comprise a given situation to Situation Awareness, and the capacity that these concepts have to improve situation-aware systems. We argue that intention-aware based systems offer an advantage over situation-aware based systems in that they reduce the informational burden on humans without limiting effectiveness. We argue that computational analysis and tracking of semantic and affective information associated with human actors' intentions are an effective way to minimize miscommunication and uncertainty, particularly in time-sensitive and information-saturated situations.|$|R
40|$|Heat {{shrink tubing}} {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create cable entry seals in wire harnessing industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operator’s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operators’ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a heat <b>shrink</b> tubing prototype <b>machine</b> that benefits the wire harnessing industry. The prototype consists of an instrumented heat chamber on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two heat guns. The chamber design allows for the directing of hot air from the heat guns onto the wire harness uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the heat chamber along the wire harness as the proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the heat shrink tubing process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the heat chamber. A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamber’s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform. The control unit performance is examined and its responses follow the simulation results with adequate accuracy...|$|R

Cortex then introduces his Planetary Minimizer, which he immediately uses to shrink the Earth down {{to the size of}} a grapefruit. The situation is brought to Aku Aku's attention when Cortex taunts the now-microscopic people of Earth. When Aku Aku informs Crash of the Earth's predicament, Coco assumes that Cortex is using the Crystals to power his <b>shrinking</b> <b>machine,</b> and requests that Crash find the same kind of Crystals in various locations around the world, which she will use to build a device that will reverse the effects of Cortex's Minimizer.|$|E

The player's mission is to gather parts of Harley's (presumably) now-destroyed <b>shrinking</b> <b>machine</b> to return him to normal size. As the player advances through levels, they pick items such as tacks, rubberbands and marbles. The many locations the player adventures through is Harley's lab where the initial incident occurs, Harley's Kitchen, Harley's toy room, where the player pilots a toy tank by himself, Harley's Bathroom, and other stages.

In addition, 20th Century Fox was known to want someone with some science-fiction clout to help promote the film. To his credit, aside from the initial [...] "impossibility" [...] of the <b>shrinking</b> <b>machine,</b> Asimov made extensive use of his background in hard science and {{went to great lengths to}} portray with great accuracy what it would actually be like to be shrunk to that scale, such as the lights on the sub being highly penetrating to normal matter, time distortion, and other side effects that are completely ignored in the movie.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{question}} of whether children and infants have memory capabilities similar to adults has long been of interest. Until recently, {{it was thought that}} compared to adults, infants have very limited memory processing abilities. Knowledge about factors affecting a child’s memory abilities can help families (specifically mothers) behave in a manner that best benefits their children in language and memory skills. The present study examines one factor that may underlie a child’s memory capabilities; namely the mother’s narrative style. Methods: Convenience sampling was used to select participants. Forty healthy children (mean age of 31. 55 months, range 25 - 37 months) and their mothers were entered into the study. All participants were native Turkish speakers, from similar socioeconomic status backgrounds. Memory was assessed by {{a modified version of the}} Magic <b>Shrinking</b> <b>Machine.</b> Narrative style was assessed by the mother “reading ” a Frog Story; a picture book with no words in it. Children were then grouped according to their mother’s level of narrative style. Children’s language skills were measured via the Turkish form of the CDI (Communicative Development Inventory) which was translated to Turkish as TIGE. Results: To explore the relationships between mothers ’ narrative styles and children’s memory and language skills and between children’s language skills and memory capabilities, linear regressions were run. There were no significant correlations among any comparison...|$|E
