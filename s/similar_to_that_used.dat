5|$|According to the 1995 presidential decree, the {{national}} flag {{is to be}} used on a staff that is colored gold (ochre). Other parts of the protocol specify the finial (the metal ornament on a flag pole) as diamond-shaped and colored in a yellow metal. In this diamond there is a five-pointed star (<b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> in national emblem). The diamond-pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag-traditions.|$|E
5|$|At a waterfall, {{another girl}} commits suicide by drowning. The girl, Carlin, looks {{identical}} to Lauren. Andrews performs an autopsy on Carlin as well, finding the same astrological symbol. It also {{becomes clear that}} the two girls are related—identical twins, born seven years apart. The girls are clones, produced using a technique <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> to create identical cattle. Black believes that this is connected to Hoffman's Earth Changes theory, that someone is breeding offspring destined to survive May 5, 2000.|$|E

5|$|Gunnerkrigg Court {{is set in}} a {{boarding}} school in a country that resembles the United Kingdom, identifiable from the grey skies and mandatory uniforms. The comic contains other clues about the setting, such as the house system that is described {{at the end of the}} first chapter. This system is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> by many UK schools, including the one the author attended; Siddell has even stated that the school in which Gunnerkrigg Court takes place is modeled after his own secondary school.|$|E
5|$|Silk {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of a protein very <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> in insect silk. It is initially a liquid, and hardens not by exposure to air {{but as a result}} of being drawn out, which changes the internal structure of the protein. It is similar in tensile strength to nylon and biological materials such as chitin, collagen and cellulose, but is much more elastic. In other words, it can stretch much further before breaking or losing shape.|$|E
5|$|The USAAF {{distance}} record did {{not last}} long: two months later, another American aircrew flew a B-29 from Guam to Washington, D.C. a distance of 7,916 miles (12,740km), breaking the world record. Nevertheless, the Japan to Washington flight pioneered a route <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> by later airliners. Importantly for the airmen, America was able to demonstrate the reach of airpower {{in light of the}} nascent Cold War.|$|E

5000|$|Many Chinese kue {{require the}} use of a Kue mould <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>use</b> in mooncakes, which is either carved out of wood or made of plastics. Kue moulds with turtles are ubiquitous, though moulds of peaches are usually quite common. Red {{coloured}} turtle kue are known especially as [...] "Ang ku kueh"/"Red Tortoise Cake" [...] (紅龜粿). Since many Chinese no longer make kue at home, these moulds have become less common in many kitchens.|$|R

5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Page {{moved to}} Hollywood to further {{employment}} in acting. He gained minor roles on soap operas, including General Hospital. He took coursework at the Art Center College of Design, and in 1989 for a class on product-design he created a machine apparatus <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> by the character portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in the film Aliens. He received his degree in industrial design from that institution with honors in 1990. Following his graduation, Page instructed students at the Switzerland location of the Art Center College of Design. Along with his studio partner Scott Robertson, he began {{work in the field}} of design consulting.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{horses are}} often used to reenact many of their {{historical}} work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> before {{the invention of the}} modern motorized truck.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra {{had a large}} agora. However, {{unlike the}} Greek Agoras (public {{gathering}} places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used {{in some of the}} tombs. Many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> in Ancient Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Some teams made {{technical}} {{changes to}} their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren introduced a revised aerodynamic for their MP4/15 chassis, aimed at {{increasing the amount}} of downforce, and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork. They also brought revised nose wings. BAR fitted their cars with one-off components that were produced to help optimise the performance of the monocoque's cooling systems. Ferrari introduced an aerodynamic set-up <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the team debuted {{a modified version of the}} F1-2000's chimneys. Minardi arrived with new radiator intakes and exits to rectify temperature issues with their Fondmetal V10 engines.|$|E
5|$|The missionaries {{introduced}} a musical form of chant into Britain, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> in Rome during the mass. During the 7th and 8th centuries Canterbury was renowned for the excellence of its clergy's chanting, and sent singing masters to instruct others, including two to Wilfrid, who became Bishop of York. Putta, the first Bishop of Rochester, {{had a reputation}} for his skill at chanting, which he was said to have learned from the Gregorian missionaries. One of them, James the Deacon, taught chanting in Northumbria after Paulinus returned to Kent; Bede noted that James was accomplished in the singing of the chants.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the {{southern}} regions of Perth to easier central business district access {{changed the nature of}} the metropolitan area, prompting dramatic population growth south of the river. This led to increased traffic on the bridge, causing regular traffic jams in peak hour. Over the years, governments suggested various ideas to reduce the traffic using the bridge, including introducing congestion pricing <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> in Singapore, charging vehicles to enter the central business district during peak periods. The government also encouraged voluntary car sharing. These efforts were largely unsuccessful, and by the 1990s, the bridge had become the city's worst traffic bottleneck, despite the addition of an extra traffic lane, bringing the total number of lanes to seven.|$|E

5|$|Wessel soon {{impressed}} Goebbels, and in January 1928, {{a period}} in which the Berlin city authorities had banned the SA in an effort to curb political street violence, Wessel was sent to Vienna to study the National Socialist Youth Group, as well as the organisational and tactical methods of the Nazi Party there. He returned to Berlin in July 1928 to recruit local youths, and was involved in helping to implement a reorganisation of the NSDAP in the city into a cell-structure <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> by the German Communist Party (KPD). Wessel did this despite SA rules forbidding its members from working for the party.|$|E
5|$|William Wallace, the king's {{master mason}} from 1617 {{until his death}} in 1631, was {{particularly}} influential. He worked on the rebuilding of the collapsed North Range of Linlithgow from 1618, Winton House for George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton and began work on Heriot's Hospital, Edinburgh. He adopted a distinctive style that applied elements of Scottish fortification and Flemish influences to a Renaissance plan <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> at Château d'Ancy-le-Franc. This style can be seen in lords' houses built at Caerlaverlock (1620), Moray House, Edinburgh (1628) and Drumlanrig Castle (1675–89), and was highly influential until the Baronial style gave way to the grander English forms associated with Inigo Jones in the later seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the castle}} meres can still be seen to the west {{of the castle}}, {{although}} in the 16th century there were two lakes, much larger than today, complete with a wharf. This dramatic use of water to reflect the image of the castle is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> at several other castles of the period, including Bredwardine and Ravensworth Castle. Water castles such as Framlingham made greater use of water than was necessary for defence and enhanced the appearance of the castle. The view from the Great Hall in the Inner Court would originally have included the gardens of the Lower Court, and these would have then been framed by the mere and the Great Park beyond. The area around the castle today remains a designed and managed landscape; although the Great Park is now covered by fields, the view still gives a sense of how the castle and landscape was meant to appear to its late medieval owners.|$|E
