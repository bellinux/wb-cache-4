5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid microphonism, {{particularly}} in the input stages of high-gain amplifiers, design engineers used to <b>shock-mount</b> the tube-socket assemblies in these stages by means of small rubber grommets placed in the screw holes, leaving them in a [...] "floating" [...] situation.|$|E
50|$|Pelican Products also {{manufactures}} customized rotationally molded cases {{built for}} specialized sensitive equipment protection. The cases {{can be modified}} with features including internal <b>shock-mount</b> systems, manual pressure relief valves, humidity indicators, custom foam and fabricated metal framing for electronics. Pelican Products also runs a series of Advanced Case Centers in California, Virginia, Massachusetts, Canada, France, United Kingdom and Australia that handle customization and design work for their cases.|$|E

50|$|Specifications for the Toughbook CF-31 {{include a}} <b>shock-mounted</b> hard drive, {{removable}} through locking reinforced port doors. It runs on either a Intel Core i3, Core i5 or Core i7 processor with 4-16 GB of DDR3 SDRAM.|$|R
50|$|One {{problem with}} radio masts {{is the danger}} of wind-induced oscillations. This is {{particularly}} a concern with steel tube construction. One can reduce this by building cylindrical <b>shock-mounts</b> into the construction. One finds such <b>shock-mounts,</b> which look like cylinders thicker than the mast, for example, at the radio masts of DHO38 in Saterland. There are also constructions, which consist of a free-standing tower (usually from reinforced concrete), onto which a guyed radio mast is installed. The best known such construction is the Gerbrandy Tower in Lopik (the Netherlands). Further towers of this building method can be found near Smilde (the Netherlands) and Fernsehturm, Waldenburg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany).|$|R
50|$|The gray metal chassis is <b>shock-mounted</b> at {{its four}} corners to reduce {{sensitivity}} to external shocks, {{and to reduce}} drive noise from residual imbalance when running fast. The soft shock mount grommets are just below the brass-colored screws at the four corners (the left one is obscured).|$|R
50|$|All Toughbook {{models have}} a {{magnesium}} alloy case, which provides durability without significant weight. Many current models have liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels {{designed specifically for}} visibility during daylight use. Other design elements include a <b>shock-mounted</b> hard drive and, on many models, a moisture and dust-resistant LCD, keyboard and touchpad.|$|R
50|$|The Toughbook CF-SX2 is a business-rugged laptop {{designed}} for mobile professionals. It has a drop-resistant magnesium alloy design and <b>shock-mounted</b> flex-connect hard drive, {{allowing it to}} handle up to a 30-inch drop {{to the base of}} the unit while operating, as well as a 12-inch drop from all other angles.|$|R
50|$|The base armour {{is formed}} by the Kanonenjagdpanzer chassis. It was made of welded steel and had a {{thickness}} of 10 to 50 mm steel. When the Kanonenjagdpanzers were upgraded, applique armour, consisting of perforated steel plates coated in a rubber-like substance, was fastened <b>shock-mounted</b> {{on the front of}} the vehicle and the side of the casemate structure. Leopard-like side-skirts were also added.|$|R
50|$|The 1967 model 172H was {{the last}} Continental O-300 powered model. It also {{introduced}} a shorter-stroke nose gear oleo to reduce drag and improve {{the appearance of the}} aircraft in flight. A new cowling was used, introducing <b>shock-mounts</b> that transmitted lower noise levels to the cockpit and reduced cowl cracking. The electric stall warning horn was replaced by a pneumatic one.|$|R
25|$|The Bedok {{class is}} made of {{glass-reinforced}} plastic, designed by the Swedish Navy and Kockums (then known as Karlskronavarvet). Its low magnetic and acoustic signatures reduces the possibility of setting off mines. It is highly durable, fire- and shock-resistant, easy to repair and is maintained only by painting. The ship's bridge, major combat equipment and engines are also <b>shock-mounted</b> to cushion against underwater explosions.|$|R
50|$|The Toughbook CF-19, in its 8th mark/generation, is a fully rugged {{device that}} {{can be used as a}} laptop or swiveled into a tablet. It is tested to {{withstand}} a six-foot drop and IP65 certified fanless design providing water and dust resistance. The device also features a <b>shock-mounted</b> hard drive, full magnesium alloy case and available explosive atmosphere certification (Class 1 Div 2) for hazardous environments.|$|R
50|$|The Toughbook CF-C2 is a semi-rugged {{convertible}} tablet. Its triple-hinge design {{allows it}} to be converted from a tablet to a laptop configuration. It has a magnesium alloy case and <b>shock-mounted</b> flex-connect hard drive allowing it to handle up to a 30-inch drop to six sides, {{as well as a}} 12-inch drop from 26 angles. The computer also features a spill-resistant keyboard (up 6 ounces).|$|R

50|$|March of 1940 saw the {{introduction}} of another version of the Model 8, the 8B. This aircraft was powered by a Lycoming O-145-B3 engine of 65 horsepower (48 kW). A month later, the company developed the deluxe model 8C, powered by a Continental C-75-8J engine. The interior was finished off with maroon cloth and tan leather upholstery, with a <b>shock-mounted</b> section in the instrument panel. The deluxe model was named the Silvaire, (in a contest) and was sold with full-color advertising.|$|R
40|$|Work on an {{innovative}} design for miniature rubidium frequency standards {{has reached the}} pre-production demonstration stage at Litton Guidance and Control Systems. Pre-production units were built and tested under contract to the Rome Air Development Center of the U. S. Air Force Systems Command. The units, which are designed for use in tactical military applications, feature fast warm-up, low power consumption, and vibration insensitivity. The output stability under vibration is maintained {{without the need for}} external <b>shock-mounts.</b> The design objectives and test results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{pervasive}} {{shock response}} spectrum (SRS) and damage boundary methods for evaluating product fragility and designing external cushioning for shock protection are described in detail with references to the best available literature. Underlying assumptions are carefully reviewed and the central message of the SRS is highlighted, particularly {{as it relates to}} standardized drop testing. Shortcomings of these methods are discussed, and the results are extended to apply to more general systems. Finally some general packaging and <b>shock-mounting</b> strategies are discussed in the context of protecting a fragile disk drive in a notebook computer, although the conclusions apply to other products as well. For example, exterior only cushioning (with low restitution to reduce subsequent impacts) will provide a slenderer form factor than the next best strategy: interior cushioning with a “dead” hard outer shell...|$|R
2500|$|However, {{there is}} at least one {{practical}} application that exploits those weaknesses: the use of a medium-size woofer placed closely in front of a [...] "kick drum" [...] (bass drum) in a drum set to act as a microphone. [...] A commercial product example is the Yamaha Subkick, a [...] woofer <b>shock-mounted</b> into a 10" [...] drum shell used in front of kick drums. Since a relatively massive membrane is unable to transduce high frequencies while being capable of tolerating strong low-frequency transients, the speaker is often ideal for picking up the kick drum while reducing bleed from the nearby cymbals and snare drums. Less commonly, microphones themselves can be used as speakers, but due to their low power handling and small transducer sizes, a tweeter is the most practical application. One instance of such an application was the STC microphone-derived 4001 super-tweeter, which was successfully used in a number of high quality loudspeaker systems from the late 1960s to the mid-70s.|$|R
