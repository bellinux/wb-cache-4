50|$|Epoxy resins and hardeners are universally used in boat {{building}} due {{to their}} superior holding power and ease of use. In its thickened state it {{is used as a}} strong filler and for a range of joints that do away with more traditional fastenings. A large supply of cheap wooden tongue depressors is useful for mixing and applying epoxy resin. The curved ends are useful for shaping coved joints with epoxy. <b>Silicon</b> <b>bronze</b> ring nails are excellent for permanent fastening of wood and ply as they are strong and easily driven. Many small boats are almost entirely fastened by epoxy resin. In stitch and glue construction the hull panels are temporarily held together with either copper wire, nylon fishing line or plastic cable ties, until the epoxy cures, after which the stitching material is removed. Polyester filler is a quick setting (20mts), softer filler, suited to very small holes and scratches and is far more easily sanded to a fair shape than harder, stronger epoxy filler which takes 24 hours to set hard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Silicon</b> <b>bronze</b> screws are {{normally}} used in boat building {{but can be}} hard to locate. Brass fasteners are commonly available but apart from being softer and weaker the common brass alloys are much more prone to corrosion through depletion of their zinc content. Stainless steel screws may be used for attaching fittings to the hull above the water line. Type 316 stainless steel is the only stainless steel recommended. Even 316 may get stained with surface rust but this does not penetrate the surface. Staining comes from being in contact with other steels such as the anchor or incorrect cleaning in the factory. Staining near wields should be removed as it can pit. Experienced boat builders are reluctant to use even 316 below the water line in a boat permanently in salt water. This especially applied to long thin fastenings such as screws in boats that have motors. Sacrificial anodes are used to help prevent corrosion underwater but experts will inspect a sample of long thin screws or bolts annually to check for corrosion.|$|E

40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is an {{important}} re-emerging pathogen which is commonly found in the environment. Many outbreaks {{have been associated with}} the contamination of food produce, often linked to cross-contamination from surfaces or equipment to prepared foodstuffs. In the present study a number of copper-base metal alloys have been used to assess the survival times of L. monocytogenes on different materials, in comparison with stainless steel. High concentrations (107) of bacteria were placed on metal coupons cut from each alloy. After defined incubation times, coupons were placed in tubes containing phosphate buffered saline and vortexed to remove the cells. Aliquots were then plated onto tryptone blood agar plates and the number of colony forming units counted. The high concentration of bacteria was used to represent a “worst-case” scenario. The results indicate that survival is greatly reduced on a copper-base alloy compared to stainless steel. Viable cells could be detected on stainless steel after 24 h incubation at room temperature. On copper, brass, aluminium bronze and <b>silicon</b> <b>bronze,</b> no viable bacteria could be detected after 60 min incubation, indicating a 5 log reduction (the detection limit of the procedure was 100 bacteria). No cells could be detected from copper nickel and copper nickel zinc alloys, after 90 min incubation. The viability stain, 5 -cyano- 2, 3 -ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC), confirmed these results, with actively respiring bacteria being clearly labelled on stainless steel after 24 h. The results suggest that careful choice of surface material could reduce the potential risk of cross-contamination in industrial, commercial and domestic environments. <br/...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The main aim of {{the work}} is to {{investigate}} the effect of deformation sequence of low cyclic torsion, monotonic torsion and monotonic tension on the flow stress and structure. This knowledge can create possibility to elaborating and applying more energy and material saving technologies where final products have determined shape and properties. Design/methodology/approach: Simultaneous deformation by cyclic torsion and tension was conducted in plastometer for complex strain paths. For micro structural observation, the optical, scanning and transition microscopes were used. Findings: Obtained results shown that by change of direction of displacement velocity vector for about 90 ° it is possible to increase or decrease of the flow stress. Without such changes of this vector the dislocation structure is not enough disturbed and strain localization in shear bands is absent, so there is no softening of materials caused by increase of free distance of dislocation movement. Research limitations/implications: The further investigations should be done especially at high temperature because at high temperature the investigated <b>silicon</b> <b>bronze</b> has large strain rate sensitivity that make difficulties to transform torque on the shear stress moreover the precise stabilization of temperature at high temperature is difficult. Practical implications: On the base of performed investigation it can be stated that great progress in metal forming processes and new technologies, more effective {{from the point of view}} of energy and material consumption could be elaborated. Originality/value: The effect of strain path in case of sheet metals forming processes has been investigated for a long time. In case of massive processes the effect of strain path on the plastic properties and structure of materials is less known because an investigations are more difficult and complex...|$|E
40|$|Grain {{refinement}} {{behavior of}} copper alloys cast in permanent molds was investigated. This {{is one of the}} least studied subjects in copper alloy castings. Grain refinement is not widely practiced for leaded copper alloys cast in sand molds. Aluminum bronzes and high strength yellow brasses, cast in sand and permanent molds, were usually fine grained due to the presence of more than 2 % iron. Grain refinement of the most common permanent mold casting alloys, leaded yellow brass and its lead-free replacement EnviroBrass III, is not universally accepted due to the perceived problem of hard spots in finished castings and for the same reason these alloys contain very low amounts of iron. The yellow brasses and Cu-Si alloys are gaining popularity in North America due to their low lead content and amenability for permanent mold casting. These alloys are prone to hot tearing in permanent mold casting. Grain refinement is one of the solutions for reducing this problem. However, to use this technique it is necessary to understand the mechanism of grain refinement and other issues involved in the process. The following issues were studied during this three year project funded by the US Department of Energy and the copper casting industry: (1) Effect of alloying additions on the grain size of Cu-Zn alloys and their interaction with grain refiners; (2) Effect of two grain refining elements, boron and zirconium, on the grain size of four copper alloys, yellow brass, EnviroBrass II, silicon brass and <b>silicon</b> <b>bronze</b> and the duration of their effect (fading); (3) Prediction of grain refinement using cooling curve analysis and use of this method as an on-line quality control tool; (4) Hard spot formation in yellow brass and EnviroBrass due to grain refinement; (5) Corrosion resistance of the grain refined alloys; (6) Transfer the technology to permanent mold casting foundries; It was found that alloying elements such as tin and zinc do not change the grain size of Cu-Zn alloys. Aluminum promoted b phase formation and modified the grain structure from dendritic to equiaxed. Lead or bismuth reduces the size of grains, but not change the morphology of the structure in Cu-Zn alloys. The grain size of the Cu-Zn-alloy can be reduced from 3000 mm to 300 mm after the addition of aluminum and lead. Similar effects were observed in EnviroBrass III after the addition of aluminum and bismuth. Boron refined the structure of yellow brasses in the presence of iron. At least 50 ppm of iron and 3 ppm of boron are necessary to cause grain refinement in these alloys. Precipitation of iron from the melt is identified as the cause of grain refinement. Boron initiates the precipitation of iron which could not be explained at this time. On the other hand zirconium causes some reduction in grain size in all four alloys investigated. The critical limit for the zirconium was found to be around 100 ppm below which not much refinement could be observed. The mechanism of grain refinement in the presence of zirconium could not be explained. Grain refinement by boron and iron can remain {{over a long period of}} time, at least for 72 hours of holding or after remelting few times. It is necessary to have the iron and boron contents above the critical limits mentioned earlier. On the other hand, refinement by zirconium is lost quite rapidly, some times within one hour of holding, mostly due to the loss of zirconium, most probably by oxidation, from the melt. In all the cases it is possible to revive the refinement by adding more of the appropriate refining element. Cooling curve analysis (thermal analysis) can be used successfully to predict the grain refinement in yellow brasses. The precipitation of iron in the liquid metal causes the metal to solidify without undercooling. Absence of this reaction, as indicated by the time-temperature (t-T) and its first derivative (dt/dT) curves, proved to be an indicator of refinement. The viability of the technique as an on-line quality control tool was proved in two foundries. The method can also correctly predict the onset of fading. The corrosion resistance of the grain refined alloys was measured in two solutions having different hydrogen activities, pH 6 and pH 8, and compared with the base alloys. Potentiodynamic polarization and long term weight loss experiments were conducted to evaluate the corrosion resistance. Cu-Zn alloys were evaluated for dezincification. In general, the grain refined alloys performed marginally better than the base alloys...|$|E
