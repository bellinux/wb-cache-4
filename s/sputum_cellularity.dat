40|$|Sputum {{induction}} {{can be used}} as a {{non-invasive technique}} to investigate airway inflammation in asthma and COPD. We reported the case of a 68 year old man with COPD, stage III GOLD, that underwent sputum induction during two exacerbation episodes. The first cell count showed a typical sputum neutrophilia, whereas the second showed sputum eosinophilia. On the basis of <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity,</b> we decided to treat the first episode with a course of antibiotics and the second exacerbation with a course of antibiotics and oral steroids. The patient showed improvement in both cases, obtaining clinical stabilisation. The induced sputum cell count could be a useful technique in a clinical setting to evaluate the cellular characteristics of airway inflammation during COPD exacerbation and modulate the antinflammatory therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background. Induced sputum in {{children}} with bronchial asthma represents a non-invasive method of bronchial inflammation assessment. The main objective of our study was to analyze the cellularity of sputum in patients with bronchial asthma according {{to the level of}} disease control and the controlling therapy (with/without inhaled glucocorticoids). The second objective was to establish the correlation between <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity</b> and other indirect parameters used to evidence bronchial inflammation (exhaled nitric oxide) and obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 second). Methods. The study included children with bronchial asthma that were assessed clinically (physical exam, questionnaire on the control of bronchial asthma {{in children}}) and by medical tests (induced sputum, exhaled nitric oxide, spirometry). Results. In patients with partially controlled asthma and those with uncontrolled asthma, the eosinophils percentage in the sputum was higher than in patients with controlled asthma (19. 8 ± 26. 4 % respectively 9. 2 ± 20. 5 % versus 4. 5 ± 14. 6 %, p< 0. 001) ...|$|E
40|$|AUTHORS’ REPLY We {{would like}} to thank Drs Labiris and Hargreave for their {{interesting}} comments on our article. They have emphasised the variability in the data {{and the fact that the}} p values for neutrophils and macrophages were near significance. Moreover, they have provided the results of a power analysis for paired continuous data showing that the study is underpowered to reach solid conclusions. We agree that their comments are valid both for the variability of the data and that the p value was near significance for neutrophils and macrophages. However, the p value for eosinophils was far from the significance level (p = 0. 49). This is important because the aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of methacholine challenge on overall <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity</b> but, in particular, on eosinophils which are considered the most relevant inflammatory cell in bronchial asthma. We are confident that a methacholine inhalation challenge carried out one hour before sputum induction in asthmatic subjects does not alter the eosinophil count in induced sputum, and that this result is important for both clinical practice and clinical trials involving patients with asthma...|$|E

However, {{there is little}} known in COPD about the detailed interrelationships between lung function and inflammatory profiles in different airway compartments from the same individual and whether airway inflammation in these different compartments differs in ex- and current smokers with established COPD. Objectives: We compared sputum, bronchoalveolar (BAL), and airway wall inflammatory profiles in current versus ex-smokers and related this to smoking intensity and lung function in 17 current and 17 ex-smokers with mild to moderate COPD. Results: Current smokers had more sputum mast cells (% differential and absolute numbers), whereas ex-smokers had increased sputum neutrophils. In BAL, there was a significant increase in eosinophils in current smokers, but ex-smokers had significantly increased neutrophils, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells. There were no cell profile differences observed in airway biopsies between current and ex-smokers and there were no correlations between the individual inflammatory cell populations in any of the airway compartments. In current smokers only, smoking intensity was negatively correlated with lung function, and associated with a reduction in overall <b>cellularity</b> of both <b>sputum</b> and BAL. Conclusion: Airway inflammation persists in ex-smokers with COPD, but differs from COPD current smokers. The impact of smoking appears to vary in different airway compartments and any direct relationships between cellularity and lung function tended to be negative, ie, worse lung function indicated the presence of fewer cells.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{the last}} decade, {{the method of}} sputum {{induction}} (SI) has offered the opportunity to study inflammation in patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). This paper reviews methodological aspects of SI and summarizes its uses in the research of inflammation in COPD, including <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity</b> and soluble markers. SI is a relatively safe, reliable, and reproducible technique, used to investigate different aspects of airway inflammation. Although various methods of induction and processing have been proved safe and highly reproducible, a generally accepted method is needed. Sputum analysis has given evidence for increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in COPD patients compared to normal subjects. In some studies, increased numbers of eosinophils have been also reported. Changes in various mediators have been found in sputum supernatant of COPD patients (IL- 8, LTB- 4 and TNF-a). The clinical usefulness of the method in the follow-up of the disease has not been explored extensively. A number of observations in patients with different clinical characteristics could be proven useful in identifying patterns of inflammation associated with different prognosis. Finally, SI could also guide treatment; such as, sputum eosinophilia in COPD could predict response to inhaled corticosteroids...|$|E

40|$|The {{level of}} {{fractional}} exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) is significantly elevated in uncontrolled asthma and decreases after anti-inflammatory therapy {{the aim of}} this prospective study was to analyze the behavior of FENO in the follow-up and management of the inflammation in asthmatic pediatric patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), compared to <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity,</b> serum interleukins (IL), and pulmonary function. Twenty-six clinically stable asthmatic children aged from 6 to 18 years, previously treated or not with ICS were included. Following an international consensus (GINA), the patients were submitted to standard treatment with inhaled fluticasone for 3 months according to the severity of the disease. During this period, each patient underwent three assessments at intervals of approximately 6 weeks: Each evaluation consisted of the measurement of FENO, determination of serum interleukins IL- 5, IL- 10, IL- 13, and interferon gamma (INF-gamma), spirometry and cytological analysis of spontaneous or induced sputum. A significant reduction in mean FENO and IL- 5, without concomitant changes in FEV 1, was observed along the study. There was no significant correlation between FeNO and FEV 1 in the three assessments. A significant correlation between FeNO and IL- 5 levels was only observed in the third assessment (r = 0. 499, P= 0. 025). in most patients, serum IL- 10, IL- 13, and INF-gamma concentrations were undetectable throughout the study Sputum samples were obtained spontaneously in 11 occasions and in 56 by induction with 3 % hypertonic saline solution (success rate: 50. 8 %), with 39 (69. 9 %) of them adequate for analysis. Only two of the 26 patients produced adequate samples in the three consecutive evaluations, which impaired the determination of a potential association between <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity</b> and FeNO levels throughout the study. in conclusion, among the parameters of this study, it was difficult to perform and to interpret the serial analysis of spontaneous or induced sputum. Serum interleukins, which remained at very low or undetectable levels in most patients, were not found to be useful for therapeutic monitoring, except for IL- 5 that seems to present some correlation with levels of FeNO exhaled. Monitoring of the mean FEV 1 indicated no significant variations during the treatment, demonstrating that functional stability or the absence of obstruction may not reflect the adequate management of asthma. Serial measurement of FeNO seemed to best reflect the progressive anti-inflammatory action of ICS in asthma.

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{is designed to}} evaluate a number of biological markers to estimate harmful exposure on coal miners from different mining regions in France and to relate the outcome to differences in prevalence of coal worker pneumoconiosis (CWP) between these regions. Eight epidemiological groups of active and ex-miners (smokers and non-smokers) have been selected in the French collieries (North, Lorraine and Provence) according to their occupational and pneumoconiotic status. The following biomarkers have been evaluated: cellularity of sputum, elementary analysis of particles in TEM/EDAX, plasma neutral metalloendopeptidase elastase type (NMEP), leucocyte elastase (HLE), fibronectin (FN) and elastin peptides. Pulmonary alveolitis, expressed by <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity,</b> is different between active workers groups but {{not related to the}} general background of pneumoconiosis prevalence in the French collieries. In the plasma parameters, fibronectin, HLE and NMEP significantly increased in all groups of coal mine workers as compared to the control group, except for fibronectin parameter in Lorraine collierie. The degree of increase of these parameters allow us to discriminate the different groups and suggest that plasma FN, HLE and NMEP may be considered as biological markers of chronic inhalation of coal mine dust particles. The decrease of elastin peptides level in the Lorraine group alone suggests a specific alteration of elastin metabolism. These parameters were not related to the development of pneumoconiosis and its degree of severity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prior {{research}} has shown that removing occupational asthmatics from exposure does not routinely lead to significant improvements in respiratory impairment. These studies were of limited duration and factors determining recovery remain obscure. Our objective was to evaluate residual respiratory impairment and associated sputum and blood biomarkers in subjects with Western red cedar asthma after exposure cessation. Methods: Subjects previously diagnosed with cedar asthma, and removed from exposure to cedar dust for at least one year, were recruited. Subjects completed a questionnaire and spirometry. PC 20 (methacholine concentration that produces 20 % fall in FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume at 1 second)) <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity</b> and select Th 1 /Th 2 (T helper cells 1 and 2) cytokine concentrations in peripheral blood were determined. The asthma impairment class was determined and multivariate analyses were performed to determine its relationship with sputum cell counts and serum cytokines. Results: 40 non-smoking males (mean age 62) were examined at a mean interval of 25 years from cedar asthma diagnosis and 17 years from last cedar exposure. 40 % were in impairment class 2 / 3. On average, the PC 20 had increased by 2. 0 mg/ml; the FEV 1 decreased by 1. 5 L, with greater decrease in those with greater impairment. Higher impairment was associated with serum interferon-gamma (mean = 1. 3 pg/ml in class 2 / 3 versus 0. 62 pg/ml in class 0 / 1, p = 0. 04), mainly due to the FEV 1 component (correlation with interferon-gamma= 20. 46, p = 0. 005) ...|$|E
40|$|Background Asbestosis is {{associated}} with lung cellular and immunological abnormalities. Induced sputum cytology and local and systemic markers of inflammation {{may be helpful to}} characterize disease status and progression in these patients. Methods Thirty-nine ex-workers with asbestosis on high-resolution CT (HRCT) and 21 non-exposed controls were evaluated. Sputum cytology and IL- 8 in serum and sputum were related to lung function impairment. Results Subjects with asbestosis had reduced <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity</b> but higher macrophagel neutrophil ratio and % macrophage as compared with controls. Sputum and serum IL- 8 were also higher in patients with asbestosis (P < 0. 05). in addition, evidence of lung architectural distorption on HRCT was associated with increased levels of serum IL- 8. Interestingly, absolute macrophage number was negatively correlated with total lung capacity (r = - 0. 40; P = 0. 04) and serum IL- 8 to lung diffiusing capacity (r = - 0. 45; P = 0. 01). Conclusions Occupationally exposed subjects with asbestosis on HRCT have cytologic abnormalities in induced sputum and increased local and systemic pro-inflammatory status which are correlated to functional impairment.

40|$|Background: Although asthma is {{characterized}} by variable airways obstruction, most studies of asthma phenotypes are cross-sectional. The stability of phenotypes defined either by biomarkers or by physiological variables was assessed by repeated measures over 1 year in the Pan-European BIOAIR cohort of adult asthmatics. Methods: A total of 169 patients, 93 with severe asthma (SA) and 76 with mild-to-moderate asthma (MA), were examined at six or more visits during 1 year. Asthma phenotype clusters were defined by physiological variables (lung function, reversibility and age of onset of the disease) or by biomarkers (eosinophils and neutrophils in induced sputum). Results: After 1 year of follow-up, the allocation to clusters was changed in 23. 6 % of all asthma patients when defined by physiological phenotypes and, remarkably, in 42. 3 % of the patients when stratified according to <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity</b> (P = 0. 034). In the SA cohort, 30 % and 48. 6 % of the patients changed allocation according to physiological and biomarker clustering, respectively. Variability of phenotypes was not influenced by change in oral or inhaled corticosteroid dose, nor {{by the number of}} exacerbations. Lower stability of single and repeated measure was found for all evaluated biomarkers (eosinophils, neutrophils and FeNO) in contrast to good stability of physiological variables (FEV 1), quality of life and asthma control. Conclusion: Phenotypes determined by biomarkers are less stable than those defined by physiological variables, especially in severe asthmatics. The data also imply that definition of asthma phenotypes is improved by repeated measures to account for fluctuations in lung function, biomarkers and asthma control...|$|E
40|$|SummaryRationaleThe {{development}} of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) in smokers and their susceptibility to infections {{is not fully}} understood. Recent evidences suggest that Clara cells play a part in host defense, immunomodulatory response and airways remodelling through the production of specific factors such as Clara cell 16 (CC- 16). This protein has never been related to patients’ lung function tests, blood gases parameters and diseases severity. ObjectivesTo evaluate a possible correlation between CC- 16 expression in sputum, measured by a new methodological approach, and the degree of severity in patients with moderate and severe COPD. We also analyzed possible correlations between CC- 16 and cytological sputum population, arterial blood gases and lung function. Main FindingsWe analyzed 20 patients, mean age 72. 95, classified {{on the basis of the}} global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease guidelines (GOLD 2006). The samples were processed for cytological analysis and CC- 16 levels were assessed by Western blot. We found lower levels of CC- 16 in severe COPD compared to moderate ones (p< 0. 027). No statistically significant differences were found between CC- 16 expression and <b>sputum</b> <b>cellularity</b> (except for macrophages), arterial blood gases, and spirometric parameters. Multiple linear regression analysis of CC- 16 versus functional and cytological parameters showed no significance. ConclusionsWe found a significantly different expression of CC- 16 in COPD patients, according to their stage of severity, as defined by the GOLD 2006 guidelines. Considering CC- 16 properties in innate immunity, a possible link between protein expression, innate immune system, and COPD infectious exacerbations may be hypothesized but further investigation are needed...|$|E
