The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding. No known damage {{was caused by}} the flood.|$|E
5|$|When a male detects a female, it chases {{the female}} and begins courtship. Females are larger and slower than males, and many males will escort and intertwine around a single female.

5|$|Along its path, Japhet dropped heavy {{rainfall}} that caused widespread river flooding. The rains occurred after an extended drought, although excessive precipitation caused heavy crop damage, notably around where the storm moved ashore. In two provinces in Mozambique, the cyclone {{damaged or destroyed}} 25,000houses, leaving at least 23,000people homeless. Flooding in Zambia caused rivers to rise in Mozambique <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the storm's passage. There were 17deaths in Mozambique. Further inland, remnant rainfall destroyed a bridge and several houses in Zimbabwe, killing eight people.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{provides}} a dubious account of Darius's ascension: <b>Several</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> Gaumata had been assassinated, Darius {{and the other}} six nobles discussed {{the fate of the}} empire. At first, the seven discussed the form of government; a democratic republic was strongly pushed by Otanes, an oligarchy was pushed by Megabyzus, while Darius pushed for a monarchy. After stating that a republic would lead to corruption and internal fighting, while a monarchy would be led with a single-mindedness not possible in other governments, Darius was able to convince the other nobles.|$|E

The system tracked nearly due north, attaining maximum winds of 50mph (85km/h), nearing the coastline of Mexico several times. However, the storm did not make landfall during its existence.

5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, a woman is advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} to other contemporary space films, Gravity, facing far less competition, opened to a better-than-expected $55.8 million in 2013. In November 2014, Interstellar debuted to $47.5 million. Unlike Gravity and Interstellar, {{which had the}} benefit of IMAX locations, boosting profits, The Martian was not initially playing in IMAX, since IMAX was committed to an exclusive run of Robert Zemeckis' The Walk. The Martian played in more than 350 premium large-format theaters including 2,550 3D locations. Also, the film was released <b>several</b> <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the announcement of NASA's discovery of water on Mars' planetary surface, which might have aided in boosting its opening. Ticket selling website Fandango reported that the film was outselling Gravity. Unlike Gravity, The Martian did not contain abundant 3D spectacle (even though it was filmed in 3D), and was longer than Gravity.|$|E
