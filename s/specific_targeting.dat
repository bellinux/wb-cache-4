5|$|The bombardments {{failed to}} cause {{significant}} physical damage, {{but had a}} major psychological impact on the residents of Sydney and Newcastle. Due to the inaccuracy of the submarines' range-finding equipment, coupled with the unstable firing platform of a submarine at sea, <b>specific</b> <b>targeting</b> was impossible.

25|$|Immunotherapy {{developed}} in the 1970s following {{the discovery of the}} structure of antibodies and the development of hybridoma technology, which provided the first reliable source of monoclonal antibodies. These advances allowed for the <b>specific</b> <b>targeting</b> of tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Initial research on malignant neoplasms found mAb therapy of limited and generally short-lived success with blood malignancies. Treatment also had to be tailored to each individual patient, which was impracticable in routine clinical settings.|$|E

40|$|A heat-labile cytotoxin was {{released}} into the culture medium during the first 2 hours of interaction between alloimmune mouse macrophages and <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> cells. This cytotoxin has been designated specific macrophage cytotoxin (SMC). The observation that SMC is only released when immune macrophages interact with <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> cells suggests that specificity depends on transplantation antigens. Target cell killing begins about 2 hours after exposure to SMC. Trypsin treatment of immune macrophages, which abolishes their capacity to adhere to and destroy monolayers of <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> cells, decreases the amount of SMC {{released into the}} culture medium...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{method that}} has been studied is {{manipulating}} the hTERT promoter to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Plasmid DNA sequences can be manufactured using the hTERT promoter followed by genes encoding for specific proteins. The protein can be a toxin, an apoptotic factor, or a viral protein. Toxins such as diphtheria toxin interfere with cellular processes and eventually induce apoptosis. [...] Apoptotic death factors like FADD (Fas-Associated protein with Death Domain) {{can be used to}} force cells expressing hTERT to undergo apoptosis. Viral proteins like viral thymidine kinase can be used for <b>specific</b> <b>targeting</b> of a drug. By introducing a prodrug only activated by the viral enzyme, <b>specific</b> <b>targeting</b> of cells expressing hTERT can be achieved. [...] By using the hTERT promoter, only cells expressing hTERT will be affected and allows for <b>specific</b> <b>targeting</b> of tumor cells.|$|E

40|$|Lifestyle {{factors and}} {{determinants}} of behaviour in <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> groupsomic groups are important target groups for health promotion. Those in low socio-economic groups have, comparatively speaking, the most unfavourable profile {{when it comes}} to lifestyle. In health policy documents, the need for focusing on <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> groups, in particular, migrants and low socio-economic groups, is emphasised. There is, however, a gap between proposed actions in health policy and actual local practice, where interventions take place. Important reasons for there being insufficient attention paid to <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> groups are the lack of political support for health promotion at the local level, and insufficient funds and professional capacity. In the near future, to cut across the unfavourable trends in risk behaviour in several <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> groups, changes in health promotion policy and practice are needed. Health Promotion can react to these unfavourabl trends, offering tailor-made services to <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> groups. In cooperation with the different parties involved, authorities should be able to create an environment where people are capable of making healthy choices and empowered to take their own responsibility in healthy and happy living...|$|R
30|$|Overall, in Experiment 3, {{observers}} missed 4 % of the <b>specific</b> <b>targets</b> and 35 % of the categorical targets (t(11) = 8.9, p < 0.0001). Thus, Experiment 3 replicates {{the basic}} finding {{of the preceding}} experiments in this series. Categorical targets are missed {{at a much higher}} rate than <b>specific</b> <b>targets.</b> Indeed, the results are not dramatically different from those of Experiment 1 or 2, suggesting that the dependence or independence of categorical and <b>specific</b> <b>targets</b> is not a major driving force in these results. Experiment 3 does not find strong evidence for satisfaction of search (or SSM) effects in which the discovery of a <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> would have made discovery of a categorical target less likely. On trials where both <b>specific</b> and categorical <b>targets</b> are present, the rate at which categorical targets are missed is predicted by the rate at which those same targets would have been missed {{in the absence of a}} <b>specific</b> <b>target.</b> The one interaction between targets in this experiment seems to be a facilitation (effect) when both targets are categorical. The second categorical target is not missed quite as often as would be predicted.|$|R
