Part way it led through spiked, crested, upheaved lava that would have been almost impassable even without its <b>silver</b> <b>coating</b> of choya cactus. There were benches and ledges and ridges bare and glistening in the sun. From the crests of these Yaqui's searching falcon gaze roved near and far for signs of sheep, and Gale used his glass on the reaches of lava that slanted steeply upward to the {{corrugated}} peaks, and down over endless heave and roll and red-waved slopes. The heat smoked up from the lava, and this, with the red color and the shiny choyas, gave the impression of a world of smoldering fire.|$|E

Background: Catheter-related infections (CRI), thrombosis, and stenosis {{are among the most}} frequent complications associated with catheters which are inserted in vessels as vascular access. These problems are usually related to the handling of the staff, the catheter materials, and the surface properties of the catheter. To mitigate such complications surface treatment process of the outer surface, such as ion beam assisted deposition is investigated in a retrospective study from 1992 to 2007, to prove if the surface treatment of the catheters is a sufficient solution. Methods: This study (1992 - 2007) evaluated <b>silver</b> <b>coated</b> and non-coated implanted large-bore catheters used for extracorporeal detoxifica-tion. In 159 patients, 54 patients received a <b>silver</b> <b>coated</b> catheter (Spi-Argent, Spire Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA) and 105 patients, an untreated catheter served as controls. The catheters were inserted into the internal jugular or sub-clavian veins. After removal, the catheters were cultured for bacterial colonization using standard microbiologic assays. They were also examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results: The <b>silver</b> <b>coated</b> catheters showed a tendency towards longer in situ time. The microbiologic examinations of the catheter tips were in both catheter types high positive, but not significant. Conclusion: The <b>silver</b> <b>coated</b> catheters showed no significant reduction in infectio...|$|R

40|$|Prosthetic graft {{infection}} or {{the need for}} reconstructive arterial surgery in septic condition is a challenging situation in vascular surgery. Recent introduction of <b>silver</b> <b>coated</b> polyester graft has meant a new therapeutic option in selecting the type of graft for revascularization. In this study we analyzed the short and midterm outcome of using <b>silver</b> <b>coated</b> grafts in aortic and lower extremity arterial reconstructions (mortality, graft occlusion, graft infection, amputation). In a single center retrospective study we implanted 42 <b>silver</b> <b>coated</b> Dacron grafts (InterGard Silver Dacron prosthesis). The indication of silver graft implantation was graft infection in 17, aorto-duodenal fistula in 7, septic condition caused by gangrene in 16 cases and in 2 cases infection was not established. Forty silver grafts were implanted in 40 patients with diagnosed infection. The mean age was 62 years (35 - 81 years), 70 % were men. Long term follow-up data were available in 29 patients; the mean follow-up time was 36. 76 months. Early (within 30 days of surgery) death occurred in 3 and late death in 11 cases (8 and 38 %). Early graft occlusion was noticed in 8 and late occlusion in 2 cases (20 and 7 %). Reinfection was diagnosed in 7 % of the cases in the early and the midterm period as well. Eight amputations were indicated in the early postoperative period (5 major and 3 minor) and 28 % of the patients required major amputation during the follow-up. <b>Silver</b> <b>coated</b> Dacron graft means a valuable therapeutic option with good rate of infection control {{in the treatment of}} graft infection and septic condition in the lack of autologous graft material in this high risk population...|$|R
