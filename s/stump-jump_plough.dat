25|$|The <b>stump-jump</b> <b>plough</b> was an Australian {{invention}} of the 1870s, designed {{to cope with the}} breaking up of new farming land, that contains many tree stumps and rocks that would be very expensive to remove. The plough uses a moveable weight to hold the ploughshare in position. When a tree stump or other obstruction such as a rock is encountered, the ploughshare is thrown upwards, clear of the obstacle, to avoid breaking the plough's harness or linkage; ploughing can be continued when the weight is returned to the earth after the obstacle is passed.|$|E

50|$|Jonny {{was a very}} {{religious}} man who belonged to the Lutheran congregation in Balaklava. It is {{said that he was}} one of the first to develop the <b>stump-jump</b> <b>plough</b> (a labour saving device to remove mallee tree stumps), for which he was awarded a medal for exhibiting it at the Port Wakefield Agricultural and Horticultural Society in 1885. Others, like Smith from Maitland, South Australia patented the invention. The <b>stump-jump</b> <b>plough</b> is now regarded as one of the most significant inventions that changed the face of the Australian countryside as it permitted land to be cleared at an unparalleled rate.|$|E
5000|$|John {{served his}} {{apprenticeship}} with J. G. Ramsay, a farming implement merchant and manufacturer of Mount Barker and in 1876 {{set up a}} workshop and smithy in Mannum, where David joined him in 1877, repairing farm equipment and paddle-steamers. Between 1877 and 1904 they designed and manufactured agricultural equipment. In 1888 they started manufacture of a wrought ploughshare using a resilient grade of steel developed for him by Meadow's company in England. A similar steel, [...] "Resiflex" [...] was produced by BHP Steel in the 1920s. He invented a <b>stump-jumping</b> <b>plough</b> which he manufactured from 1884.The company John Shearer and Sons was registered in 1923.|$|R

50|$|Under R.B. Smith's direction, {{his brother}} Clarence Herbert Smith {{created the first}} <b>stump-jump</b> <b>plough,</b> {{entitled}} the Vixen, in 1876. The South Australian government had offered a reward of £200 to anyone who could develop an effective mechanical stump puller due to frustration with lack of productivity efficiency on its farms with current equipment.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1800s, {{and into the}} early 20th century, the town {{expanded}} steadily due to income from the surrounding farms. As well, it became notable as the location of Clarence Smith's factory where he manufactured the <b>Stump-jump</b> <b>plough</b> between 1880 and 1935. This South Australian invention was vital in opening mallee country throughout Australia to the plough.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{settlers}} soon {{made their}} {{mark on the}} history of the region. In 1843, John Ridley revolutionised the agricultural industry with the first [...] "stripper machine". In the 1860s, a local farmer named Charles Mullen created a method of ploughing which was known as [...] "Mullenising". Mullen invented an implement, used throughout Australia, which was the precursor of the <b>stump-jump</b> <b>plough.</b> During 1866-1877, pioneer farmer Richard Marshall succeeded in solving the [...] "red rust" [...] problem in wheat by crossbreeding various wheat varieties and improved soil conditions using bone meal on the land. After good crop returns, a student at Roseworthy College named Charles Deland, led a campaign in favour of fertilizer.|$|E
5000|$|He {{rented a}} blacksmith's shop from John Calton and began {{building}} bullock drays. He built a lathe, press and workbenches from local timber. With hard work, attention to detail, and by accepting any job, business grew. He {{started working on}} a farm of his own, [...] "Trevue", where he developed implements that were manufactured by his [...] "Phoenix Foundry" [...] (founded around 1859). Martin & Co. became a major employer in the town. He took on Thomas Flett Loutit (ca.1832 - 20 September 1873) as a partner. It has been claimed that the first <b>stump-jump</b> <b>plough</b> was made by Martin & Co. Their machinery was successfully exhibited at the various Agricultural Shows. They manufactured iron from local ore, but the experiment was not a resounding success.|$|E
40|$|When {{discussing}} {{objects from}} Australia’s industrial past journalists writing for ‘popular’ magazines {{are fond of}} using the ‘Aussie icon’ tag. Many such reviews focus on the usual parade of ‘rural’ design objects: the <b>stump-jump</b> <b>plough,</b> Sunshine harvester, Furphy water tank and Ford Ute to make the claim that we are uniquely inventive as a nation. Far less attention, however, is paid to ‘urban’ design objects. Planet’s ‘Studio K’ lamp, to be re-released this year, is one such ‘urban’ design object and surely worthy of iconic status in Australia. [Introduction...|$|E
