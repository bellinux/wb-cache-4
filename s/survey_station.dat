Matheson directs Mulder to Arecibo, assuring the agent that {{he will try to}} hold off a Blue Beret UFO {{retrieval}} team said to be headed there in twenty-four hours. Mulder arrives at the <b>Survey</b> <b>station,</b> where he finds a frightened Puerto Rican man, Jorge, who draws a picture of an alien that he claims to have seen. Meanwhile, Scully, unaware of Mulder's whereabouts, tries to find him. Reviewing a list of flights from Washington, Scully tracks Mulder down to Puerto Rico.|$|E

40|$|Conventionally, {{establishment}} of cordon and screen lines for traffic volume studies is purely subjective, relying {{much on the}} political jurisdictions, natural boundaries or man-made barriers. Two conflict objectives are generally kept in mind in setting cordon and screen lines: obtaining as much and representative traffic information as possible and saving subsequent manpower requirement in data collection. This paper makes a first attempt to develop a systematic way for selecting cordon and screen lines for a given study area and road network. Two integer programming models are developed: one is to choose the optimal locations of a given number of <b>survey</b> <b>stations</b> to separate as many origin-destination pairs as possible {{and the other is}} to determine the minimum number of <b>survey</b> <b>stations</b> to separate all origin-destination pairs.
