60|$|Who {{can believe}} in growing old, {{so long as}} we are wrapped in this cloak of colour and wings and song; so long as this unimaginable vision is here for us to gaze at--the <b>soft-faced</b> sheep about us, and the wool-bags drying out along the fence, and great numbers of tiny ducks, so trustful that the crows have taken several.|$|E
60|$|The shop-boy {{enjoyed the}} name of Robert Roddy. He was a <b>soft-faced,</b> washed-out youth, with a {{disposition}} to wink both eyes in a meek manner. Rough-spoken people called him an idiot, but Roddy was not quite such an idiot as they took him for. He obeyed his master's mandate by sitting down on a tall stool near the window, and occupied himself in attempting to carve a human face {{on the head of}} a walking-stick.|$|E
6000|$|Several {{months passed}} in San Francisco {{during which time}} he studied the game and its rules, and {{prepared}} himself to take a hand. He even took private instruction in English, and succeeded in eliminating his worst faults, though in moments of excitement he was prone to lapse into [...] "you-all," [...] "knowed," [...] "sure," [...] and similar solecisms. He learned to eat and dress and generally comport himself after the manner of civilized man; but through it all he remained himself, not unduly reverential nor considerative, and never hesitating to stride rough-shod over any <b>soft-faced</b> convention if it got in his way and the provocation were great enough. Also, and unlike the average run of weaker men coming from back countries and far places, he failed to reverence the particular tin gods worshipped variously by the civilized tribes of men. He had seen totems before, and knew {{them for what they}} were.|$|E
6000|$|There remains, however, {{one popular}} branch of book-illustration, which has {{attracted}} {{the talents of}} some of the most skilful and original of modern draughtsmen, i.e. the embellishment of children's books. From the days when Mulready drew the old [...] "Butterfly's Ball" [...] and [...] "Peacock at Home" [...] of our youth, to those of the delightfully Blake-like fancies of E. V. B., whose [...] "Child's Play" [...] has recently been re-published for the delectation of a new generation of admirers, this has always been a popular and profitable employment; but of late years it has been raised to the level of a fine art. Mr. H. S. Marks, Mr. J. D. Watson, Mr. Walter Crane, have produced specimens of nursery literature which, for refinement of colouring and beauty of ornament, cannot easily be surpassed. The equipments of the last named, especially, are of a very high order. He began as a landscapist on wood; he now chiefly devotes himself to the figure; and he seems to have the decorative art at his fingers' ends as a natural gift. Such work as [...] "King Luckieboy's Party" [...] was a revelation in the way of toy books, while the [...] "Baby's Opera" [...] and [...] "Baby's Bouquet" [...] are petits chefs d'oeuvre, of which the sagacious collector will do well to secure copies, not for his nursery, but his library. Nor can his [...] "Mrs. Mundi at Home" [...] be neglected by the curious in quaint and graceful invention. {14} Another book--the [...] "Under the Window" [...] of Miss Kate Greenaway--comes within the same category. Since Stothard, no one has given us such a clear-eyed, <b>soft-faced,</b> happy-hearted childhood; or so poetically [...] "apprehended" [...] the coy reticences, the simplicities, and the small solemnities of little people. Added to this, the old-world costume in which she usually elects to clothe her characters, lends an arch piquancy of contrast to their innocent rites and ceremonies. Her taste in tinting, too, is very sweet and spring-like; and there is a fresh, pure fragrance about all her pictures as of new-gathered nosegays; or, perhaps, looking to the fashions that she favours, it would be better to say [...] "bow-pots." [...] But the latest [...] "good genius" [...] of this branch of book-illustrating is Mr. Randolph Caldecott, a designer assuredly of the very first order. There is a spontaneity of fun, an unforced invention about everything he does, that is infinitely entertaining. Other artists draw to amuse us; Mr. Caldecott seems to draw to amuse himself,--and this is his charm. One feels that he must have chuckled inwardly as he puffed the cheeks of his [...] "Jovial Huntsmen;" [...] or sketched that inimitably complacent dog in the [...] "House that Jack Built;" [...] or exhibited the exploits of the immortal [...] "train- band captain" [...] of [...] "famous London town." [...] This last is his masterpiece. Cowper himself must have rejoiced at it,--and Lady Austen. There are two sketches in this book--they occupy the concluding pages--which are especially fascinating. On one, John Gilpin, in a forlorn and flaccid condition, is helped into the house by the sympathising (and very attractive) Betty; on the other he has donned his slippers, refreshed his inner man with a cordial, and over the heaving shoulder of his [...] "spouse," [...] who lies dissolved upon his martial bosom, he is taking the spectators into his confidence with a wink worthy of the late Mr. Buckstone. Nothing more genuine, more heartily laughable, than this set of designs has appeared in our day. And Mr. Caldecott has few limitations. Not only does he draw human nature admirably, but he draws animals and landscapes equally well, so one may praise him without reserve. Though not children's books, mention should here be made of his [...] "Bracebridge Hall," [...] and [...] "Old Christmas," [...] the illustrations to which are the nearest approach to that beau-ideal, perfect sympathy between the artist and the author, with which the writer is acquainted. The cut on page 173 is from the former of these works.|$|E
50|$|A <b>soft-faced</b> hammer is {{a hammer}} {{designed}} to offer driving force without damaging surfaces. <b>Soft-faced</b> hammers have replaceable faces made of plastics, nylon, rubber, copper, or aluminum.|$|E
50|$|Related <b>soft-faced</b> hammers have heads {{faced with}} {{materials}} such as brass, lead, tightly wound rawhide, or plastic, although these faces are usually flat, not in a ball or wedge peen shape. These hammers usually have replaceable heads or faces, because they will deform, wear out, or break over time. They are used to prevent damage to a struck surface, and are graded {{by the weight of}} the head and by hardness of the striking face.|$|E
