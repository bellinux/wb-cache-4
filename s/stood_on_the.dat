5|$|Brampton Manor {{probably}} <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{site of the}} New Road Industrial Estate. After {{the manor}} was destroyed the site was known as Brampton Field, {{at least until the}} 18th Century, and indeed one of the streets of the housing estate which covers the site today is named Brampton Field.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War in 1950, most of Gyeongju was spared from the fighting, and remained under South Korean control throughout the conflict. However, for a brief time in late 1950 portions of the city <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front lines, as North Korean forces pushed the Pusan Perimeter southward from Pohang.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the graves, several buildings stood within the cemetery. A larger rectangular structure with an east-west alignment, identified from postholes left in the ground, <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side. It has been interpreted as a chapel or shrine. A smaller grubenhaus – a type of sunken building – which {{is thought to have}} been used as a mortuary chapel was located close by in the central area of the cemetery. An Iron Age roundhouse had also once been located within the north-west quadrant but was no longer standing at the time the cemetery was laid out. All of these buildings would have <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crest of a ridge, and would have been especially prominent to travelers arriving from the south.|$|E

5|$|Old St Paul's Cathedral was {{the medieval}} cathedral of the City of London that, until 1666, <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{site of the}} present St Paul's Cathedral.

5|$|The 37mm M5 gun had a {{manually}} operated breechblock. The tank commander doubled as loader, {{like many other}} tanks of the time. There was no turret basket in the M2A4 light tank; the commander <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side, while the gunner <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left side. The commander turned the turret onto {{the general direction of}} target. The gunner would then bring the target into the M5 telescopic sight. The M20 combination mount had 20° of traverse; this could either be by a handwheel driving the rack and pinion traverse gear mechanism or pressure on the gunners shoulder rest overcoming the friction in the mechanism. Depression and elevation of the gun was either through a geared mechanism or, with the gears disengaged, free through movement of the gunner's shoulder rest.|$|E
5|$|The {{fabric of}} the palace had been {{completely}} neglected during the years in which the Grimaldi had been exiled from Monaco.

5|$|The {{persistence}} of the cult of Menkauhor during the late Eighteenth to Nineteenth Dynasty possibly results from the location of his pyramid, which <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way to the necropolis of the Apis bulls, which later became the Serapeum.|$|E
5|$|Wismer {{sought a}} place for his team to play, but was only able to secure the {{decrepit}} Polo Grounds, which had been without a major tenant since {{the departure of the}} New York Giants baseball team in 1957.

5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} castle was 'tending to ruin', and {{following}} his {{victory in the}} English Civil War Oliver Cromwell decreed its destruction in 1655, a process which was completed within a fortnight. The castle had <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main route from Bristol to London, and following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards Old Market. The demolition of Lawford's Gate at {{the eastern end of}} Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an uninterrupted route into the bustling heart of Bristol.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1346, Kantakouzenos <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> verge of victory. He left Thrace {{under the control of}} his son Matthew and moved on to Selymbria, close to Constantinople. He did not attack the capital, but waited for almost a year for the city to surrender. In his memoirs, he {{explains}} {{that he did not want}} to turn his Turks on the city, although contemporaries such as Gregoras accused him of indecision and of needlessly prolonging the war.|$|E
5|$|Curiously, {{the legend}} {{has not been}} {{reported}} by any Byzantine author. However, {{an investigation of the}} surviving holes wherein the metal letters were riveted verified its accuracy. It also showed that the first line <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western face of the arch, while the second on the eastern. According to the current view, this refers to the usurper Joannes (r. 423–425), while according to the supporters of the traditional view, it indicates the gate's construction as a free-standing triumphal arch in 388–391 to commemorate the defeat of the usurper Magnus Maximus (r. 385–388), and which was only later incorporated into the Theodosian Walls.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} Saxon and early medieval period {{there were at}} least four {{buildings}} on the summit. The base of a stone cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period and {{it may have been a}} hermitage. The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th centuries was found part way down the hill and may have been the head of the cross that <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit. The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 14th century, a {{house by the}} name of Capell's Court <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site of Linton Park. It took its name from a family of local landowners named de Capell who held the {{property}} from the late 14th century to the mid-15th century. It was then sold to the Baysden family who held it until the late 16th century, when it was sold to Sir Anthony Mayney. Mayney's grandson sold the estate to the judge Sir Francis Wythen. Wythen's daughter, Catherine, inherited the estate and, following her second marriage to Brigadier-General Sir George Jocelyn, the estate was sold to London merchant Sir Robert Mann.|$|E
5|$|In March 2012, the parody {{national}} anthem from the film's soundtrack, which acclaims Kazakhstan for its high-quality potassium exports {{and having the}} second cleanest prostitutes in the region, was mistakenly played at the Amir of Kuwait International Shooting Grand Prix. The gold medalist, Mariya Dmitriyenko, <b>stood</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dais while the entire parody was played. The team complained, and the award ceremony was restaged. The incident apparently resulted from the wrong song being downloaded from the Internet.|$|E

Breeds that the Conservancy has assisted in saving include the Carolina Marsh Tacky horse, Randall cattle, Red Wattle hogs and the American rabbit.|$|E
