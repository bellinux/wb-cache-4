Some mechanisms, such as the production of angiotensin II and unloading of cardiovascular receptors, activate both behaviors, while others, such as the increase in blood osmolality or sodium concentration, activate water, but inhibit saline intake. Aldosterone probably activates only saline intake. Clonidine, an a 2 -adrenergic agonist, inhibits water and saline intake induced by these mechanisms.

40|$|Phased arrays in CMOS for {{consumer}} communication bands aim to enhance receiver performance by exploiting beamforming with antenna arrays. Sensitivity increases {{with the number}} of antenna elements through array gain and interferers can be cancelled through the spatial filtering of the beam pattern [1]. For the latter, the linearity of the receiver before the beamforming <b>summing</b> <b>point</b> becomes a bottleneck as interferers are not cancelled yet. Phase shifting in the LO domain reduces the complexity in the signal path and enables the use of linear signal blocks, but has high requirements on the multiphase LO generation [2]. On the other hand, a switched-capacitor phase shifter can be very linear, but is limited by the linearity of the necessary input matching and element summing g m-stages [3]. This paper proposes a fully passive phased-array receiver front-end which implements impedance matching, phase shifting and element summing with only switched-capacitor stages for a high linearity. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Higher-degree moment tensor {{representation}} of seismic sources is ob-tained for a horizontally layered homogeneous medium. A Taylor series expansion of Green’s function around a reference source position {{and time is}} made, and this enables us to approximate the seismic radiation in both the regional and teleseismic distances through a sequence of terms representing increasingly detailed aspects of the source behavior. Source coefficients and orientation factors of the first- and second-degree moment tensors are obtained. The representation is applied to a uni-lateral rupture Haskell fault model, and the synthetic seismograms of different models calculated by the higher-degree moment tensors are compared with the theoretical solutions for a propagating source. Our results show that, the {{representation of}} higher-degree moment tensors up to degree 2 can describe the response of a moving source well enough, and it’s possible to use the moment series {{as a tool for}} calculating seismograms from finite and propagating faults in the forward sense. The computa-tion takes much less time than the method of <b>summing</b> <b>point</b> sources over the fault surface.

40|$|The exact Cagniard-de Hoop {{solutions}} for a point dislocation in half-space {{are used to}} construct models of the strong ground motion observed during the February 9, 1971 San Fernando earthquake (M_L = 6. 4). By <b>summing</b> <b>point</b> dislocations distributed over the fault plane, three-dimensional models of a finite fault located in a half-space are constructed to study the ground motions observed at JPL (Pasadena), Palmdale, Lake Hughes, and Pacoima Dam. Since the duration of faulting {{is comparable to the}} travel times for various wave types, very complex interference of these arrivals makes a detailed interpretation of these wave forms difficult. By investigating the motion due to small sections of the fault, it is possible to understand how various wave types interfere to produce the motion due to the total fault. Rayleigh waves as well as S to P head waves are shown to be important effects of the free surface. Near-field source effects are also quite dramatic. Strong directivity is required to explain the difference in amplitudes seen between stations to the north and stations to the south. Faulting appears to have begun north of Pacoima at a depth of 13 km. The rupture velocity, which is near 2. 8 km/sec in the hypocentral region, appears to slow to 1. 8 km/sec at a depth of 5 km. Displacements on the deeper sections of the fault are about 2. 5 m. Fault offsets become very small at depths near 4 km and then grow again to 5 m near the surface rupture. The large velocity pulse seen at Pacoima is a far-field shear wave which is enhanced by directivity. Peak accelerations at Pacoima are probably associated with the large shallow faulting.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{implement}} a Power System Stabilizer (PSS) and incorporate it to a Generator to enhance its dynamic performance. When a generator is connected to a power system the rotor angle oscillations due to small load changes can be observed This is due to fact that once a generator is constructed the damping effect of it is fixed and it is unable to offer additional damping to damp down these rotor angle oscillations. The power system stabilizer (PSS) provides supplementary damping for low frequency rotor angle oscillations ranging from 0. 1 Hz to 3 Hz which covers local mode, Inter area mode and inter unit mode power system oscillations. Here the PSS output is fed back to the excitation system <b>summing</b> <b>point</b> to damp down rotor angle oscillations. // In general, small load changes in a power system cause rotor angle oscillations. In order to damp down these oscillations an electrical torque should be produced on the rotor shaft, in phase with the speed deviation. Power system stabilizer adds a closed loop auxiliary feedback signal to the reference voltage of Automatic voltage regulator (AVR) in proportion to either speed deviation, frequency deviation or power deviation. // Normally the terminal voltage of a generator is adjusted by the AVR after computing the difference between reference voltage and feedback terminal voltage. In my project the PSS is designed to operate as follows. A voltage signal {{in proportion to the}} frequency deviation caused by small load changes is first produced. This voltage signal which represents the frequency deviation is then added to the reference voltage of AVR. This in turn causes an electrical torque to be added on the rotor shaft to enhance the small signal stability performance. // The developed PSS consists of a High pass filter (HPF), a Zero crossing detector (ZCD), a Frequency to voltage conveitor (F/V), a Summer I and a Summer 2. The frequency deviation is filtered by using the HPF in order to block steady changes in frequency. The filtered signal is sent through the ZCD to maintain a constant amplitude signal to the F/V converter because it responds to amplitude of input signal. The output of F/V converter and the voltage corresponding to base load frequency which is injected separately using a Calibration instrument, are summed in summer 1 to obtain a voltage deviation corresponding to frequency deviation. The output of summer I and reference voltage of AVR are summed in summer^ and fed back to LM 723, which is the main control chip of the AVR. // In order to analyze the effect of PSS, following parameters were observed. 1 Output of frequency to voltage convertor 2 Generator Current 3 Induction Motor Current Finally two MATLAB routines are used to extract actual low frequency oscillations from observed signals. 1 A low pass filter is designed using ellip() and filter() functions and observed signals are filtered with a cutoff frequency of 3 Hz. The outputs of the filter clearly show the effect of PSS in enhancing the dynamic performance of the generator. 2.

40|$|AbstractAn {{individual}} line {{or a combination}} of lines viewed in darkness has a large influence on the elevation to which an observer sets a target so that it is perceived to lie at eye level (VPEL). These influences are systematically related to the orientation of pitched-from-vertical lines on pitched plane(s) and to the lengths of the lines, {{as well as to the}} orientations of lines of ‘equivalent pitch’ that lie on frontoparallel planes. A three-stage model processes the visual influence: The first stage parallel processes the orientations of the lines utilizing 2 classes of orientation-sensitive neural units in each hemisphere, with the two classes sensitive to opposing ranges of orientations; the signal delivered by each class is of opposite sign in the two hemispheres. The second stage generates the total visual influence from the parallel combination of inputs delivered by the 4 groups of the first stage, and a third stage combines the total visual influence from the second stage with signals from the body-referenced mechanism that contains information about the position and orientation of the eyes, head, and body. The circuit equation describing the combined influence of n separate inputs from stage 1 on the output of the stage 2 integrating neuron is derived for n stimulus lines which possess any combination of orientations and lengths; Each of the n lines is assumed to stimulate one of the groups of orientation-sensitive units in visual cortex (stage 1) whose signals converge on to a dendrite of the integrating neuron (stage 2), and to produce changes in postsynaptic membrane conductance (gi) and potential (Vi) there. The net current from the n dendrites results in a voltage change (VA) at the initial segment of the axon of the integrating neuron. Nerve impulse frequency proportional to this voltage change signals the total visual influence on perceived elevation of the visual field. The circuit equation corresponding to the total visual influence for n equal length inducing lines is VA=ΣVi/[n+(gA/gS) ], where the potential change due to line i, Vi, is proportional to line orientation, gA is the conductance at the axon's <b>summing</b> <b>point,</b> and gS=gi for each i for the equal length case; the net conductance change due to a line is proportional to the line's length. The circuit equation is interpreted as a basis for quantitative predictions from the model that can be compared to psychophysical measurements of the elevation of VPEL. The interpretation provides the predicted relation for the visual influence on VPEL, V, by n inducing lines each with length l: thus, V=a+[kiΣθi/n+(k 2 /l) ], where θi is the orientation of line i, a is the effect of the body-referenced mechanism, and k 1 and k 2 are constants. The model's output is fitted to the results of five sets of experiments in which the elevation of VPEL measured with a small target in the median plane is systematically influenced by distantly located 1 -line or 2 -line inducing stimuli varying in orientation and length and viewed in otherwise total darkness with gaze restricted to the median plane; each line is located at either 25 ° eccentricity to the left or right of the median plane. The model predicts the negatively accelerated growth of VPEL with line length for each orientation and the change of slope constant of the linear combination rule among lines from 1. 00 (linear summation; short lines) to 0. 61 (near-averaging; long lines). Fits to the data are obtained over a range of orientations from − 30 ° to + 30 ° of pitch for 1 -line visual fields from lengths of 3 ° to 64 °, for parallel 2 -line visual fields over the same range of lengths and orientations, for short and long 2 -line combinations in which each of the two members may have any orientation (parallel or nonparallel pairs), and for the well-illuminated and fully structured pitchroom. In addition, similar experiments with 2 -line stimuli of equivalent pitch in the frontoparallel plane were also fitted to the model. The model accounts for more than 98 % of the variance of the results in each case...|$|E
