5|$|Today, the Alaska Volcano Observatory {{monitors}} {{activity at}} Mount Cleveland using satellite imagery. Cloud cover often obscures the volcano, which makes many events difficult to follow. In addition, the low {{resolution of the}} satellite imagery allows minor events, which do not make an impression on the <b>satellite</b> <b>picture,</b> to pass unnoticed. There are no seismic or geophysical instruments on the mountain (the nearest are in Nikolski), and some eruptions are first observed by pilots flying over the volcano. A field {{study was conducted in}} late 2001, and an automatic system based on thermal anomalies was implemented following eruptive events in 2005. In recent years the Alaska Volcano Observatory has made an effort to expand volcanic coverage westward along the Aleutian Arc.|$|E
25|$|The low {{pressure}} center was {{so deep that}} somewhat of an eye actually formed. Rarely do eyes form on storms other than hurricanes, and it is especially rare in extratropical cyclones. NASA took a <b>satellite</b> <b>picture</b> of {{the eye of the}} storm; the eye was located south and east of southern New Jersey in this picture.|$|E
500|$|After being named, Pauline {{displayed}} {{signs of}} a tight circulation, but satellite pictures were unable to pick up any distinct features due to nearby cirrus outflow. Later that day, however, satellites picked up a feature in the hurricane that resembled an eye, but closer inspection showed that the eye was either a shadow or a gap between bands and that the real center was [...] west of the eye. On September30, the storm turned to the northwest and its forward speed accelerated to [...] Around this time, a <b>satellite</b> <b>picture</b> showed a genuine eye beginning to form and banding features became apparent. Even though the picture was distorted due to by electronic problems, the tropical storm was subsequently upgraded to hurricane intensity. On October 1, the ship Overseas Joyce recorded [...] to [...] north-northeast winds, a heavy swell from the east-southeast and a pressure of 1002mbar. An estimate based on satellite pictures placed the Overseas Joyce at [...] to [...] away from the center. Another nearby ship, the Golden Eagle, reported south-southeast winds of [...] and high seas [...] east of the center.|$|E

500|$|Air masses can be {{modified}} {{in a variety of}} ways. [...] Surface flux from underlying vegetation, such as forest, acts to moisten the overlying air mass. [...] Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as [...] to [...] [...] For example, southwest of extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect snow bands. Those bands bring strong localized precipitation since large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences (larger than 13°C or 23°F) between the water surface and the air above. Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds (see <b>satellite</b> <b>picture)</b> which produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the deeper the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes.|$|E

Both predictive differential quantizing technique and double delta coding can be significantly improved by applying a background skipping technique. An extension code is constructed. This code requires very little storage space and operates efficiently. Simulation results are presented for various coding schemes and source codes...|$|R

40|$|Rainfall {{which is}} {{regarded}} as one of the more important observations for the measurements of this most variable parameter was made continuously, across large areas and over the sea. Ships could not provide the needed resolution nor could available radars provide the needed breadth of coverage. Microwave observations from the Nimbus- 5 satellite offered some hope. Another possibility was suggested by the results of many comparisons between rainfall and the clouds seen in <b>satellite</b> <b>pictures.</b> Sequences of pictures from the first geostationary satellites were employed and a general correspondence between rain and the convective clouds visible in <b>satellite</b> <b>pictures</b> was found. It was demonstrated that the agreement was best for growing clouds. The development methods to infer GATE rainfall from geostationary satellite images are examined...|$|R
