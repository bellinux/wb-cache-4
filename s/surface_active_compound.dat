Two surfactin concentrations that inhibit (400 g/ml) and even stimulate (300 g/ml) the growth of B. subtilis 168 strain were assessed. Surfactin brought about the growth arrest for 3 hours and the restored growth rate decreased in the case of inhibitory concentration, whereas the stimulatory concentration increased the growth rate and resulted in higher final density of the population.

The {{aim of this}} study was to reveal the self-resistance strategy at the level of the lipid moiety of cytoplasmic membrane, which B. subtilis employs to combat surfactin in concentrations that are lethal for other bacterial species. Non-producing strain B. subtilis 168 was cultivated in the presence of two different sublethal concentrations of surfactin (350 a 650 µg/ml), which was isolated from the culture broth of B. subtilis ATCC 21332. Presence of surfactin in the medium resulted in a concentration dependent lag phase, which took 40 min (350 µg/ml) and 3 h (650 µg/ml), respectively. Afterwards, the culture grew with the altered doubling time of 44 min (350 µg/ml) and 126 min (650 µg/ml), respectively. Surfactin induced substantial changes in the phospholipid composition of the cytoplasmic membrane.

40|$|Flowing liquids in {{pipe systems}} cause {{pressure}} drops and energy losses {{and can be}} responsible for the initiation of flow induced localized corrosion (FILC). Initiation of FILC is affected by unfavourable geometric conditions in flow systems and local flow intensities above critical values. Many technical systems are concerned, e. g. in the field of oil and gas production, pipeline transportation, chemical plants or power stations. Critical flow intensities are generally expressed in terms of wall shear stresses as a value for the friction between turbulent flowing liquids and the wall. High molecular polymers and <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds</b> can influence a turbulent flow by reducing the wall shear stress to values which are uncritical for destruction of protective surface layers and thus can reduce the likelihood of FILC. In the framework of this thesis globular structures of hyperbranched polymers (e. g. polyglycerols, polyethylene imines) were investigated in order to find out if hyperbranched polymers are able to reduce wall shear stresses and if they have a higher resistance to degradation in high shear fields compared to <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds</b> like surfactants. It was proved by electrochemical and rheological investigations that globular structures like polyglycerols and polyethylene imines as well exert flow improving properties when the molecular size is high enough. Electrochemical and rheological measurements yield different results on the flow improving properties. This is explained by the effect of local flow intensities on the near-wall concentration of additives yielding an increase of the near-wall liquid viscosity and thus influences the interaction between the flowing liquid and the wall. This may already result in a decrease of the flow induced corrosion attack in flow systems. In summary, it was found out that hyperbranched polymers are a new class of polymers with a new supramolecular structure which exhibits as well as high molecular <b>compounds</b> and <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds</b> flow improving properties...|$|R

This work focuses on constraining the impacts that biomass burning has on Earth's climate through two effects: scattering or absorption of light by particles and particle impacts on cloud formation. To explore biomass burning light interaction and hygroscopicity, a series of environmental chamber experiments were carried out using fuels common to the southwest U. S. This work includes the effects that photochemical aging has on the emissions to provide a realistic assessment of the emissions' lifetime in the atmosphere. The work done on the cloud formation properties of the emissions shows that two common assumptions applied to the emissions misrepresent their cloud forming abilities. The first assumption, that <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds</b> are negligible in cloud activation, is shown to not apply to biomass burning aerosols. Not accounting for the presence of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds</b> over estimates the hygroscopicity of the aerosols by up to 30 %. The second assumption, that the volume of the particles is well characterized by the electrical mobility diameter, is also shown to not apply to the system. Making the second assumption when parameterizing the hygroscopicity of the aerosols underestimates the hygroscopicity by up to 50 %. Accounting for both assumptions is shown to have a greater impact at the point of emission than after six hours of photochemical aging. Therefore, the age of the aerosols must be taken into account when predicting the indirect effects of biomass burning aerosol. This work also explores the light absorption of biomass burning aerosol and its reaction to photochemical aging. The results indicate that the aerosol is light absorbing and the magnitude of absorption can change with photochemical exposure. This work also shows that the absorption of the aerosol evolves with the volatility and <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds</b> present in the aerosol. The final part of this work demonstrates that the local air quality that biomass is grown in can have an impact when that biomass is burned. Biomass grown in a polluted area is shown to emit more NOx than biomass grown in a clean area and that the aerosols are less volatile...|$|R

The transformed B. subtilis SB 103 derivative of the strain 168 was shown to produce surfactin measured by its decrease in surface tension, emulsification activity, and TLC analysis of the <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compound</b> isolated from the culture broth.

Both sodium chloride and succinic acid are found in atmospheric aerosols, the former being main constituent of marine aerosol. Succinic acid was found to decrease the surface tension of water already at very low concentrations. Sodium chloride increased the surface tension linearly {{as a function of}} the concentration. Surface tensions of both binary solutions agreed well with the previous measurements. Succinic acid was found to lower the surface tension even if sodium chloride is present, indicating that succinic acid as a <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compound</b> tends to concentrate to the surface. An equation based on thermodynamical relations was fitted to the data. As a result, a surface tension parameterization of ternary solution was obtained over the whole concentration range. The parameterization can safely be used at temperatures from 10 to 30 °C. These kinds of parameterizations are important for example in atmospheric nucleation models. To investigate the influence of surface tension on cloud droplet activation, the surface tension parameterization was included in an adiabatic air parcel model. Usually in cloud models the surface tension of pure water is used. Simulations were done for characteristic marine aerosol size distributions consisting of the considered ternary mixture. We found that by using the surface tension of pure water, the amount of activated particles is underestimated up to 8 % if particles contain succinic acid and overestimated it up to 8 % if particles contain only sodium chloride.

One or more low molecular compounds, present in culture filtrates of 3. 1 T 8, caused rapid immobilization of zoospores of P. aphanidermatum and inhibited cyst germination. Bioassays for suppression of root and crown rot were performed with 2 -week-old cucumber plants in nutrient solution. Complete disease suppression occurred after addition of a suspension of unwashed cells grown on nutrient-poor R 2 A, or the filtrate of this suspension, 1 day before inoculation with zoospores. Application of washed cells caused slight suppression in one of two bioassays only. No disease suppression occurred when bacterial inoculum grown on 1 / 10 TSBA or in 1 / 10 TSB was used. In two bioassays on cucumber plants grown for 4 – 5 weeks in 18 -L containers, application of R 2 A-grown cells of 3. 1 T 8 did not cause disease suppression. Density of 3. 1 T 8, monitored using immunofluorescence colony staining, decreased at least 100 -fold during these experiments to approximately log 3 – 4 cfu ml- 1 of nutrient solution and log 5 – 6 cfu g- 1 roots. Overall, the findings indicated a strong influence of nutritional resources on production of antifungal compounds by strain 3. 1 T 8. The lack of disease suppression in hydroculture containers suggested that in situ production of the compounds was insufficient or absent, although the bacteria persisted in the nutrient solution and on the roots of cucumber.

This, in turn, has served as a driving force for the discovery and application of novel biosurfactants. The class Actinobacteria represents a vast group of microorganisms with the ability to produce a diverse range of secondary metabolites, including surfactants. Understanding the extensive nature of the biosurfactants produced by actinobacterial strains can assist in finding novel biosurfactants with new potential applications. This review therefore presents a comprehensive overview of the knowledge available on actinobacterial surfactants, the chemical structures that have been completely or partly elucidated, as well as the identity of the biosurfactant-producing strains. Producer strains of not yet elucidated compounds are discussed, as well as the original habitats of all the producer strains, which seems to indicate that biosurfactant production is environmentally driven. Methodology applied in the isolation, purification and structural elucidation of the different types of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds,</b> as well as surfactant activity tests, are also discussed. Overall, actinobacterial surfactants can be summarized to include the dominantly occurring trehalose-comprising surfactants, other non-trehalose containing glycolipids, lipopeptides and the more rare actinobacterial surfactants. The lack of structural information on a large proportion of actinobacterial surfactants should be considered as a driving force to further explore the abundance and diversity of these compounds.

The aim of this thesis was to investigate the salivary interactions between two antiplaque agents and saliva and microorganisms at defined solid/liquid and air liquid interfaces. The plaque control agents used in this study were delmopinol and chlorhexidine in varying concentrations. Sample of polled whole saliva collected from 16 subjects were used for adsorption experiments to solid surfaces. Whole saliva from one individual was used to study the adsorption of chemical agents to bacterial cell walls. Whole saliva samples from five subjects were used to study the binding or precipitation of salivary components by the antiplaque agents in solution. The interactions between the chemical antiplaque agents and the salivary components were investigated with ellipsometry, tensitometry, electrophoresis, video-densitometry, electrobloting, and radiolabeling. The results indicate that chlorhexidine is a <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compound</b> that has the capability to adsorb onto bare solid surfaces of well-defined chemical characteristics and onto surfaces preconditioned with salivary films. Chlorhexidine and delmopinol were shown to have binding sites for salivary proteins and to induce precipitation of salivary proteins. Delmopinol appears to precipitate more high molecular weight salivary proteins than chlorhexidine. It was also demonstrated that the composition of saliva as well as the concentration of chlorhexidine or delmopinol play a role in the amount of salivary proteins precipitated. In addition, chlorhexidine and delmopinol were round to bind to the salivary films coating the tested bacteria. The substantivities of both agents are related to their binding capabilities to salivary proteins.

The surface pressure-molecular area isotherms change with the length and nature of the side chains in a manner which suggests that a long side chain allows the porphyrin rings to acquire the most ordered packing. A rigid chain structure was found to restrict the orientational flexibility of the porphyrin rings and hence restricted them to acquire well-ordered monolayer.;The solid state photophysical properties of these materials are strongly dependent on their degree of order. Spectroscopic studies of single monolayer films transferred to quartz and SnOdollar 2 dollar slides using the Langmuir-Blodgett technique indicate that increasing the order in porphyrin monolayers leads to increasing spectral shifts in absorption and to decreasing fluorescence quantum yields. On the SnOdollar 2 dollar semiconductor surface, the monolayers exhibit an enhanced fluorescence quenching.

Noniyonik yüzey aktif maddelerden nonil fenol etoksilatlar kısa süre öncesine kadar yüzey aktif madde pazarının % 80 ‘ini oluşturan türler olarak bu pazarda ciddi bir paya sahiptiler. Sucul ortamda yarattıkları olumsuz etkiler anlaşılana kadar nonil fenol etoksilatlar kağıt, tekstil, deri, gıda, boya gibi bir çok endüstriyi kapsayan geniş bir yelpazede yaygın olarak kullanılmaktaydılar. Ancak 1990 ‘lı yılların başlarında endokrin bozucu ve toksik etkilerinin fark edilmesinin ardından nonil fenol etoksilatların yerine kullanılabilecek başka bir noniyonik yüzey aktif madde arayışına girilmiştir. Gelinen bu aşamada birinci alternatif olarak toksik etkileri bilinmeyen, yüksek biyolojik bozunurluğa sahip ve yüzey aktif madde olarak uygulamada nonil fenol etoksilatları ikame edebilecek nonil alkol etoksilatlar görülmektedir. Bahsedilen özellikleri nedeniyle nonil alkol etoksilatların üretimleri ve kullanımları gün geçtikçe artmakta ve yaygınlaşmaktadır. Her ne kadar bilinen herhangi toksik, kanserojenik veya mutajenik etkiye sahip olmasalar da, giderek artan miktarda üretilen ve kullanılan alkol etoksilatların arıtılabilirliklerinin araştırılması ihtiyacı doğmuştur. Literatürde alkol etoksilatların biyolojik olarak arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili gün geçtikçe artan sayıda araştırma yer almasına karşın söz konusu yüzey aktif maddelerin fiziko-kimyasal, elektrokimyasal ve fotokimyasal arıtılabilirlikleri ile ilgili sınırlı ve yetersiz sayıda araştırma mevcuttur. Bu çalışmanın amacı alkol etoksilatlara örnek teşkil etmek üzere seçilen polioksietilen (4) loril eter (Brij 30) ‘in 20 mg/L konsantrasyonundaki sulu çözeltilerinin koagülasyon, elektrokoagülsyon ve TiO 2 /UV-A fotokatalitik oksidasyon prosesleri esas alınarak fizikokimyasal ve kimyasal yöntemler ile arıtılabilirliğinin incelenmesi ve maksimum Brij 30 ve organik madde (TOK) giderimini sağlayacak en uygun proses reaksiyon koşullarının belirlenmesidir.

İki farklı TiO 2 katalizörü kullanılarak yürütülen fotokatalitik oksidasyon deneylerinde Aeroxide PF 2 heterojen katalizörü ile yine istenilen düzeyde giderme verimleri elde edilememiştir.

Nonionic {{surfactants}} {{have low}} foaming properties, are highly soluble {{in cold water}} and are effective even in very low concentrations in water. Because of these advanteges, nonionic surfactants are widely used surface active substances especially in the industries such as leather, food, pulp and paper, cosmetics etc. Nonylphenol ethoxylates which used to dominate the surfactant market with a consumption rate of 80 %, {{have been the most}} preferred nonionic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compound.</b> Nonylphenol ethoxylates are functionally used as cleaning and washing agents, surface active agents and foaming agents. The industrial activities use nonylphenol ethoxylates for industrial and institutional cleaning, textile auxiliaries, leather auxiliaries, emulsion polymerization, agricultural pesticides, cosmetics, cleaning products and office products such as correction fluids and ink. In early 90 ‘s the toxic and endocrine distrupting effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the aquatic environment have been revealed. Nonylphenol, a breakdown product of nonylphenol ethoxylates, has been shown to mimic the action of the female hormone oestrogen. Concerns have focused on the potential for nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates to cause feminisation in wildlife, such as fish exposed to nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates contaminated effluents, as well as being a potential factor in the increasing incidence of reproductive organ disorders and decreasing sperm counts in men. Whereas nonylphenol ethoxylates is reasonably readily degradable, its breakdown product nonylphenol is more persistent. It has been determined that these compouns exhibit the estrogenetic activity by mimicing the hormones mentioned. Especially in the aquatic environment, fishes are the most affected organisms. It is known that nonylphenol ethoxylates are also very slowly biodegredable and have bioaccumulating property. After realizing the adverse effects of nonylphenol ethoxylates in the environment, espacially in aquatic environment, several countries have been taken act by regulations restricting production and consumption of nonylphenol ethoxylates. It was necessary to replace nonylphenol ethoxylates with another nonionic surface active agent. At this point alcohol ethoxylates seem to be the most appropriate alternative due to it‘s high biodegredability, low toxicity, high water solubility and surface active effectiveness. Alcohol ethoxylates are the second largest group of surfactants in terms of manufacture (after linear alkylbenzenesulphonates) and the main group of non-ionic surfactants. The main area of alcohol ethoxylate application is in the manufacture of washing powders, liquids etc. Alchol ethoxylates are classifed as easily biodegradable surfactants, in contrast to previously used oxyethylated alkylphenols or oxyethylene-oxypropylene block copolymers. xviii However, the massive stream of alcohol ethoxylates directed into sewage systems and then to sewage treatment, is required strict control in order to prevent pollution of the aquatic environment. A very important chain in this control is the examination of the biodegradability of surfactants prior to their uses in washing powder formulations. After replacing nonylphenol ethoxylates, production and consumption of alcohol ethoxylates have rapidly increased. This progression brought on the requirement of knowlege on the treatability, biodegradability and toxicity properties of alcohol ethoxylates. There are several research on the biodegradability of nonyl alcohol ethoxylates, however there are very little information about the chemical treatablity of these compounds. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the treatability of alcohol ethoxylates in aqueous solutions by coagulation, electrocoagulation and TiO 2 /UV-A photocatalitic oxidation processes and to determine the optimum process conditions for the most effective treatment process. As a model nonyl alcohol ethoxylate compound poly(oxyethylene) (4) loryl ether, Brij 30 was selected to be used in the experiments. This study consists of seven chapters. In the first chapter, the purpose and scope of the study was described briefly. In the second chapter, classification of surfactants, properties of surfactants, a brief explanation about toxicity of nonylphenol ethoxyltes, properties of alcohol ethoxylates and treatability of alcohol ethoxylates were defined. In the third chapter, fundamentals of coagulation and electrocoagulation were defined. Basic chemicals‘ reactions which occur during these processes were explained. In the fourth chapter, photochemical oxidation process was described, the fundamentals and basic reactions were explained. The factors which effecting photocatalitic activity were also explained in the end of the chapter. In the fifth chapter, the materials and methods were introduced which were used during the experimental part of the thesis. Since three different processed were used, three different treatment methods were explained. These processes were: classical coagulation-floculation process, electrocoagulation process and TiO 2 catalized photocatalitic oxidation process. For every process the same analytical analysis were applied to the sampes in order to follow the treatment efficiency such as colourimetric surfactant determination and TOC analysis. In the sixth chapter all of the experimental results were evaluated and discussed. In the last chapter of the study the results were briefly evaluated and the most important results were stressed by the explanation of importance. In this experimental study, three different chemical treatment alternatives were evaluated and it was determined that only one of them was suitable to treat model pollutant, Brij 30 compound from its aqueos solution. The first alternative was classical coagulation-flocculation process derived in different coagulant (FeCl 3) concentrations varing between 100 and 1000 mg/L, in pH 6. 5 and 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentration. In this process the least Brij 30 removal was observed with 25 % Brij 30 removal in 100 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage and the highest Brij 30 removal efficiency was achieved with 39 % in 750 mg/L FeCl 3 dosage. These results showed that coagulation-floculation process was not practical for removing Brij 30 from its aqueous solution. xix The second process was electrocoagulation process using stainless steel electrodes and NaCl as electrolyte. Electrocoagulation experiments were conducted at original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6), various NaCl concentrations (500, 1000, 1500, 2000 mg NaCl/L) and two different current densities (9, 3 and 18, 6 mA/cm 2). When experimental results were evaluated; in 500 mg/L NaCl concentration, current density of 18, 6 mA/cm 2 after 180 minutes 70 % of Brij 30 removal was achieved. In the coagulation-flocultion experiments there was no significant removal result neighter in Brij 30 nor in TOC. The last but the most effective process was photocalalytic oxidation using TiO 2 as catalyst under UV-A radiation. In this experiments firstly two different TiO 2 types (Degussa P 25 and Aeroxide P 2) were compared and it was proved that Degussa P 25 was significantly more effective than Aeroxide P 2 in removing Brij 30 and TOC. The experiments were conducted in 20 mg/L Brij 30 concentrations, in two different pH (original pH ~ 6 and pH= 3) to determine the effect of initial pH, in two different TiO 2 concentrations (1 and 1. 5 g/L) to determine the effect of TiO 2 dosages and for the selected test periods (5, 10, 15, 60, 240, 480 minutes). The aim of experiments were to determine the optimum process terms. In these experiments that in the original pH of 20 mg/L Brij 30 solution (~ 6) and 1 g/L Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage after 15 minutes more than 96 % Brij 30 removal was obtained. Under these experimental conditions only after 240 minutes 64 % TOC removal was achieved. After increasing the Degussa P 25 TiO 2 dosage to 1. 5 g/L, after 480 minutes of photocatalitic oxidation TOC removal increased to 86 %. In general after decreasing the pH to 3 resulted in decreases the Brij 30 removal efficiencies. The experimental results showed that coagulation-floculation and electrocoagulation processes were not suitable effective treatment methods in removing Brij 30 from aqueous solutions. Additionally very limited organic matter removal efficiencies in terms of TOC could be obtained by appliying these processes. The most effective process was photocatalitic oxidation under UV-A radiation from the three different processes. By using photocatalitic oxidation it is possible to remove practically all of the model pollutant and most of the TOC from the water under mentioned conditions. Even in short reaction periods (15 minutes) high rates of Brij 30 removals are achieved but longer experiment periods (240 - 480 minutes) are needed in order to reach significant TOC removals.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Endokrin bozucu bileşikler hormon gibi davranarak canlı yaşamı üzerinde etkisi olan ve bununla birlikte birçok hastalığa neden olmasından dolayı son yıllarda araştırmacıların da özellikle üzerinde durduğu bir konu haline gelmiştir. Oldukça karmaşık yapılı endokrin bozucu bileşiklerin etkin arıtımının sağlanması, karasal ve sucul ortamları bu öncelikli kirleticilerin sebep oldukları ekotoksikolojik etkilerden korumak için önem kazanmıştır. Endokrin bozucu bileşiklerin tamamen giderilmesi, zararsız ayrışma ürünlerine dönüştürülmesi veya endokrin aktivitelerinin giderilmesi için uygun ve etkili metotların geliştirilmesi adına kapsamlı araştırmalar yapılmaktadır. Reaktif serbest radikallerin üretimine dayanan ileri oksidasyon prosesleri farklı kimyasal yapıya sahip birçok organik kirleticinin arıtımında tek başlarına veya konvansiyonel teknolojiler ile birlikte çok önemli bir rol oynamaktadır. Son yıllarda ise, zor ayrışan, hatta inert ve/veya toksik kirleticilerin sülfat radikali bazlı ileri oksidasyon prosesleri ile giderimiyle ilgili araştırmalar ön plana çıkmıştır. Bu deneysel çalışmada, yaygın üretim kapasiteleri, yoğun tüketimleri, kendilerinin ve ayrışma ürünlerinin endokrin bozucu etkilerinden dolayı çevreye ve insan sağlığına son derece zararlı Bisfenol A (BPA) ve Oktilfenol etoksilat (OPEO) kirleticilerinin sülfat ve hidroksil radikali bazlı ileri oksidasyon prosesleri ile arıtılabilirlikleri, gerçek su ve distile su ile hazırlanan numunelerde karşılaştırmalı olarak araştırılmıştır. Seçilen kirleticilerin arıtımları sırasında meydana gelen toksisite değişimlerinin belirlenmesi amacıyla ayrıntılı deneysel çalışmalar yürütülmüştür. BPA giderimi persülfat (PS) /UV-C prosesiyle yapılan deneyde distile su (DS) ortamında 5. Dakikada, İstanbul’da içme suyu arıtma tesisi girişinden iki seferde alınan gerçek su numunelerinde ise (GS 1 ve GS 2) 20. dakikada; H 2 O 2 /UV-C prosesiyle yapılan deneyde ise DS için 7. dakikada GS 1 ve GS 2 için 30. dakikada gerçekleşmiştir. BPA’nın PS/UV-C ile arıtımında, TOK giderim verimleri DS (% 70 TOK giderimi) ile yapılan deneyde GS 1 (% 25 TOK giderimi) ve GS 2 (% 28 TOK giderimi) numunelerine göre daha yüksektir. TOK gideriminin DS için % 84 GS 1 ve GS 2 için sırasıyla % 45 ve % 48 olduğu H 2 O 2 /UV-C prosesinde de PS/UV-C prosesine benzer şekilde DS ile yapılan deneyde daha yüksek giderim verimi elde edilmiştir. PS/UV-C prosesiyle OPEO giderimi DS için 5. GS 1 ve GS 2 için 10. ve 20. dakikalarda; H 2 O 2 /UV-C prosesiyle DS için 5., GS 1 ve GS 2 için sırasıyla 20 ve 30. dakikalarda tamamen giderilmiştir. OPEO’nun PS/UV-C prosesi ile arıtımında TOK giderimlerinin DS ile hazırlanan numunede % 92, GS 1 ve GS 2 için % 74, H 2 O 2 /UV-C prosesinde ise DS için % 92, GS 1 için % 69, GS 2 için ise % 75 olduğu bulunmuştur. BPA’nın PS/UV-C ile arıtıldığı deneylerde V. fischeri ve P. subcapitata toksisite analizleri yapılmış ve 90. dakikada inhibisyonun yeterince azaldığına ve bu dakikada reaksiyonun sonlandırılabileceğine karar verilmiştir. BPA’nın H 2 O 2 /UV-C prosesi ile arıtımında V. fischeri, P. subcapitata ve D. magna toksisitesindeki değişimler incelendiğinde sırasıyla 60., 120. ve 120. dakikalarda inhibisyonun görülmemesi reaksiyonun 120. dakikada durdurulması gerektiğini göstermiştir. Advanced {{oxidation}} processes (AOPs) {{have been}} a matter of recent scientific and technological interest in water treatment technologies. AOPs are mainly employed to effectively oxidize, transform or remove recalcitrant compounds from industrial and municipal wastewater including resistant organics (pesticides, surfactants, coloring matters, pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting chemicals) based on the parameters assessed, removal efficiencies and the degradation mechanisms of pollutants. There are a variety of advanced oxidation processes including: homogenus ultraviolet irridation (UV) - either direct irradiation of the contaminant or photolytic oxidation mediated by hydrogen peroxide (UV/H 2 O 2), and/or ozone (UV/H 2 O 2 /O 3 or UV/O 3), fenton and photo fenton processes, heterogeneous photocatalysis using semiconductor catalysts (e. g. UV/TiO 2), X-ray or Gamma ray radiolysis, ultrasonic irradiation and electron beam radiation. Although these technologies involve different methods of activation, as well as oxidant generation, most of them are electric-energy-driven and share the common denominator of hydroxyl radical chemistry for contaminant removal. Natural or industrial endocrine disrupters, which are taken to the living organism externally, are risk factors against health because of their potential of imitating the hormonal activity in natural life. Endocrine disrupting compounds are defined as health threatening substances and/or mixtures that change the endocrine system(by inhibition of normal synthesis and hormonal functions by imitating the natural hormons, release of stock hormons, inhibition of secretion and transport machanisms, combining and inactivate natural hormons etc.) of healthy living organisms or their future generations. In recent years, sulphate radical based photochemical advanced oxidation processes gain importance for the removal of endocrine distrupters and their decomposition products. Bisphenol A (2, 2 -bis(4 -hydroxyphenyl) propane; BPA), is a chemical being widely used as a monomer for the production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate, unsaturated polyester-styrene resins and flame retardants. The final industrial products are used as coating materials on cans, as powder paints, additives in thermal paper, in dental fillings and as antioxidants in plastics. It has been postulated that BPA has estrogenic activity and is classified as an endocrine disrupting compound (EDC). Due to its high consumption rate and adverse health effects on wildlife, BPA is {{known as one of the}} industrial pollutants that have generated significant academic as well as public interest recently. BPA is being released into the natural environment as well as surface water during its manufacturing and by leaching from final products If not treated properly, effluent containing BPA is a potential source of contamination in the aquatic environment. Due to the fact that biotreatment requires long retention times and cannot degrade BPA completely rapid and efficient treatment processes including advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have successfully been developed for the efficient treatment of BPA. Alkylphenol ethoxylates are complex and organic compounds, which usually degrades hardly. For this reason, their biological treatability in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants are limited, and usually they leave conventional wastewater treatment plants without having any important structural change and meet the environment. In addition, their biodegration products are usually more toxic and refracter than the original product. Nonylphenol and octylphenol ethoxylates (OPEO) are most widely used alkylphenol ethoxylates and they create important environmental problems. Nonylphenol and OPEO which used to dominate the surfactant market almost all consumption, have been the most preferred nonionic <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compound.</b> They are functionally used as cleaning and washing agents, surface active agents and foaming agents. The industrial activities use nonylphenol ethoxylates for industrial and institutional cleaning, textile auxiliaries, leather auxiliaries, emulsion polymerization, agricultural pesticides, cosmetics, cleaning products and office products such as correction fluids and ink. In this study, BPA, being among the most intensively studied, well-known endocrine disrupting compounds, as well as the nonionic surfactant OPEO (commercial name: Triton X- 45), whose metabolite octylphenol’s endocrine disrupting impact is very evident although its concentration in natural water is relatively low, was treated with sulfate (persulfate/UV-C) and hydroxyl (hydrogen peroxide/UV-C) radical-based photochemical oxidation processes in pure (distilled) and real raw freshwater samples. Within the scope of this study, the selected photochemical oxidation processes that comparatively evaluated in terms of BPA, OPEO and their organic carbon removal efficiencies and rates, as well as oxidant consumption efficiencies and rates. Besides treatment performance, dominant/effective active oxidant types were established. The major purpose was to comparatively evaluate the sulfate and hydroxyl radical-based oxidation processes more comprehensively. Moreover, the acute toxicity of the selected endocrine disrupting model pollutants and their advanced oxidation products were determined by a series of battery bioassays in which aquatic organisms selected from three different trophic levels (Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) were employed. Besides changes in their toxic effects, their estrogenic activities were followed during photochemical treatment. Within the scope of this work, it could be concluded that two advanced oxidation processes were capable of effectively/completely removing the endocrine disrupting compounds and their organic carbon content in pure as well as real freshwater. During photochemical treatment, the toxic and endocrine disrupting effects of the model pollutants generally speaking decreased gradually and could be completely eliminated. However, this was strongly related to the type of photochemical treatment process as well as sensitivity of the selected bioassay’s test organisms. Toxicity changes could be associated with the evolution of advanced oxidation products; for example the acute toxicity increased during the serial shortening of the polyethoxylate chain of the surfactant Triton X- 45, but decreased at the later stages of photochemical treatment due to the progress in complete oxidation (mineralization). Results of this experimental study showed that; distiled water and fresh water samples containing 20 mg/L BPA, 2, 5 mM oxidant PS/UV-C as well as H 2 O 2 /UV-C photochemical advanced oxidation processes could been able to effectively treat BPA (five minutes for PS/UV-C and seven minutes for H 2 O 2 /UV-C in distiled water; 20 minutes for PS/UV-C and 30 minutes for H 2 O 2 /UV-C in fresh waters). These two processes {{have been a}}ble to treat The necessery treatment durations determent in these two processes as; 5 minutes for OPEO in distiled water, 10 minutes (fresh water 1) and 20 minutes (fresh water 2) for PS/UV-C, 20 minutes (fresh water 1) and 30 minutes (fresh water 2) for H 2 O 2 /UV-C under the same conditions. For organic matter treatment yield which is showed by total organic carbon (TOC) parameter, 70 % and 84 % mineralization is reached on treatment of BPA containing distiled water within 120 minutes treatments for PS/UV-C and H 2 O 2 /UV-C processes respectively. For treatment of OPEO containing distiled water, 92 % TOC removal occurred within 120 minutes both treatment processes. In the experimental treatment of BPA, with 120 minutes treatment process 25 % (fresh water 1), 28 % (fresh water 2) TOC removal occurred for PS/UV-C process and 45 % (fresh water 1), 48 % (fresh water 2) TOC removal occurred for H 2 O 2 /UV-C process under the same conditions as above. In the experimental treatment of OPEO, at the end of 120 minutes process 74 % (fresh water 1 and fresh water 2) TOC removal occurred for PS/UV-C and 69 % (fresh water 1) 67 % (fresh water 2) TOC removal occurred for H 2 O 2 /UV-C under the same conditions as above. Toxicity test results for BPA indicated that complete detoxification was achieved after 10 min for Vibrio fischeri and 90 min for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata for PS/UV-C process and at 120 min for Vibrio fischeri, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and 60 min for Daphnia magna for H 2 O 2 /UV-C process in real raw freshwater samples, respectively. Toxicity test results indicated for OPEO that complete detoxification was achieved at 120 min for Vibrio fischeri and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata for PS/UV-C process and at 10 min for Vibrio fischeri and 120 min for Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, Daphnia magna for H 2 O 2 /UV-C process in real raw freshwater samples.

40|$|A review. Foam {{is common}} in Fe and {{steelmaking}} processes. Fe and steelmaking slags have inherent foaminess but the presence of strong <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds</b> like P 2 O 5, Cr 2 O 3, CaS, V 2 O 5, and CaF 2 make the foam more stable. Stable foam can form only {{in the presence of}} <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agents. When a bubble rises on the surface of a liquid, the film around it develops a concentration gradient of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agents such that Marangoni force acts in upward direction. This prevents liquid drainage from the film. The presence of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agents favors formation of smaller bubbles and prevents bubble rupture as well. So a strong <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> agent where ds/dc is high makes the foam very stable. When a bubble comes into contact with a solid surface, the dynamic contact angle is different from the equil. value. If the former is less than the latter, there is a resultant outward force which tries to make the bubble flat. This force is responsible for the collapse of foamy slags in the presence of large carbonaceous particles. This force is not significant for very small bubbles and is not effective when carbon particles are much smaller than the bubble...|$|R
40|$|Aerosols {{and clouds}} provide the largest {{uncertainty}} in the atmospheric radiation budget. The main focus of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} ability of organic compounds in aerosol particles to form clouds, and more specifically those emitted by living organisms. The cloud forming properties of the highly water-soluble methyltetrols and polyols, which are compounds produced by plants and fungi that are common in aerosol, were studied. All compounds and their salt mixtures have a moderate potential to serve as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). They are thus not likely to have a significant global impact on cloudiness. The potential presence of surfactants released by microorganisms was investigated for aerosols sampled at different locations. Very low surface tension values were measured for these aerosol extracts (30 mN/m), which implies that these aerosols have good CCN properties and indicate the presence of biosurfactants. Their occurrence in aerosols still needs to be confirmed directly by chemical identification. Reactions of organic compounds in sulfate salt solutions exposed to UV-light were studied and found to produce <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds.</b> Thus, mixed sulfate/organic aerosol could have more favourable CCN properties after exposure to light than when kept in the dark. The <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds</b> were proposed to be long-chained organosulfates with hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, similar to other amphiphilic surfactants. Mixtures of salt and strong surfactants formed by bacteria were studied using two different techniques for determining their CCN properties. There were inconsistencies between the two methods which could be accounted for by surface partitioning. The studied mixtures were determined to be good potential CCN material in both techniques. All these aspects require further investigation, but if the impact of strong biogenic surfactants on cloud formation is confirmed, a new link between living organisms and climate would be identified.

30|$|The {{most common}} {{practice}} in the foam destruction {{is the use of}} antifoam chemicals and mechanical foam breaking devices. However, these steps add to the complexity as well as cost of the downstream process and are insufficient for foam destruction in vigorously foaming biosurfactant systems (Winterburn and Martin 2012). Research efforts regarding biosurfactant production processes have been directed towards development of more effective downstream processes. For this reason, there is an interest in utilizing controlled foaming in biosurfactant fermentation systems through the application of foam separation techniques (Chen et al. 2006 a). One of the emerging technologies applied for this purpose leverages the native partitioning of <b>surface</b> <b>active</b> <b>compounds</b> into foam fractions during fermentation processes and is termed the foam fractionation method.
