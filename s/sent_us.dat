5|$|In 1950 North Korea invaded South Korea, {{prompting}} the United States {{to intervene in}} the name of the United Nations. President Harry S. Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. Forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also <b>sent</b> <b>U.S.</b> based troops, tanks, fighter and bomber aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization New Jersey was recalled from the mothball fleet to provide seaborne artillery support for U.N. and South Korean troops. New Jersey was recommissioned at Bayonne on 21 November 1950, Captain David M. Tyree in command, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she welded her crew into an efficient body which would meet the demanding requirements of the Korean War. She sailed from Norfolk, Virginia 16 April 1951 and arrived from Japan off the east coast of Korea 17 May. Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin, commanding the United States Seventh Fleet, placed his flag in New Jersey for the next six months.|$|E

25|$|In 1857-1858, President James Buchanan <b>sent</b> <b>U.S.</b> {{forces to}} the Utah Territory in {{what became known as}} the Utah Expedition. The Mormons, fearful that the large U.S. {{military}} force had been sent to annihilate them and having faced persecution in other areas, made preparations for defense. Though bloodshed was to be avoided, and the U.S. government also hoped that its purpose might be attained without the loss of life, both sides prepared for war. The Mormons manufactured or repaired firearms, turned scythes into bayonets, and burnished and sharpened long-unused sabres.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 1832, Jackson {{signed into}} law the Tariff of 1832. It was {{designed}} to placate the nullifiers by lowering tariff rates, but the nullifiers in South Carolina remained unsatisfied. On November 24, the South Carolina legislature officially nullified both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828. In response, Jackson <b>sent</b> <b>U.S.</b> Navy warships to Charleston harbor, and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession. On December 28, 1832, with {{less than two months}} remaining in his term, Calhoun resigned as Vice President to become a U.S. Senator for South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|Before Bolling could {{actually}} take command of his unit, he was detached in June 1917 for staff duty. French premier Alexandre Ribot had <b>sent</b> <b>U.S.</b> President Woodrow Wilson a telegram {{at the end}} of May urging the United States to contribute 4,500 aircraft; 5,000 pilots; and 50,000 mechanics to the war effort. Because of his legal experience Bolling was assigned to assist in the drafting of legislation to fund the development of military aviation in response to Ribot's proposal. The subsequent Aviation Act (40 Stat. 243), passed July 24, 1917, was the largest single appropriation for a single purpose to that time, $640 million.|$|E

500|$|Warren denies {{claims of}} an imitation, noting the {{discrepancies}} between the production schedules: when Inseminoid entered the shooting stage, Alien, {{which had been}} filmed in closed studios, had been released months before. While the director accepts the often [...] "uncanny" [...] similarities between the two films, he states that Alien distributors 20th Century Fox discounted the possibility of derivation after watching the final cut of Inseminoid: [...] "... in fact, the head of Fox <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> a very nice letter saying how much he enjoyed the film and wished us luck with the release ... I find it flattering that anyone can compare Alien, which cost {{in the region of}} $30million, with Inseminoid which cost less than £1million. We must have done something right." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film has}} also been said to be {{inspired}} by The Devotion of Suspect X, a Japanese novel written by Keigo Higashino. Ekta Kapoor, who had purchased the Hindi movie rights of the novel, sent a legal notice to the makers of the film. However, the director clarified, [...] "After Ekta's legal team <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> the letter, I watched the Japanese film, Suspect X, which is an adaptation of the Japanese novel. There could be similarities between my film and that Japanese film, but my film is neither an adaptation nor a copy. The Japanese film is also about a murder cover-up and hence the allegation. Similarities are quite common {{in the works of}} creators and that shouldn't be made into an issue." [...] Rashomon (1950) was also cited as an inspiration for the film.|$|E

[...] "Originally we were on holiday in Hong Kong and had an awful situation, as we were in an active pitch for a famous band and we didn't like the music," [...] Knight said. [...] "We were sent a track which had this awful DRM attached and it was frustrating us trying to play it through dial-up connection. Someone else <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> another track which was a simple MP3." [...] Tanaka eventually {{came up with the}} idea of a ball that [...] "connected through things". Knight didn't quite understand the idea at first, but through a process of miscommunication, they wrote the video's treatment about [...] "a crazy basketball" [...] which was the quickest treatment they had ever written at the time.|$|E

[...] Later, while MacLeod trains Richie roughly so that he can face Immortal Annie Devlin (Sheena Easton), Richie angrily tells MacLeod, [...] "You can't get past it, Mac. I know.

Very casually I told him that John wasn’t really in and that <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> both into hysterics. We were laughing and chatting. I made a nice lunch for Marianne and a bunch of her friends but they never showed up. Paul and I sat together and ate it instead. I’ll never forget the meal – it was chicken casserole. It was such a funny introduction that it threw us both off guard. It could have been very embarrassing, but there was an immediate rapport and we just couldn’t stop talking.” ...|$|E

500|$|Lead singer Raine Maida {{first brought}} {{up the idea of}} a concept album after {{excerpts}} from the book began influencing his songwriting. Passing time on the road, he had amassed a backlog of songs and had begun to record demos. He jokingly suggested an album title of Kurzweil. [...] "That was not the most graceful sounding name in the world, so we went with Spiritual Machines instead," [...] Turner said. While the other band-members were less enthusiastic about the idea due to its weighty subject matter, Maida and Turner decided to pursue it and Turner contacted Ray Kurzweil via email to ask for permission to use the title of his book for their project. Kurzweil's excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album and a correspondence developed. “I think it’s amazing that Ray Kurzweil <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> a bunch of pieces, and for whatever reason, they really tie in with {{what we were trying to}} say on this record,” said Maida.|$|E

In response, Jackson <b>sent</b> <b>U.S.</b> Navy warships to Charleston harbor, and threatened to hang Calhoun or any man who worked to support nullification or secession. Tensions eased after both sides agreed to the Compromise Tariff of 1833 on March 2, which was proposed by Henry Clay, now a senator, to change the tariff law {{in a way that}} satisfied Calhoun, who by then was in the Senate. On the same day, Congress passed the Force Bill, which empowered the President of the United States to use military force to ensure state compliance with federal law. South Carolina accepted the tariff, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill. In Calhoun's speech against the Force Bill, delivered on February 5, 1833, no longer as vice president, he strongly endorsed nullification, at one point saying: ...|$|E
500|$|McMahon {{commented that}} the SIS {{had a history of}} [...] "furnish {{unreliable}} information on the IRA's foreign intrigues." [...] Yet, these past failures were ignored as the reports reinforced the fears of invasion. MaMahon suggested that [...] "It is even possible that the plans discovered in Holland were planted. Whether deliberate deception or not, British intelligence was well and truly deceived." [...] Historian Eunan O'Halpin argued that while the Dutch document could be seen as a British fabrication, [...] "it is now known... that German deception operations prepared in anticipation of Operation 'Sealion' included the manufacturing of rumours and stories of plans to attack Ireland as a feint during the build up to an invasion of Southern England." [...] Nicholas Mansergh commented that [...] "Ireland had no place" [...] in the initial Sealion plans, and it was not until 3 December 1940 that German planners even looked at the possibility before concluding that such an operation was not possible or if launched would result in failure. In his memoirs, Carton De Wiart commented [...] "I can never believe the Germans had any intention of invading Ireland but I am very grateful for any reason which <b>sent</b> <b>us</b> there, for it was an ideal training ground for troops and the division improved enormously from the moment of our arrival." ...|$|E
