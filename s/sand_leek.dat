50|$|The <b>sand</b> <b>leek</b> is a {{perennial}} plant with an egg-shaped bulb. The plant produces {{two to five}} unstalked leaves, the bases of which are sheath-like. Each leaf blade is linear, 7-20 mm wide, flat with a slight keel, an entire margin and parallel veins. The edges of the leaf and the central vein are rough to the touch. The flowering stem is cylindrical, growing to a height of 30 to 90 cm and the upper half is leafless. The whole plant has an onion-like aroma. The inflorescence is a globular cluster surrounded by membranous bracts in bud which wither when the flowers open. Each individual flower is stalked and has a purple perianth 4 to 7 mm long. There are six tepals, six stamens and a pistil formed from three fused carpels. Mixed with the flowers {{are a number of}} purple bulbils. The fruit is a capsule, but the seeds seldom set, and propagation usually takes place when the bulbils are knocked off and grow into new plants.|$|E
