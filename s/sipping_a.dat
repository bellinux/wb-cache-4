500|$|The video {{begins with}} a tribute and sample of the opening credits of Leave It to Beaver which is overdubbed to {{introduce}} Knowles as [...] "B.B. Homemaker" [...] in a Daisy Dukes style outfit. The song begins once she goes inside a house and brings along a board saying [...] "Why Don't You Love Me". Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running down her cheeks while {{talking on the phone}} to her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while <b>sipping</b> <b>a</b> cocktail and French-inhaling a cigarette in the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on what happens in the video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career. The video closes on her falling to the floor after hanging up the phone and finishing her martini, and says the final word [...] "...dumb!" [...] in a scene in which she is dressed in a dominatrix-type outfit while holding a whip.|$|E

40|$|Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) {{is known}} to be closely {{associated}} with atherosclerosis, and {{it is one of the}} sources of oxidized cellular injury. Previous studies show that ox-LDL affects platelet aggregation. We studied the effects of ox-LDL on shear-induced platelet aggregation (SIPA) and compared it with native LDL. Methods: We incubated ox-LDL with LDL and CuSO_ 4 for 16 hours at 37 ℃. We incubated platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with ox-LDL or native LDL, and measured <b>SIP</b> <b>A.</b> And we compared the effect of ox-LDL to PRP with and without <b>SIP</b> <b>A.</b> Results: Ox-LDL increased low SIPA but not high <b>SIP</b> <b>A,</b> and the effect was concentration-dependent Native LDL had no effect on SIPA. The effect of ox-LDL on low SIPA started at very low concentrations compared to aggregation without SIPA. Electron microscopy clearly demonstrated the effect of ox-LDL on low SIPA. Conclusion: Ox-LDL increased low SIPA in a concentration-dependent manner. Resent studies have demonstrated that low shear stress increases ox-LDL receptors. Low shear stress might increase these receptors on platelets, and, as a result of this, ox-LDL enhanced low SIPA in this study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We prove a {{comparison}} inequality between {{a system of}} independent random walkers and a system of random walkers which interact by attracting each other-a process which we call here the symmetric inclusion process (<b>SIP).</b> <b>As</b> an application, correlation inequalities for the SIP, {{as well as for}} a model of heat conduction, the so-called Brownian momentum process, are obtained. These inequalities are counterparts of the inequalities (in the opposite direction) for the symmetric exclusion process, showing that the <b>SIP</b> is <b>a</b> natural bosonic analogue of the symmetric exclusion process, which is fermionic. We discuss stationary measures of the <b>SIP,</b> and <b>an</b> asymmetric version that has the same stationary probability measures, as well as infinite non-translation invariant reversible measures. Finally, we consider a boundary driven version of the SIP for which we prove duality and correlation inequalities. ...|$|R
