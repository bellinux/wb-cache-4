50|$|The {{simplest}} machine carder is {{the drum}} carder. Most drum carders are hand-cranked {{but some are}} powered by electric motor. These machines generally have two rollers, or drums, covered with card clothing. The licker-in, or smaller roller meters fibre from the infeed tray onto the larger <b>storage</b> <b>drum.</b> The two rollers are connected to each other by a belt- or chain-drive so that their relative speeds cause the <b>storage</b> <b>drum</b> to gently pull fibres from the licker-in. This pulling straightens the fibres and lays them between the wire pins of the <b>storage</b> <b>drum's</b> card cloth. Fibre is added until the <b>storage</b> <b>drum's</b> card cloth is full. A gap in the card cloth facilitates removal of the batt when the card cloth is full.|$|R

50|$|When a {{low-speed}} deflagration occurs {{within a}} closed vessel or structure, pressure effects can produce damage due to expansion of gases as a secondary effect.

The risks of deflagration inside waste <b>storage</b> <b>drums</b> is a growing concern in storage facilities.|$|E

50|$|Modern cable ships differ {{greatly from}} their predecessors. There {{are two main}} types of cable ships: cable repair ships and cable-laying ships. Cable repair ships, like the Japanese Tsugaru Maru, tend to be smaller and more maneuverable; {{they are capable of}} laying cable, but their primary job is fixing or {{repairing}} broken sections of cable. A cable-laying ship, like the Long Lines, is designed to lay new cables. Such ships are bigger than repair ships and less maneuverable; their cable <b>storage</b> <b>drums</b> are also larger and are set in parallel so one drum can feed into another, allowing them to lay cable much faster. These ships are also generally equipped with a liner cable engine (LCE) that helps them lay cable quickly.|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the feasibility to employ remote sensing for the characterization of the contents of liquid chemical waste <b>storage</b> <b>drums.</b> Philipson et al. (1981) had found that, when the air temperature is changing rapidly, differences in the thermal inertia of the drum contents can lead to detectable differences in the skin temperature of the drums. Thus, postsunset, airborne thermal remote sensing could potentially provide some level of discrimination among chemical <b>storage</b> <b>drums.</b> Discrimination should be possible among steel drums filled largely with: (1) aqueous solvents, (2) organic solvents, or (3) clay packing materials. The response of a drum filled with clay packing materials should be similar to that of an empty drum. The reported study had the objective to verify the theoretical findings, taking into account the use of a hand-held infrared radiometer. It was found that under the proper conditions the temperature differences among drums with the three different types of contents will be significant and consistent...|$|E

Allthe 48 storage devices were in constant use for over 6 months and were used to continually harvest rainwaterfor domestic uses. 40 drinking tap water samples were also analyzed alongside the rainwater as control.

A comparison of the two storage containers shows a highly significant increase (P= 0. 0003) in the rainwater stored in the plastic containers compared to that in metal containers. BPA tends to be highlyincreased in rainwater in the region, possibly due to increased industrialization, with greater amount in samplesstored in plastic containers than that stored in metal containers.

40|$|The Radioactive Scrap and Waste Facility Liner-by-Liner Characterization Project was {{initiated}} to support waste management planning and disposition {{activities at the}} Materials and Fuels Complex located at the Idaho National Laboratory. The project scope consisted of a detailed examination of available historical records to consolidate information and eliminate discrepancies between sources. This information was captured in a new comprehensive searchable online database dubbed Sealion (Searchable Liner Online). For each storage liner and associated waste container, Sealion tracks the physical configuration, radiological data (e. g., source term, transuranic content, fissile content, and direct gamma radiation reading), Resource Conservation and Recovery Act characterization data, contents descriptions, {{and a variety of}} other waste management data. Historical hard-copy records were scanned and are stored in the database for easy access. In addition to storing the consolidated data in a library for easy retrieval or linking, Sealion serves as a tool in the development of batching plans for retrieving, transporting, processing, and, ultimately, dispositioning the waste. An integral search function allows the user to query for a variety of parameters in order to plan custom batches and account for facility or regulatory limitations (e. g., U. S. Department of Transportation limits, hazard category determinations, and fissile gram equivalent limitations). Liners can be combined or batched together and the combined results displayed in real-time graphs and tables showing the cumulative characteristics. The basic database architecture has proven to be adaptable to a variety of other similar applications. Sealion is capable of tracking segmented inventories (i. e., the liners can be replaced with <b>storage</b> <b>drums,</b> racks in a warehouse, or grids overlaid on a landfill). Additionally, the batching functions allow for the ability to combine inventory sub-locations into real-time graphs that summarize the characteristics of the contents for ease in comparison of characteristics to established thresholds or decision-making modeling needed to support waste-management operations...|$|E
40|$|Water {{quality and}} {{availability}} are important issues {{in many developing}} countries where portions of populations still lack access to potable water. Throughout the English-speaking Caribbean and parts of Latin America, households and businesses invest in water supply systems even when they are connected to and pay for water services from a private or state owned provider. Inconsistent supplies of water from the water companies have led many people to invest in storage tanks which, if operated correctly, can provide water throughout the day even when the supply from the main is low or zero. While these individual systems help to guarantee a more constant supply of water, they may impact water quality when it does reach the household tap. The tanks could become breeding grounds for vectors of human disease and may also affect the concentrations of bacteria, heavy metals and organics in the water. The goal of this research was to understand how households use water storage tanks and determine the effect of these tanks and the individual practices on water quality. Target plots were used to visualize linkages between water quality parameters and household surveys of localized water practices and perception on water quality. The study focused on three field sites: Siparia, Trinidad and Tobago, Region 4 Subset in Guyana, and Villa Litoral, Bolivia. Convenience sampling was used to administer surveys to households in the rural areas of Siparia (39), Region 4 Subset (40), and Villa Litoral (57). The Region 4 Subset is comprised of two rural areas, Mon Repos and Mocha, and Georgetown, the country 2 ̆ 7 s capital. Black, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tanks and water <b>storage</b> <b>drums</b> are predominantly used in the field sites within Siparia and Region 4 Subset, while cement tanks, drums, and jerry cans are used in Villa Litoral. The average age of household water storage devices was 4 - 10 years in Siparia and Region 4 Subset, and 0 - 3 years in Villa Litoral. These devices were found on various elevations to accommodate piped connection, indoor pumping, and rainwater catchment. Cleaning frequency of tanks in Siparia was every few months, while in Region 4 Subset it varied from weekly to every few months. In Villa Litoral 26. 3...|$|E
