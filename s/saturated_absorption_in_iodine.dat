40|$|Abstract − This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the investigation of uncertainties achievable through stabilization of lasers using <b>saturated</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>in</b> <b>iodine</b> vapour. The main {{focus is on the}} iodine cell technology and evaluation. We present results from two independent methods for the measurement of the purity of molecular iodine in absorption cells. The purity was tested by improved method based on measurement of induced fluorescence and evaluation by the Stern-Volmer formula. Original measurement setup was upgraded with a system for compensation of unwanted effects of back-reflected and scattered light and multimode regime of the pumping laser. The modified arrangement results in a significant improvement of reproducibility. The evaluation of absolute frequency shifts caused by iodine cells was measured by direct frequency comparison of iodine-stabilized frequency doubled Nd:YAG lasers. The absolute frequency shift of a reference laser system was calibrated by frequency comparison with a stabilized optical comb locked to the radiofrequency etalon, the measuring system consists of a commercial laser and our stabilization system with 3 f technique. Correct function of the stabilization setup was verified through the evaluation of the Allan standard deviations. A series of measurements with a special refillable iodine cell was conducted on both experimental setups for three various levels of impurities. Results of both methods are in a very good correlation and show very high purity of iodine in measured cells. The results also help for definition of procedures for improving iodine cell manufacturin...|$|E

In this study, we generated two beams emitting photon energy means of 42 and 50 keV respectively, from a conventional 225 kV X-ray source. Viability assays performed after pre-exposure to 10 μM of IUdR for 48 h suggest that complex lethal damage is generated after low energy photons irradiation compared to 137 Cs irradiation (662 KeV). To further decipher the molecular mechanisms leading to IUdR-mediated radiosensitization, we analyzed the content of DNA damage-induced foci in two glioblastoma cell lines and showed that the decrease in survival under these conditions was correlated with an increase in the content of DNA damage-induced foci in cell lines. Moreover, the follow-up of repair kinetics of the induced double-strand breaks showed the maximum delay in cells labeled with IUdR and exposed to X-ray irradiation. Thus, {{there appears to be a}} direct relationship between the reduction of radiation survival parameters and the production of DNA damage with impaired repair of these breaks.

The study of the. hYperfine structure of 129 I 2 opti-cal absorption lines is of great interest not only be-cause of its implication in laser frequency stabilization I 1] {{but also because of}} the information on such pa-rameters as the nuclear quadrupole moment which can be deduced from a comparison with a similar study on the natural isotopic variety 127 i 2 " As is well known, the B ~-X transition <b>in</b> the <b>iodine</b> molecule gives rise to a very rich rovibronic absorption spectrum throughout the visible region, with a density of some five lines per cm - 1 [2]. Observation of hyper-fine structure splittings, narrower than the Doppler width, calls for some kind of sub-Doppler technique. Two of them were used in the present study. The re-sults for 127 I 2 were deduced from experiments on laser induced fluorescence of a collimated supersonic molecular beam, performed in collaboration with Churassy et al.

RebelloOver {{the past}} 20 years {{there have been}} limited efforts to improve students’ {{interest}} and knowledge of electronics and to offer students experiences to integrate and apply their knowledge of electronics with experimental physics. None of the reform efforts cited in the literature have performed a careful assessment of student learning and attitudes, {{and most of them}} report anecdotal success. These programs share several commonalities. They typically have a capstone project experience in which students apply their knowledge and skills in electronics and instrumentation to a particular context. The KSU Physics Department has embarked on an endeavor to improve the PMI (Physical Measurement and Instrumentation) class taken by physics majors. Capstone project experiences for students in PMI will provide them with an opportunity to revisit experiments they completed in previous courses. They then apply the knowledge and skills in electronics and instrumentation learned {{at the beginning of the}} PMI course to automate these experiments. The use of LabVIEW and NI ELVIS provides a range of opportunities to students due to their visual interface and easy learning curve. However, they do have some disadvantages such as speed and resolution when compared to more traditional measurements with oscilloscopes. Three specific capstone experiences have been developed in PMI. These include <b>saturated</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>in</b> Rubidium, the Franck-Hertz experiment, and the speed of light measurement.

Comparing data from traditional experiments and those from automated using LabVIEW and NI ELVIS provides a context in which to discuss the trade-offs between the traditional and automated experiments.

The oblique shock produced at the plate leading edge impinged on the detached bow shock wave produced by the cylinder. The symmetry plane in the flow was studied using a laser sheet-beam probe from a narrow-bandwidth laser source, which induced fluorescence <b>in</b> <b>iodine</b> molecules seeded <b>in</b> the gas. Fluorescence patterns produced by the sheet-beam were recorded by a charge-coupled device camera as the laser frequency was tuned in increments over a range spanning two distinct <b>absorption</b> lines <b>in</b> the <b>iodine</b> spectrum. The fluorescence intensity-versus-laser excitation frequency data recorded at each pixel was least-squares fitted to a nonequilibrium model of the iodine spectrum to estimate local translational and rotational temperature, velocity, and density. Contour plots of these results are presented at a resolution equal to roughly one mean-free-path of the oncoming flow at the plate leading edge. Profile plots of translational and rotational temperature on the plate are presented...|$|R

40|$|The Comment {{discusses}} {{an important}} problem of <b>saturated</b> <b>absorption</b> spectroscopy on {{the width of}} nonlinear <b>absorption</b> resonance <b>in</b> low-pressure gases in the standing-wave field. The conclusions of references [1 - 3] are erroneous, according to which, with small saturations, the resonance width is, within a constant factor, the inverse of the transit time of an atom with thermal velocity through the light beam. A careful treatment of this problem given in supplement agrees with earlier works [5 - 9]...|$|R
