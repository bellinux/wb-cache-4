The First Minister, Scottish cabinet ministers and Law officers <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row, in the middle section of the chamber. The largest party in the Parliament sits {{in the middle of}} the semicircle, with opposing parties on either side. The Presiding Officer, parliamentary clerks and officials sit opposite members at the front of the debating chamber.|$|E
5|$|On special occasions, such as Uposatha day, {{an orange}} stole is placed around its {{shoulders}} by the presiding monk and is fanned. A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals; some men <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> enclosure while others including {{women and children}} sit {{in the middle and}} rear end of the foyer. Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed. During the winter season, the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the music video {{is based on the}} lyrics and {{presented}} as a typical Friday for Black. She wakes up and goes to school, meeting her friends on the way. In the evening, after debating whether to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> or back of a convertible, Black and her friends ride the car to a party at 7:45 pm. Patrice Wilson appears {{near the end of the}} song to deliver a short rap. The video was shot on January 6, 2011 at Black's father's house with friends and family as extras, and requiring multiple takes over 12 hours. Some of those extras became stars in their own right; her friends Benni Cinkle, Amanda Cooper and Hayley Grodt. Ark Music, according to Black's parents, cautioned them and her that they should not expect her to become famous. Black hoped that her friends and family would enjoy watching the video on YouTube and that it would perhaps help her to later begin a singing career.|$|E

It was agreed that Reid would be paid for his services at normal flight instruction rates, plus compensation for the layover time.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, calling it [...] "one of those rare movies where I wanted to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row and let the images wash out {{to the edges of}} my field of vision". Broadway star Nathan Lane, who was the voice of Timon the meerkat in The Lion King, has said Finding Nemo was his {{favorite}} animated film. Ed Park of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's an ocean of eye candy that tastes fresh even in this ADD-addled era of SpongeBob SquarePants." [...] Mark Caro of the Chicago Tribune gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "You connect to these sea creatures as you rarely do with humans in big-screen adventures. The result: a true sunken treasure." [...] Hazel-Dawn Dumpert of L.A. Weekly gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "As gorgeous a film as Disney's ever put out, with astonishing qualities of light, movement, surface and color at the service of the best professional imaginations money can buy." [...] Jeff Strickler of the Star Tribune gave the film a positive review, saying it [...] "proves that even when Pixar is not at the top of its game, it still produces better animation than some of its competitors on their best days." [...] Gene Seymour of Newsday gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "The underwater backdrops take your breath away. No, really. They're so lifelike, you almost feel like holding your breath while watching." [...] Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Parental anxiety may not be the kind of stuff children's films are usually made of, but this perfectly enchanting movie knows how to cater to its kiddie audience without condescending to them." ...|$|E
500|$|Kingda Ka's over-the-shoulder {{restraint}} system {{consists of a}} thick, rigid lap bar and two thin, flexible over-the-shoulder restraints. Because the over-the-shoulder portions of the restraint are not rigid, the hand grips are mounted to the lap bar. Kingda Ka's restraints are also held down by a belt, in case the main locking system fails. To speed loading, riders are asked to secure their own restraints if possible.Kingda Ka's station has two parallel tracks, with switch tracks at the entrance and exit. Each of the station's tracks is designed to accommodate two trains, so {{each of the four}} trains can be operated from its own station. While all of the trains are mechanically identical and able to load and unload at each of the four individual station bays the original plan was for all trains to operate {{at the same time and}} for each train to load and unload at their own station. During normal operation, trains on one side are loaded while trains on the other side are launched. When both sides of the station are in use an employee directs riders in line to go to a particular side, where they can choose to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> or rear of the train. During recent seasons it has become common that only one train bay (the forward one on the side opposite of the parking lot) be used for the loading, unloading, and dispatching of trains and that the other train or trains in operation on any given day wait either in the station behind a loading/unloading train or outside of the station on the brakes that follow the second hill. Two operators load, check and dispatch each train; another launches the trains. Kingda Ka's music is by Safri Duo; almost their entire Episode II album is played in the queue and station. The other is the remix version of Survivor's [...] "Eye of the Tiger", played by DJ Quicksilver. Both of these may be heard during the queue and in the station.|$|E

Heffer made a good-humoured complaint when political journalist Andrew Roth described Doris as [...] "tiny", insisting that she was actually [...] "petite". According to the diaries of Giles Radice, Doris Heffer would <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row of the audience when Heffer was speaking, saying, [...] "Nonsense, Eric" [...] if he said something with which she disagreed.

2500|$|Various officers—clerks {{and other}} officials—sit at the Table, ready {{to advise the}} Speaker on {{procedure}} when necessary. Members of the Government sit on the benches on the Speaker's right, while members of the Official Opposition occupy the benches on the Speaker's left. Members are assigned seating {{on the basis of}} the seniority in a party caucus; Government ministers sit around the Prime Minister, who is traditionally assigned the fourth seat along the front row on the Speaker's right-hand side. The Opposition leader sits directly across from the Prime Minister and is surrounded by Opposition spokespersons. The remaining party leaders <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> rows.

60|$|When {{he gave up}} his {{attempts}} {{with a sigh of}} despair, he had leisure to look around him. The sledge was gliding on with railway speed. One or two solitary hummocks that looked like white sentinels on the level plain, went past him with an awful rush, and several undulations caused by snow-drift were crossed in a light leap which he barely felt. Benjy was fully aware of his danger. To meet with a hummock no bigger than a wheelbarrow, would, in the circumstances, have entailed destruction; he therefore seized a pole which formed part of the sledge-gear, and tried steering. It could be done, but with great difficulty, as he had to <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the sledge to keep it down.|$|E
