[...] The McKinleys traveled by train to Lewiston, where they switched to trolleys to view the Niagara Gorge. [...] When the party reached the municipality of Niagara Falls, they transferred to carriages to see the sights. [...] The party rode halfway across the Honeymoon Bridge overlooking the Falls, though McKinley was careful not to enter Canada for reasons of protocol. [...] It was a hot day, and Ida McKinley felt ill due to the heat; she was driven to the International Hotel to await her husband, who toured Goat Island before joining his wife for lunch. [...] After smoking a cigar on the veranda, the President rode with his wife to the train which now awaited them nearby, and saw her settled there before touring the hydroelectric plant at the Falls. [...] The train then returned to Buffalo so McKinley could attend the reception at the Temple of Music. [...] Ida McKinley had originally intended to accompany her husband to the auditorium, but as she was not fully recovered, she decided to return to the Milburn House to rest. [...] As the time allotted for the reception had been pared down to ten minutes, the President did not expect to be separated from his wife for long. [...] As it was only 3:30p.m., McKinley stopped for refreshments at the Mission Building before proceeding to the Temple of Music.|$|E
