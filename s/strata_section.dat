40|$|Recent {{advances}} in computer simulation together with field measurements of caving and microseismic activity about longwall panels, has allowed {{a much better}} understanding of the caving process and the variability due to geology. The joint research between SCT Operations and CSIRO Division of Exploration and Mining has initiated new methods of computational modelling predicting various caving patterns and strata failure far ahead of the longwall face. This work was validated by field measurements of caving and microseismic activity at the longwall face. The rock fracture distribution and the caving characteristics of a range of <b>strata</b> <b>sections</b> have been simulated by computer methods. Validation studies of the method were addressed together with case studies. The interaction of caving with support convergence and face control is presented. The method allows the simulation of longwall support behaviour under various geological conditions.

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{analysis}} of the monitoring data of an offshore sand mining area in the Pear River estuary, the submarine geomorphy of the mining area can be classified into four types, namely shore, coarse sand mining pit, smooth sand mining pit and semi-deep terrain. From the sub-bottom profiles, it can be found that the four types represent four stage processes of sand mining, of which the most direct impact is the change of water depth, geomorphy and shallow sediment. Coarse granule sediments of autochthonous deposit cause strong reflection in the seabed surface and reduce the penetrating power of seismic wave. However, fine particles like clay and silt become suspended solids and gradually deposit, forming a smooth sediment surface of weak reflection and an illuvial horizon that can be penetrated by the seismic wave of shallow <b>stratum</b> <b>section</b> plotter, after being away from the sand mining center in a certain distance. Carry out research on four stratigraphic profiles representing the sand mining process that are selected from the testing zone and conduct analysis description on the sedimentation process of the sand mining area. By comparing topographic monitoring data of March in 2009 and that of September in 2010, the annually variation diagram of sedimentation can be acquired. There is more sedimentation in low-lying places. The thickest sedimentation is 3 m. Yet the annually sedimentary thickness is less than 1 m in the broad semi-deep water area that is more that 0. 5 km away from the depocenter.

40|$|Abstract: Integrated ä 13 C chemostratigraphy and {{sequence}} stratigraphy are developed for {{a succession of}} Vendian <b>strata</b> (Nokhtuisk <b>section)</b> on the southern margin of the Siberian platform. The carbonates exhibit secular variations in ä 13 C and at least three major depositional sequences that encompass the last c. 20 million years (< 565 – 545 Ma) of Vendian time. Correlation of these events with key sections in eastern Siberia reveals the development of three cratonic sequences that partition the Vendian System of Siberia into high-resolution time slices (third-order sequences). The third-order events form a larger depositional sequence, which is correlated with greater confidence on a global-scale. With the aid of global chemostratigraphic constraints, the second-order sequence in Siberia is interpreted to represent the youngest {{of at least two}} sequences of eustatic origin that span the latest 60 million years of terminal Neoproterozoic time. Evidence for repeated glaciations in many basins at this time provides a plausible mechanism for the third-order cratonic sequences in Siberia. However, eVects due to sea-floor spreading related to the break-up of the supercontinent Rodinia are invoked as the primary mechanism for the longer-term, second-order sea-level fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The Upper Cretaceous to Eocene Montgomery Creek Formation {{is exposed}} between the Klamath and Cascade Mountains in the {{vicinity}} of Big Bend and Montgomery Creek, northern California. The formation is divided into a northern and a southern section. The rocks consist of a basal conglomerate succeeded by feldspathic to lithic graywackes, conglomerates, shales, carbonaceous shales, and minor lignites. The northern section is 3, 188 feet thick. Fining upward point bar deposits, abundant foreset- and cross-bedding, and thick flood-basin deposits indicate the northen <b>section</b> <b>strata</b> were deposited by meandering rivers. Carbonaceous shales, lignites and fossil leaves define the swamps that were present in the basins. The southern section is 4, 596 feet thick. Thick and laterally extensive sandstone bodies, numerous conglomerate interbeds, and abundant planar cross-bedding suggest that these strata were deposited by braided rivers. A few outcrops low in the section resemble the northern <b>section</b> <b>strata,</b> and are interpreted to be meandering river deposits. A progressive change in composition of the sandstones from the base {{to the top of the}} formation occurs in both the northern and southern sections. This reflects the change from metamorphic and plutonic source rocks of the Klamath Mountains to volcanic source rocks of the early Cascade Range. The southern section maintains a more lithic-rich composition, reflecting higher discharge rates and steeper gradients responsible for braided-river deposition. Paleocurrent readings from foreset bedding and imbricated pebbles indicate a north-to-south transport direction in most of both sections. Some westerly transport occurred high in the southern <b>section.</b> Eocene <b>strata</b> four miles north of the northern section reflect a meandering river depositional environment. These strata have a higher shale-to-sandstone ratio, larger proportions of carbonaceous shales and coal, and a different sandstone mineralogy than Eocene rocks to the south. Analysis revealed that the Montgomery Creek Formation carbonaceous shales and coal are sufficiently rich in organic carbon to be hydrocarbon source rocks. Most of the samples are thermally immature, but could produce gas through bacterial-fungal breakdown of organic matter. The Eocene sandstones have adequate porosity and permeability to be petroleum reservoir rocks. The Klamath Mountains acted as a source area for Cretaceous marine deposits in basins north and south of the study area.

The Susong section (Lower Yangtze Sedimentary Province) comprises {{a range of}} carbonate and mudstone facies that record overall shallowing from offshore to intertidal settings. The Tianshengqiao section (Upper Yangtze Sedimentary Province) consists of mixed carbonate and siliciclastic facies deposited in shallow marine to offshore settings. Griesbachian to Dienerian ichnological records in both sections are characterized by low ichnodiversity, low ichnofabric indices (1 – 2) and low bedding plane bioturbation indices (1 – 2). Higher ichnofabric indices (3 and 4), corresponding to a dense population of diminutive ichnotaxon, in the Tianshengqiao section suggest opportunistic infaunal biotic activity during the earliest Triassic. Ichnological data from the Susong section show an increase in ichnodiversity during the late Smithian with 11 ichnogenera identified and increased ichnofabric indices of 4 – 5 and bedding plane bioturbation indices of 3 – 5. Although complex traces such as Rhizocorallium are present in Spathian-aged <b>strata</b> in this <b>section,</b> low ichnodiversity and ichnofabric indices and diminutive Planolites suggest a decline in recovery. In the Tianshengqiao section, ichnofabric indices are moderate to high (3 – 5) although only six ichnogenera are present and Planolites burrows are consistently small in Smithian and Spathian strata. Complex traces, such as large Rhizocorallium and Thalassinoides, and large Planolites, did not appear until the Anisian. Ichnological results from both sections record the response of organisms to unfavourable environmental conditions although the Susong section shows earlier recovery during the Smithian prior to latest Smithian–Spathian decline. This decline may have resulted from a resurgence of euxinic to anoxic marine environment in various regions of South China. Ichnological data from the Tianshengqiao section indicate protracted recovery throughout the Early Triassic as previously found elsewhere in South China. Comparison of the South China trace fossil records with global ichnological data show a diachronous pattern of recovery of trace makers and highlights the heterogeneous development of oxic facies on the marked variation in recovery rate...|$|R
40|$|Paleovalleys {{associated}} with the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian unconformity {{have been identified as}} potential targets for hydrocarbon exploration in the Illinois Basin. Though there is little literature addressing the geologic factors controlling hydrocarbon accumulation in sub-Pennsylvanian paleovalleys basin-wide, much work has been done to identify the Mississippian-Pennsylvanian unconformity, characterize the Chesterian and basal Pennsylvanian lithology, map the sub-Pennsylvanian paleogeology and delineate the pre-Pennsylvanian paleovalleys in the Illinois Basin. This study uses Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to determine the geologic factors controlling the distribution of hydrocarbon-bearing sub-Pennsylvanian paleovalley fill in the Illinois Basin. A methodology was developed to identify densely-drilled areas without associated petroleum occurrence in basal Pennsylvanian paleovalley fill. Kernel density estimation was used to approximate drilling activity throughout the basin and identify “hotspots” of high well density. Pennsylvanian oil and gas fields were compared to the hotspots to identify which areas were most likely unrelated to Pennsylvanian production. Those hotspots were then compared to areas with known hydrocarbon accumulations in sub-Pennsylvanian paleovalleys to determine what varies geologically amongst these locations. Geologic differences provided insight regarding the spatial distribution of hydrocarbon-bearing sub-Pennsylvanian paleovalleys in the Illinois Basin. It was found that the distribution of hydrocarbon-bearing paleovalleys in the Illinois Basin follows structural features and faults. In the structurally dominated portions of the Illinois Basin, especially in eastern Illinois along the La Salle Anticlinal Belt, hydrocarbons migrate into paleovalleys from underlying hydrocarbon-rich sub- Pennsylvanian paleogeology. Along the fault-dominated areas, such as the Wabash, Rough Creek and Pennyrile Fault Zones, migration occurs upwards along faults from deeper sources. Cross sections were made {{to gain a better understanding}} of the paleovalley reservoir and to assess the utility of using all the data collected in this study to locate paleovalley reservoirs. The Main Consolidated Field in Crawford County, Illinois, was chosen as the best site for subsurface mapping due to its high well density, associated Pennsylvanian production, and locally incised productive Chesterian <b>strata.</b> Four cross <b>sections</b> revealed a complex paleovalley reservoir with many potential pay zones. The methodology used to locate this paleovalley reservoir can be applied to other potential sites within the Illinois Basin and to other basins as well...|$|R
40|$|The Elgin Member of the Upper Ordovician (Katian) Maquoketa Formation of Iowa {{contains}} phosphorite beds {{consisting of}} millimeter-scale phosphatic fossils, primarily steinkerns. Similar beds {{occur in the}} coeval strata of the classic Cincinnatian Series around the Cincinnati, Ohio area. Initial sampling of the phosphate-rich beds of the Maquoketa allows comparison between the faunal composition and taphonomy of these beds and collections from the more extensively sampled Cincinnatian strata. We isolated these fossils by dissolution of bulk samples in acetic acid and examined the same <b>strata</b> in thin <b>section</b> to study the fossils in context. The Maquoketa diminutive phosphatized fossils have been interpreted as evidence of dwarfed faunas indicative of environmental stress, such as anoxia, which may have also contributed to phosphogenesis. An alternative explanation for the small size is that phosphogenesis was size-selective and that phosphatic particles were concentrated by reworking as less-durable shell material was destroyed. These hypotheses can be tested by examining the fauna for “normal” sized elements. Insoluble residue from sampled phosphate-rich strata in both field areas yields abundant molluscan steinkerns, as well as crinoid columnals, conodonts, scolecodonts, bryozoan zooecia steinkerns and other fossils associated with a normal marine fauna. In Cincinnatian occurrences, {{the composition of the}} phosphatic assemblages is variable but {{is a reflection of the}} variability of faunal composition seen in these strata rather than an indication of an unusual fauna associated with extreme conditions; most are associated with diverse marine assemblages. Insoluble residues from both areas yield steinkerns that precipitated in small pores within larger skeletons. This phenomenon can be seen in thin section, where phosphate is present within certain parts of the larger preserved skeletons. The maximum size of the steinkerns of the Maquoketa is larger than those of most Cincinnatian occurrences, although size is variable in Cincinnatian occurrences. In Cincinnatian strata the abundance of small phosphatic fossils correlates with evidence for reworking; heavily reworked beds yield the most residue. Examined in thin <b>section,</b> the sampled <b>strata</b> of the Maquoketa appear to be heavily reworked and represent an extreme endmember of this concentration of durable phosphatic material. Detailed examination using an SEM and associated XRF elemental mapping reveals that the phosphatic steinkerns of both localities are very similar in their taphonomy. Both consist of botryoidal growths of carbonate fluorapatite (CFA). The botryoidal growth appears to have nucleated on the walls of the original shell, first forming a lining of variable thickness. Some steinkerns have secondary botryoidal growths on the outside of the steinkern indicating continued precipitation of CFA after destruction of the original shell. This secondary precipitation suggests that reworking played a role not only in concentrating the phosphatic material but also in encouraging continued precipitation of CFA. The size of the available pore space appears to have played a role in encouraging the precipitation of CFA. In thin section the CFA is limited to smaller parts of larger shells, such as the apices of gastropods and did not precipitate on the inside of the larger, more open spaces within the shell. Many of the phosphate-filled spaces are also sediment-filled, suggesting that subdivision of the larger space into smaller pores enhanced the precipitation of CFA. The difference in the maximum size of the steinkern achieved in the different assemblages suggests that geochemical factors affected size limits. The most distinctive aspect of phosphate-rich Ordovician strata of mid-Laurentia is the degree of reworking that concentrated the durable small fossils. Details of taphonomy also suggest that phosphate precipitation was an iterative process enhanced by reworking, and that small pore spaces enhanced this mineralization, thus selectively preserving certain sizes and parts of the larger fauna...|$|R
40|$|Early Paleogene (Paleocene-Eocene) climate was {{significantly}} warmer than today, with the poles {{generally considered to}} have been free of ice. These greenhouse conditions ended in the earliest Oligocene when {{the formation of the}} circum-Antarctic seaway between Antarctica and Australia had widened sufficiently to allow thermal isolation of the Antarctic continent and expansion of ice sheets to sea level. The associated invigorated Southern Ocean circulation patterns have been deemed responsible for formation of the Marshall Unconformity (32 - 29 Ma), a prominent hiatus in many Early Oligocene sedimentary sections in the wider New Zealand region. However, some recent studies have suggested there may have been short periods of significant Antarctic glaciation prior to opening of the circum-Antarctic seaway, including in the Late Paleocene at c. 58 - 57 Ma, referred to in this study as the “Late Paleocene event” (LPE). This study investigates the origin(s) of sedimentary sequences from four eastern North Island early Paleogene sections with the aim of determining whether any links can be made between the nature of the sediment facies and their bounding contacts with ice sheet growth on Antarctica. A late Paleogene section that records a possible occurrence of the Early Oligocene Marshall Unconformity has also been studied with the aim of comparing lithologic features from the site with those in the early Paleogene study sections. Methods used include detailed logging and description of sedimentary strata, and petrographic, mineralogical, grain size, elemental, stable carbon and oxygen isotope, organic carbon content, micropaleontologic, and palynofacies analyses. In the study sections the LPE is represented by dark grey, brown-grey, or black, occasionally glauconitic, non-calcareous mudstone, often with relatively high organic matter contents. Geochemical proxies indicate that during deposition of these lithologies siliceous microbiota were the dominant primary producers in the overlying surface ocean waters, suggesting a period of cooling and enhanced upwelling occurred at the time. Additionally, relative sea-level curves formulated for the studied sections through the Paleocene show three falls in sea level, the last of which coincides with the LPE. The relative sea-level curves are considered to represent eustatic changes in sea level and thus the fall that coincides with the LPE may record development of continental ice on Antarctica. The two interpreted falls in sea level prior to the LPE are also commonly associated with dominantly siliceous productivity and may record precursor cooling events. The occurrence of possible “dropstones” in Early to Late Paleocene <b>strata</b> at one <b>section</b> may also record fluctuations between glacial and interglacial conditions prior to, and possibly within, the LPE. There is presently inconclusive evidence for the Akitio River section recording the Early Oligocene Marshall Unconformity, but the glaucony bearing unit that has been suggested to mark the event is similar to some LPE lithofacies and is associated with an episode of increased biosiliceous productivity, supportive of climate cooling. Collectively these features suggest that the LPE may be associated with marked cooling and continental ice development on Antarctica, well before the circum-Antarctic seaway had widened sufficiently to allow thermal isolation of the Antarctic continent. This suggests that Antarctic ice sheet growth is less reliant on ocean heat transport than currently believed, and other mechanisms, such as draw down of atmospheric CO 2, may also be involved. Other results from this study of less relevance to early Paleogene marine climate but of interest to general eastern North Island geology include the possible identification of Awhea Formation and Waipawa Formation at the Pahaoa coastal section in Wairarapa; interpretations of the depositional environments for the lithofacies in the study sections, involving dominantly hemipelagic upper to lower slope mudstone with occasional mass emplaced sandstone and pelagic limestone deposits; a suggested mechanism that led to organic matter enrichment in the Waipawa Formation; a possible explanation for the lateral transition of thick deposits of organic rich mudstone to relatively thin deposits of greensand and glauconitic mudstone; possible explanations for lateral variations in redox conditions; the possible correlation of an Early Eocene olistrostromic unit at Pahaoa with an olistrostomic unit farther south, suggestive of a major tectonic episode; and confirmation of an anomalous trend, noted by previous studies on several Paleocene-Eocene sections, within the Wanstead Formation of increasing terrigenous sediment input during a transgressive period...|$|R
40|$|The {{site for}} CRP- 3, 12 km east of Cape Roberts (77. 006 °S; 103. 719 °E) was selecte to overlap the lower Oligocene strata cored in nearby CRP- 2 / 2 A, and {{to sample the}} oldest strata in the Victoria Land Basin (VLB) for Paleogene climatic and tectonic history. As it transpired there was {{underlap}} {{of the order of}} 10 s of metres. CRP- 3 was cored from 3 to 939 mbsf (metres below the sea floor), with a core recovery of 97 %. Coring took place from October 9 to November 19, 1999, on 2. 0 to 2. 2 m of sea ice and through 295 in of water. The Cenozoic strata cored were mostly g 1 acially influenced marine sediments of early Oligocene age, though they may be earliest Eocene near the base, where at 823 mbsf Devonian Beacon sandstone was encountered. Following CRP- 1 and CRP- 2 / 2 A, CRP- 3 completes the coring of 1500 m of strata on the western margin of the VLB. Core fractures and other physical properties, such as sonic velocity, density and magnetic susceptibility, were measured throughout the core. Down-hole logs for these and other properties were taken from 20 down to 900 - 919 mbsf. Also, vertical seismic profile data were gathered from shots offset both along strike and up dip from the hole. Sonic velocities in CRP- 3 are close to 2. 0 km/s in the upper 80 m, but become significantly faster below 95 mbsf, averaging 3. 2 + 0. 6 km/s {{to the bottom of the}} hole. An exception to this is an interval of dolerite conglomerate from 790 to c. 820 mbsf with a velocity of c. 4. 5 km/s. Dip of the strata also increases down-hole from 10 ° in the upper 100 m to around 22 ° at the bottom. Over 3000 fractures were logged through the hole, and borehole televiewer imagery was obtained for most of the hole for orienting core and future stress field analysis. Two high-angle crush zones, interpreted as faults, were encountered at c. 260 and c. 540 mbsf, but no stratigraphic displacement could be recognised. A third fault zone is inferred from a low angle shear zone in the upper part of a coarse dolerite conglomerate from 790 to 805 mbsf. Temperature gradient was found to be 28. 5 °. km- 1. Basement strata cored from 823 mbsf to the bottom of the hole are largely light-reddish brown medium-grained sandstone (quartz-cemented quartzarenite) with abundant well-defined parallel lamination. These features are comparable with the middle Devonian part of the Beacon Supergroup, possibly the Arena Sandstone. This interval also includes a body of intrusive rock from 901 to 920 mbsf. It has brecciated contacts and is highly altered but some tholeiitic affinity can be recognised in the trace element chemistry. Its age is unknown. Post-Beacon sedimentation began on deeply eroded quartzarenite with the deposition of a thin sandstone breccia and conglomerate, probably as terrestrial talus, followed by dolerite conglomerate and minor sandstone of probable fluvial origin to 790 mbsf. Sedimentation continued in a marine setting, initially sandstone and conglomerate, but above c. 330 mbsf the strata include mudstone and diamictite also. The older sandstone and conglomerate beds are seen as the products of rapid episodic sedimentation. They are interpreted by some as the product of glaciofluvial discharge into shallow coastal waters, and others as a result of sediment gravity flows, perhaps glacially sourced, into deeper water. The core above c. 330 mbsf has facies that allow the recognition of cyclic sequences similar to those in CRP- 2 A. Fourteen unconformity-bounded sequences have been recognised from 330 mbsf to the sea floor, and are interpreted in terms of glacial advance and retreat, and sea level fall and rise. Detailed lithological descriptions on a scale of 1 : 20 are presented for the full length of the core, along with core box images, as a 300 page supplement to this issue. The strata cored by CRP- 3 are for the most part poorly fossiliferous, perhaps as a consequence of high sedimentation rates. Nevertheless the upper 200 m includes several siliceous microfossil- and calcareous nannoplankton-bearing intervals. Siliceous microfossils, including diatoms, ebrideans, chrysophycean cysts and silicoflagellates are abundant and well-preserved in the upper 67 m - below this level samples are barren or poorly preserved, but contain residual floras that indicate assemblages were once rich. No siliceous microfossils were found below 193 mbsf. Calcareous nannofossil have a similar distribution but are generally well preserved. Foraminifera, marine and terrestrial palynomorphs, and marine macrofossils were found consistentlsy down to c. 330 mbsf and sporadically to 525 mbsf. The taxa suggest marine deposition in water depth of c. 50 to 120 m. Below 525 mbsf no microfossils were found, apart from mudstone with similar marine and terrestrial palynomorphs at 781 mbsf, and rare miospores in the conglomerate below 790 mbsf. The terrestrial miospore record, which include several species of Nothofagus and podocarpaceous conifers, suggest low diversity woody vegetation, implying a cold temperate to periglacial climate for the hinterland throughout the period recorded by CRP- 3. Important components of the warmer Eocene flora, known from erratics in southern McMurdo Sound, are missing, through the dominance of smectite in clay from strata below 650 mbsf suggests that the landscape prior to the timne of deposition had experienced a more temperate weathering regime. Biostratigraphy for ihe upper part of CRP- 3 is provided by diatoms and calcareous nannofossils. The first appearance of Cavitatus jouseanus at 48 mbsf suggests an age of arround 31 Ma for this horizon. The last appearance of Transverspontis pulcheroides at 114 mbsf in an interval of relatively high abundance indicates a reasonably sound age for this horizon at 32. 5 ± 0. 5 Ma. The absence of particular resistant diatoms that are older than 33 Ma supports an age that is younger than this for the upper 200 m of CRP- 3. Marine palynomorphs, which occur sporadically down to 525 mbsf and in a single occurrence at 781 inbsf, have biostratigraphical potential once the many new species in this and other CRP cores are described, and F 0 and LO datums established. The mudstone at 781 mbsf has a new clinocyst species, rare Lejeunecysta cysts and a variety of acritarchs and prasinophytes, a varied marine assemblage that is quite different from and presumably younger than the well known Transantarctic Flora of mid to late Eocene age. On this basis and for the moment we conclude that the oldest strata in CRP- 3 are earliest Oligocene (or possibly latest Eocene) in age - c. 34 Ma. Over 1 l 00 samples were taken for magnetic studies. Four magnetozones were recognisd on the basis of NRM intensity and magnetic susceptibility, reflecting the change in sediment composition between quartz sand-dominated and dolerite-dominated. For this report there was time only to produce a magnetostratigraphy for the upper 350 m. This interval is largely of reversed polarity (5 normal intervals total 50 of the 350 m), in contrast to the dominantly normal polarities of CRP- 2 / 2 A, and is inferred to be Chron C 12 R. This extends from 30. 9 to 33 Ma. consistent with the biostratigraphic datums from the upper part of CRP- 3. The lower limit of reversed polarity has yet to be established. The short period normal events are of interest as they may represent cryptochrons or even polarity changes not recognised in the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale. Erosion of the adjacent Transantarctic Mountains through the Kirkpatrick Basalt (Jurassic tholeiitic flows) and dolerite-intruded Beacon Supergroup (Devonian-Triassic sandstone) into granitic basement beneath is recorded by petrographical studies of clast and sand grain assemblages from CRP- 3. The clasts in the lower 30 m of the Cenozoic section are almost entirely dolerite apart from a few blocks from the Beacon Supergroup beneath. Above this, however, both dolerite and granitoids are ubiquitous, the latter indicating that erosion had reached down to granitic basement even as the first sediment was accumulating in the VLB. No clasts or sand grains of the McMurdo Volcanic Group were found, but rare silt-size brown volcanic glass occurs in smear slides through most of CRP- 3, and is interpreted as distal air fall from alkaline volcanism in northern Victoria Land. Jurassic basalt occurs as clasts sporadically throughout the sequence: in the sand fraction they decline upwards in abundance. The influence of the Devonian Beacon Supergroup is most striking for the interval from 600 to 200 mbsf, where quartz grains, from 10 to 50 % of them rounded, dominate the sand fraction. Laminae of coal granules from the overlying Permian coal measures in all but the upper 150 in of the CRP- 3 sequence show that these also were being eroded actively at this time. CRP- 3 core completed the stratigraphical sampling of the western margin of the VLB by not only coring the oldest strata (Seismic Unit V 5) but also the basin floor beneath. This has several important tectonic implications: - most of the Kirkpatrick Basalt and the Beacon Supergroup with the sills of Ferrar Dolerite have been eroded by the time down-faulting displaced the Beacon to form the basin floor. - matching the Beacon strata at the bottom of CRP- 3 with the equivalent strata in the adjacent mountains suggests c. 3000 m of down-to-the-east displacement across the Transantarctic Mountain Front as a consequence of rifting and subsequent tectonic activity. - the age of the oldest Cenozoic strata in CRP- 3 (c. 34 Ma), which are also the oldest <b>strata</b> in this <b>section</b> of the VLB, most likely represents the initiation of the rift subsidence of this part of the West Antarctic Rift System. This age for the oldest VLB fill is much younger than previously supposed by several tens of millions of years, but is consistent with newly documented sea floor spreading data immediately north of the northern Victoria Land continental margin. These new data sets will drive a re-evaluation of the relationship between initiation of uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains (currently c. 55 Ma) and VLB subsidence...|$|R
