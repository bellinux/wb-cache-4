By means of the example of documents incorporating hypertext structures we discuss the impact of taking such an approach on representation and processing within the database system. 1 Introduction In the recent past the proliferation of the hypertext paradigm for representation of information has been facilitated by technological advances. The main difference between conventional documents and hypertext documents is that in the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{relational}} schema (R-schema) to XML Schema translation algorithm that analyzes the cardinality between data values {{and patterns of}} user queries to resolve the implicit referential integrity issue. Many translation methods have been developed taking into account structural and/or semantic aspects. However, earlier methods have considered only the explicit referential integrity specified by the R-schema during translation or partially reflect the implicit referential integrity. It causes several problems such as incorrect translations, abnormal relational model transitions, and so on. In addition, many conventional translation algorithms <b>support</b> XML <b>document</b> <b>type</b> declaration (DTD) as the final translation result. However, it is insufficient to exactly represent the information of the R-schema. The VQT algorithm analyzes the value cardinality and user query patterns and extracts the implicit referential integrities by using the cardinality property of foreign key constraints between columns and the equi-join characteristic in user queries. The VQT algorithm can apply the extracted implied referential integrity relation information to the R-schema and create an XML Schema as the final result. Therefore, the VQT algorithm prevents the R-schema from incorrectly converting into the XML Schema, and it richly and powerfully represents all {{the information in the}} R-schema by creating an XML Schema as the translation result on behalf of the XML DTD...|$|R

This lack of documenting the rendering engine has made refactoring and extending the editor hard and tedious. For instance many CSS 2. 1 and upcoming CSS 3 properties have not been implemented. Software developers in different projects such as TextGrid using Vex would like to update its CSS rendering engine {{in order to provide}} advanced user interfaces as well as <b>support</b> different <b>document</b> <b>types.</b> In order to minimize the effort of extending Vex functionality, I found it beneficial to write a basic documentation about Vex software architecture in general and its CSS rendering engine in particular.

In fact layered diagrams can help developers understand software’s source code faster and easier in order to alter it, and fix errors. This paper is written for the purpose of providing direct support for exploration in the comprehension process of Vex source code. It discusses Vex software architecture.

40|$|The Walden?s Paths Project {{is used by}} {{different}} communities {{in order to create}} and use linear paths that link to documents available on the web. Walden?s Paths has been implemented as a web application using Drupal where a web service handles the core functionality of storage and representation of a Path data structure and a user interface uses this service for authoring and browsing of the paths. I have implemented an interactive user interface for representation of information for educational purpose {{in the form of a}} graph instead of a linear representation. This representation helps the users of the path to better understand the subject by understanding the conceptual structure of subject. The authoring interface is simple and easy to use and enables the authors of Walden?s Paths to represent the conceptual structure of a subject domain in the form of a graph. It allows for graphical representation of different types of relationships between various topic included in the Walden?s Paths. Such graphical representation of educational resources is similar to the concept of Topic Maps. The authoring tool for the Walden?s Paths has been implemented in Drupal 7.

40|$|Purpose: In this contribution, we want {{to detect}} the <b>document</b> <b>type</b> {{profiles}} of the three prestigious journals Nature, Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (PNAS) with regard to two levels: journal and country. Design/methodology/approach: Using relative values based on fractional counting, we investigate the distribution of publications across <b>document</b> <b>types</b> at both the journal and country level, and we use (cosine) <b>document</b> <b>type</b> profile similarity values to compare pairs of publication years within countries. Findings: Nature and Science mainly publish Editorial Material, Article, News Item and Letter, whereas the publications of PNAS are heavily concentrated on Article. The shares of Article for Nature and Science are decreasing slightly from 1999 to 2014, while the corresponding shares of Editorial Material are increasing. Most studied countries focus on Article and Letter in Nature, but on Letter in Science and PNAS. The <b>document</b> <b>type</b> profiles {{of some of the}} studied countries change to a relatively large extent over publication years. Research limitations: The main limitation of this research concerns the Web of Science classification of publications into <b>document</b> <b>types.</b> Since the analysis of the paper is based on <b>document</b> <b>types</b> of Web of Science, the classification in question is not free from errors, and the accuracy of the analysis might be affected. Practical implications: Results show that Nature and Science are quite diversified with regard to <b>document</b> <b>types.</b> In bibliometric assessments, where publications in Nature and Science play a role, other <b>document</b> <b>types</b> than Article and Review might therefore be taken into account. Originality/value: Results highlight the importance of other <b>document</b> <b>types</b> than Article and Review in Nature and Science. Large differences are also found when comparing the country <b>document</b> <b>type</b> profiles of the three journals with the corresponding profiles in all Web of Science journals. ...|$|R
