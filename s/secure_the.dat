The security applications of the normal zone call the session management API with the user’s input data (e.g., PIN, fingerprint) for user authentication. Upon the completion of the channel and the session between the normal zone and <b>the</b> <b>secure</b> zone, <b>the</b> security applications can take advantage of other NZ-security APIs.|$|R
