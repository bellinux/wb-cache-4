5|$|McAleer {{was born}} in Youngstown, Ohio, an {{industrial}} center located near the border of western Pennsylvania. His father, Owen McAleer, died at a young age, leaving McAleer's mother, Mary, to support three children. The family lived on the city's west <b>side,</b> <b>where</b> the McAleer children were raised to value the concept of formal education. McAleer attended local public schools and graduated from Rayen High School. In later years, {{all three of the}} McAleer brothers moved on to successful careers, and the oldest, Owen McAleer, Jr., served for a time as mayor of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September 1899, Gan {{died at the}} age of 55 in {{his house}} at No. 87 Amoy Street. His total assets were worth an {{estimated}} S$550,000. He was buried at Leng Kee Sua somewhere on the hill by the <b>side</b> <b>where</b> Leng Kee Road runs today. Due to redevelopment of the area, his body was disinterred and reburied in a family grave at Bukit Brown Cemetery. After the death of his father, Gan Tiang Tok continued the family business for three years, though by the turn of century it was no longer so lucrative. Gan Tiang Tok was dogged by ill health from 1903 until his death in 1927 at the age of 68.|$|E

5|$|Orographic {{precipitation}} {{occurs on}} the windward side of mountains and {{is caused by}} the rising air motion of a large-scale flow of moist air across the mountain ridge, resulting in adiabatic cooling and condensation. In mountainous parts of the world subjected to relatively consistent winds (for example, the trade winds), a more moist climate usually prevails on the windward side of a mountain than on the leeward or downwind side. Moisture is removed by orographic lift, leaving drier air (see katabatic wind) on the descending and generally warming, leeward <b>side</b> <b>where</b> a rain shadow is observed.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{continued}} to receive armaments from Ticonderoga, with guns arriving on September 21 {{and also on}} October 5. However, the artillery were positioned {{too far away to}} do much damage to the fort. With the arrival of the new guns, Montgomery planned to move the emphasis of the bombardment from {{the east side of the}} fort to the north <b>side,</b> <b>where</b> they would be closer. However, his officers unanimously rejected this plan, fearing that many men would desert due to the increased danger. Montgomery ordered that a new battery be built where the Royal Savage could be threatened. On October 14, the battery was completed and then used to sink the British ship.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the ruins}} of Castell y Bere still stand on a rocky outcrop, with {{protective}} ditches cut into the stone on {{the south and east}} sides. The entrance to the castle lies on the west <b>side,</b> <b>where</b> the barbican, probably built by Edward I, contains two gatetowers, overlooking the stone steps approaching the inner gate. Through the barbican is the castle courtyard, containing a large well and the remains of several internal buildings of uncertain date.|$|E

5|$|Wobble or shimmy {{begins when}} some {{otherwise}} minor irregularity, such as fork asymmetry, accelerates {{the wheel to}} one side. The restoring force is applied in phase with {{the progress of the}} irregularity, and the wheel turns to the other <b>side</b> <b>where</b> the process is repeated. If there is insufficient damping in the steering the oscillation will increase until system failure occurs. The oscillation frequency can be changed by changing the forward speed, making the bike stiffer or lighter, or increasing the stiffness of the steering, of which the rider is a main component.|$|E
5|$|Comprising {{an area of}} 1.6ha (4 acres), with a {{perimeter}} of 480m (1570ft), the Scottish Parliament building is located 1km (0.6mi) east of Edinburgh city centre {{on the edge of}} the Old Town. The large site previously housed the headquarters of the Scottish and Newcastle brewery which were demolished to make way for the building. The boundary of the site is marked by the Canongate stretch of the Royal Mile on its northern side, Horse Wynd on its eastern <b>side,</b> <b>where</b> the public entrance to the building is, and Reid's Close on its western side. Reid's Close connects the Canongate and Holyrood Road on the southwestern side of the complex. The south eastern side of the complex is bounded by the Our Dynamic Earth visitor attraction which opened in July 1999, and Queen's Drive which fringes the slopes of Salisbury Crags.|$|E
5|$|Dan Mulligan (Mark Ruffalo) is a {{formerly}} successful {{record label}} executive living in New York City who is estranged {{from his wife}} Miriam (Catherine Keener) and struggling {{to keep up with}} the changing music industry. After being fired from his job, he goes on a drinking binge which leads him to a bar in the Lower East <b>Side</b> <b>where</b> he encounters Gretta James (Keira Knightley). Gretta is a young and fiercely independent songwriter who has just broken up with her long-time boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave Kohl (Adam Levine), a newly successful musician who had an affair with one of his producers' assistants. Captivated by Gretta's music, Dan offers her to sign her to his former record label, and although she initially refuses she reconsiders the offer and agrees.|$|E

5|$|Even before Carpathia {{arrived in}} New York, efforts were getting {{underway}} {{to retrieve the}} dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 of them were buried. Memorials were raised in various places– New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others– and ceremonies were held {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of Titanics victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by <b>side,</b> <b>where</b> bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.|$|E
5|$|Following the US 33 interchange, Skyline Drive heads {{southwest}}. The roadway {{passes through}} Smith Roach Gap {{and comes to}} the Bacon Hollow Overlook to the south, where it curves to the west. The drive heads through Powell Gap and reaches the west-facing Eaton Hollow Overlook, where it turns to the southwest and winds along. The road bends south and comes to a ranger station at Simmonds Gap. Skyline Drive continues southerly to the Loft Mountain Overlook on the east <b>side,</b> <b>where</b> it turns westerly before heading northwest. The roadway then makes a hairpin turn to the southwest. The road straddles the border of Rockingham and Albemarle counties and continues to the south to the Loft Mountain Wayside, which is site of restrooms and food service. Skyline Drive heads southwest and comes to Loft Mountain, where a ranger station, restrooms, campground, and camp store are located. The drive heads past Browns Gap Parking before it comes to Dundo, where an overlook to the northwest, restrooms, picnic grounds, and Dundo Group Camp are located.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their entry}} into the AFL in 1997, Port Adelaide drafted Harley to the club {{as part of their}} zone selections, which {{entitled}} them to recruit uncontracted players from the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) prior to the 1996 National Draft. He struggled to break into the Port Adelaide senior team, and often found himself playing in the SANFL reserves for Norwood during the 1997 season, where he helped the team reach the SANFL reserves Grand Final, where they were defeated by the Port Magpies. Harley's contributions in the reserves team throughout the year saw him promoted to the senior Norwood <b>side,</b> <b>where</b> he featured in two of their SANFL finals before missing selection for the senior SANFL Grand Final.|$|E

5|$|He had his {{breakout}} {{game for}} the New Zealand club in the round 18 48-0 victory over the Parramatta Eels. Tomkins scored two tries, {{one of which was}} directly from the lock position after a scrum win against the feed. The other of which, also from a scrum play, was down the short <b>side</b> <b>where</b> he broke four tackles in a fantastic individual effort. He also set up a brilliant try for captain Simon Mannering. In the first half, Tomkins recorded nine tackle breaks, a try assist, two line breaks, 84 running metres and two tries. His first half performance truly put him on the map in the National Rugby League after some debate previous to this game over whether he was worth the big money.|$|E
5|$|McEvilly {{started his}} career with non-League side Burscough, rising through their youth ranks to the senior <b>side,</b> <b>where</b> he made 49 league appearances, scoring 28 goals.

Since 2009, McEvilly has {{struggled}} with injuries and has had brief spells at numerous non-league clubs in England and Wales, {{as well as a}} brief period at League of Ireland side Sligo Rovers in 2010, which was also cut short due to injury. He is currently playing with Barrow for the third time, with whom he won the FA Trophy in 2010.|$|E
5|$|South Florida is a {{transitional}} zone between the Nearctic and Neotropical ecozones, {{resulting in a}} wide variety of plant and animal life. The intersection of ecozones brings opportunities for visitors to see species, particularly birds, that are not seen elsewhere in North America. The park includes four distinct ecosystems, each supporting its own flora and fauna. Mangrove swamp, lagoon, island key and offshore reef habitats provide diversity for many species. In this semi-tropical environment, the seasons are differentiated mainly by rainfall. Warm to hot and wet summers bring occasional tropical storms. Though only marginally cooler, the winters tend to be relatively drier. Bay salinity varies accordingly, with lower salinity levels in the wet summer, trending to more fresh water on the west <b>side</b> <b>where</b> new fresh water flows in.|$|E
