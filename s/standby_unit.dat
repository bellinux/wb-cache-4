25|$|KTM Komuter is an {{electrified}} {{commuter rail}} service first introduced in 1995, catering especially to commuters in Kuala Lumpur {{and the surrounding}} suburban areas. KTMB provides 248 commuter services daily, serving 45 stations along 175 route-kilometres. The network consists of two main sectors are Seremban Line and Port Klang Line running at 15 minutes frequency during peak hours and 20 minutes frequency during off-peak hours. The Tanjung Malim shuttle service & Rembau shuttle service running at Seremban Line both end stations operates at half-hour frequency. Komuter coaches are currently the most modern in the KTM fleet and are air-conditioned. Currently, they have a fleet of Class 81, Class 82, Class 83 & Class 92 in which {{almost all of the}} Class 92 are operational while many more of the Class 81, Class 82 & Class 83 has been scrapped, leaving only few to operate as a <b>standby</b> <b>unit</b> during rush hour.|$|E
50|$|Link 22 {{specifies}} two {{network management}} roles. For each role, a <b>standby</b> <b>unit</b> automatically {{takes over the}} role if the unit performing or assigned that role fails. The new management unit immediately nominates a new <b>standby</b> <b>unit.</b> The system will therefore continue operation without the presence of units originally nominated to perform these management roles, and will operate even if no units are performing the roles. After the Link 22 system has started, the Super Network Management Unit (SNMU) has overall management responsibility for the entire Super Network. The Network Management Units (NMUs) have management responsibility only for their particular NILE Network. The SNMU can order the NMUs to perform their network management functions. The SNMU can be the NMU for the networks that it is active on. A NMU may be the NMU {{of more than one}} network.|$|E
50|$|Link 22 uses {{distributed}} protocols, {{so it has}} {{no single}} point of failure (that is, the loss of a single unit does not cause the loss of an entire network). Some units perform specific management roles, but the system will continue operating without them. Each unit that performs a special role is required to designate a <b>Standby</b> <b>unit,</b> which can automatically take over the role in case of failure.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the reliability and}} sensitivity analysis of a system with M primary <b>units,</b> W warm <b>standby</b> <b>units,</b> and R unreliable service stations where warm <b>standby</b> <b>units</b> switching to the primary state might fail. Failure times of primary and warm <b>standby</b> <b>units</b> are assumed to have exponential distributions, and service times of the failed units are exponentially distributed. In addition, breakdown times and repair times of the service stations also follow exponential distributions. Expressions for system reliability,R-Y(t), and mean time to system failure, MTTF are derived. Sensitivity analysis, relative sensitivity analysis of the system reliability and the mean time to failure, with respect to system parameters are also investigated. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|The {{buildings}} on the base were assembled from five pre-fabricated units flown in by Hercules C-130 aircraft with ski landing gear. Four units formed the main building, which is 8x25 meters; and a smaller Jamesway huts unit was constructed 300 meters away. Two 75 kW diesel generators provided the necessary energy for the main unit; and an additional generator was maintained at the <b>standby</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, a 3500 m skiway was built for air transport. A 32 m meteorological tower was erected with instruments at varying heights to monitor the persistent thermal air inversion layer above the Antarctic snow.|$|E
50|$|On 1 August 1945, the {{airfield}} was again reassigned directly to Third Air Force. With {{the end of}} the war, inactivation of Esler Field began on 7 September 1945. However, the Air Force's inactivation was quite slow, with {{the airfield}} being put on standby status 31 January 1946. The 353d was redesignated as a <b>Standby</b> <b>Unit,</b> but not inactivated, keeping a skeleton force of 6 officers and 50 civilians assigned to the base until 31 May 1946 when the base was finally closed. The airfield remained Federal property until the 1950s when it was finally ceded to the Police Jury as surplus property. A small civilian airport opened after return to civil control.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} cost benefit {{analysis}} of availability systems with warm <b>standby</b> <b>units</b> and imperfect coverage. The time-to-failure and the time-to-repair of the active and <b>standby</b> <b>units</b> {{are assumed to be}} exponentially and generally distributed, respectively. We assume that the coverage factor is the same for an active-unit failure as that for a standby-unit failure. We present a recursive method, using the supplementary variable technique and treating the supplementary variable as the remaining repair time, to develop the steady-state availability, (or Av), for three availability models. For each availability model, the explicit expressions for the Av for three various repair time distributions, such as exponential, k-stage Erlang, and deterministic are provided. Under the cost/benefit criterion, comparisons are performed based on assumed numerical values given to the distribution parameters, and to the cost of the active and <b>standby</b> <b>units.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

5000|$|Prior to {{automatic}} systems, the subscriber rang {{an operator}} who would quote {{the time from}} a central clock in the exchange with a phrase such as [...] "The time by the exchange clock is...". This was not precise and the operator could not always answer when the subscriber wanted. In 1954, British-made systems were installed in Melbourne and Sydney. The mechanical speaking clock used rotating glass discs where {{different parts of the}} time were recorded on the disc. A synchronous motor drove the disc with the driving source derived from a 5 MHz Quartz Oscillator via a multi stage valve divider. This was amplified to give sufficient impetus to drive the motor. Because of the low torque available, a hand wheel was used to spin the motor on start up. The voice was provided by Gordon Gow. The units were designed for continuous operation. Both units in Melbourne and Sydney were run in tandem (primary and backup). For daylight saving time changes, one would be on line while the second was advanced or delayed by one hour and at the 02:00:00 Australian Eastern Standard time, would be switched over to the <b>standby</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Link 22 {{system is}} {{designed}} to be resilient. If faults occur, it manages them and attempts to continue operating. A unit participating on multiple NILE Networks can have a failure on one network while continuing to operate on the other networks. A unit is able to handle the closure or shutdown of a network and the restart of the network after the hardware has been reset, without affecting the other networks.When the connectivity changes, possibly due to the loss of a unit or the failure of equipment, the relay automatically takes this into account and modifies message routing in an attempt to maintain the probability that messages get to their addressees.Link 22 automatically retransmits messages to ensure that the requested quality of service (Reliability) is achieved whenever possible. This removes the need for the DLP to perform redundant transmissions and minimizes bandwidth utilization. Retransmissions are always placed in different packets on the network so that the loss of a single packet cannot cause the loss of all repeated transmissions.The transmission on the NILE Networks is controlled by the TDMA structure, which is known to each unit, so the loss of any unit does not affect the ability of the remaining units to continue operation. Virtually all functions work in this manner (called distributed protocols), so there is no single point of failure.Some units perform special roles, but the loss of these units is not disastrous to the operation of Link 22. Any unit that is performing one of the special roles must ensure that it always has a <b>standby</b> <b>unit</b> available to take over the role in case the unit is lost or its Link 22 system fails. A Standby that takes over a role must ensure that a new standby is defined. Messages are exchanged between units, and the loss of reception from the role unit will cause its standby to activate the Role Takeover protocol. Similarly, if the role unit loses reception from its standby, it will give the standby role to another unit.Troubleshooting at the unit, network, or Super Network level is enabled by the reporting of monitoring and statistical data. Each unit’s SNC also validates all message data sent to it by the DLP before processing the message, and reports success or failure of each message back to the DLP. If the validation fails, the SNC also provides details of why the message failed validation.|$|E

These are measured as probability density functions (pdfs) of the system. The rate variables are influenced by the respective auxiliary variables, i.e., failure rate and repair rates of the primary unit and the failure {{rate of the}} <b>standby</b> <b>unit</b> along the entire mission or operating time. In addition, the level of failure state of the system (i.e., level variable S 4) is increased by these rate variables of the primary and standby units, leading to the declining reliability of system.

30|$|Security {{is also an}} {{essential}} aspect for HA Clouds; however, none of the presented solutions deals with security mechanisms, such as those protecting against malicious attacks at the VM or application level. This occurs because detection and treatment of security breaches depends on different mechanisms. Even when an attack leads to a failure condition, dealing with this issue can propagate {{the consequences of the}} attack to the standby units. For example, {{in the case of a}} Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, the middleware can proactively detect the active unit is out of service, failover to the <b>standby</b> <b>unit,</b> and transfer all requests to the <b>standby</b> <b>unit.</b> This strategy would propagate the denial of service to the <b>standby</b> <b>unit.</b> Therefore, the integration of HA and security services is {{an essential}} requirement when implementing a cloud middleware.|$|E
