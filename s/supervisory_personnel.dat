30|$|Alternative {{silvicultural}} {{benefits from}} continuity of ownership and <b>supervisory</b> management <b>personnel</b> who can oversee the consistent application of silvicultural prescriptions. For example, these approaches {{may only be}} feasible if concessions are agreed on {{beyond the scope of}} a single harvest to include repeated harvesting operations, and if concessionaires are held responsible for reforestation and other silvicultural operations. Especially on larger private ownerships and in areas with limited infrastructure, the supervision of logging activities is necessary to avoid unauthorized or accidental removal of higher-valued trees intended for retention. Furthermore, the higher diversity of forest conditions (e.g., tree-species combinations – literally dozens in tropical forests - and various stand structural conditions), and the associated lack of simple, standardized instructions and management protocols {{make it more difficult to}} cope with rapid turnover of staff. Even where scientific data and understanding already exist from long-term silvicultural trials, foresters often appear to heavily rely on their observations, intuition, and experience when applying alternative silvicultural approaches. Developing and fostering these skills in new personnel is challenging for forest administrators and land owners.|$|R

[...] The operators of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps were not recognized for their service until 1897, when President Cleveland approved an act directing the Secretary of War to issue certificates of honorable service to all members (including those who died) of the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps.

[...] Only <b>supervisory</b> <b>personnel</b> were granted military commissions from the Quartermaster Department in order to distribute funds and property. [...] All of the orders the telegraph operators received came directly from the Secretary of War. [...] Also, because there was no government telegraph organization before the Civil War, there was no appropriation of funds by Congress to pay for the expenses of erecting poles, running cables, or the salaries of operators.

2500|$|The Court {{also made}} {{assumptions}} about the business necessity of hiring permanent replacement workers which proved incorrect. Legal scholars, economists and others {{have pointed out that}} because most strikes are of an extremely short duration, employers do not need to hire replacements of any kind. Additionally, a large majority of businesses may operate {{for long periods of time}} without hiring permanent replacement workers by relying on managerial or <b>supervisory</b> <b>personnel,</b> temporary replacements, or workers loaned from other subsidiaries; contracting out work; or stockpiling inventory. The Court not only assumed that an employer needed to hire replacements in order continue operations but also that the employer must grant replacement workers permanent status to induce them to work. Not only is this assumption unwarranted, but the Court itself recognized this in later rulings. In Erie Resistor, Great Dane Trailers, and Fleetwood Trailer, the Court held that employer tactics which are [...] "inherently destructive" [...] of employee rights are enough to run afoul of the NLRA, and no legitimate business reasons is a defense. Yet, in Mackay Radio, hiring permanent replacements—perhaps the act most likely to be inherently destructive of those rights—is held not to be an infringement of the law. A few scholars bluntly conclude that there is no way to reconcile Mackay Radio with these three cases.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} perceptions of both <b>supervisory</b> and subordinate <b>personnel</b> {{in a major}} midwestern metropolitan law enforcement agency {{to determine the effects}} biological sex has on perceptions of women in general and perceptions of the communication competencies of women as leaders. The field of law enforcement was chosen because it has long been considered a male dominated working environment that can be stressful for women. Female law enforcement personnel demonstrated a more positive regard for women in general and a more positive regard for the communication competencies of women as managers than did males. Employees who tended to view women in a positive manner also tended to view positively the communication competencies of women as managers. Individuals who had worked for or with a female manager had more positive regard for women in general and more positive regard for the communication competencies of women as leaders than those who had not worked for a female supervisor.

40|$|Quality and {{continuous}} improvement are important organizational goals for businesses which strive for excellence, yet {{the role of}} human perceptions {{in the success of}} such systems has been largely unexplored by previous research. Several factors are thought to influence the employee’s viewpoint on quality climate within a work environment. One of these factors is the level of trust employees have in their management (organizational) and <b>supervisory</b> (group) <b>personnel.</b> This paper discusses the concept of quality climate and examines the relationship between perceptions of trust and quality climate at two administrative tiers. Employees from three facilities completed electronic questionnaires on perceptions of trust and quality climate at the organizational and group tiers. A positive significant relationship was noted between organizational trust and organizational quality climate and between trust at the organizational and group tiers. No significant predictive relationship was observed between group trust and group quality climate. Nor were quality climate perceptions from facilities with existing quality management systems found to be significantly different from those facilities without quality management systems in place. Data from the project suggest that perceptions of trust and quality climate are clearly related as are the trust perceptions at both organizational and group tiers. However, another observation was that the connection employees make with quality management is not evident at the group tier. Additionally, data collected in this project showed a clear disconnect between established quality management systems and employees’ thoughts about quality. The role of employees in {{the development and implementation of}} quality management systems is not well understood, particularly as they relate to the relationship between supervisors and employees.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 40 - 42) This {{study investigated}} the effects that a training program {{would have on the}} knowledge of an Employee Assistance Program. The training was designed for <b>supervisory</b> and management <b>personnel.</b> The research questians were: (1) Will supervisors' knowledge of an Employee Assistance Program increase with training? (2) Will the Employee Assistance Program training enable the supervisor to recognize the signs of a troubled employee? (3) Does the training provide a valuable tool in aiding the supervisor to help a troubled employee? Previous studies were not discovered by this writer. However, the two studies that are mentioned in this research mainly dealt with the knowledge gained by the supervisors on alcohol and drug. abuse. These served as a basis for this study. Literature continuously suggested the importance of supervisory training but no supportive evidence could be found by this author. A total of 40 subjects, 24 males and sixteen females, participated in the study. All were in a supervisory or above position in an electronic manufacturing company based in Ventura County. All participants were administered the instrument before and after the training sessions. Analysis of covariance was computed between the experimental and comparison groups. The data did provide evidence that knowledge of the Employee Assistance Program was gained {{as a direct result of}} the training session.
