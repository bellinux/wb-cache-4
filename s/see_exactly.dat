The covering is made of paper or some other flimsy material so that knives or arrows will pass through it. The implication is that the thrower or archer must estimate {{the position of the}} assistant using memory and other indirect guides and aim on that basis.|$|E
25|$|The Caterham is {{the purest}} and most honest street car I've ever driven. Period. No power steering. No power brakes. No drive-by-wire. Just a direct {{connection}} {{between you and the}} contact patch. The responses to steering, throttle, brake, and gearshift inputs are so nearly instantaneous that they verge on the telepathic. And I can <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> what's happening, at least at {{the front end of the}} car, as the wheels turn and judder.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{concerns}} about littering and bomb threats, some geocachers hide their caches in inappropriate locations, such as electrical boxes, that may encourage risky behaviour, especially amongst children. Hides {{in these areas}} are discouraged, and cache listing websites enforce guidelines that disallow certain types of placements. However, as cache reviewers typically cannot <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> where and how every particular cache is hidden, problematic hides can slip through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting {{to search for a}} cache, and report any problems.|$|E

60|$|The arm-chair critic, {{reviewing}} {{a situation}} calmly {{and at his}} ease, is apt to make too small allowances for the effect of hurry and excitement on the human mind. He is cool and detached. He <b>sees</b> <b>exactly</b> what {{ought to have been}} done, and by what simple means catastrophe might have been averted.|$|R
50|$|Monitoring tools {{track and}} display {{real-time}} and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modeling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. <b>Seeing</b> <b>exactly</b> when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities.|$|R
25|$|RoboMary {{can examine}} the {{computer}} brain of similar non-color-locked robots {{when they look}} at a red tomato, and <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> how they react and what kinds of impulses occur. RoboMary can also construct a simulation of her own brain, unlock the simulation's color-lock and, with reference to the other robots, simulate exactly how this simulation of herself reacts to seeing a red tomato. RoboMary naturally has control over all of her internal states except for the color-lock. With the knowledge of her simulation's internal states upon seeing a red tomato, RoboMary can put her own internal states directly into the states they would be in upon seeing a red tomato. In this way, without ever seeing a red tomato through her cameras, she will know exactly {{what it is like to}} see a red tomato.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{reportedly}} spent $15million of the $80million {{budget on}} special effects, provided by Industrial Light & Magic; the producers wanted {{a new look}} for the Mummy {{so that they would}} avoid comparisons to past movies. John Andrew Berton, Jr., Industrial Light & Magic's Visual Effects Supervisor on The Mummy, started developing the look three months before filming started. He said that he wanted the Mummy [...] "to be mean, tough, nasty, something that had never been seen by audiences before". Berton used motion capture in order to achieve [...] "a menacing and very realistic Mummy". Specific photography was conducted on actor Arnold Vosloo so that the special effects crew could <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> how he moved and replicate it.|$|E
500|$|Dunham stated it has [...] "incredibly {{attractive}} backgrounds, super slick animations, and {{the best}} character design on PlayStation 2." [...] An Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) reviewer stated it has [...] "cooler character designs on a PS2 fighter" [...] whilst another said, [...] "some of the coolest 2D game artwork ever." [...] Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine deemed it as [...] "the best-looking 2D graphics ever seen in a fighter." [...] 1UP.com said, [...] "the ultrasharp, hi-res character art and fluid animation keep XX at the cutting 2D edge." [...] Dunham, Knutson, Keil, and GamePro commended its similarity with Japanese animated series. The reviewer for GamePro stated it [...] "becomes an art form in its own right." [...] Greg Kasavin of GameSpot, however, said [...] "many of the moves in the game are animated so strangely {{that it can be}} difficult to <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> what's going on." ...|$|E

She stood looking at her master, not {{understanding}} whether she was free to go, or whether he had more {{to say to her}} and would call her back if she did go. Her look was very intent.

6000|$|... "My dear Watson," [...] said he, [...] "I cannot {{agree with}} those who rank modesty among the virtues. To the logician all things should be <b>seen</b> <b>exactly</b> as they are, and to {{underestimate}} one's self {{is as much a}} departure from truth as to exaggerate one's own powers. When I say, therefore, that Mycroft has better powers of observation than I, you may take it that I am speaking the exact and literal truth." ...|$|R
500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film four out of four stars and praised the detail in the {{portrait}} of Johnny Marco, saying [...] "Coppola is a fascinating director. She sees, and we <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> what she sees. There is little attempt here to observe a plot. All the attention is on the handful of characters, on Johnny." [...] A.O. Scott in The New York Times called the film [...] "exquisite, melancholy and formally audacious" [...] and said [...] "This {{is not a matter}} of imitation, but rather of mastery, of finding — by borrowing if necessary — a visual vocabulary suited to the story and its environment. If you pay close attention, [...] "Somewhere" [...] will show you everything." [...] Peter Bradshaw disagreed in The Guardian, awarding the film two stars from five. He praised the cinematic technique but said that the film resembled Lost in Translation too closely, lacked emotional depth and that even on second viewing [...] "the question of why we should really care or be interested remains tantalisingly unanswered"; the final shot failed to solve any emotional problems and [...] "really is one of the daftest things I have seen for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Matos was broadly {{critical}} of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it [...] "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, [...] "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience...it doesn't feel deep enough to command {{much more than a}} furiously dedicated fan following". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is [...] "a genuinely fresh addition...that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [...] ". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer [...] "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as [...] "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition". The review from Edge magazine described multiplayer mode as [...] "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The Edge review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because [...] "you can always <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which [...] "effectively lets you know when you have an opening and when to run".|$|E
500|$|Straw {{described}} Nick Griffin as a [...] "fantasising conspiracy theorist {{with some}} very unpleasant views and no moral compass. But {{now that he has}} been exposed for what he is it is time to move on." [...] Warsi said Griffin was [...] "...very much exposed for the man that he is. When he was questioned on his views his face of extremism was exposed. He was given an opportunity to explain some of his policies and he couldn't". Huhne said, [...] "This is a person who comes from a fascist background; anyone who watches the programme will <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> what he stands for." [...] Greer said Griffin had been [...] "totally trounced" [...] on the show, and that sitting next to Griffin had been [...] "probably the weirdest and most creepy experience of my life". Nevertheless, Griffin perceived that he had [...] "struck up a rapport" [...] with Greer, who treated him differently from the other panellists. Greer avoided looking in Griffin's direction throughout, and indeed turned her back on him pointedly. Speaking to the Associated Press, Griffin stated that his appearance had secured the BNP's place on the national stage, and while not revolutionary, was like gaining a kind of [...] "Boy Scout's badge". He was relatively pleased with having [...] "been able to land a few punches of my own". Later, Griffin declared: [...] "Millions of people are angry about the way I was treated." [...] Describing the experience as a [...] "lynch mob", he complained how the choice of London had made it hostile territory for him, and had prevented him from speaking on then-current events such as the postal strikes.|$|E

50|$|Figure 2B shows {{a circuit}} {{electrically}} identical to Figure 2A using Miller's theorem. The coupling capacitor is replaced on the input {{side of the}} circuit by the Miller capacitance CM, which draws the same current from the driver as the coupling capacitor in Figure 2A. Therefore, the driver <b>sees</b> <b>exactly</b> the same loading in both circuits. On the output side, a capacitor CMo = (1 + 1/Av)CC draws the same current from the output as does the coupling capacitor in Figure 2A.|$|R

2500|$|Comcast won the Consumerist Worst Company In America ("Golden Poo") {{award in}} 2010. A gold trophy {{in the shape}} of a pile of human feces was {{delivered}} to Comcast Corporate Headquarters to commemorate the unmatched level of enmity flowing from their customer base to their business. Competitor Verizon congratulated Comcast on their award via the Verizon Twitter feed. Comcast responded immediately by publicly acknowledging the dubious award, and citing ongoing efforts to improve its customer service. One effort to change this is a new app called, Tech ETA, that allows customers to <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> when a technician is coming.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{arachnid}} {{is threatened}} by a touch to the web or when too large a prey becomes entangled, the arachnid vibrates rapidly in a gyrating motion in its web and becomes blurred and difficult to focus on. For this reason [...] pholcids have sometimes been called [...] "vibrating spiders", although {{they are not the}} only species to exhibit this behavior. Doing so might make it difficult for a predator to <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> where the spider is, may be intended to signal an assumed rival to leave, or may increase the chances of capturing insects that have just brushed their web and are still hovering nearby. If the spider continues to be harassed it will retreat into a corner or drop from its web and escape.|$|E
60|$|It was not, however, till {{some months}} {{after the death of}} the old bishop, and almost {{immediately}} consequent on the installation of his successor, that notice was given that the reform was about to be carried out. The new law and the new bishop were among the earliest works of a new ministry, or rather of a ministry who, having for awhile given place to their opponents, had then returned to power; and the death of Dr. Grantly occurred, as we have <b>seen,</b> <b>exactly</b> at the period of the change.|$|R

2500|$|Yet The Watchtowers public {{coverage}} of the same series of conventions was notable for its far more cautious tone. In its summary of the convention talks, the magazine reiterated the teaching that Bible chronology showed 6000 years of human existence would be completed in the mid-1970s, then pointed out: [...] "These publications have never said that the world's end would come then. Nevertheless, there has been considerable individual speculation on the matter." [...] What was certain, the magazine said, was that the end would come within the generation of those who saw the beginning of world tribulations in 1914. [...] "So we can be confident that the end is near; {{we do not have}} the slightest doubt that God will bring it about ... we have to wait and <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> when, in the meantime keeping busy in God's service." ...|$|E

The user can <b>see</b> <b>exactly</b> where the probes will deploy as the lasers pinpoint where each probe will contact the intended target. [...] The warning arc has had perhaps the biggest impact of all the advancements; it has the capability to deescalate the situation without the user having to fire a single shot. According to Kevin Sailor of the Westminster Police Department, [...] "All of our initial field uses of the X2 resulted in voluntary surrenders upon display of the warning arc." [...] Each of the innovations {{mentioned in this article}} and others unmentioned have led two models – the Taser X26P and the Taser X2 – to be called [...] "smart weapons". Advancements in processing speeds, chip and circuitry technologies, and more powerful software have propelled forward powerful [...] "smart devices".|$|E

50|$|If {{a genetic}} cause is {{suspected}} {{and little else}} {{is known about the}} illness, then it remains to be <b>seen</b> <b>exactly</b> how many genes are involved in the phenotypic expression of the disease. Once that is determined, the question must be answered: if two people have the required genes, why are there differences in expression between them? Generally, what makes the two individuals different are likely to be environmental factors. Due to the involved nature of genetic investigations needed to determine such inheritance patterns, this is not usually the first avenue of investigation one would choose to determine etiology.|$|R

Most unexpectedly she betrayed a ridiculous consternation, but only for a moment. Then she assumed at once that I would give him hospitality upstairs where there was a camp-bedstead in my dressing-room. I said: ...|$|R
