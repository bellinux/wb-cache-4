5|$|Mixing about 2.0% {{beryllium}} into copper {{forms an}} alloy called beryllium copper that is six times stronger than copper alone. Beryllium alloys {{are used in}} many applications because of their combination of elasticity, high electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, high strength and hardness, nonmagnetic properties, as well as good corrosion and fatigue resistance. These applications include non-sparking tools that are used near flammable gases (beryllium nickel), in springs and membranes (beryllium nickel and beryllium iron) used in <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> and high temperature devices. As little as 50 parts per million of beryllium alloyed with liquid magnesium leads to {{a significant increase in}} oxidation resistance and decrease in flammability.|$|E

5|$|The largest use of {{palladium}} {{today is}} in catalytic converters. Palladium {{is also used}} in jewelry, dentistry, watch making, blood sugar test strips, aircraft spark plugs, <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments,</b> and electrical contacts. Palladium {{is also used to}} make professional transverse (concert or classical) flutes. As a commodity, palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964. Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum. Because it absorbs hydrogen, palladium is a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments that began in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E
5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of superalloys for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, <b>surgical</b> <b>instruments</b> are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
