25|$|The {{production}} of an alkali {{on a large}} scale became an important goal as well, and Nicolas Leblanc succeeded in 1791 in introducing a method for the {{production of}} sodium carbonate. The Leblanc process was a reaction of sulphuric acid with sodium chloride to give <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> and hydrochloric acid. The <b>sodium</b> <b>sulphate</b> was heated with limestone (calcium carbonate) and coal to give a mixture of sodium carbonate and calcium sulphide. Adding water separated the soluble sodium carbonate from the calcium sulphide. The process produced a large amount of pollution (the hydrochloric acid was initially vented to the air, and calcium sulphide was a useless waste product). Nonetheless, this synthetic soda ash proved economical compared to that from burning specific plants (barilla) or from kelp, which were the previously dominant sources of soda ash, and also to potash (potassium carbonate) produced from hardwood ashes.|$|E
