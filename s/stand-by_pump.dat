40|$|Case StudyCS 1 Four 580 HP {{cooling tower}} feed pumps were {{upgraded}} by retrofitting improved bowl assemblies with enclosed stainless-steel impellers. Pumps exhibited capacity limitation up to 50 % of rated and cavitation damage in original semi-open cast iron impellers, requiring continuous operation of all installed equipment, including the <b>stand-by</b> <b>pump,</b> to cover plant requirements. Performance of the pumps was optimized by rework of new impellers and stand testing to satisfy guarantee point and improve efficiency to accommodate power limitation of existing drivers. As a result, rated capacity was recovered, allowing one pump in stand-by, {{with a significant}} reliability improvement and considerable savings in maintenance costs, together with a lower capital investment compared to {{the replacement of the}} complete units...|$|E
50|$|Circulating {{water systems}} are {{normally}} {{of the wet}} pit type, but for sea water circulation, both the wet pit type and the concrete volute type are employed. In some industries, one or two <b>stand-by</b> <b>pumps</b> are also connected parallel to CW pumps. It is recommended that these pumps must be constantly driven by constant speed squirrel cage induction motors. CW pumps are designed as per IS:9137, standards of the Hydraulic Institute, USA or equivalent.|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 71 The {{service life}} of {{rolling element bearing}} in {{centrifugal}} chemical process pumps {{is an issue of}} increasing concern. A key factor influencing bearing service life is the condition of the bearing lubricant. Several industrial users of process pumps participated in a survey of centrifugal pumps to determine the levels of water and particulate contamination in the bearing housing lubricating oil. More than 150 samples were analyzed, including new oil along with oil from operating and <b>stand-by</b> <b>pumps.</b> High levels of debris contamination were found in all size ranges of particulates. Water contamination was a much smaller problem than previously assumed. An overall conclusion is that current contamination control methods for non-recirculating oil bath rolling bearing element lubrication systems are not effective...|$|R

The Olushandja Dam, {{which is}} {{situated}} in the Omusati region in northern Namibia, serves as a balancing and storage dam for water supplied from the Calueque Dam, on the Cunene River. Olushandja Dam forms {{an important component of}} the bulk water supply network. The Namibian Department of Water Affairs (DWA), the proponent of the project, aims to upgrade the Olushandja Dam, with the objective of increasing the surety of water supply to the regions of northern Namibia. The upgrading of the Olushandja Dam involves the repair of the north wall pump station and the installation of two pumps, with a combined pumping capacity of 3. 2 m 3 /s. A complete set of <b>stand-by</b> <b>pumps</b> will also be provided to optimise the surety of supply. The impact of upgrading the dam will be in terms of management, rather than construction or development, as the construction related to the upgrading will be minor. A sound management strategy is required to maximise the benefits of an assured water supply, while minimising the negative effects on the communities living in close proximity to the dam...|$|R
30|$|It {{is evident}} that {{selection}} of higher dimension pipe than actually required as far as economical point of view can increase the resilience of network. Hence, minimizing the cost and maximizing the resilience of the network will be more appropriate if the network is to be designed based on not only economical point of view but also resilience of the system. Reliability of the system can be increased by providing <b>stand-by</b> <b>pumps</b> and storage facilities if water source is reliable. But {{in the case of}} components such as pipes and valves, economical and technical feasibility of providing stand-by pipes and valves is herculean task. It is difficult and too costly to have parallel pipe for each pipe or even for some critical pipes. In case of possible situations to have parallel pipes, the house connections taken from the main pipe cannot be shifted to parallel pipe at the time of failure or abnormal operating condition. Hence, it is wise to size the pipe to have additional capacity at the design stage itself. The question of extending capacity of pipe can be achieved by formulating design problem as a multi-objective problem. This paper uses these three existing measures which address the resilience of water distribution network.|$|R
