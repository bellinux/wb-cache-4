5|$|Current {{research}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{rates of}} self-harm {{are much higher}} among young people with {{the average age of}} onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm in young people could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E
