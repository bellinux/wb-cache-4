5|$|Many {{different}} treatments {{exist for}} acne. These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and salicylic acid. They {{are believed to}} work in at least four different ways, including the following: reducing inflammation, hormonal manipulation, killing P. acnes, and normalizing <b>skin</b> <b>cell</b> shedding and sebum production in the pore to prevent blockage. Common treatments include topical therapies such as antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, and retinoids, and systemic therapies including antibiotics, hormonal agents, and oral retinoids.|$|E
5|$|On May 28, 2003, a Haflinger filly named Prometea {{became the}} first horse clone born. Bred by Italian scientists, she was cloned from a mare <b>skin</b> <b>cell,</b> and was a healthy foal. In 2008, Prometea herself {{gave birth to the}} first {{offspring}} of an equine clone, a colt named Pegaso sired by a Haflinger stallion through artificial insemination. The American Haflinger Registry does not allow horses born as a result of cloning to be registered, although as of 2010 other nations' registries have not yet entered a decision on the topic. In January 2012, Breyer Horses created a model horse of the Haflinger.|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} causes an alteration in DNA by modifying neighboring thymine bases {{resulting in}} the formation of a dimer. These dimers block the processes of transcription and translation and ultimately no protein is synthesized and the cell dies. However, DNA repair mechanisms correct this damage by excising the dimer from the DNA strand and inserting replacement bases which are joined to the original strand by DNA ligase. This allows transcription to resume and ultimately protein synthesis to take place. This research focused on determining the DNA damage and subsequent repair levels in a connective tissue disorder, namely Marfan syndrome. This information is important in understanding the clinical expression and management of life threatening conditions in Marfan syndrome individuals. Preliminary results indicate that at 20 - 25 J/m 2 UV dose (254 nm) Marfan syndrome <b>skin</b> <b>cells</b> show a mean reduced survival value of 12 % compared to normal human <b>skin</b> <b>cells.</b> Gel electrophoresis indicates a reduced DNA repair level 24 h post UV irradiation for Marfan syndrome <b>skin</b> <b>cells</b> compared to normal human <b>skin</b> <b>cells.</b> These results suggest Marfan syndrome <b>skin</b> <b>cells</b> have reduced survival and DNA repair levels compared to normal human <b>skin</b> <b>cells.</b> Department of BiologyThesis (M.

5|$|Azelaic acid {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} for mild to moderate acne when applied topically at a 20% concentration. Treatment twice daily for six months is necessary, and is as effective as topical benzoyl peroxide5%, isotretinoin0.05%, and erythromycin2%. Azelaic acid is thought to be an effective acne treatment due to its ability to reduce <b>skin</b> <b>cell</b> accumulation in the follicle, and its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It has a slight skin-lightening effect due to its ability to inhibit melanin synthesis, and is therefore useful in treating of individuals with acne who are also affected by postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Azelaic acid may cause skin irritation but is otherwise very safe. It is less effective and more expensive than retinoids.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead <b>skin</b> <b>cell</b> debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E

25|$|The skin is {{the largest}} organ in the human body. For the average adult human, the skin has a surface area of between 1.5-2.0 square meters (16.1-21.5 sq ft.). The {{thickness}} of the skin varies considerably over {{all parts of the}} body, and between men and women and the young and the old. An example is the skin on the forearm which is on average 1.3mm in the male and 1.26mm in the female. The average square inch (6.5cm²) of skin holds 650 sweat glands, 20 blood vessels, 60,000 melanocytes, and more than 1,000 nerve endings. The average human <b>skin</b> <b>cell</b> is about 30 micrometers in diameter, but there are variants. A <b>skin</b> <b>cell</b> usually ranges from 25-40 micrometers (squared), depending on a variety of factors.|$|E
25|$|Most vulvar cancer (approximately 90%) is {{squamous}} cell carcinoma, which originates from epidermal {{squamous cell}}s, {{the most common}} type of <b>skin</b> <b>cell.</b> Carcinoma-in-situ is a precursor lesion of squamous cell cancer that does not invade through the basement membrane. While this type of lesion is more common with older age, young women with risk factors may also be affected. In the elderly, complications may occur due to the presence of other medical conditions.|$|E
50|$|Dandruff is the {{shedding}} of dead <b>skin</b> <b>cells</b> {{from the}} scalp. As <b>skin</b> <b>cells</b> die, {{a small amount}} of flaking is normal; about 487,000 cells/cm2 are released normally after detergent treatment. Some people, however, experience an unusually large amount of flaking either chronically or as a result of certain triggers, up to 800,000 cells/cm2, which can also be accompanied by redness and irritation.|$|R

Dr. Wood and a colleague donated <b>skin</b> <b>cells</b> and the DNA from those cells was transferred into human eggs. It is not clear if the embryos produced would have been capable of further development, but Dr. Wood stated that if that were possible, using the technology for reproductive cloning would be both unethical and illegal. The five cloned embryos, created in Stemagen Corporation lab in La Jolla, were later destroyed. Ethics concerns were subsequently raised.|$|R

25|$|Ultraviolet UVB light (wavelengths between 315 – 280nm) {{from the}} sun is absorbed by <b>skin</b> <b>cell</b> DNA and results in a type of direct DNA damage called cyclobutane {{pyrimidine}} dimers (CPDs). Thymine-thymine, cytosine-cytosine or cytosine-thymine dimers are formed by the joining of two adjacent pyrimidine bases within a DNA strand. Somewhat similarly to UVB, UVA light (longer wavelengths between 400 – 315nm) {{from the sun}} or from tanning beds can also be directly absorbed by skin DNA (at about 100 to 1000 fold lower efficiency than UVB is absorbed).|$|E
25|$|Therapeutic cloning is {{achieved}} by creating embryonic stem cells {{in the hopes of}} treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned. In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a <b>skin</b> <b>cell</b> of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient. The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.|$|E
25|$|Heritability {{means the}} {{information}} in a given gene is not always exactly the same in every individual in that species, so the same gene in different individuals does not give exactly the same instructions. Each unique form of a single gene is called an allele; different forms are collectively called polymorphisms. As an example, one allele for the gene for hair color and <b>skin</b> <b>cell</b> pigmentation could instruct the body to produce black pigment, producing black hair and pigmented skin; while a different allele of the same gene in a different individual could give garbled instructions {{that would result in}} a failure to produce any pigment, giving white hair and no pigmented skin: albinism. Mutations are random changes in genes creating new alleles, which in turn produce new traits, which could help, harm, or have no new effect on the individual's likelihood of survival; thus, mutations are the basis for evolution.|$|E

500|$|A major {{mechanism}} of acne-related skin inflammation is mediated by P. acnes ability to bind and activate {{a class of}} immune system receptors known as toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially TLR2 and TLR4. Activation of TLR2 and TLR4 by P. acnes leads to increased secretion of [...] IL-1α, IL-8, and TNF-α. Release of these inflammatory signals attracts various immune cells to the hair follicle including neutrophils, macrophages, and Th1 cells. IL-1α stimulates increased <b>skin</b> <b>cell</b> activity and reproduction, which in turn fuels comedo development. Furthermore, sebaceous gland cells produce more antimicrobial peptides, such as HBD1 and HBD2, in response to binding of TLR2 and TLR4.|$|E
