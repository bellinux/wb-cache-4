40|$|Cultural {{socialization}} {{has been}} linked with child development and outcome, but, to date, the majority of {{research has focused on}} race and ethnicity. However, since families headed by gay and lesbian parents experience stigma related to parental sexual orientation, socialization practices may be uniquely important for families headed by gay and lesbian parents. The present study examined <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> socialization among 54 families headed by gay and lesbian parents (52 fathers, 43 mothers, 51 school-aged children) using a cultural socialization framework. Findings revealed that parents engaged in socialization along three dimensions: Cultural Socialization, Preparation for Bias, and Proactive <b>Parenting.</b> Children perceived <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> socialization with less frequency than parents reported engaging in these behaviors across all dimensions. In general, <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> socialization was not associated with child behavioral adjustment.

[...] Allen argued that although U.S. psychology and sociology organizations have expressed consensus opinions that children of same-sex couples suffer no measurable disadvantages, conflicting results and limited data show that there's no such certainty on the matter.

40|$|Objective: Using the 2011 – 2012 National Survey of Children's Health data set, we {{compared}} spouse/partner relationships and parent-child relationships (family relationships), parenting stress, and children's general health, emotional difficulties, coping behavior, and learning behavior (child outcomes) in households of same-sex (female) versus different-sex continuously coupled parents with biological offspring. We assessed whether associations among family relationships, parenting stress, and child outcomes were {{different in the}} 2 household types. Methods: Parental and child characteristics were matched for 95 female <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> and 95 different-sex parent households with children 6 to 17 years old. One parent per household was interviewed by telephone. Multivariate analyses of variance and multiple linear regressions were conducted. Results: No differences were observed between household types on family relationships or any child outcomes. <b>Same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> households scored higher on parenting stress (95 % confidence interval = 2. 03 – 2. 30) than different-sex parent households (95 % confidence interval = 1. 76 – 2. 03), p =. 006. No significant interactions between household type and family relationships or household type and parenting stress were found for any child outcomes. Conclusion: Children with female <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> and different-sex parents demonstrated no differences in outcomes, despite female <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> reporting more parenting stress.

This paper presents findings from an Australian qualitative study of separated <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> and explores their experiences with professionals and service providers during and after their separation. As a consequence of their separation, <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> encountered new service providers with whom they had to navigate relationships with; this paper will focus on their experiences with the legal profession, mediation services, counseling, and mental health services. Findings demonstrated ongoing challenges for parents in finding service providers who they believed could meet and/or understand their specific needs. Heteronormativitiy, whether experienced or perceived, often created an added layer of marginalization for <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> as they navigated the already difficult terrain of separation. Consequently, some parents did not access service providers and missed out on the help that they needed during their separation. Those that did visit professionals and service providers reported mixed experiences, with some participants describing encounters fraught with difficulty, while for others, their experiences were much better than they had anticipated. While some participants had a preference for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex (LGBTI) specific service providers, some discovered a lack of understanding among LGBTI providers towards separating parents or non-biological mothers. This study highlights the need for better education and training for separation related service providers, both mainstream and LGBTI, and the need for more research exploring separation experiences of <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> families...|$|R
