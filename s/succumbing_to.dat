5|$|By saying this, Kennedy was admonishing {{people not}} to riot in wake of King's death and in effect equating their actions {{to that of the}} civil rights leader's assassin. After quoting Abraham Lincoln, he portrayed the American public as a people {{increasingly}} <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> its violent tendencies that undermined its national ideals. He argued that all deaths degraded American society, thereby assuming an uncompromising stance that any and all acts of violence were unacceptable.|$|E

However, just like Alp Arslan of the Seljuk Turks, Murad I left the taking of Byzantine territory to his vassals with Philippopolis falling after major campaigning between 1363–4 and Adrianople <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> the Ottomans in 1369.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the mandate was to prevent the {{healthcare}} system from <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> adverse selection, which would result in high premiums for the insured and little coverage (and thus more illness and medical bankruptcy) for the uninsured. Studies by the CBO, Gruber and Rand Health concluded that a mandate was required. The mandate increased the size and diversity of the insured population, including more young and healthy participants to broaden the risk pool, spreading costs. Experience in New Jersey and Massachusetts offered divergent outcomes.|$|E
5|$|A band of {{convection}} formed {{northeast of}} Greg early on September7, inducing moderate to strong northeasterly wind shear on the cyclone. Combined with land interaction, the storm weakened to tropical storm intensity by 18:00UTC that day, and Greg made landfall near Cabo San Lucas three hours later, with winds of 60mph (95km/h). After turning west-northwest and then west, the cyclone moved over progressively cooler waters {{and continued to}} lose strength, although a small area of deep convection persisted. Greg weakened to a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on September8 before <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> the unfavorable environment and dissipating a day later west of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|A left-arm medium-pace seam bowler, Toshack was {{a member}} of the first-choice team, and played in the first four Test matches before <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> a {{persistent}} knee injury.

5|$|After being alerted by McCoy, Kirk {{arrives in}} the engine room and discovers Spock dying of {{radiation}} poisoning. The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice his own life to save those of the ship's crew is a logical one, before <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> his injuries. A space burial is held in the Enterprise torpedo room and Spock's coffin is shot into orbit around the new planet. The crew leaves {{to pick up the}} Reliant marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V.

After Wimbledon, Federer continued to be upset early in tournaments in Hamburg and Gstaad because of a serious back injury through October, when he announced that he was parting ways with Paul Annacone, his coach for the last three years.

5|$|Ernest Mangnall was {{the first}} man to bring any major {{silverware}} to the club, winning the club's first ever Football League title in 1908. This was followed by the FA Cup the following season, and another league title in 1911. Despite this success, though, he left the club a year later to join local rivals Manchester City. Coincidentally, Mangnall's last match in charge of United was the Old Trafford derby of 7 September 1912. John Bentley took over as club secretary, but was replaced two years later by Jack Robson, who became the club's first full-time manager.

Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a black spot on his hand, but is prevented from <b>succumbing</b> <b>to</b> the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E
