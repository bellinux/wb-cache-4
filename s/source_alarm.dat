40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multi-perceptive model {{to stimulate the}} {{movement}} of virtual agents in danger events. The sound <b>source</b> (<b>alarm),</b> visual event and smell event localizations, {{as well as their}} attributes, such as sound frequency, event dimension and odor’s propagation area, are defined in the virtual environment. In hearing perception, the sound intensity is attenuated according to the distance from the source and collisions with the walls located between the agent and the alarm. Also, the different sensibilities of the human ear are taken in consideration, as well as the natural hearing loss because of the aging. Besides hearing, the model aggregates other perceptions, such as vision and smell, treated by zonal and sensory approaches regarding the distance and the agent view angle to the perceptive area. To provide realism to the model, a pseudo-communication among agents was defined to propagate the individual knowledge acquired by their perceptions. Using this knowledge, the behavior model will define which action is to be taken next in the environment through a decision tree...|$|E
40|$|Acoustics {{comfort in}} a room {{is one of the}} most {{important}} building physics aspect that should be observed. in public spaces like hospital, especially in an intensive care unit such as NICU. Researches on the acoustic conditions of NICU in Indonesia are still limited. The acoustical study conducted in this research is using objective, subjective, and simulation methods based on soundscape concept with the concern on the nurse’s perception. This research was conducted at a national hospital in Jakarta. According to National Standardization Agency of Indonesia (SNI) and World Health Organization (WHO), the suitable sound pressure level (SPL) for noise in patient’s room is 35 dBA. From the study, it was found that the equivalent SPL value exceeded the standard. Soundscape in NICU can be improve with the addition of curtain on the incubator’s side, installation of glass partition, and ceiling absorber in the nurse station area. The result of simulation showed that the SPL in the room decreased with average value 8. 9 dBA for sound <b>source</b> <b>alarm</b> ventilator and 8. 2 dBA for sound source medical officer conversations. And the speech transmission index (STI) increased from “bad” to “good” range became “fair” to “excellent” range...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with examining in a formal quantitative manner what human observers look at and what the objects of their gaze tell them. Three models designed to describe and predict the allocation of human attention in supervisory control tasks were investigated. A series of three experiments examined the relative influence of five factors on the sampling patterns of participants: the information generation rate of the information signal (bandwidth), the frequency of significant, i. e., task relevant, events on an information <b>source</b> (<b>alarm</b> frequency), the payoff matrix associated with missing or detecting critical events (value), the visual salience of the events, {{and the cost of}} making an observation. The paradigm employed is similar to that developed by Senders and colleagues (1964), in which observers were asked to monitor an array of four simulated ammeters and to press a button whenever the pointer of any ammeter entered an "alarm zone. " Aspects of three mathematical models, Senders's constrained random sampler, Wickens and colleagues SEEV model, and Pirolli's and Card's Information Foraging Theory Model, were combined to form seven different models predicting performance in the task. The sampling patterns predicted by each model were compared against the eye movement data of participants. Results of the three experiments indicate that participants' sampling patterns were sensitive to the experimental manipulations. Comparisons of the model predicted patterns of attention allocation to those in the participant data indicated that different models described different participants. Participants who performed poorly at the task were best described by models incorporating bandwidth. Participants who performed well at the task were best described by models incorporating alarm frequency, and those who performed best at the task were not well-described by any of the models. Overall the models based on Information Foraging Theory were the most robust in predicting the attention allocation patterns of participants. Implications of each of the experimental manipulations and of the fit of the models to the participant data are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Equipment shelter alarm {{management}} is usually performed from central offices from which field units react to alarms {{and to which}} they return after the <b>alarm</b> <b>source</b> has been fixed. This is time consuming and travel times are often long. The goal of this thesis is to present an efficient alarm handling solution that reduces costs and repair times. The thesis also presents theory about digital cartography, routing and mobile positioning. An alarm pilot was planned and built. The pilot combines a GIS system, an equipment shelter database, mobile positioning, routing and alarm logging. Alarms are received from external systems. Costs and repair times are reduced significantly when travel times are shorter. This requires the mobile positioning of the nearest field units to the <b>alarm</b> <b>source.</b> Efficient <b>alarm</b> logging and reporting facilitates service planning and increases customer satisfaction...|$|R

Under such an influence, ants followed trails for only short distances, no longer arrived at marked areas and no longer orientated themselves to a <b>source</b> of <b>alarm</b> pheromone. Also when exposed to electromagnetic waves, ants became unable to return to their nest and recruit congeners; therefore, the number of ants collecting food increases only slightly and slowly. After 180 h of exposure, their colonies deteriorated. Electromagnetic radiation obviously affects social insects' behavior and physiology. © Informa UK Ltd.

40|$|Color poster with text, photographs, and images. The goal of {{this project}} was to {{establish}} a primary culture of alarm cells from the skin of Creek Chub (Semtilus atromaculatis). The skin (epithelium) is composed of different cell types. Included among them are cells that produce alarm substance. This compound is released following tissue damage, such as would occur during a predation event (Smith 1992, Canadian Journal of Zoology, 70 (8) : 1473 - 1476). When the alarm substance enters the water, anti-predatory behaviors are initiated by neighboring fish (e. g., darting, freezing, schooling). Alarm substance has not been isolated and commercial preparations are not available. Establishing a culture of fish epithelial cells will provide an immediate <b>source</b> of <b>alarm</b> substance {{that can be used}} in behavioral experiments with Creek Chub.

A variety of defensive strategies is described for the group, such as bitting and resin deposition. Defensive behaviours are usually mediated by chemical communication such as alarm pheromones. This study describe the defensive strategies of the stingless bee Melipona flavolineata Friese 1900 towards known pheromone sources, the head secretions of the robber bee Lestrimelitta limao and the mandibular gland extract of conspecifics M. flavolineata workers. The pheromones provoked different defensive reactions. The head secretions of the robber bee repelled returning foragers, elicited the enclosing of the nest entrance tube with batumen balls and agglomeration of workers outside of the box. In contrast, the mandibular gland extract elicited aggression towards the pheromone site, transport of resin and generalised agitated flights.

50|$|The {{least bittern}} is an elusive bird. They {{spend much time}} {{straddling}} reeds. When alarmed, the least bittern freezes in place with its bill pointing up, turns its front and both eyes toward the <b>source</b> of <b>alarm,</b> and sometimes sways to resemble wind-blown marsh vegetation. This is perhaps a predator-avoidance behaviour, since its small size makes the bittern vulnerable to many potential predators. Thanks to its habit of perching among the reeds, the least bittern can feed {{from the surface of}} water that would be too deep for the wading strategy of other herons. The least bittern and much larger and different-looking American bittern often occupy the same wetlands, but may have relatively little interaction because of differences in foraging habits, preferred prey, and timing of breeding cycles. The least bittern arrives on its breeding grounds about a month after the American bittern, and leaves one or two months earlier. John James Audubon noted that a young captive least bittern was able to walk with ease between two books standing 4 cm apart. When dead, the bird's body measured 5.7 cm across, indicating that it could compress its breadth to an extraordinary degree.|$|R
