5000|$|Inelastic neutron {{scattering}} is an experimental technique {{commonly used in}} condensed matter research to study atomic and molecular motion as well as magnetic and crystal field excitations.It distinguishes itself from other {{neutron scattering}} techniques by resolving the change in kinetic energy that occurs when the collision between neutrons and the sample is an inelastic one. Results are generally communicated as the dynamic structure factor (also called inelastic <b>scattering</b> <b>law)</b> , sometimes also as the dynamic susceptibility [...] where the scattering vector [...] {{is the difference between}} incoming and outgoing wave vector, and '''' is the energy change experienced by the sample (negative that of the scattered neutron). When results are plotted as function of , they can often be interpreted {{in the same way as}} spectra obtained by conventional spectroscopic techniques; insofar as inelastic neutron scattering can be seen as a special spectroscopy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{human body}} is not {{transparent}} to visible wavelengths. Hence, one photon imaging using fluorescent dyes {{is not very}} efficient. If the same dye had good two-photon absorption, then the corresponding excitation would occur at approximately two times the wavelength at which one-photon excitation would have occurred. As a result, {{it is possible to}} use excitation in the far infrared region where the human body shows good transparency. It is sometimes said, incorrectly, that Rayleigh scattering is relevant to imaging techniques such as two-photon. According to Rayleigh's <b>scattering</b> <b>law,</b> the amount of scattering is proportional to , where [...] is the wavelength. As a result, if the wavelength is increased by a factor of 2, the Rayleigh scattering is reduced by a factor of 16. However, Rayleigh scattering only takes place when scattering particles are much smaller than the wavelength of light (the sky is blue because air molecules scatter blue light much more than red light). When particles are larger, scattering increases approximately linearly with wavelength: hence clouds are white since they contain water droplets. This form of scatter is known as Mie scattering and is what occurs in biological tissues. So, although longer wavelengths do scatter less in biological tissues, the difference is not as dramatic as Rayleigh's law would predict.|$|E

Hofstadter refers to this in his 1961 Nobel Lecture: [...] "This behavior can be understood in terms of the theoretical <b>scattering</b> <b>law</b> developed by M. Rosenbluth in 1950". In 1953, Rosenbluth derived the Metropolis algorithm; cited in Computing in Science and Engineering (Jan. 2000) as being among the top 10 algorithms having the [...] "greatest influence on the development and practice of science and engineering in the 20th century." [...] However, by the late 1950s, Rosenbluth {{turned his attention to the}} burgeoning discipline of plasma physics and quickly laid the foundation for many avenues of research in the field, particularly the theory of plasma instabilities. Although he continued to work on plasma physics for the remainder of his career, he often made forays into other fields. For example, around 1980, he and coworkers produced a detailed analysis of the free electron laser, indicating how its spectral intensity can be optimized. He maintained a high productivity rate throughout his entire career. Indeed, only a few years before his death, Rosenbluth discovered the existence of residual flows (so-called Rosenbluth-Hinton flows), a key result for understanding turbulence in tokamaks.|$|E

40|$|Although {{diffusive}} shock acceleration (DSA) {{could be}} simulated by some well-established models, {{the assumption of}} the injection rate from the thermal particles to the superthermal population is still a contentious problem.
