500|$|... "Fight for You" [...] is an urban-pop ballad with {{a length}} of four minutes and two seconds. According to Meena Rupani of DesiHits, the song finds Derulo as the male protagonist singing [...] "that he's got a girl in his life he isn't ready {{to let go of}} just yet". The song {{contains}} a sample of the song [...] "Africa" [...] (1982) by American rock band Toto. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Fight for You" [...] features [...] "airy synths and bouncy castle-sized beats". During an interview with New! magazine, Derulo explained the concept of [...] "Fight for You", saying: [...] "It's very relationship-based and the line [...] means so much, whatever you believe in you should go for. The song is based on a personal experience, I was in a relationship and I put myself in that place again where you would do anything to keep the relationship together <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to that place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lead singer Bono {{explained}} {{that he had to}} ask himself a few hard questions before carrying on recording: [...] "I wanted to check where I was to where I am. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and listened to all the music that made me {{want to be in a}} band, right from the Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo & The Bunnymen, all that stuff. And what was interesting is, that was what a lot of people in bands now are listening to anyway. So in a funny way, it made us completely contemporary." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} Mueller gave different reasons for leaving, [...] "One {{is that the}} decision {{had been made to}} terminate the Apollo program, and that was a good time then to leave before, and let someone else take over for the next phase. From a practical point of view, I needed to go make some money so I could keep my family going. It was costly for us to join the Apollo program. My salary was half what I was making in industry when I went there, {{and it was just a}} strain to keep the family going and work going at the same time. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to industry.".|$|E
60|$|This obliges me to {{tell the}} truth, and to do <b>so</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> ever <b>so</b> far, and {{tell you about the}} FAIRY BLACKSTICK.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{have not}} seen the squire as yet. <b>I</b> will do <b>so</b> before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> of course. But it seemed such a commonplace sort of thing to go round by the village." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you think}} <b>I</b> would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> there, Isabel?" [...] asked March, with a haggard look. [...] "Well, {{if you say}} <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> and do what Dryfoos ordered me to do. I'm {{sufficiently}} cowed between him and you, I can assure you." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to our {{quarters}} and ruminated over things in general, and watched old Umslopogaas whetting his axe {{outside the window}} as a vulture whets his beak beside a dying ox.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> {{into the}} house alone, and found my guest waiting for me in some impatience. He was lying upon a sofa, piled up with cushions, and the extreme pallor of his face alarmed me.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to my stool, {{feeling very}} small and yet indignant, for how was it {{possible}} to be definite about ghosts, or to explain the exact facts of the Mameena myth which clung {{to me like a}} Wait-a-bit thorn.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Snowfield on Saturday, and I {{shall have}} to set out to Treddleston early, to be {{in time for the}} Oakbourne carrier. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the farm to-night, that I may have the last day with my aunt and her children. But I can stay here all to-day, if your mother would like me; and her heart seemed {{inclined}} towards me last night." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I {{recorded}} {{an album}} {{two years ago}} which was a real pop album <b>so</b> when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> into writing again I decided I wanted to work on something a bit more personal and take a bit more influence and inspiration from around where I am. It felt like a really good time to use this inspiration and explore what it {{like to live in}} Galway and Clare for so long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{will be no}} difficulty," [...] {{returned}} the wizard, [...] "for the feast {{is not to be}} held for twice seven days. By that time the Kablunet will be well, and getting strong. Of course he must rest and be well stuffed just now. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> will <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> and say that you are coming, and tell them also what you have found--a Kablunet. Huk!" ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly I {{came on the}} Tuesday, {{and stayed}} a fortnight, but he came not; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to Kensington, and after that I had very few of his lordship's visits, which I was very glad of, and in a little time after was more glad of it than I was at first, and upon a far better account too.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did. I was mad, I {{can tell}} you. I wasn't going to 'it 'er if I could 'elp it, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and licked into this chap, {{just to show}} 'er what I could do. 'E was a big chap, too. Well, I chucked him, and smashed things about, and gave 'er a scaring, and she ran up and locked 'erself into the spare room." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and {{got little}} Albert. He can't walk, or talk, or do {{anything}} except drool, and I had to carry him in my arms. We went on past the last hayfield, which {{was as far as}} I'd ever gone. Then the woods and brush got so thick, and me not finding any more trail, we followed the cow-path down to a big creek and crawled through the fence which showed where the Home land stopped.|$|E
50|$|It {{was only}} when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to this club and heard the sort of things they were playing that I really {{understood}} about 12-inch remixes. Although I myself had already {{had a couple of}} big 12-inch hits, I'd never heard them being played on a big sound system, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> then <b>went</b> <b>back</b> and mixed 'Relax' again and that was the version which sold a couple of million over here the UK.|$|R
5000|$|Critics have {{proclaimed that}} this eclectic eight-piece “would have sounded utterly at home within the hallowed {{confines}} of Preservation Hall in New Orleans' French Quarter” [...] and their “upbeat, old-school, All-American sonic safaris exemplify everything shows should be: hot, spontaneous, engaging and, best of all, {{a pleasure to}} hear” [...] Rob Sheffield, in Rolling Stone, hailed them as a great band “whose Americana swing was <b>so</b> fun <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to see them again the next day.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{much longer}} before you can do <b>so</b> again, if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the Islands with papa. I shall expect you to be true, you know; {{and it will be}} ten years at the least before I can hope to be home again." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the inn of The Golden Stag, and, {{climbing}} some steps, I made a loud noise. A woman came, and I {{asked for}} food. She led {{me through a}} room where were enormous barrels, ten feet in diameter, lying fatly on their sides; then through a large stone-clean kitchen, with bright pans, ancient as the Meistersinger; then up some steps and into the long guest-room, where a few tables were laid for supper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, but," [...] {{continued}} the sweetly communicative Maria, with some real and some assumed simplicity, [...] "your ladyship forgets--for you said presently after, you were {{sure he was}} no gentleman, for he did not run after you with your glove which you had dropped--and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> myself to find your ladyship's glove, and he never offered to help me, and I saw him closer than your ladyship did, and I am sure he is handsome, though he is not very civil." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{waited until}} one o'clock. Then I slipped down, {{got into the}} museum, struck a match, and looked for the scarab. It wasn't there. I couldn't believe it at first. I struck some more matches--quite a number--but it was no good. The scarab was gone; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to bed and thought hard {{thoughts}} about you. It was silly of me. I ought to have known you would not break your word; but there didn't seem any other solution of the thing's disappearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{told that}} his tree grows great, that it overshadows all the royal kraal. I think that Mameena wishes {{to sleep in the}} shade of it. And now you are weary, and <b>so</b> am <b>I.</b> <b>Go</b> <b>back</b> to your wagons, Macumazahn, for I have nothing more to say to you to-night. But be sure to return and tell me what chances at Panda's kraal. Or, as I have said, perhaps I shall meet you there. Who knows, who knows?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all. I made a {{good time}} of it in California, where I've been last, digging gold. My mate, as was with me, got a talking about the old country, and wrought on me <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> with him to see it again. So, instead of {{gambling}} away all my money over there" [...] (Mat carelessly jerked his hand in a westerly direction), [...] "I've come to spend it over here; and I'm going down into the country to-morrow, to see if anybody lives to own me at the old place." ...|$|R
5000|$|Whereas the band's major label debut, Introduction to Mayhem, boasted strong hip hop tendencies, (the) New Release {{demonstrated}} a broader variety with bluesy vocals, saxophone, and piano scattered throughout. Regarding the band's new musical direction, Bobby Burns stated [...] "I just grew very, very {{sick of the}} whole music scene last year... All the plastic bands that were put together by record companies, etc. I didn't {{want to hear any}} of that music any longer... <b>So</b> <b>I</b> didn't... <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to what was real to me and what made me feel good growing up... Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Kiss... Back then you could tell all those bands apart, and music of today just sounds like the same records made over and over with all the same guitar sounds and shit." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the wall, a {{white flag}} in my hand, and {{presently}} an envoy advanced from the Spanish camp {{to speak with}} me--not de Garcia, but another. I told him in few words that those who remained alive {{of the people of}} the Otomie would die beneath the ruins of their city like the children of Tenoctitlan before them, but that while they had a spear to throw and an arm to throw it, they would never yield to the tender mercies of the Spaniard.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the boat, having {{carefully}} {{wrapped up}} Euphemia, to endeavor {{to save the}} girl. I found that the boarder had so arranged the gang-plank that it was possible, without a very great exercise of agility, to pass from the shore to the boat. When I first saw him, on reaching the shelving deck, he was staggering up the stairs with a dining-room chair and a large framed engraving of Raphael's Dante--an ugly picture, but full of true feeling; at least so Euphemia always declared, though I am not quite sure that I know what she meant.|$|E
60|$|I waited, {{when the}} German courier ceased, to hear {{something}} said of this strange story. The silence was unbroken. I looked round, and the five couriers were gone: so noiselessly that the ghostly mountain might have absorbed them into its eternal snows. By this time, I {{was by no means}} in a mood to sit alone in that awful scene, with the chill air coming solemnly upon me - or, if I may tell the truth, to sit alone anywhere. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> into the convent- parlour, and, finding the American gentleman still disposed to relate the biography of the Honourable Ananias Dodger, heard it all out.|$|E
2500|$|Lane's {{practice}} of tackling opponents about {{the head and}} neck, which was then a legal technique, was sometimes called a [...] "Night Train Necktie". It later became known as a clothesline tackle and prohibited. He later explained the rationale for his {{practice of}} necktie tackling:My object is to stop the guy before he gains another inch[...] [...] [...] f I hit them in the legs they may fall forward for a first down[...] [...] [...] I grab them around the neck <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the bench and sit down.|$|R
5000|$|When Mike Judge {{submitted}} the pilot script and drawings for King of the Hill to the Fox network, network executives advised him that Hank Hill should be younger than 49 years old, as Judge had described the character. Judge {{received a phone}} message from a network executive who told him that Hank's age should be 32, {{the same age as}} the network's average viewer. Judge later said, [...] "I got all angry, and then I was like, 'Well, wait. It's just a drawing.' <b>So</b> <b>I</b> just <b>went</b> <b>back</b> with the same drawing and said, 'Okay, he's 34.'" ...|$|R
50|$|Such {{incredible}} {{things happen}} when <b>I</b> leave groups, <b>so</b> that when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>back,</b> <b>I</b> {{can hardly believe}} what they’ve accomplished in the time since I was last there. I see this everywhere <b>I</b> <b>go.</b> The people <b>I</b> work with want to radiate this process and transform things. They want everyone {{to have access to}} these principles, and they have enormous energy for spreading this kind of work.|$|R
60|$|To {{some men}} {{the means of}} escape which I had {{discovered}} might have seemed difficult and dangerous enough--to me the prospect of slipping down the pipe into the street did not suggest even a thought of peril. I had always been accustomed, by the practice of gymnastics, to keep up my school-boy powers as a daring and expert climber; and knew that my head, hands, and feet would serve me faithfully in any hazards of ascent or descent. I had already got one leg over the window-sill, when I remembered the handkerchief filled with money under my pillow. I could well have afforded to leave it behind me, but I was revengefully determined that the miscreants of the gambling-house should miss their plunder {{as well as their}} victim. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the bed and tied the heavy handkerchief at my back by my cravat.|$|E
6000|$|I saw {{the little}} fellow again, {{in a curious}} way, a few nights later. A wild storm was raging over the woods. Under its lash the great trees writhed and groaned; and the [...] "voices"--that strange {{phenomenon}} of the forest and rapids--were calling wildly through {{the roar of the}} storm and the rush of rain on innumerable leaves. I had gone out on the old wood road, to lose myself for a little while in the intense darkness and uproar, and to feel again the wild thrill of the elements. But the night was too dark, the storm too fierce. Every few moments I would blunder against a tree, which told me I was off the road; and to lose the road meant to wander all night in the storm-swept woods. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> for my lantern, with which I again started down the old cart path, a little circle of wavering, jumping shadows about me, the one gray spot in the midst of universal darkness.|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>back</b> to the working-class, {{in which}} I {{had been born}} and where I belonged. I care no longer to climb. The {{imposing}} edifice of society above my head holds no delights for me. It {{is the foundation of}} the edifice that interests me. There I am content to labour, crowbar in hand, shoulder to shoulder with intellectuals, idealists, and class-conscious working-men, getting a solid pry now and again and setting the whole edifice rocking. Some day, when we get a few more hands and crowbars to work, we'll topple it over, along with all its rotten life and unburied dead, its monstrous selfishness and sodden materialism. Then we'll cleanse the cellar and build a new habitation for mankind, in which there will be no parlour floor, in which all the rooms will be bright and airy, and where the air that is breathed will be clean, noble, and alive.|$|E
3000|$|... (P 7) When [my children] were younger, {{they did}} not {{understand}} much. Now they understand the situation as they are older. My daughter still does not talk to me. Initially, I was not very used to it <b>so</b> <b>I</b> try to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> home after joining the rehabilitation program. But my wife told me, “No, you cannot come back home, you have to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> [to the recovery program].” [...]...|$|R
2500|$|Weld {{resigned}} {{the governorship}} on July 29, 1997, to devote his full attention to campaigning for the ambassadorship, even though few {{thought he would}} be successful; there was speculation that he was really resigning because he had become tired of serving as governor. A bipartisan majority of Senators signed letters demanding that Helms advance his nomination, but Helms refused. After an intensive six-week battle, Weld conceded defeat and withdrew his nomination on September 15, 1997. He commented sarcastically, [...] "I asked President Clinton to withdraw my name from the Senate <b>so</b> <b>I</b> can <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to New England, where no one has to approach the government on bended knee to ask it to do its duty." ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 2006 {{interview}} with Gibson.com's Backstage Pass Haynes explains his early influences:"When I first started [...] - [...] chronologically speaking [...] - [...] Hendrix and Clapton and Johnny Winter {{were the first}} three people I got turned on to. That was the Cream era of Clapton. Then eventually, I heard the Allman Brothers and everybody else from that era that I stole something from (laughs). Of course, I would read interviews with all these people and find out who they listened to. And they all listened to B.B. King and Freddie King and Albert King and Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters and Elmore James, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and discover that stuff." ...|$|R
