60|$|I {{slept in}} Anscombe's room {{that night and}} looked after him. He was very feverish and {{the pain in his}} leg kept him awake a good deal. He told me that he could not bear Dr. Rodd and wished to get away at once. I had to explain to him that this was {{impossible}} until his spare oxen arrived which I was going to <b>send</b> <b>for</b> <b>to</b> Pretoria, but of other matters, including that of the dangerous state of his foot, I said nothing. I was thankful when towards two in the morning, he fell into a sound sleep and allowed me to do the same.|$|E

'He let me {{see that}} he knew he could force upon the Lifu people {{whatever}} he pleased, the French Government having promised him any number of soldiers he may <b>send</b> <b>for</b> <b>to</b> take possession, if necessary, of the island. They have 1,000 men in New Caledonia, steamers and frigates of war; and he told me plainly that this island and Nengone are considered as natural appendages of New Caledonia, and practically French possessions already, so that, of course, to attempt doing more than secure for the people a religious liberty is out of the question. He promised me that if the people behaved properly to him and his people, he would not send for the soldiers, nor would he do anything to interfere with the existing state of the island.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{represented}} my own {{circumstances to}} him in the most moving terms that I was able. I told him that those unhappy distresses which first moved him to a generous and an honest friendship for me, would, I hope, move him to a little concern for me now, though the criminal part of our correspondence, which I believed neither of us intended to fall into at the time, was broken off; that I desired to repent as sincerely as he had done, but entreated him to put me in some condition that I might not be exposed to the temptations which the devil never fails to excite us to from the frightful prospect of poverty and distress; and if he had the least apprehensions of my being troublesome to him, I begged he would put me in a posture {{to go back to my}} mother in Virginia, from when he knew I came, and that would put an end to all his fears on that account. I concluded, that if he would send me #50 more to facilitate my going away, I would send him back a general release, and would promise never to disturb him more with any importunities; unless it was to hear of the well-doing of the child, whom, if I found my mother living and my circumstances able, I would <b>send</b> <b>for</b> <b>to</b> come over to me, and take him also effectually off his hands.|$|E

6000|$|... "Keep her, I tell you, {{and have}} a woman in from the village to do the {{cleaning}} and go away again. My weekly expenses must and shall be lowered immediately. I don't <b>send</b> <b>for</b> you <b>to</b> make objections, Mrs. Michelson--I <b>send</b> <b>for</b> you <b>to</b> carry out my plans of economy. Dismiss the whole lazy pack of indoor servants to-morrow, except Porcher. She is as strong as a horse--and we'll make her work like a horse." ...|$|R
60|$|Instead of <b>sending</b> <b>for</b> Gloody <b>to</b> {{clear the}} table, he moved away the objects near him, {{so as to}} leave an empty space at his disposal.|$|R

6000|$|The medical {{testimony}} was more precise {{and more to}} the purpose than it sometimes is in a Court of Justice. 'You had better <b>send</b> <b>for</b> something <b>to</b> cover it. All's over.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "General Olaf, of my guard," [...] she answered, [...] "Governor of the State Prison. You remember, you wished me <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>for</b> him <b>to</b> {{settle the}} point {{as to which}} we were arguing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho! uncle Ole; here's a business. Sich a to do--wounds, blood, and murder! or {{at least}} an attempt at it;--the whole {{settlement}} in arms, and the parson <b>sends</b> <b>for</b> you <b>to</b> take command!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Police, indeed!" [...] she answered. [...] "Do {{you know}} that all {{they have done so}} far is <b>to</b> keep <b>sending</b> <b>for</b> me <b>to</b> go and look at dead bodies down at the Morgue? I think that I shall <b>send</b> over <b>for</b> an English detective." ...|$|R

"I {{was about}} <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>for</b> you, Captain Wallingford," [...] said Emily, the instant she saw me, and {{confirming}} my conceited conjectures, by blushing deeper than I {{had seen her}} before, {{in the whole of}} that blushing, sensitive, and enjoyable day; [...] "about <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>for</b> you, <b>to</b> take charge of your treasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not {{suppose he}} wants me in any haste at all. He may have spoken to the king about me, and when Edward again spoke of my {{returning}} he would simply <b>send</b> <b>for</b> me <b>to</b> come at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now go, divine Prince," [...] she said, [...] "and you his followers, go, all of you, {{and leave}} me to my lonely house, until Pharaoh <b>sends</b> <b>for</b> me <b>to</b> share that new realm which he {{inherits}} beyond the West." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Come this way, then," [...] said Tom, {{wondering}} if this young fellow belonged to Guest & Co.'s Wharf, for his imagination ran continually toward that particular spot; and uncle Deane might any time be <b>sending</b> <b>for</b> him <b>to</b> {{say that there was}} a situation at liberty.|$|R
60|$|Her first inquire {{was after}} the watch-tower. She did not care for any {{discomfort}} if her vassals would be faithful, and hold it out for her, till she could <b>send</b> <b>for</b> help <b>to</b> the allies of her husband's house, and her eyes glanced as she spoke.|$|R
