Wideband spectra of EGG signals were evaluated from sustained and intermittent phonation under various conditions, including changes of electrode position, vowel, subglottal pressure and SPL. Recordings were made of subjects producing /pV/ utterances with simultaneous acquisition of EGG and intraoral pressure. The EGG spectrum envelope was found to be quite linear in dB/octave, {{with the exception of the}} fundamental partial. The EGG spectrum effects of vowel changes were negligible. EGG <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> change with SPL was large at phonation onset and small in loud phonation. Additionally, recordings from an existing database of 8 trained male singers were analysed for EGG spectrum variation with SPL. The singers performed crescendo tasks on sustained tones, with a typical SPL variation of up to 20 dB from soft to loud. The corresponding EGG spectra had slopes of - 14 to ‑ 9  dB/octave. The variation in EGG <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> was again small, on the order of one quarter of the slope variation in the airborne spectrum. Occasionally, ripple in the EGG spectrum envelope was present, due to double peaks in the time derivative of the closing part of the EGG waveform. We conclude that the EGG <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> appears to offer a convenient contacting criterion, but will be harder to use for judging vocal effort beyond contacting...|$|E
40|$|Modelling the size-abundance {{spectrum}} of phytoplankton {{has proven to}} be a very useful tool for the analysis of physical-biological coupling and the vertical flux of carbon in oceanic ecosystems at different scales. A frequent observation relates high phytoplankton biovolume in productive regions with flatter <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> and the opposite in oligotrophic ecosystems. Rather than this, the relationship between high biovolume phytoplankton assemblages and flatter size-abundance spectra does not correspond with measurements of the phytoplankton community in the Atlantic Ocean open waters. As part of the Malaspina Circunnavegation Expedition, sixty seven sampling stations within the Atlantic Ocean covering six oceanographic provinces, at different seasons, produced a complete set of phytoplankton size-spectra whose slope and biovolume did not show any obvious interrelation. In these oligotrophic sites, small (procaryotes) and medium-size (nanoplankton) cells are responsible for the most part of biovolume, and their response to environmental conditions does not apply to changes in the size-abundance <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> as expected in richer, large-cell dominated ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{long-term}} {{evolution of}} scaling (fractal) {{characteristics of the}} ULF geomagnetic fields in the seismoactive region of the Guam Island is studied {{in relation to the}} strong (Ms = 8. 0) nearby earthquake of 8 August 1993. The selected period covers 10 months before and 10 months after the earthquake. The FFT procedure, Burlaga-Klein approach and Higuchi method, have been applied to calculate the scaling exponents and fractal dimensions of the ULF time series. It is found that the spectrum of ULF emissions exhibits, on average, a power law behaviour S(f) ? f - b, which is a fingerprint of the typical fractal (self-affine) time series. The <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> b fluctuates quasi-periodically during the course of time in a range of b = 2. 5 ? 0. 7, which corresponds to the fractional Brownian motion with both persistent and antipersistent behaviour. An tendency is also found for the <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> to decrease gradually when approaching the earthquake date. Such a tendency manifests itself at all local times, showing a gradual evolution {{of the structure of the}} ULF noise to a typical flicker noise structure in proximity to the large earthquake event. We suggest considering such a peculiarity as an earthquake precursory signature. One more effect related to the earthquake is revealed: the longest quasi-period, which is 27 days, disappeared from the variations of the ULF emission <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> during the earthquake, and it reappeared three months after the event. Physical interpretation of the peculiarities revealed has been done on the basis of the SOC (self-organized criticality) concept...|$|E
40|$|A 2 x 3 within groups {{experiment}} with {{two levels of}} sound intensity and three levels of tempo of sound rhythm was conducted. Eleven psychology students participated in the study.

Decrease in SMI indexes in low and medium spectral bands occurred with more intensive sound rhythms {{as a function of}} rhythm tempo increase which may point to increased stress and mental load. Spectral analysis showed no clear interference between sound and cardiac rhythm. Changes in 1 /f <b>spectra</b> <b>slopes</b> were similar to those of SMI indexes. A decrease in correlation dimension for more intensive rhythms points to decrease of series dimensionality which is probably the result of domination of non-linear factors determining dynamic system.

40|$|Fish size-spectra {{provide a}} simple {{synthetic}} metric {{to assess the}} effects of pressures on the overall function of river ecosystems. An exploration {{of the effects of}} hydrological pressures on this metric is addressed in order to test its sensitiveness as a potential holistic indicator of ecological integrity. A set of 652 sampling sites with individual fish length data were used to compare the size-spectra among unimpaired sites and sites only affected by hydrological pressures. The variation of size-spectra along a gradient of rheophily was also considered. Our results show that size <b>spectra</b> <b>slopes</b> are naturally steeper in rheophilic than in limnephilic reaches. According to this, hydrological alterations produce different responses in the fish community size spectra. Hydrologically impaired rheophilic reaches show an increase in the ecological efficiency (size <b>spectra</b> <b>slope)</b> but a decrease in community capacity (elevation of the size spectra), whereas limnephilic reaches experience a decrease in the ecological efficiency but an increase in the food-web capacity (increased elevation of the size spectra).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{importance}} of source <b>spectrum</b> <b>slopes</b> {{in the perception of}} phonation by White Hmong listeners. In White Hmong, non-modal phonation (breathy or creaky voice) accompanies certain lexical tones, but its importance in tonal contrasts is unclear. In this study, native listeners participated in two perception tasks, in which they were asked to identify the word they heard. In the _rst task, participants heard natural stimuli with manipulated F 0 and duration (phonation unchanged). Results indicate that phonation is important in identifying the breathy tone, but not the creaky tone. Thus, breathiness can be viewed as contrastive in White Hmong. Next, to understand which parts of the source spectrum listeners use to perceive contrastive breathy phonation, source <b>spectrum</b> <b>slopes</b> were manipulated in the second task to create stimuli ranging from modal to breathy sounding, with F 0 held constant. Results indicate that changes in H 1 -H 2 (di_erence in amplitude between the _rst and second harmonics) and H 2 -H 4 (di_erence in amplitude between the second and fourth harmonics) are independently important for distinguishing breathy from modal phonation, consistent with the view that the percept of breathiness is inuenced by a steep drop in harmonic energy in the lower frequencies...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the power spectra of outflow-driven turbulence through high-resolution three-dimensional isothermal numerical simulations where the turbulence is driven locally in real-space {{by a simple}} spherical outflow model. The resulting turbulent flow saturates at an average Mach number of ~ 2. 5 and is analysed through density and velocity power spectra, including {{an investigation of the}} evolution of the solenoidal and compressional components. We obtain a shallow density power spectrum with a slope of ~- 1. 2 attributed to the presence of a network of localised dense filamentary structures formed by strong shock interactions. The total velocity power <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> is found to be ~- 2. 0, representative of Burgers shock dominated turbulence model. The density weighted velocity power <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> is measured as ~- 1. 6, slightly less than the expected Kolmogorov scaling value (slope of - 5 / 3) found in previous works. The discrepancy may be caused by the nature of our real space driving model and we suggest there is no universal scaling law for supersonic compressible turbulence. We find that on average, solenoidal modes slightly dominate in our turbulence model as the interaction between strong curved compressible shocks generates solenoidal modes, and compressible modes decay faster.

40|$|A {{simulated}} loess watershed, {{where the}} loess material and relief properly represent the true loess surface, is adopted {{to investigate the}} variation in <b>slope</b> <b>spectrum</b> with loess watershed evolution. The evolution of the simulated loess watershed was driven by the exogenetic force of artificial rainfall. For {{a period of three}} months, twenty artificial rainfall events with different intensities and durations were carried out. In the process, nine DEM data sets, each with 10 mm grid resolution, were established by the method of close-range photogrammetry. The <b>slope</b> <b>spectra</b> were then extracted from these DEMs. Subsequent series of carefully designed quantitative analyses indicated a strong relationship between the <b>slope</b> <b>spectrum</b> and the evolution of the simulated loess watershed. Quantitative indices of the <b>slope</b> <b>spectrum</b> varied regularly following the evolution of the simulated loess watershed. Mean <b>slope,</b> <b>slope</b> <b>spectrum</b> information entropy (H), terrain driving force (Td), Mean patch area (AREA_MN), Contagion Index (CONTAG), and Patch Cohesion Index (COHESION) kept increasing following the evolution of the simulated watershed, while skewness (S), Perimeter-Area Fractal Dimension (PAFRAC), and Interspersion and Juxtaposition Index (IJI) represented an opposite trend. All the indices changed actively in the early and active development periods, but slowly in the stable development periods. These experimental results indicate that the time series of <b>slope</b> <b>spectra</b> was able to effectively depict the slope distribution of the simulated loess watershed, thus presenting a potential method for modeling loess landforms.

40|$|Visual {{discomfort}} {{consists of}} the adverse effects of viewing certain visual stimuli such as stripes and particular filtered noise patterns. Noise patterns with amplitude spectra differing from those typical of natural images are judged as uncomfortable. Specifically, noise filtered to have 1 /f 2 amplitude a spectrum is judged to be more uncomfortable than 1 /f noise (Juricevic et al 2010, Perception 39, 884 – 899). In the present study, we investigated whether stimuli with amplitude <b>spectrum</b> <b>slopes</b> previously judged to be uncomfortable affect performance on visual tasks. In {{the first part of}} the experiment, contrast detection thresholds for a target against 1 /f and 1 /f 2 backgrounds were measured using a staircase procedure, in order to determine performance-matched contrast levels for the target. Our hypothesis is that, in the visual search task, observers will have a shorter reaction time for target absent responses for the 1 /f 2 trials if they are visually uncomfortable, when conditions are matched for accuracy. With low-contrast targets, no significant differences in reaction times or accuracy were found. With high-contrast targets, reaction times were shorter with the 1 /f 2 background compared to the 1 /f background, but there was no reduction in accuracy. Eye-movement data showed there to be no differences in either saccade length or fixation duration for the two backgrounds. Therefore, although stimuli with atypical amplitude <b>spectrum</b> <b>slopes</b> have previously been shown to increase visual discomfort judgments, we found no evidence that this is associated with impaired performance in a visual search task...|$|R

We examined how changes in fishing pressure and benthic habitat composition influenced the size spectra of island-scale reef fish communities in Lau, Fiji. Between 2000 and 2006 fishing pressure {{declined in the}} Lau Islands due to declining human populations and reduced demand for fresh fish. At the same time, coral cover declined and fine-scale architectural complexity eroded due to coral bleaching and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci. We examined the size distribution of reef fish communities using size spectra analysis, the linearized relationship between abundance and body size class. Spatial variation in fishing pressure accounted for 31 % {{of the variation in}} the slope of the size spectra in 2000, higher fishing pressure being associated with a steeper slope, which is indicative of fewer large-bodied fish and/or more small-bodied fish. Conversely, in 2006 spatial variation in habitat explained 53 % of the variation in the size <b>spectra</b> <b>slopes,</b> and the relationship with fishing pressure was much weaker (12 % of variation) than in 2000. Reduced cover of corals and lower structural complexity was associated with less steep size <b>spectra</b> <b>slopes,</b> primarily due to reduced abundance of fish < 20 cm. Habitat degradation will compound effects of fishing on coral reefs as increased fishing reduces large-bodied target species, while habitat loss results in fewer small-bodied juveniles and prey that replenish stocks and provide dietary resources for predatory target species. Effective management of reef resources therefore depends on both reducing fishing pressure and maintaining processes that encourage rapid recovery of coral habitat...|$|R

The first objective of this project was to describe the response of biological assemblages along a gradient of urbanization and to compare metrics of watershed imperviousness in order to determine, as has been suggested in the literature, whether effective imperviousness, which represents the proportion of impervious area directly connected to the stream by storm sewers, is a better predictor of stream impairement than total imperviousness in the watershed. Decline in sensitive taxa abundance is initiated at 14 % total imperviousness and 3 % effective imperviousness in the Ottawa-Carleton region and, total and effective imperviousness have equivalent predictive power. The second objective of this project was to describe how the structure of metazoan assemblages in urban streams, as described by size spectra attributes (i. e. slopes, intercepts, number of logarithmic size classes occupied, and residual variance), varies with watershed size, land use and water quality. Streams size spectra of the Ottawa-Gatineau region have relatively shallow slopes, reflecting relatively higher densities of organisms in the larger size classes compared to other ecosystem types (e. g. lakes, oceans, soils, coastal waters). Size <b>spectra</b> <b>slopes,</b> density corrected for size, number of size classes, and residual variance vary predictably along gradients of watershed size, watershed proportion of natural land use and periphyton chlorophyll a.

We show that an outflowing corona reproduces the hard-state spectrum of Cyg X- 1 and similar objects. The dynamic model predicts a correlation between the observed amplitude of reflection R and the X-ray <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> Gamma since both strongly depend on beta. A similar correlation was observed and its shape is well fitted by the dynamic model.

This dissertation describes the first detailed analysis of this data set. Ganymede and Callisto subsolar temperatures are 10 °K and 5 °K respectively below equilibrium values. Equatorial nighttime temperatures are between 100 °K and 75 °K, Callisto and Europa being colder than Ganymede. The diurnal temperature profiles can be matched by 2 -layer surfaces that are also consistent with the eclipse cooling observed from earth, though previous eclipse models underestimated thermal inertias by about 50 %. Substrate thermal inertias in the 2 -layer models are a factor of several lower than for solid ice. These are 'cold spots' on Ganymede and Callisto that are not high-albedo regions, which may indicate large thermal inertia anomalies. All <b>spectra</b> show a <b>slope</b> of increasing brightness temperature with decreasing wavelength, indicating local temperature contrasts of 10 - 50 °K. Callisto spectra steepen dramatically towards the terminator, a trend largely matched with a laterally-homogeneous model surface having lunar-like roughness, though some lateral variation in albedo and/or thermal inertia may also be required. Subsolar Ganymede spectra are steeper than those on Callisto, {{but there is no}} steepening towards the terminator, indicating a much smoother surface than Callisto's. The <b>spectrum</b> <b>slopes</b> on Ganymede may indicate large lateral variations in albedo and thermal inertia. A surface with similar areal coverage of dark, very low thermal inertia material, and bright material with thermal inertia a factor of 2 - 3 below solid ice, fits the diurnal and eclipse curves, and (less accurately) the IRIS <b>spectrum</b> <b>slopes.</b> Europa <b>spectra</b> have very small slopes, indicating a smooth and homogeneous surface. Modelling of surface water ice migration gives a possible explanation for the inferred lateral inhomogeneities on Ganymede. Dirty ice surfaces at Jupiter are subject to segregation into high-albedo ice-rich cold spots and ice-free regions covered in lag deposits, on decade timescales. Ion sputtering and micrometeorite bombardment are generally insufficient to prevent the segregation.

40|$|The κ {{parameter}} (Anderson and Hough, 1984), and namely its site-specific component (κ 0), {{is important}} for predicting and simulating high-frequency ground motion. We develop a framework for estimating κ 0 and addressing uncertainties under the challenging conditions often imposed in practice: 1. Low seismicity (limited, poor-quality, distant records); 2. Limited-bandwidth data from the Transportable Array (maximum usable frequency 16 Hz); 3. Low magnitudes (ML 1. 2 - 3. 4) and large uncertainty in stress drop (corner frequency). We cannot resolve stress drop within the bandwidth, so we propose an approach that only requires {{upper and lower bounds}} on its regional values to estimate κ 0. To address uncertainties, we combine three measurement approaches (acceleration <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope,</b> AS; displacement <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope,</b> DS; broadband spectral fit, BB). We also examine the effect of crustal amplification, and find that neglecting it can affect κ 0 by up to 35 %. DS estimates greatly exceed AS estimates. We propose a reason behind this bias, related to the residual effect of the corner frequency on κAS and κDS. For our region, we estimate a frequency-independent mean S-wave Q of 900 ± 300 at 9 - 16 Hz, and an ensemble mean κ 0 over all sites of 0. 033 ± 0. 014 s. This value is similar to the native κ 0 of the NGA-West 2 ground motion prediction equations, indicating that these {{do not need to be}} adjusted for κ 0 for use in Southern Arizona. We find that stress drop values in this region may be higher compared to estimates of previous studies, possibly due to trade-offs between stress drop and κ 0. For this dataset, the within-approach uncertainty is much larger than the between-approach uncertainty, and it cannot be reduced if the data quality is not improved. The challenges discussed here will be relevant in studies of κ for other regions with band-limited data, e. g., any region where data come primarily from the TA...|$|E

This suggests that full recovery of coral reef fish assemblages in terms of abundance–biomass is considerably longer than generally believed.

Under stable conditions, AES occasionally form as well, indicating the appearance of occasional mixing events reflected in the electric field perturbations. AES magnitudes under stable conditions are relatively small, except in special cases such as high humidity and fog. The analysis of electric field (EF) spectra gives additional useful information on the parameters of the atmospheric boundary layer and its turbulence. A rather sharp change in the <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> takes place in the vicinity of 0. 02 Hz under stable conditions. The characteristic slope of the spectrum and its change are reproduced in a simple model of EF formation...|$|E
40|$|Light {{absorbance}} {{by water}} samples of 16 lagoons was measured between 250 and 400 nm. From these readings, we extract absorbance at 254 nm (A 254), and <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope,</b> S*. These two descriptors are negatively correlated, so that samples are distributed along a hyperbola, between an "oceanic" (= oligotrophic) pole and a "eutrophic" (or coastal) pole. We determine an "optical oceanic index", OOI as the curvilinear abscissa of each sample along the A 254 -vs-S* hyperbolic regression curve. OOI exhibits significant correlations with several water characteristics (particulate organic matter, total dissolved nutrients). It also correlates well with an estimator of potential flushing rate base on reef morphometry and swell energy distribution. OOI thus appears adequate {{as a highly}} sensitive, and at least semi-quantitative, estimator of the oceanic/coastal gradient. Absorbance {{can be used as}} a rapid, sensitive, and relatively cheap method for studying DOC distribution, qualitative and quantitative, in coral-reef lagoons. An improvement of the data base is planned, and necessary to confirm the present results. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} many {{experiments}} on {{a search of}} fractionally charged particles in cosmic rays have been reviewed. The registered by ATIC and PAMELA experiments change of the proton energy spectrum at about 250 GeV can be explained if fractionally charged particles with another energy <b>spectrum</b> <b>slope</b> actually mixed with protons but cannot be separated because of a strong dE/dx fluctuations. The performed simulations show that multilayer detectors can seriously help in such separation. In the Aragats experiment performed using multilayer proportional counter combined with hadron calorimeter a group of 4 e/ 3 like events with unexpectedly high average energy has been registered. It {{could be explained by}} their different from regular hadrons energy spectrum. The ATIC experiment ionization spectrum in single charged particle area has been examined. An interesting bump in 2 e/ 3 charge region was observed. The events in the bump have very different from regular protons angular distribution. Comment: 5 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the luminosity and redshift {{dependence of the}} quasar continuum by means of composite spectrum using a large non-BAL radio-quiet quasar sample drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Quasar continuum slopes in the UV-Opt band are measured at two different wavelength ranges, i. e., α_ν 12 (1000 ∼ 2000 Å) and α_ν 24 (2000 ∼ 4000 Å) derived from power law fitting. Generally, the UV <b>spectra</b> <b>slope</b> becomes harder (higher α_ν) towards higher bolometric luminosity. On the other hand, when quasars are further grouped into luminosity bins, we find both α_ν 12 and α_ν 24 show significant anti-correlation with redshift (i. e., quasar continuum becomes redder towards higher redshift). We suggest that the cosmic dust extinction is very likely {{the cause of this}} observed α_ν-z relation. We build a simple cosmic dust extinction model to quantify the observed reddening tendency and find an effective dust density nσ_v ∼ 10 ^- 5 h Mpc^- 1 at z< 1. 5. The other possibilities that could produce such a reddening effect have also been discussed. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures; published in ApJ...|$|R
40|$|Isopycnal <b>slope</b> <b>spectra</b> were {{computed}} from thermistor data obtained using a microstructure platform towed through turbulence generated by internal tidal motions near the Hawaiian Ridge. The spectra {{were compared with}} turbulence dissipation rates that are estimated using shear probes. The turbulence sub-range of isopycnal <b>slope</b> <b>spectra</b> extends to surprisingly large horizontal wavelengths (100 m). A four-order-of-magnitude range in turbulence dissipation rates at this site reveals that isopycnal <b>slope</b> <b>spectra</b> 2 / 3 k 1 / 3 x. The turbulence spectral subrange (kx 0. 4 cpm) responds to the dissipation rate as predicted by the Batchelor model spectrum, both in amplitude and towed vertical coherence. Scales between 100 and 1000 m are modeled by a linear combination of internal waves and turbulence while at larger scales internal waves dominate. The broad bandwidth of the turbulence subrange means that a fit of spectral amplitude to the Batchelor model yields reasonable estimates of, even when applied at scales of tens of meters that in vertical profiles would be obscured by other fine structure. 1...|$|R
40|$|Large scale {{studies on}} {{individual}} size distribution of fish have primarily been done at community level, but little {{attention is paid}} at species level. We described fish size structure by using mean size, size diversity and the slope of linear size spectra of six common European fish species to compare whether these metrics responded to the same large-scale continental gradients. As predictors, we included several environmental variables and relative estimates of abundance (catch per unit effort) as indicator of density-dependent effects. We found differences in {{the strength of the}} main predictors of size structure between the six species, but the direction of the response was relatively similar and consistent for most of the size metrics. Temperature variations across Europe weakly induced the similar negative response to the size metrics for most species. However, we found an unexpectedly strong density dependence of size structure in all species, resulting in lower mean body size and size diversity and steeper size <b>spectra</b> <b>slopes.</b> This suggests that the density-dependent effect is so far an underestimated driver of fish size structure...|$|R
