This study examined {{the strength of the}} association between the electromyographic activities and the acceleration/deceleration of the cervical and thoracic spine, and its correlation with the functional disabilities in individuals with neck pain. Methods Time history of the cervical and thoracic acceleration/deceleration and EMG activity was acquired in thirty-four subjects with chronic neck pain and thirty-four age- and gender-matched asymptomatic subjects during active neck movements. The strength of the association between the electromyographic activity of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscles</b> and the cervical and thoracic acceleration/deceleration was determined using cross-correlation method. Relationship between the strength of this association and the severity of the functional disabilities in neck pain group was examined using correlation analysis. Findings The strength of the association between cervical and thoracic acceleration/deceleration and electromyographic activities was significantly lower in neck pain group. Significant negative correlations were found between the functional disability level and the strength of this defined association in the symptomatic group. Interpretation The compromised capability of the <b>spinal</b> <b>muscles</b> to produce acceleration/deceleration in the neck pain group may imply an impaired electromechanical coupling of these <b>spinal</b> <b>muscles</b> when performing neck movements. Significant negative correlation of the degree of functional disabilities suggests that the present approach can be used as an objective and specific evaluation of the dynamic performance of the <b>spinal</b> <b>muscles</b> and its relationship with the functional disabilities in neck pain subjects.

The encoded protein is a Ca2+-permeable, nonselective cation channel that has been found involved in multiple physiologic functions, dysfunctions and also disease. It functions in the regulation of systemic osmotic pressure by the brain, in vascular function, in liver, intestinal, renal and bladder function, in skin barrier function and response of the skin to ultraviolet-B radiation, in growth and structural integrity of the skeleton, in function of joints, in airway- and lung function, in retinal and inner ear function, and in pain. The channel is activated by osmotic, mechanical and chemical cues. It also responds to thermal changes (warmth). Channel activation can be sensitized by inflammation and injury. Hereditary channelopathy mutations of TRPV4 lead to skeletal dysplasias, premature osteoarthritis, and neurological motor function disorders as a manifestation of a motor neuropathy or <b>spinal</b> <b>muscle</b> atrophy.|$|E

This model is characterized by very low levels of the survival motor neuron protein, slow disease progression and motor neuron loss, which enables to detect disease-modifying effects at delayed time intervals. Lithium administration attenuates the decrease in motor activity and provides full protection from motor neuron loss occurring in SMA-III mice, throughout the disease course. In addition, lithium prevents motor neuron enlargement and motor neuron heterotopy and suppresses the occurrence of radial-like glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining in the ventral white matter of SMA-III mice. In SMA-III mice long-term lithium administration determines a dramatic increase of survival motor neuron protein levels in the spinal cord. These data demonstrate that long-term lithium administration during a long-lasting motor neuron disorder attenuates behavioural deficit and neuropathology. Since low level of survival motor neuron protein is bound to disease severity in SMA, the robust increase in protein level produced by lithium provides solid evidence which calls for further investigations considering lithium in the long-term treatment of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscle</b> atrophy...|$|E

Thus imbalance of the <b>spinal</b> <b>muscles</b> appearing after growth has ceased produces little or no lateral curvature. A primary disturbance of the vertebral growth centres has not yet been proven, but it is thought that, once a lateral curve has developed. the imbalance in the distribution of stress on the epiphysial plates increases the deformity following the laws ofepiphysial growth (Hueter 1862, Volkmann 1872) and the recent studies of Trueta (1957). Steindler (1951) stated that “the fact that the deformity develops under gravitational influence implies that it is selective, and this again means that certain predisposing factors must be at work. ” FIG.

Some {{officers}} have complained of lower back pain and have attributed the cause to wearing Metvest. This has raised {{the question as to}} whether or not wearing police body armour is related to low back pain issues. In order to investigate this, a study was carried out to determine the physiological effect of wearing body armour. This was assessed by measuring spinal torque / range of motion (RoM), muscle activity (EMG) during spinal flexion and extension, functional health score and subjective back pain, in both a Control Group and a non-specific Low Back Pain Group (LBP - identified by Occupational Health), to determine differences between these two groups. Additionally, the LBP group underwent an 8 week rehabilitation programme, devised and executed by Occupational Health, MPS. Functional and subjective assessments were taken group prior, mid and post rehabilitation. Data showed that wearing Metvest body armour did not have a significant effect on either spinal range of motion nor <b>spinal</b> <b>muscle</b> activity during forward flexion and backward extension in either the control or LBP subjects.

Ten healthy participants (19 - 25 years, 5 male, 5 female) performed exercise that involved holding the upper body unsupported in slight extension until fatigue and then, after 30 minutes of rest, for repeated bursts of 24 seconds. ICCs indicated good to excellent reliability of baseline measures (TOI: 0. 75) and of amplitude changes during fatigue (PCr: 0. 73, TOI: 0. 69, HHb: 0. 80), and recovery (HHb: 0. 96) and poor to fair reliability for time constants describing rates of change during fatigue (PCr: 0. 11) and recovery (PCr: 0. 31, HHb: 0. 47).

40|$|Spinal {{manipulation}} is {{a manual}} therapy approach commonly employed by chiropractors, osteopaths and manipulative physiotherapists {{in the treatment}} of back pain. It is characterised by a rapid high velocity, low amplitude thrust which commonly causes an audible ‘pop’ or ‘cavitation’ in the joint. Any beneficial effects are generally explained with reference to changes in vertebral joint movement. This paper looks at the process of spinal manipulation {{to see if there is}} reason to expect effects beyond simple changes in the biomechanics of the spine. It shows that during the process of spinal manipulation, rapid stretching of <b>spinal</b> <b>muscles</b> is inevitable. It goes on to review recent evidence that muscle stretch is a potent stimulus for the upregulation of a splice product of the insulin-like growth factor gene by the stretched muscle. Evidence that the product of this gene (mechano-growth factor; MGF) promotes muscle growth and repair (myotrophism) is presented, together with evidence that MGF promotes the growth and repair of neurones (neurotrophism). Against this background the hypothesis is proposed that one of the effects of spinal manipulation is to stretch <b>spinal</b> <b>muscles</b> which will upregulate MGF and result in local myotrophic and neurotrophic effects. This growth factor hypothesis represents a major departure from the biomechanical and biopsychosocial models currently used to explain the effects of spinal manipulation, and could provide the basis for further studies aimed at defining the molecular correlates of this type of manual therapy.
