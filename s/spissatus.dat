5|$|Cirrus <b>Spissatus</b> {{clouds are}} the highest clouds of the main cloud genera. They may form in the higher {{tropopause}} or even at the lower stratosphere. They are dense and opaque, not allowing {{the light of the}} sun or moon to pass through. They are more common on the anvils of cumulonimbus clouds.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, <b>spissatus,</b> and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvinâ€“Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
2500|$|Cirriform clouds {{have three}} non-convective species that can form in mostly stable airmass conditions. [...] Cirrus {{fibratus}} comprise filaments {{that may be}} straight, wavy, or occasionally twisted by non-convective wind shear. The species uncinus is similar but has upturned hooks at the ends. [...] Cirrus <b>spissatus</b> appear as opaque patches that can show light grey shading.|$|E
2500|$|All cloud {{varieties}} {{fall into}} one of two main groups. [...] One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus (thin translucent), perlucidus (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and opacus (thick opaque). [...] These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. [...] All three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. [...] However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. [...] Opacity-based varieties are not applied to high clouds because they are always translucent, {{or in the case of}} cirrus <b>spissatus,</b> always opaque. [...] Similarly, these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.|$|E
5000|$|A {{different}} {{variety of}} cirrus <b>spissatus</b> also forms from phenomena {{that have nothing}} to do with cumulonimbus blow-off or dissipating cumulonimbus cells needed [...] When dense cirrus is formed by means other than by cumulonimbus blow-off or dissipating cumulonimbus clouds, it will frequently be seen as many dense patches at different levels (cirrus <b>spissatus</b> duplicatus), often mixed with thin cirrus filamentsneeded. Another variety, cirrus <b>spissatus</b> intortus, is sometimes described as looking like [...] "entangled sheaves" [...] of cirrus clouds. When viewed toward the sun, the denser patches often have gray bases.|$|E

50|$|Cirrus <b>spissatus</b> is {{the dense}} cirrus that will partly or {{completely}} hide the sun (or moon) and which appears dark grey when seen against the light.

50|$|Cirrus <b>spissatus</b> {{clouds are}} the highest of the main cloud genera, and may {{sometimes}} even occur in the lower stratosphere. The characteristic features of cirrus clouds are fine threads or wisps of ice crystals, generally white, but appearing grey when dense and seen against the light. There is no precipitation at the ground. It also frequently exhibits optical phenomena.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrostratus {{fibratus}} {{is a type}} of cirrostratus cloud. The name cirrostratus fibratus {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "fibrous". Cirrostratus fibratus is one of the two most common forms that cirrostratus often takes, with the other being cirrostratus nebulosus. They are formed from strong, continuous winds blowing at high altitudes, and they often cover {{a large portion of the}} sky. Cirrostratus fibratus may often develop from either cirrus fibratus or cirrus <b>spissatus</b> cloud. Precipitation is often imminent behind these clouds; however, they are not a precipitation-producing cloud.|$|E

40|$|Particle size spectra were {{measured}} during 20 hr of sampling in cirrus generating cells (uncinus, stratus, <b>spissatus,</b> thunderstorm anvil) and the particle concentration, mean crystal length, ice water content, reflectivity factor, and precipitation rate were calculated from these spectra. Average {{values of the}} physical properties in the generating cells were obtained. Growth {{was found to be}} downward, reaching a maximum ice water content just below the base of the generating cell. The maximum ice water contents (not including the thunderstorm anvil) were found in cirrus uncinus. Liquid water was not found throughout the cirrus sampling by measurement with the Johnson-Williams hot-wire liquid-water meter; however, it is believed that liquid water is present as a transient phase...|$|E
