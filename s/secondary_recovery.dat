25|$|Crude oil {{development}} and production in U.S. oil reservoirs can include {{up to three}} distinct phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or enhanced) recovery. During primary recovery only about 10 percent of a reservoir's original oil in place is typically produced. <b>Secondary</b> <b>recovery</b> techniques extend a field's productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production wellbore, resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place. However, {{with much of the}} easy-to-produce oil already recovered from U.S. oil fields, producers have attempted several tertiary, or enhanced oil recovery, techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir's original oil in place.|$|E
25|$|The Peruvian Constitution {{establishes}} {{equal protection}} for {{domestic and foreign}} investors who may enter into agreements with the Government and guarantees free access, possession, and disposal of foreign currency. Hydrocarbon Law No. 26844 of May 1997 eliminated the exclusive rights of the state-owned Petróleos del Perú S.A. to control the <b>secondary</b> <b>recovery</b> of crude oil, refining, and imports and subsequent resale of petroleum and byproducts. The Peruvian laws have attempted to ensure more-favorable minerals and crude {{oil and gas exploration}} and production contract terms for investors. Legal procedures to obtain mining rights were made easier by the enactment of complementary legislation Supreme Decree No. 018 of July 9, 1992. The Government relinquished exclusive control over exploration, mining, smelting, and refining of metals and fuel minerals. Individuals and private companies are allowed to hold mining permits in Peru. In the legal framework for investment and taxation, no distinction is made among domestic and foreign investors, corporations, joint ventures, and consortia formed in Peru or abroad. Municipalities and Regional governments in areas where mineral resources (metals and industrial minerals) are exploited will receive 50% of the taxes collected to be invested in education and social programs (health, housing, and others) in conformance with the Canon Minero (Ministry Resolution No. 266-2002-EF/15 of May 1, 2002). The remittance of dividends, depreciation, and royalties abroad has no restrictions. Contracts can be signed by investors, and the Government guarantees the stability of legal commitments and taxes. To increase protection of investors’ interests, Peru signed agreements with the World Bank’s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency in April 1991, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25312 and with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in December 2002, which was authorized by Legislative Decree No. 25809.|$|E

50|$|In {{situations}} where a packer must be easily {{removed from the}} well, such as <b>secondary</b> <b>recoveries,</b> re-completions, or to change out the production tubing, a retrievable packer must be used. To unset the tool, either a metal ring is sheared or a sleeve is shifted to disengage connecting components.

30|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} refers to several processes conducted to increase oil production from a reservoir after primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>recoveries,</b> which are typically performed by injecting water or gas. The injected fluid may push the oil or {{interact with the}} reservoir rock oil system to prepare suitable conditions for recovery. Injecting water alternating gas (WAG) shows better sweep efficiency than injecting water or gas alone (Irawan and Bataee 2014; Chalaturnyk and Li 2004; Chin et al. 2002).|$|R

50|$|Enhanced oil {{recovery}} (abbreviated EOR) is {{the implementation of}} various techniques for {{increasing the amount of}} crude oil that can be extracted from an oil field. Enhanced {{oil recovery}} is also called tertiary recovery (as opposed to primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>recovery).</b> According to the US Department of Energy, there are three primary techniques for EOR: thermal recovery, gas injection, and chemical injection. Sometimes the term quaternary recovery is used to refer to more advanced, speculative, EOR techniques. Using EOR, 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir's original oil can be extracted, compared with 20 to 40 percent using primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>recovery.</b>|$|E
30|$|A {{decrease}} in the viscosity of oil treated with AR 80 in the cores can be expected because {{an increase in the}} ratio between the short-chain n-alkane and long-chain n-alkane concentrations was found in the effluent oil, as described above. The {{decrease in}} viscosity would have improved the oil–water mobility ratio and the water sweep efficiency during <b>secondary</b> oil <b>recovery.</b> The brine injected during <b>secondary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> would, therefore, have flowed into regions that had not been flooded by brine during primary oil recovery. The remaining oil in those regions would have been displaced by the brine and an oil bank would have formed ahead of the slug of brine injected during <b>secondary</b> oil <b>recovery.</b> A high oil content fluid drained from the core when the oil bank reached the core outlet, as shown in Fig.  14.|$|R

50|$|But {{petroleum}} isn’t {{the only}} thing trapped in the earth. Water hides there too.

50|$|Over the {{lifetime}} of the well, the pressure falls {{and at some point}} there is insufficient underground pressure to force the oil to the surface. After natural reservoir drive diminishes, <b>secondary</b> <b>recovery</b> methods are applied. They rely on the supply of external energy into the reservoir in the form of injecting fluids to increase reservoir pressure, hence replacing or increasing the natural reservoir drive with an artificial drive. <b>Secondary</b> <b>recovery</b> techniques increase the reservoir's pressure by water injection, natural gas reinjection and gas lift, which injects air, carbon dioxide or some other gas into the bottom of an active well, reducing the overall density of fluid in the wellbore. Typical recovery factor from water-flood operations is about 30%, depending on the properties of the oil and the characteristics of the reservoir rock. On average, the recovery factor after primary and secondary oil recovery operations is between 35 and 45%.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Taiwan, {{secondary}} copper smelters {{and zinc}} recovery plants primarily utilize recovering metal from scrap and dross, and handles mostly fly ash and slag with high temperature to produce ZnO from the {{iron and steel}} industry. The materials may contain organic impurities, such as plastic and organic chloride chemicals, and amounts of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) are produced during the smelting process. Therefore, <b>secondary</b> metal <b>recovery</b> industries are major emission sources of PCDD/Fs, {{which may have been}} demonstrated to elicit oxidative stress and to involve the production of plasma malondialdehyde (MDA). Many studies have also indicated that the intake of antioxidants, smoking, age and exposure to environmental pollutants may be implicated to DNA damage or lipid peroxidation. This study therefore aims to elucidate the roles of occupational exposure like joining the smelting work, age, smoking and alcohol status, and antioxidant intake on oxidative damage in <b>secondary</b> metal <b>recovery</b> workers in Taiwan. 73 workers were recruited from 2 <b>secondary</b> metal <b>recovery</b> plants.

5000|$|As {{production}} {{began its}} inevitable decline with the exhaustion of easily recovered oil, and consequent drop in reservoir pressure, drillers began trying <b>secondary</b> <b>recovery</b> techniques. Gas injection was used from 1947 {{in the west}} part of the field, and several waterfloods were attempted as well. [...] Peak oil production from the entire Cat Canyon field was in 1953, coinciding with development of newly discovered pools and enhanced recovery techniques in existing drilling operations.|$|E
50|$|By {{properly}} {{managing the}} production rates, greater benefits {{can be had}} from solution gas drives. <b>Secondary</b> <b>recovery</b> involves the injection of gas or water to maintain reservoir pressure. The gas/oil ratio and the oil production rate are stable until the reservoir pressure drops below the bubble point when critical gas saturation is reached. When the gas is exhausted, the gas/oil ratio and the oil rate drops, the reservoir pressure has been reduced and the reservoir energy exhausted.|$|E
30|$|It {{has become}} {{increasingly}} necessary to produce oil and gas fields more economically and efficiently {{as a result of}} the ever-increasing demand for petroleum worldwide. Since a significant number of prominent oil fields are mature fields and the number of new discoveries per year is decreasing, it is become more imperative to use <b>secondary</b> oil <b>recovery</b> processes (Nwaozo 2006).|$|R

They concluded that silica nanoparticles are able to change the wettability of such rocks from oil-wet to mixed/water wet, and this means {{that this type of}} nanoparticles is useful for EOR. Moreover, they pointed out that the concentration of nanoparticles and salinity of the solution were the most important factors in changing the wettability of the calcite rock samples. Furthermore, Ju and Fan (2009) demonstrated that untreated polysilica nanoparticles could change the wettability of sandstones from oil wet to water wet by an adsorption phenomenon. In addition, adding untreated polysilica nanoparticles could improve the effective water permeability, while decreasing the absolute permeability of the addressed sandstone samples.|$|R
