40|$|The large-time {{behavior}} of {{solutions to the}} initial and initial boundary value problems for a onedimensional viscous polytropic ideal gas in unbounded domains is investigated. Using a <b>special</b> <b>cut-off</b> function to localize the problem, we derive a local representation for the speciøc volume. With {{the help of the}} local representation, and certain new estimates for the temperature and the stress, and the weighted energy estimates, we prove that in any bounded interval, the speciøc volume is pointwise bounded from below and above for all t 0 and a generalized solution is convergent as time goes to infinity...|$|E
40|$|Two {{component}} {{model for a}} description of the electromagnetic nucleon structure functions in low-x region, based on generalized vector dominance and color dipole approaches is briefly described. The model operates with the mesons of rho-family having the mass spectrum which is equidistant on square mass and takes into account the nondiagonal transitions in meson-nucleon scattering. The <b>special</b> <b>cut-off</b> factors are introduced in the model, to exclude the gamma-qq-V transitions {{in the case of the}} narrow qq-pairs. For the color dipole part of the model the well known FKS-parameterization is used.

40|$|Abstract. The classic {{problem of}} {{regularity}} of boundary points for higher-order PDEs is concerned. For second-order elliptic and parabolic equations, {{this study was}} completed by Wiener’s (1924) and Petrovskii’s (1934) criteria, and was extended to more general equations including quasilinear ones. Since the 1960 – 70 s, the main success was achieved for 2 mth-order elliptic PDEs (e. g., by Kondrat’ev and Maz’ya), while the higher-order parabolic ones, with infinitely oscillatory kernels, were not studied in such great details. As a basic model, explaining typical difficulties of regularity issues, the 1 D bi-harmonic equation in a domain shrinking to the origin (0, 0) is concentrated upon: ut = −uxxxx in Q 0 = {|x | 0 is a smooth function on [− 1, 0) and R(t) → 0 + as t → 0 −. The zero Dirichlet conditions on the lateral boundary of Q 0 and bounded initial data are posed: u = ux = 0 at x = ±R(t), − 1 ≤ t 0 : e. g., l = 4 is regular, while l = 5 is not; (ii) for R(t) = (−t) 1 / 4 ϕ(− ln(−t)) with ϕ(τ) → + ∞ as τ → +∞, regularity/irregularity of (0, 0) can be {{expressed in terms of}} an integral Petrovskii-like (Osgood–Dini) criterion. E. g., after a <b>special</b> “oscillatory <b>cut-off</b> ” of the boundary, the function ˜R(t) = 3 −...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe vibroacoustic bending {{properties}} of honeycomb sandwich panels with composite faces are studied from the wavenumber modulus to the mechanical impedance, {{passing through the}} modal density. Numerical results extracted from finite elements software computations are compared with analytical results. In both cases, the homogenization method {{is used to calculate}} the global properties of the sandwich panel. As faces are made of composite material, the classical laminate theory serves as reference. With particular conditions used in the application for symmetric panel, the original orthotropic mechanical properties can be reduced simply to three parameters commonly used in vibroacoustic characterisations. Theses three parameters are the mass per unit area, the bending rigidity and the out of plane shear rigidity. They govern simultaneously the wavenumber modulus, the modal frequencies, the modal density and the mechanical impedance. For all these vibroacoustic characterisations, a <b>special</b> frequency called <b>cut-off</b> frequency separates two domains. In the first domain, below the cut-off frequency or in low frequencies, the orthotropic sandwich panel has a classical isotropic plate behaviour. In the second domain, above the cut-off frequency or in high frequencies, the out of plane shear rigidity has a great importance that changes the behaviour. Experimental measurements of the bending wavenumber modulus and modal frequencies for our own application were carried out. In the domain of the vibroacoustic, the critical frequency is also an important frequency. It depends once again on the mass per unit area, the bending rigidity and the out of plane shear rigidity. The experimental and numerical results of the article are reasonably in agreement with the analytical formula. They all confirm the evolution in frequency through different boundary conditions around the panel. The analytical modal frequencies of rectangular sandwich panels with transverse shear, in simply supported boundary conditions are well known, but in free boundary conditions it is more difficult to predict them. For experiments however, this latter condition is the most usual one. We present, in this paper, an analytical formula that we have developed for the modal frequencies of such a panel in free boundary conditions. All parameters being controlled, it is possible from dynamic measurements and with a special process to identify some honeycomb and composite mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{correction}} to Merton (1973) ’s well-known classical case of pricing perpetual American put options by considering the same pricing problem under a stochastic volatility model {{with the assumption that}} the volatility is slowly varying. Two analytic formulae for the option price and the optimal exercise price of a perpetual American put option are derived, respectively. Upon comparing the results obtained from our analytic approximations with those calculated by a spectral collocation method, it is shown that our current approximation formulae provide fast and reasonably accurate numerical values of both option price and the optimal exercise price of a perpetual American put option, within the validity of the assumption we have made for the asymptotic expansion. We shall also show that the range of applicability of our formulae is remarkably wider than it was initially aimed for, after the original assumption on the order of the “volatility of volatility” being somewhat relaxed. Based on the newly-derived formulae, the quantitative effect of the stochastic volatility on the optimal exercise strategy of a perpetual American put option has also been discussed. A most noticeable and interesting result {{is that there is a}} <b>special</b> <b>cut-off</b> value for the spot variance, below which a perpetual American put option priced under the Heston model should be held longer than the case of the same option priced under the traditional Black-Scholes model, when the price of the underlying is falling...|$|E
