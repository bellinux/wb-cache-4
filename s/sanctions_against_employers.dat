40|$|The {{issue of}} labour {{migration}} {{is becoming more}} prominent in policy debates as employers are gradually more reliant on migrant workers from non-EU countries. The Commission's legislative proposal for a directive providing for <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>employers</b> of illegally staying third-country nationals forms {{an integral part of}} the EU's comprehensive and structural approach towards effective migration management. Although the phenomenon of undeclared work is not limited to migrants, the new legislation on <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>employers</b> of such persons presupposes that the chance to obtain work in the EU without the required legal status is a key inducement to illegal immigration. Based on the premise that employer sanctions set the moral tone for immigration policy at the workplace, this article intends to address one of the main causes of illegal migration: the black labour market. The article highlights the importance of having a harmonized EU framework for imposing <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>employers</b> of irregular migrants. It examines the scope of the draft directive and its features and evaluates national legislation by means of the following considerations: 1) What is the national legislation as far as sanctions of employers of illegal workers are concerned? 2) What kind of sanctions do they provide? 3) Are these sanctions effective and efficient? 4) How the Commission proposal can become successful in helping to remedy enforcement difficulties? 5) Which additional to preventive measures can be taken to achieve the above policy objective? 6) What consequences would the draft directive have on national legislation...|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. On 16 May 2007, the European Commission {{issued a}} Proposal for a Council Directive {{providing}} for <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>employers</b> of illegally staying third country nationals (COM(2007) 249. 1) The measure aims at providing a harmonised EU framework for imposing sanctions on employers for hiring third country nationals (TCNs) {{who do not}} enjoy a regular status of stay in the EU. The proposal would establish a common policy consisting of three main features. First, employers {{would be subject to}} a number of new administrative obligations that would need to be fulfilled before recruiting any TCNs. Noncompliance would lead to a series of punitive measures, financial sanctions and criminal penalties. Second, the procedure for operationalising complaints would be harmonised; and third, each member state would be required to inspect the employee records in 10 % of its registered companies...|$|E

40|$|Several {{factors have}} led to the current push for <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>employers</b> who hire illegal aliens. One main factor is the {{perception}} that illegal aliens take jobs from United States citizens and legal aliens, work- ers and negatively affect the national economy. Obviously, any percep- tion that the jobs of United States citizens are being lost tends to create an emotionally charged environment that hampers objective decision making. Further, frustration has built up because current legal mecha- nisms seem incapable of halting illegal immigration. This frustration has increased xenophobia. Finally, proponents of sanctions identify a major inequity in a law which punishes illegal immigrants but provides no sanc- tions against their employers. The answer, some say, is to end the 2 ̆ 2 pull 2 ̆ 2 of illegal immigration, i. e. eliminate employment opportunities in the United States by prohibiting employers from hiring illegals. Although employer sanctions temporarily satisfy an emotional need to do something to preserve citizens 2 ̆ 7 jobs from hordes of illegal aliens, they do not permanently address underlying problems. Congress must adopt a more sophisticated approach to illegal immigration and recog- nize the potential pitfalls of employer sanctions...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} recent legal {{developments on}} undocumented migrant workers, finds {{the acceptance of}} international legal standards unsatisfactory and argues that the private law rights derived from the "semi-legal" employment contract between the employer and the undocumented migrant worker generates a solid base for significant legal claims. It further monitors {{the promotion of the}} position of the undocumented migrant workers under recent EU law and calls for a re-focusing on the employment contract in the reading of a relevant EC Directive, with a particular emphasis on the issue of access to justice for the migrant workers. The increased number of undocumented migrants who leave their countries of origin for reasons outside the scope of the asylum procedure, as well as the circumstances under which this migration is undertaken and the working conditions of these individuals in the host countries, have brought about legal activities from governments and institutions such as the EU. The aim has in general been to establish <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>employers</b> of undocumented migrant workers, but a shift towards a compensatory, employee protective, attitude has recently emerged, both in EU legislation and in a broader perspective in US case law. The article concludes that such a development must be massively supported in relation to access to justice in order to fulfill the ambition. The poor legal position of the undocumented migrant workers is significantly connected to issues of legal representation, trade union participation and the threat of repatriation...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{significance of}} employers' collective action for economic performance is widely acknowledged, {{but has not}} been complemented with corresponding theory-guided research on the probability of collective action and the conditions for effective action. This thesis examines the nature of, the conditions for, {{and the consequences of}} employers' collective action on further training, a crucial component of a successful high-skill strategy for industries and nations. The study addresses three core issues of labour economics: transferability of training, skill shortages, and sharing of training costs between employer and employees. The enquiry builds on and adds to previous contributions that analyse transferable training as a collective good. It scrutinises the theoretical foundation and compares its implications with those of human capital theory. Finally, the empirical study of further education and training in four Norwegian industries is offered as a strategic test of these two alternative theories. The collective action perspective shares core assumptions of human capital theory, but integrates the possibility of collective action as a solution to some of the market failures associated with investment in transferable human capital. This alternative view also predicts in what labour market settings such action is likely to occur, building on Olson's work and theories of employers' collective action. The collective action perspective differs crucially from human capital theory by predicting that transferability is endogenous i. e. significantly shaped by employers' individual and collective action, and not simply by technology. Thus, 'endogenous transferability' is a principal link between the constitution of labour markets and employers' choice of training and skill supply strategies. The results confirm the prediction that transferability is 'endogenous'. Moreover, they suggest that employers' collective action is more likely to succeed in ensuring transferability and encouraging employee investment than is using <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>employers</b> to promote employer-financed transferable training...|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] Recently, {{the issues}} of {{immigration}} and immigration policy have garnered intense debate in the United States. Much of what Americans have discussed relates to border security, <b>sanctions</b> <b>against</b> <b>employers</b> who knowingly hire undocumented workers, and temporary and permanent paths to legalization for undocumented workers. This debate often overshadows a meaningful discussion {{about the future of}} workplace rights for undocumented workers who, despite their undocumented status, currently work in the United States and at times suffer labor and employment law violations in their workplaces. Unfortunately, the national immigration debate has not incorporated this discussion. Moreover, the current proposed federal immigration bills neither address nor clarify what effect they will have on the workplace rights of undocumented workers. Similar to Professor Cunningham-Parmeter’s article, this article focuses on one aspect of the new legal landscape for undocumented workers in the United States since the U. S. Supreme Court’s 2002 decision in Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. NLRB. One central element of this new legal landscape is ongoing confusion about what effect, if any, immigration policy has on federal and state labor and employment law in the United States. Below, I take a first step toward clarifying the extent to which immigration policy affects the rights of states to extend the full protection of their state labor and employment laws to undocumented workers. Specifically, I address the following unresolved question currently before many lower courts: When, if ever, does federal immigration law preempt certain state labor and employment law remedies? First, I briefly describe why this question has emerged and has become important in U. S. courts. Next, I describe recent U. S. Supreme Court Supremacy Clause jurisprudence indicating that some lower courts’ answers to the preemption question described above threaten to stretch the Supremacy Clause beyond its constitutionally-intended boundaries...|$|E
