First, the concordance between self-, peer-, and daily diary-reports of victimization was assessed. Participants were 188 Dutch adolescents (43 % male, Mage =  16. 07 years, SD = . 84) who participated in a classroom assessment and daily diary assessment (5 consecutive school days). Peer-reports (15 %) and self-reports (13 %) yielded higher prevalence rates than diary-reports (3 %). Second, associations of self- and peer-reported victimization with self-, peer-, and daily diary-reported internalizing problems were examined. Due to its low prevalence, diary-reported victimization could not be related to internalizing. The association of self- and peer-reported victimization with internalizing problems varied <b>by</b> informant (<b>self-</b> vs. peer-reported internalizing) and problem type (interpersonal vs. intrapersonal). Self- and peer-reported victimization were positively associated with daily internalizing affect.

50|$|Pollination {{and fruit}} {{formation}} depend on meiosis. Meiosis {{is central to}} the processes by which diploid microspore mother cells within the anther give rise to haploid pollen grains, and megaspore mother cells in ovules that are contained within the ovary give rise to haploid nuclei. Union of haploid nuclei from pollen and ovule (fertilization) can occur either <b>by</b> <b>self-</b> or cross-pollination. Fertilization leads to the formation of a diploid zygote that can then develop into an embryo within the emerging seed. Repeated fertilizations within the ovary are accompanied by maturation of the ovary to form the tomato fruit.|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{show that}} some {{fundamental}} self- and snap-stabilizing wave protocols (e. g., token circulation, PIF, etc.) implicitly assume a very light property that we call BreakingIn. We prove that BreakingIn is strictly induced <b>by</b> <b>self-</b> and snap-stabilization. Combined with a transformer, BreakingIn allows to easily turn the non-fault-tolerant versions of those protocols into snap-stabilizing versions. Unlike the previous solutions, the transformed protocols are very efficient and work at least with the same daemon as the initial versions extended to satisfy BreakingIn. Finally, we show how to use an additional property of the transformer to design snap-stabilizing extensions of those fundamental protocols like Mutual Exclusion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — CDMA and MIMO-CDMA systems using RAKE {{receivers}} {{are heavily}} limited <b>by</b> <b>self-</b> and multiple-accessinterference. Linear equalization {{is a means}} to remove this interference, however it is often not practical due to the enormous complexity, especially in the MIMO case. This paper presents an approach to greatly reduce the complexity of linear MIMO equalizers. It discusses the complexity reduction of the equalizer itself and describes a suboptimal low-complexity method to compute its coefficients. The application of frequency domain equalization using the overlap/add FFT method to MIMO systems is suggested. The coefficients of the joint equalizer/MIMO detector are also derived in the frequency domain, based on an approximation of an MMSE criterion. Performance results in terms of BER are quantified through simulations of a MIMO-extended UMTS-FDD downlink. I...|$|R

A general expression for arbitrary moments of the signal field operators is obtained and qualitative effects caused by non-linear treatment of quantum fluctuations are discussed. The behaviour of the exact steady-state intensity, {{as well as of}} the second-order correlation function and of the photon number fluctuations of the signal mode, is studied. A sub-Poissonian photon statistic is found in the above-threshold region and a critical increase in the photon number fluctuations is shown in the transition region for the case of relatively small non-linearities. Characteristic properties of the threshold behaviour are discussed in the case of large non-linearities...|$|R
