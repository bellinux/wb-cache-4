40|$|The {{present study}} explores {{the use of}} a {{conventional}} <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> of a primary school and its potential as a space for creative play and environmental learning. Children’s play behavior and views of the <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> are explored, as well as their vision for its improvement. The research constitutes part of a wider <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> project and was carried out in a primary school in Volos city, Greece, during the 2010 - 2011 schoolyear. Geographical and participatory design methods were used that capture children’s experience of space and their will for participation in redesigning their <b>school</b> <b>ground.</b> They included mapping of the physical features of the <b>school</b> <b>ground,</b> children’s drawings, interviews with children, and observation and mapping of children’s behavior in the <b>school</b> <b>ground.</b> Results indicate that children primarily view their <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> as a space for recreation, play, relaxation, and communication with peers. They mainly emphasize structured, pre-constructed elements, such as the football and basketball grounds, or the kiosk, which they use in both conventional and unconventional ways. However, the participants do not seem to have developed an adequate sense of place and belonging in their <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> environment. The paper presents insights on children’s play behavior and views for their <b>school</b> <b>ground,</b> the role of children as participants in the <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> design, and design principles for the improvement of the <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> as they have emerged from the research...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the role of}} <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> as outdoor learning resources for environmental education. The opportunities to use <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> are particularly prominent in tropical climate, where the weather permits plenty of outdoor learning activities. A study in primary schools in Jakarta explored the relationship between thespatial aspects of <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> {{and its role in}} providing access to outdoor environmental resources, from the perspectives of teachers and pupils. The findings reveal that the potentials of <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> environment in many schools have not been fully utilised. Outdoor opportunities offered by <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> environment do not immediately result in active environmental learning. The findings suggest the needs to rethink the position of <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> within the current spatial design of school environment, to address the demands for more engagement with nature and current perspectives towards environmental learning...|$|R

Henn became recognised as a teacher when he became a founding headmaster at Worksop College in Nottinghamshire; however he resigned in 1899 amidst differences with a new superior who disagreed with Henn's philosophy of a <b>school</b> <b>grounds</b> with beautiful buildings dominated by a chapel.|$|E

Residential areas of Millers Island, Edgemere, North Point, Bowleys Quarters and Turners Station suffered severe damage from the hurricane, with over 400people needing to be rescued. Over 300buildings were destroyed. The storm surge flooding killed a man in Dundalk, and either destroyed or greatly damaged most marinas. Strong winds downed 118trees on <b>school</b> <b>grounds</b> and hundreds of others elsewhere, some of which fell on power lines which resulted in leaving 220,000customers without power. The passage of Hurricane Isabel left 3,189tons (2,893t) of debris across the county.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} primary {{factors that influence}} {{the features of the}} environment at the common nursery <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> through analyses obtained by two types of data sets. One is about several examples of nursery school children’s play, the other is about free answer style questionnaire written by nursery teachers. The examples were selected form fieldnotes of photos taken by a nursery teacher through qualitative analysis. From these data, three facts became clear. First, the opportunities for changing the nursery <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> features lay in children’s play. Second, the material tools supported children’s creative performances. Third, changing the nursery worker’s motivation for risk led to the discovery of a new concept in children’s play with material tools (Sunoko). As a result, this paper clarified that the common environments of the nursery <b>school</b> <b>ground</b> changed into innovative one by children’s power of play. Besides, this study showed evidence for modification of the features of environment in nursery <b>school</b> <b>ground...</b>|$|R

Two days after the killings, a friend of Saari's, named Rauno, told 7 päivää that at 11:53 he received a call from Saari in which he confessed to having killed ten people. Saari is claimed to have spoken to Rauno in a calm manner, telling him that he wanted to say goodbye. He was found alive by the police at 12:30, having shot himself in the head. He was taken to Tampere University Hospital, where he was treated for his gunshot wound. He died a short time later at 17:40.|$|E
5|$|The regiment, {{originally}} headquartered at Pines Bridge Inn on Croton Lake, {{moved its}} headquarters to the Holbrook Military Academy, {{and the academic}} building at the school became Field Hospital No. 2 of the Atlantic Division of the American Red Cross. The ground floor of the west wing and the mess hall {{on the first floor}} was turned into a large, well-heated office with glass-partitioned private offices, and equipped with typewriters and mimeograph machines. The new regimental office had strong contrast with their Pines Bridge Inn office, it having been drafty, dirt-floored and poorly-lit. The site opened for their use on October 8, 1918, and the regiment fully demobilized on February 1, 1919. A reunion was held at the former <b>school</b> <b>grounds</b> for many of the troops from March 23 to 25, 1919.|$|E

5|$|Assisted by {{the school}} janitor Mister One, and pursued by a {{grotesque}} scarecrow-like being named Labor 9 who suddenly appears on the <b>school</b> <b>grounds,</b> Ryouta and Sakuya begin investigating the dome and the murder. They visit the lab and compare alibis; Shuu, who Ryouta distrusts, asks if Ryouta has forgotten anything important, to which he replies that he hasn't. Upon investigating the headmaster's office, they discover the headmaster had likewise been poisoned to death, what they saw earlier being merely pre-recorded footage; they also find a computer {{and a pair of}} documents, one titled The Human Representative and a torn, unreadable one titled Operation Hatoful. The Human Representative reveals that if the protagonist, a symbol of humanity, were to die, the campus would be sealed off and the birds inside handed over to humans as sacrifices—something confirmed when the computer is used to open a small hatch in the dome and students are shot dead as they attempt to flee—when the dome is lifted twelve hours after her death is reported.|$|E
