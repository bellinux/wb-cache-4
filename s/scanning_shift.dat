40|$|Introduction: The {{curriculum}} in most emergency medicine (EM) clerkships includes very little formalized training in point-of-care ultrasound. Medical schools {{have begun to}} implement ultrasound training in the pre-clinical curriculum, and the EM clerkship is an appropriate place to build upon this training. The objectives are (1) {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of implementing a focused ultrasound curriculum within an established EM clerkship and (2) to obtain feedback from medical students regarding the program. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of medical students during an EM clerkship year from July 1, 2011, to June 30, 2012. Participants included fourth-year medical students (n= 45) enrolled in the EM clerkship at our institution. The students underwent a structured program focused on the focused assessment with sonography for trauma exam and ultrasound-guided vascular access. At the conclusion of the rotation, they took a 10 -item multiple choice test assessing knowledge and image interpretation skills. A cohort of EM residents (n= 20) also took the multiple choice test but did not participate in the training with the students. We used an independent samples t-test to examine differences in test scores between the groups. Results: The medical students in the ultrasound training program scored significantly higher on the multiple-choice test than the EM residents, t(63) = 2. 3, p< 0. 05. The feedback from the students indicated that 82. 8 % were using ultrasound on their current rotations and the majority (55. 2 %) felt that the one-on-one <b>scanning</b> <b>shift</b> was the most valuable aspect of the curriculum. Discussion: Our study demonstrates support for an ultrasound training program for medical students in the EM clerkship. After completing the training, students were able to perform similarly to EM residents on a knowledge-based exam...|$|E

The proposed BIST TPG subside transitions that occur at scan inputs during <b>scan</b> <b>shift</b> operations and hence reduces switching {{activity in the}} CUT. The proposed BIST is comprised of two TPGs: LT-RTPG and 3 -weight WRBIST. Test patterns engender by the LT-RTPG detect easy-to-detect faults and test patterns generated by the 3 -weight WRBIST detect faults that abide undetected after LT-RTPG patterns are applied. The proposed BIST TPG does not require modification of delegation logics, {{which can lead to}} performance degeneracy.

A forthright solution is to reduce the speed of the test clock during <b>scan</b> <b>shift</b> operations. However, since most test application time of scan-based BIST is expend for <b>scan</b> <b>shift</b> operations, this will increase test application time by about a factor of if scan flip-flops are clocked at speed during <b>scan</b> <b>shift</b> operations.

40|$|Abstract—Reduction in test {{power is}} {{important}} to improve bat-tery lifetime in portable electronic devices employing periodic self-test, to increase reliability of testing, and to reduce test cost. In scan-based testing, a significant fraction of total test power is dissi-pated in the combinational block. In this paper, we present a novel circuit technique to virtually eliminate test power dissipation in combinational logic by masking signal transitions at the logic in-puts during <b>scan</b> <b>shifting.</b> We implement the masking effect by in-serting an extra supply gating transistor in the supply to ground path for the first-level gates at the outputs of the scan flip-flops. The supply gating transistor is turned off in the scan-in mode, essen-tially gating the supply. Adding an extra transistor in only one logic level renders significant advantages with respect to area, delay, and power overhead compared to existing methods, which use gating logic at the output of scan flip-flops. Moreover, the proposed gating technique allows a reduction in leakage power by input vector con-trol during <b>scan</b> <b>shifting.</b> Simulation results on ISCAS 89 bench-marks show an average improvement of 62 % in area overhead, 101 % in power overhead (in normal mode), and 94 % in delay over-head, compared to the lowest cost existing method.

40|$|Abstract — Reduction {{in average}} and peak power during test {{application}} {{is important to}} improve battery lifetime in portable electronic devices employing periodic self-test and to improve reliability/cost of testing. This paper proposes an integrated solution for peak and average power reduction in test-per-scan BIST by targeting power reduction in both combinational block and scan chain. First, we present a novel circuit technique, called First Level Supply gating (FLS), to virtually eliminate power dissipation in combinational logic by masking signal transition at the logic inputs during <b>scan</b> <b>shifting.</b> We realize the masking effect by inserting an extra supply gating transistor in the VDD to GND path for the first level gates at the output of scan flip-flops. Simulation results on ISCAS 89 benchmarks show an average reduction of 65 % in area overhead, 119 % in power overhead (in normal mode), and 104 % in delay overhead compared to lowest-cost known signal masking alternative. To reduce the leakage power of the combinational block, which is considerably high in scaled technologies, we propose input vector control using FLS during <b>scan</b> <b>shifting.</b> Experiments {{on a set of}} ISCAS 89 benchmarks show about 38 % average reduction in leakage power with the proposed leakage reduction technique. Second, to address the power in the scan chain, we propose an efficient scan partitioning technique that reduces both average and peak power in the <b>scan</b> chain during <b>shift</b> and functional cycles. Experiments on a set of ISCAS 89 benchmarks show 12. 6 % average reduction in peak power with the proposed partitioning method over partitioning according to RTL description. I...|$|R
