5|$|The {{number of}} <b>scribes</b> were disputed in the past. According to Kenyon's opinion {{there were five}} <b>scribes,</b> two <b>scribes</b> in the Old Testament (I and II) and three in the New (III, IV, and V). Subsequently, Skeat and Milne argued {{there were only two}} or {{possibly}} three <b>scribes.</b> Present scholars agreed in that case (Metzger, Aland, Hernández, Jongkind).|$|E
5|$|Fischer-Elfert distinguishes ancient Egyptian {{graffiti}} {{writing as}} a literary genre. During the New Kingdom, <b>scribes</b> who traveled to ancient sites often left graffiti messages {{on the walls of}} sacred mortuary temples and pyramids, usually in commemoration of these structures. Modern scholars do not consider these <b>scribes</b> to have been mere tourists, but pilgrims visiting sacred sites where the extinct cult centers could be used for communicating with the gods. There is evidence from an educational ostracon found in the tomb of Senenmut (TT71) that formulaic graffiti writing was practiced in scribal schools. In one graffiti message, left at the mortuary temple of Thutmose III at Deir el-Bahri, a modified saying from The Maxims of Ptahhotep is incorporated into a prayer written on the temple wall. <b>Scribes</b> usually wrote their graffiti in separate clusters to distinguish their graffiti from others'. This led to competition among <b>scribes,</b> who would sometimes denigrate the quality of graffiti inscribed by others, even ancestors from the scribal profession.|$|E
5|$|Under Plegmund's archbishopric, {{the quality}} of the Latin used by his <b>scribes</b> improved, surpassing the poor quality used by the <b>scribes</b> of the {{previous}} two archbishops, Ceolnoth and Æthelred. When Alfred died in 899, Plegmund crowned his son Edward as king.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Scribe's</b> {{influence}} on theater, according to Marvin J. Carlson, [...] "cannot be overestimated". Carlson observes that, unlike other influential theater thinkers, <b>Scribe</b> {{did not write}} prefaces or manifestos declaiming his ideas. <b>Scribe</b> influenced theater, instead, with craftsmanship. He honed a dramatic form into a reliable mould that could be applied not only to different content, but to different content {{from a variety of}} playwrights. Carlson identifies a single instance of <b>Scribe's</b> critical commentary from a speech <b>Scribe</b> gave to the Académie française in 1836. <b>Scribe</b> expressed his view of what draws the audiences to theater: ...|$|R

5|$|Tischendorf {{believed}} that four separate <b>scribes</b> (whom he named A, B, C and D) copied {{the work and}} that five correctors (whom he designated a, b, c, d and e) amended portions. He posited {{that one of the}} correctors was contemporaneous with the original <b>scribes,</b> and that the others worked in the 6th and 7th centuries. It is now agreed, after Milne and Skeat's reinvestigation, that Tischendorf was wrong—scribe C never existed. According to Tischendorf, scribe C wrote the poetic books of the Old Testament. These are written in a different format {{from the rest of the}} manuscript – they appear in two columns (the rest of books is in four columns), written stichometrically. Tischendorf probably interpreted the different formatting as indicating the existence of another scribe. The three remaining <b>scribes</b> are still identified by the letters that Tischendorf gave them: A, B, and D. Correctors were more, at least seven (a, b, c, ca, cb, cc, e).|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{feasibility}} of Ti film coated on glass substrate <b>scribed</b> via a 532 nm picosecond laser is investigated. Laser irradiations from the film side and from the transparent substrate side are performed for comparison. Optical microscopy, SEM, surface stylus and contact resistance measurement reveal that the Ti film can be completely removed with no damage to the glass substrate, using optimized process parameters. The complete removal threshold for the film for front-side <b>scribing</b> is found at 120 mJ/cm 2, while the minimum laser fluence for complete <b>scribing</b> is 70 mJ/cm 2 {{in the case of}} back-side <b>scribing.</b> The lines <b>scribed</b> from the front side exhibit obvious thermal effects such as heat affected zones, burr and micro cracks. Backside <b>scribing</b> exhibits non-thermal behavior, which also can increase the process speed for the <b>scribing</b> of a Ti film on glass to 1000 mm/s. This makes the back-side laser <b>scribing</b> of Ti film a promising technique. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
5|$|The {{autograph}} {{score is}} lost, its last documented owner being Christian Friedrich Penzel, one of Bach's last {{students and a}} copyist of his works. The original parts are kept in the Bach-Archiv Leipzig. They were copied from the lost autograph score by four <b>scribes,</b> three of them known by name, including the composer. A set of three duplicate parts is kept in the Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin – Preußischer Kulturbesitz as D-B Mus. ms. Bach St 384, Faszikel 1. They were copied by five <b>scribes,</b> of which three are known by name: Christian Gottlob Meißner, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach and Johann Andreas Kuhnau.

The document that records this agreement is not dated, however, so it is unknown when exactly during Æthelred's episcopate the document was drawn up. Another problem for the archbishop was {{a decline in the}} abilities of the <b>scribes</b> at Canterbury, which is dramatically illustrated by the document, which has a number of errors and duplications.
