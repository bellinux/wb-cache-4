The procedure involves the solution of two associated equivalent plane frames, along with equations from a previously published work. The equivalent plane frames contain extensible connecting rods, of an axial stiffness to be determined, which connect the individual plane subframes that form the given building space frame. The {{iterative procedure}} comprises evaluation of the column <b>shear</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> by solving the equivalent plane frames.

The iterative procedure converges to certain limits of the stresses of the equivalent plane frames.

A façade rigger braced structure comprises a series of interior walls and façade riggers placed in the exterior frames of the building parallel to the horizontal load on the structure. The method of analysis requires only four stiffnesses representing a uniform structure up the height: the bending stiffness of the walls, an axial stiffness parameter representing {{the contribution of the}} columns in the end frames and bending as well as racking <b>shear</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of the façade riggers. The analysis yields the optimum location of the façade rigger, the deflection {{at the top of the}} structure and the forces in the four structural components such as the bending moment reduction in the walls. It allows a rapid assessment of the influence of the façade rigger stiffnesses on the overall behaviour of the structure in graphical form.

Two equivalent <b>shear</b> <b>stiffness</b> properties of periodic core structures, Gcxy and Gcxy, corresponding to torsion and in-plane shear, respectively, are conceptually and analytically distinguished from each other.

While it is conceptually known that wavelengths need to tend towards zero (as compared to the specimen dimensions perpendicular to the pulse propagation direction) in the 3 D case, and towards infinity in the 1 D case, we here report on a new systematic experimental assessment {{of the influence of}} the sample geometry on wave type: tests on solid isotropic aluminum samples reveal that the extensional (or bar) wave propagation mode requires transmission of truly slender samples (required slenderness ratio of 20 or larger for wavelengths equal to the wave travel distance; this minimum slenderness ratio is increasing with increasing travel distance-over-wavelength ratio). After a transition zone with dispersive wave propagation, non-dispersive bulk waves are detected once the slenderness ratio is reduced to 5 or lower (at wavelengths equal to the wave travel distance; this maximum slenderness ratio is increasing with increasing travel distance-over-wavelength ratio). On the other hand, it is conceptually known from continuum mechanics that the wavelength needs to be larger than the investigated material volume or representative volume element (RVE), as to reveal the material’s elastic properties, while corresponding quantitative data are rare. As a remedy, we here report on new experiments on transversely isotropic, porous aluminum samples, which reveal that minimum pore dimension-over-wavelength ratios of 1 and 10, respectively, relate to detection of normal and <b>shear</b> <b>stiffnesses,</b> respectively, of the solid material between the pores, while these ratios need to be smaller than 0. 01 and 0. 1, as to detect the normal and <b>shear</b> <b>stiffnesses</b> of the overall porous materials.
