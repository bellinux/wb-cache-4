5|$|The {{drive for}} decimalisation of the {{currency}} in Britain dates {{as far back as}} 1682. Although nothing was done regarding early proposals, the adoption of a decimal currency in the United States, France and other nations in the late 18th and early 19th centuries renewed the call, and commissions in 1841 and 1843 called for its adoption. In 1847, a motion was introduced in Parliament by Sir John Bowring calling for the introduction of a decimal currency and the <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> of one-tenth and one-hundredth of a pound. Bowring obtained surprisingly strong support for his motion, and the Russell government promised that a coin valued at one-tenth of a pound (two shillings) would be produced to test public opinion, with consideration in future to be given to the introduction of other decimal coins.|$|E

5|$|Though {{production}} <b>of</b> business <b>strikes</b> {{ended in}} 1878, the <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> proof <b>coins</b> continued in limited numbers until 1883, {{when the final}} mintage <b>of</b> 979 <b>coins</b> was struck at the Philadelphia Mint.

50|$|The State of California and the {{municipality}} refused {{to finance the}} Games. The U.S.S.R. refused {{to participate in the}} games as well. Legislation from July 22, 1982 authorized an issue <b>of</b> Olympic <b>coins.</b> The Bill allowed the <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> six <b>coins</b> bearing three different designs. The United States struck its first Olympic coins ever, and its first gold coin in fifty years. Uncirculated Coins were produced at the United States Mint’s facilities in Denver, Philadelphia, San Francisco and West Point.|$|R
50|$|Two £5 coins {{have been}} made to mark London 2012 Olympics. As with other Olympics since 1952, the Royal Mint will <b>strike</b> a set <b>of</b> {{commemorative}} one-kilogram gold and silver <b>coins.</b> The <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> such large <b>coins</b> necessitated a new Act of Parliament, the Coinage (Measurement) Act 2011.|$|R
50|$|The ideal <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> <b>coins</b> with a value {{equal to}} their {{production}} costs {{was not long}} maintained, and the coins were given a face value slightly higher than their metal content, so inevitably counterfeits soon began to appear.|$|R
50|$|The {{games were}} {{to be held in}} Denver, Colorado but after two years of preparation, the city withdrew and Innsbruck was chosen to stage the Games. The Hall Mint, one of the oldest mints in Europe was reopened to <b>strike</b> some <b>of</b> the <b>coins.</b>|$|R

50|$|Dupré was {{a talented}} {{engraver}} and the composition which he {{created for the}} 5-franc represented the republic during almost 200 years. The écu à l'Hercule created in 1796, was again struck in 1848, then in 1870 and 1877. The new franc of 1960 renewed honor to Dupré by the <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> silver commemorative <b>coins</b> <b>of</b> 10 francs (1965-1973) and 50 francs (1974-1977).|$|R
50|$|<b>Striking</b> <b>of</b> the new <b>coins</b> {{began on}} January 30, 1883, and the Mint placed the first pieces in {{circulation}} on February 1. Snowden, concerned about reports of speculation in 1883 proof Shield nickels, received permission on February 6 to continue striking proof Shield nickels {{for several months}} alongside the new pieces.|$|R
50|$|The first theory {{claims that}} they should be placed in the central Balkans, in the {{northern}} part of the Republic of Macedonia (at the Upper Strymon valley), while the second theory considers that this tribe, at least at the time <b>of</b> the <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> the inscribed <b>coins</b> (i.e. early 5th century), was based in an area further to the south.|$|R

50|$|The Royal Mint of Malaysia was the {{national}} mint of Malaysia. It was located at the Kompleks Kilang Wang Bank Negara Malaysia in Shah Alam. It was established in 2003 to <b>strike</b> <b>coins</b> <b>of</b> Malaysia until 2006. The 1967 Malaysian coinage issue was struck at the Royal Mint in London.|$|R
50|$|On 17 September 1806, when The Netherlands {{were under}} the rule of King Louis Napoleon, he decided that the <b>striking</b> and {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> should be by a single, national body. This was in contrast to the Middle Ages custom of large trading cities having their own mint and coins, which resulted in several coins circulating within the country, and many levels of controlling bureaucracy.|$|R
5|$|The Kennedy half dollar, first minted in 1964, is a fifty-cent coin {{currently}} {{issued by}} the United States Mint. Intended as a memorial to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy, it was authorized by Congress just over a month after his death. Use of existing works by Mint sculptors Gilroy Roberts and Frank Gasparro allowed dies to be prepared quickly, and <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> the new <b>coins</b> began in January 1964.|$|R
50|$|It is {{mentioned}} as a castrum (fortress) in the 11th century, and later was contended between the Republic of Genoa and the commune of Tortona: after they signed a peaca in 1227, they dismantled the castle. In 1313 it was given by emperor Henry VII the Genoese family of the Spinola, who were named marquisses of the town in 1641. Three years later Arquata obtained also the right to <b>strike</b> <b>coins</b> <b>of</b> its own.|$|R
5|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, there were {{increasing}} {{calls for the}} replacement of the Seated Liberty design, used since the 1830s on most denominations <b>of</b> silver <b>coins.</b> In 1891, Mint Director Edward O. Leech, having been authorized by Congress to approve coin redesigns, ordered a competition, seeking a new look for the silver coins. As only the winner would receive a cash prize, invited artists refused to participate and no entry from the public proved suitable. Leech instructed Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter, and half dollar, and after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech's endorsement, they were approved by President Benjamin Harrison in November 1891. <b>Striking</b> <b>of</b> the new <b>coins</b> began the following January.|$|R
5|$|The Treasury {{announced}} {{the new design}} on December 19, 1921. Photographs of Baker and de Francisci examining the final plaster model appeared in newspapers, along with written descriptions of the designs, since the Treasury at that time took the position that it was illegal for photographs of a United States coin to be printed in a newspaper. Secretary Mellon gave formal approval to the design on December 20. As {{it would take the}} Mint several days to produce working dies, the first <b>strike</b> <b>of</b> the new <b>coins</b> was scheduled for December 29.|$|R
5|$|Sets of 1d (one penny) to 4d silver coins {{are known}} {{from the time of}} Charles II onwards. However, as there is no record of any {{denomination}} higher than 1d (then struck for circulation in silver) being used in the Maundy gift before 1731, sets from before then are most likely ordinary circulation strikes. At that time, coins used for the Maundy money distribution were indistinguishable from those struck for circulation. It was not until 1752 that coins not struck for circulation were used for the Maundy distribution. At times when little silver was being struck by the Royal Mint, the coins distributed might bear a previous year's date. To evade statutory prohibitions on the <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> silver <b>coin</b> during the Napoleonic Wars, all Maundy pieces issued from 1800 to 1815 bear the date 1800, though most were struck later. When the date was finally changed in 1816, after the prohibition ended, the size <b>of</b> the <b>coins</b> was slightly reduced, as the Royal Mint increased the amount struck from one troy pound of sterling silver from 62 to 66 shillings <b>of</b> silver <b>coin.</b> The last year in which no Maundy coins were struck was 1821.|$|R
30|$|This {{asymmetrical}} rendering, which {{depends on}} both illumination and viewing angles, {{makes it difficult}} to decide whether a coin was minted by the same die. In general, the intensity, direction, and number of light sources may vary from one studio to another, leading to differences in the shadows cast, the contrast between bright and dark regions, and the rendering of surface texture. Different lighting directions may make small patterns on the coin, such as inscriptions and symbols, look very different, and highlights arising from specularity of the metallic surface may affect the quality of the images, especially when automatic exposure correction is enabled in the camera. The use of polarizing filters to reduce specular highlights can cause undesirable birefringence effects [4]. More fundamentally, the projection of the 3 D object surface onto the 2 D image means that valuable information about the object is discarded, which makes it more difficult to analyse distortions arising from the <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coin</b> in the die and also of subsequent wear and corrosion [5].|$|R
5000|$|The decimal [...] "franc" [...] was {{established}} {{as the national}} currency by the French Revolutionary Convention in 1795 as a decimal unit (1 franc = 10 décimes = 100 centimes) of 4.5 g of fine silver. This was slightly less than the livre of 4.505 g, but the franc was set in 1796 at 1.0125 livres (1 livre, 3 deniers), reflecting in part the past minting <b>of</b> sub-standard <b>coins.</b> Silver coins now had their denomination clearly marked as “5 FRANCS” and it was made obligatory to quote prices in francs. This ended the ancien régime’s practice <b>of</b> <b>striking</b> <b>coins</b> with no stated denomination, such as the Louis d'or, and periodically issuing royal edicts to manipulate their value in terms of money of account, i.e. the Livre tournois.|$|R
50|$|A uniface is a {{reference}} to a one-sided Coin or Banknote, usually issued in low denomination, in times of war or in the early evolution <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> and banknotes; other examples are made as trial <b>strikes</b> <b>of</b> dies.|$|R
5|$|There were {{complaints}} that year from officials {{at all three}} of the mints concerning the quality <b>of</b> the <b>coins</b> produced. In the summer of 1874, coiner A. Loudon Snowden issued a formal complaint to Pollock {{about the quality of the}} strikings, most notably on the high points of the design; Barber began modifying the design later that year, reducing the relief. The modified dies began service in 1875. In the fall of that year, Linderman suggested that the reverse of the trade dollar should be altered in 1876 to commemorate the centennial of American independence; Pollock opposed the idea, noting that such a change would be difficult to carry out because Congressional approval would be necessary and that it might cause the coin to lose favor in the Orient. In May 1876, former assistant engraver Anthony C. Paquet created a reverse die after being hired by Linderman to improve the <b>striking</b> quality <b>of</b> the <b>coins.</b> Linderman approved <b>of</b> the new design, but it was ultimately rejected by Mint officials due to fears of Chinese disapproval.|$|R
500|$|The first dollar coins, {{known as}} Flowing Hair dollars, were {{issued by the}} Mint {{beginning}} in 1794. By 1800, a majority of depositors requested their bullion be struck as silver dollars, which were then utilizing the Draped Bust design. This contributed to a shortage of small change in circulation, and as a result, the public became increasingly critical of the Mint. Mint Director Elias Boudinot began encouraging depositors to accept fractional coins, {{and the production of}} dollars began to decrease in relation to the smaller coins. Dollar coin production ceased in March 1804, although those pieces bore the date of 1803. In his 1805 report, Mint Director Robert Patterson stated that [...] "he <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> small <b>coins</b> is a measure which has been adopted to accommodate the banks and other depositors, and at their particular request, both with a view of furnishing a supply of small change, and to prevent the exportation of the specie of the United States to foreign countries." [...] Though none had been struck for over two years, Secretary of State James Madison officially suspended silver dollar coinage on May 1, 1806, addressing a letter to Patterson: Sir: In Consequence of a representation from the director of the Bank of the United States that considerable purchases have been made <b>of</b> dollars <b>coined</b> at the mint for the purpose of exporting them, and as it is probable further purchases and exportations will be made the President directs that all the silver to be coined at the mint shall be of small denominations, so that the value of the largest pieces shall not exceed half a dollar.|$|R
5|$|Following his {{swearing}} in as Lord Protector in 1653, Oliver Cromwell {{became a}} proponent of Blondeau's coinage method, which had yet to find favour in the nation's minting establishment. In 1654, Cromwell's government placed Blondeau {{in charge of a}} planned mint in Ireland, where the coinage was heavily debased by fraudulent means. The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to <b>strike</b> £2,000 worth <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the split collar, because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|R
50|$|Monetae cudendae ratio (also spelled Monetæ cudendæ ratio; English: On the Minting <b>of</b> <b>Coin</b> or On the <b>Striking</b> <b>of</b> Coin; sometimes, Treatise on Money) is a {{paper on}} coinage by Nicolaus Copernicus (Polish: Mikołaj Kopernik). It was written in 1526 {{at the request of}} Sigismund I the Old, King of Poland, and {{presented}} to the Prussian Diet.|$|R
5|$|In the {{interest}} <b>of</b> time (the <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> the new <b>coin</b> {{was to begin}} in January 1964), Roberts modified the existing bust of Kennedy he had created for use on the Kennedy medal in the Mint's Presidential series, while Frank Gasparro began modifications to the reverse he had created for the same medal. Both Roberts' and Gasparro's designs had been approved by Kennedy. Roberts had met with Kennedy in person to show him early models of the design; although the President expressed no opinion regarding the depiction, Roberts decided {{to make some changes}} after meeting him. After the Mint produced trial strikes, Jacqueline and Robert Kennedy were invited to view them. Mrs. Kennedy viewed the designs favorably, but suggested that the hair be altered slightly. It was also suggested that a full or half figure of the president be used instead of the profile, but Roberts noted that there was not enough time to produce an entirely new design because of the project's time constraints, and also that he believed the left profile would give a more attractive appearance.|$|R
2500|$|In {{order to}} solve {{temporarily}} the shortage <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> in Tibet when the Chinese army arrived in 1791, the Chinese had allowed the <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> the so-called [...] "Kong-par tangkas" [...] which were produced from alloyed silver {{and had a}} design copied from Nepalese prototypes. These tangkas which first were produced in the Kongpo province and later in Lhasa, were the first mass-produced silver <b>coins</b> <b>of</b> Tibet and had about the same weight as their Nepalese counterparts, i.e. about 5.2grams.|$|R
500|$|Moore in {{his letter}} urged a change of design, stating that the sketch, if {{translated}} into a coin, [...] "would bring humiliation {{to the people of}} Maine". However, Maine officials refused and insisted on the submitted sketches. After discussions among Peters, Moore, and various officials, an agreement was reached whereby the sketches would be converted into plaster models, and Fraser engaged his onetime student, Anthony de Francisci, to do the work. The younger sculptor completed the work by early July, and the models were approved by the Commission on July 9. The Engraving Department at the Philadelphia Mint created the coin dies utilizing de Francisci's models. Either Chief Engraver George T. Morgan, or his assistant, future chief engraver John R. Sinnock, changed the moose and pine tree on the coin from being in relief (as in de Francisci's models), to be sunken into the coin. This was probably in an attempt to improve the <b>striking</b> quality <b>of</b> the <b>coins,</b> and if so, had limited success, as the full detail would not appear on many coins.|$|R
5000|$|The Chinese {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to tighten their grip on Tibet, and issued an edict which among other dispositions stipulated {{the introduction of a}} new silver coinage, struck {{in the name of the}} Qianlong Emperor.
