In 1908 Prime Minister H.H. Asquith—although a heavy drinker—took the lead by proposing to close {{about a third of}} the 100,000 pubs in England and Wales, with the owners compensated through a new tax on surviving pubs. The brewers controlled the pubs and organized a stiff resistance, supported by the Conservatives, who repeatedly defeated the proposal in the House of Lords. However, the [...] "People's Tax" [...] of 1910 included a <b>stiff</b> <b>tax</b> on pubs. Beer and liquor consumption fell in half from 1900 to 1920, in part because there were many new leisure opportunities.|$|E

30|$|But {{how fast}} will this {{improvement}} take place? The {{need to reduce}} the annual amount of GHG emitted into the atmosphere is an urgent one [3]. Hence {{the speed at which}} the adverse effects of private car use will be mitigated through the normal vehicle renewal process, or through an accelerated one, carries considerable interest. How long will it take for a new technology to penetrate (almost) the entire car fleet? How fast can we lower the fleet’s mean CO 2 emission rate? If certain technologies, such as combustion engines, were to be banned from new cars, or subjected to <b>stiff</b> <b>taxes,</b> {{how long would it take}} before emissions from the car fleet had dropped by, say, 50 or 90  %? What kind of modelling apparatus is needed to resolve such questions? The aim of this paper is to provide some answers to these questions.|$|R
40|$|Exploring {{the effects}} on Malaysia's poor of the early 1980 s' {{recession}} and the mid- 1980 s' adjustment, Demery and Demery use an applied general equilibrium model to assess three counterfactual policy packages against the chosen package. The first package assumes an earlier, preemptive adjustment to see whether delaying the decision to accept {{the economic and political}} consequences of adjustment made matters worse for poor households. The second assumes milder fiscal restraint, timed with the actual restraint, but a bolder devaluation of the ringgit - to see whether it might have been possible to speed the recovery without increasing the adverse effects on the poor. The third assumes <b>stiffer</b> <b>taxes</b> to raise revenue and correct the public deficits that the milder restraint of the second package could not. Only the third package comes close to achieving the actual outcome, but at the cost of hurting the poor, as happens with the first two packages. The government's chosen policies for cutting and switching expenditures and devaluing the exchange rate thus did much to protect the poor. The slowdown in poverty alleviation in the mid- 1980 s {{was the result of the}} recession, not of the adjustment policies. The government had few alternatives to restore the macroeconomic balances as effectively without making matters even worse for the poor...|$|R
2500|$|The 2011 CBA instituted {{major changes}} to the luxury tax regime. The {{previous}} CBA had a dollar-for-dollar tax provision system, which remained in effect through the 2012–13 season. Teams exceeding the tax level were punished by being forced to pay one dollar to the league for each dollar by which their payroll exceeded the tax level. Starting in 2013–14, the tax changed to an incremental system. Under the current system, tax is assessed at different levels based on the amount that a team is over the luxury tax threshold. The scheme is not cumulative—each level of tax applies only to amounts over that level's threshold. For example, {{a team that is}} $8 million over the tax threshold will pay $1.50 for each of its first $5 million over the tax threshold, and $1.75 per dollar for the remaining $3 million. Starting in 2014–15, [...] "repeat offenders", subject to additional penalties, are defined as teams that paid tax in previous seasons. In the first season, repeat offenders from in all previous three seasons will pay a <b>stiffer</b> <b>tax</b> rate; from 2015–16 thereafter, teams paying taxes in three out of four years will be subject to the higher repeater rate. As in the previous CBA, the tax revenue is divided among teams with lower payrolls. However, under the new scheme, no more than 50% of the total tax revenue can go exclusively to teams that did not go over the cap. Initial reports did not specify the use of the remaining 50% under the 2011 CBA, but it was later confirmed that this amount would be used to fund revenue sharing for the season during which tax was paid.|$|R

30|$|The {{corresponding}} {{changes in}} average type approval CO 2 emissions {{are shown in}} Fig.  11. A 10  % <b>stiffer</b> overall purchase <b>tax</b> {{is consistent with a}} 2.41  gCO 2 /km lower average type approval emission rate from all new passenger cars. Abolishing the tax exemptions for BEVs will, on the other hand, boost the mean emission rate by 3.85  gCO 2 /km, through changes in the mix of cars sold.|$|R
50|$|The Tax Reform Act of 1986 {{was given}} impetus by a {{detailed}} tax-simplification proposal from President Reagan's Treasury Department, and {{was designed to}} be tax-revenue neutral because Reagan stated that he would veto any bill that was not. Revenue neutrality was achieved by offsetting tax cuts for individuals by eliminating $60 billion annually in tax loopholes and shifting $24 billion of the tax burden from individuals to corporations by eliminating the investment tax credit, slowing depreciation of assets, and enacting a <b>stiff</b> alternative minimum <b>tax</b> on corporations.|$|R
40|$|The idea of {{capturing}} carbon dioxide from flue gases is not new. First commercial applications were realizedin {{the field of}} Enhanced Oil Recovery (USA, 1977 – 1984). CO 2 has been injected in the oil reservoirs toincrease the mobility of oil. Historically, its origins were not related to green house gases (GHG) effect. It was not before 1996, when thefirst commercial CO 2 capture with sequestration motivated by GHG reduction was realized. In 1996 Statoil ofNorway began injecting CO 2 beneath {{the bottom of the}} North Sea. The <b>stiff</b> Norwegian carbon <b>tax</b> was thestrong incentive in this pioneering project. In this Paper the role of gasification and specifically the role of IGCC (Integrated Gasification CombinedCycle) will be discussed {{as one of the most}} effective tools in CO 2 capture and consequently, in zero carbonpower generation...|$|R
