Driving his Mercedes, Bowie had <b>spotted</b> a drug <b>dealer</b> on the streets who he believed had ripped him off. In retaliation, Bowie repeatedly rammed his own car into the dealer's car, after which he returned to his hotel and ended up driving around in circles in the hotel's underground garage.|$|R
500|$|The {{image was}} shot by {{photographer}} Jim Marshall one morning in the band's home of Macon, Georgia. The group were not very happy about being woken up early to shoot ("we figured it didn't make a damn bit of difference what the cover was or what time we took it," [...] said guitarist Dickey Betts). Normally the band hated being photographed; the cover of later retrospective release The Fillmore Concerts shows them displaying terminal boredom. However, during the session, Duane <b>spotted</b> a <b>dealer</b> friend, raced over and grabbed a bag of contraband, then returned to his seat, discreetly clutching the stash in his lap. This made the whole band laugh, resulting in a memorable image. Marshall stenciled the album title {{on one of the}} road cases, which were stacked in front of the wall.|$|R
50|$|One of Tucker's most {{innovative}} business ideas caused the most {{trouble for the}} company and {{was used by the}} SEC to spark its formal investigation. His Accessories Program raised funds by selling accessories before the car was even in production. Potential buyers who purchased Tucker accessories were guaranteed a <b>spot</b> on the <b>dealer</b> waiting list for a Tucker '48 car. Tucker also began selling dealerships before the car was ready for production, and {{at the time of the}} trial had sold over 2000 dealerships nationwide at a price of $7500 to nearly $30,000 each.|$|R

50|$|In 1967, nearly 80-years later, Selene has {{returned}} to Paris, to investigate familier reports of the two remaining Lycan brothers, who had escaped her decades earlier. Unbeknownst to her, she is spotted {{in the streets of}} Paris by the youngest Lycan brother, Krandrill, (from the very same belfrey she had sighted his oldest brother in Part I). While he goes to inform his twin brother, Selene is giving her report to Kraven via telephone. To her disgust, Selene is informed that her presence is 'eagerly-awaited at the mansion' by Lord Clovis. Meanwhile, Krandrill arrives at the backroom of the weed shop they've been working out off. Vregis comments that the 'incense can only hide them for so-long', and Krandrill informs him that he has <b>spotted</b> the Death <b>Dealer</b> that killed Darius in Paris. Figuring that she's there as protection for Lord Clovis at the 'Crimson Moon ceremony', being held at their old mansion, they decide to crash the ceremony to lure her out, so that they can both kill her and the other Vampires, and reclaim their old home, all in one night.|$|R
50|$|The group {{leave for}} school and Jay {{delivers}} another lie regarding his frequent use of recreational soft drugs after the boys witness school bully Mark Donovan smoking cannabis. Simon abandons the group temporarily to pursue Carli and his pursuit leads him to becoming acquainted with a girl named Tara, who he is immediately smitten with. Tara, an avid fan of music invites Simon to a local gig. Simon accepts the invitation {{and in order to}} further impress her claims he is able to obtain cannabis and that he himself is a frequent user of the drug (particularly when attending music events). He realises he has been impulsive and allows Jay the opportunity to actualise his most recent wild tale regarding his drug use. Jay claims he is unable to obtain any drugs as his fictitious associate has left Britain to spend a year in Afghanistan. Ever determined to create some plausibility with his claim, Jay, accompanied by Neil approaches Donovan, wishing to purchase cannabis. Donovan mockingly provides the two with a ripped up tea bag, still taking Jay's Â£20 from him. When the boys arrive at the gig, Jay decides to re-attempt proving to Simon and Will that he can obtain drugs by trying at the venue. After a short search, Neil <b>spots</b> a <b>dealer</b> and he and Jay head over to him. After a short argument with the dealer, he sells them the drugs. Will refuses to smoke it, so the rest of the boys smoke them out the back, with Neil having taken some of his dad's sleeping tablets as well. While inside, Jay starts teasing Will about not taking the drugs until Will eats what's left of them.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{continuous}} time model of an FX market organized as a multiple dealership. The model reflects {{a number of}} salient features of the Czech koruna <b>spot</b> market. The <b>dealers</b> have costly access to the best available quotes. They interpret signals from the joint dealer-customer order flow and decide upon their own quotes and trades in the inter-dealer market. Each dealer uses the observed order flow to improve the subjective estimates of the relevant aggregate variables, which are the sources of uncertainty. One of the risk factors {{is the size of}} the cross-border dealer transactions in the FX market. These uncertainties have diffusion form and are dealt with according to the principles of portfolio optimization in continuous time. The model is used to explain the country, or risk, premium in the uncovered national return parity equation for the koruna/euro exchange rate. The two country premium terms that I identify in excess of the usual covariance term (a consequence of the 'Jensen inequality effect') are the dealer heterogeneity-induced inter-dealer market order flow component and the dealer Bayesian learning component. As a result, a 'dealer-based total return parity' formula links the exchange rate to both the 'fundamental' factors represented by the differential of the national asset returns, and the microstructural factors represented by heterogeneous dealer knowledge of the aggregate order flow and the fundamentals. Evidence on the cross-border order flow dependence of the Czech koruna risk premium, in accordance with the model prediction, is documented. Bayesian learning, FX microstructure, optimizing dealer, uncovered parity. ...|$|R
