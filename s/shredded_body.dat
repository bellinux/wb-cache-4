Several witnesses of raining frogs describe the animals as startled but healthy, and exhibiting relatively normal behavior shortly after the event. In some incidents, the animals are frozen to death or even completely encased in ice. There are examples where {{the product of the}} rain is not intact animals, but <b>shredded</b> <b>body</b> parts. Some cases occur just after storms having strong winds, especially during tornadoes. However, there have been many unconfirmed cases in which rainfalls of animals have occurred in fair weather {{and in the absence of}} strong winds or waterspouts.|$|E

500|$|Public {{health policy}} {{at this time}} was shaped by the miasma theory (the belief that {{airborne}} particles released by decaying flesh were the primary factor in the spread of contagious illness), and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern. A Royal Commission established in 1842 to investigate the problem concluded that London's burial grounds had become so overcrowded {{that it was impossible}} to dig a new grave without cutting through an existing one. Commissioner and sanitation campaigner Edwin Chadwick testified that each year, 20,000 adults and 30,000 children were being buried in less than [...] of already full burial grounds; the Commission heard that one cemetery, Spa Fields in Clerkenwell, designed to hold 1,000 bodies, contained 80,000 graves, and that gravediggers throughout London were obliged to <b>shred</b> <b>bodies</b> in order to cram the remains into available grave space. In 1848–49 a cholera epidemic killed 14,601 people in London and overwhelmed the burial system completely. Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves were exhumed to make way for new burials.|$|R

5000|$|On 12 March 2003, James Mahon made first {{mention of}} the claims that some Iraqis were killed in plastic {{shredders}} or wooden chippers, when he addressed the House of Commons after returning from research in northern Iraq. Six days later, Clwyd wrote an article in The Times entitled [...] "See men shredded, then say you dont back war," [...] saying that an unnamed Iraqi had said that Saddam and Qusay Hussein fed opponents of their Baathist rule into a plastic shredder or wood chipper, and then used their <b>shredded</b> <b>bodies</b> as fish food. Later she would add that it {{was believed to be}} housed in Abu Ghraib prison, and spoke with an unidentified person who claimed the American-sourced shredders were dismantled [...] "just before the military got there". As the first journalist to state the unsubstantiated claim, the rolling effect of the gruesome verbal picture garnered wider media and international political support, including from Australian Prime Minister John Howard, for an invasion of Iraq. The Suns political editor Trevor Kavanagh wrote in February 2004 {{that as a result of}} Clwyds article [...] "Public opinion swung behind Tony Blair, as voters learned how Saddam fed dissidents feet first into industrial shredders." [...] As she had been vocal and prominent in her concern for the situation in Iraq before the war, Tony Blair made her a Special Envoy on Human Rights in Iraq in the run-up to the war.|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of climate change, streams are warming and their runoff has been {{decreasing}} in most temperate areas. These changes can affect consumers directly by increasing their metabolic rates and modifying their physiology and indirectly by changing {{the quality of the}} resources on which organisms depend. In this study, a common stream detritivore (Echinogammarus berilloni Catta) was reared at two temperatures (15 and 20 °C) and fed Populus nigra L. leaves that had been conditioned either in an intermittent or permanent reach to evaluate the effects of resource quality and increased temperatures on detritivore performance, stoichiometry and nutrient cycling. The lower quality (i. e., lower protein, soluble carbohydrates and higher C:P and N:P ratios) of leaves conditioned in pools resulted in compensatory feeding and lower nutrient retention capacity by E. berilloni. This effect was especially marked for phosphorus, which was unexpected based on predictions of ecological stoichiometry. When individuals were fed pool-conditioned leaves at warmer temperatures, their growth rates were higher, but consumers exhibited less efficient assimilation and higher mortality. Furthermore, the shifts to lower C:P ratios and higher lipid concentrations in <b>shredder</b> <b>body</b> tissues suggest that structural molecules such as phospholipids are preserved over other energetic C-rich macromolecules such as carbohydrates. These effects on consumer physiology and metabolism were further translated into feces and excreta nutrient ratios. Overall, our results show that the effects of reduced leaf quality on detritivore nutrient retention were more severe at higher temperatures because the shredders were not able to offset their increased metabolism with increased consumption or more efficient digestion when fed pool-conditioned leaves. Consequently, the synergistic effects of impaired food quality and increased temperatures might not only affect the physiology and survival of detritivores but also extend to other trophic compartments through detritivore-mediated nutrient cycling...|$|R

However, the Cyber Shredder hacks into Stockman's robotic body, forcing him into an alliance with the Turtles to evict the <b>Shredder</b> from his <b>body.</b> In his final appearance in the series, Stockman clones an army of mutant dinosaurs to wreak havoc on New York for no apparent reason, but the Turtles turn the dinosaurs docile.|$|R
500|$|Cartier and Kneale's {{first major}} {{production}} was the six-part serial The Quatermass Experiment, broadcast {{in the summer}} of 1953. A science-fiction story, it relates the sending of the first humans into space by Professor Bernard Quatermass and the consequences when an alien presence invades the crew's rocket during its flight and returns to Earth {{in the body of the}} one remaining crewmember, having absorbed the consciousnesses and <b>shredded</b> the <b>bodies</b> of the other two. A critical and popular success, The Quatermass Experiment has been described by the British Film Institute's Screenonline website as [...] "one of the most influential series of the 1950s". Cartier's contribution to the serial's success was highlighted in his 1994 obituary in The Times newspaper, which also called the serial [...] "a landmark in British television drama as much for its visual imagination as for its ability to shock and disturb".|$|R

40|$|Auto {{shredder}} residue or “ASR ” is a heterogeneous mixture of largely non-metallic materials {{resulting from the}} <b>shredding</b> of auto <b>bodies,</b> appliances, and other scrap metal materials. An auto shredder is a large, electric-powered hammermill that pulverizes metal into fist-sized pieces which are then sorted by different “downstream ” metal separation processes including magnets, trommels, screens, optical scanners, eddy currents, {{and other types of}} proprietary process equipment. ASR is the material that remains after ferrous and nonferrous metals have been separated and removed from the various streams comprising the output of the shredder. Shredder output is known as “aggregate ” in the industry and is an intermediate process material that contains significant amounts of valuable ferrous and nonferrous metal that is separated and sold as commodities. In contrast, ASR consists primarily of foam, fabric, plastics, rubber, tires, glass, wood, and debris materials, along with minute amounts of remaining metallic material that is too small to be economically separated and removed from the aggregate. Following completion of processing for metals separation and removal, ASR is sent to an in-line treatment system (described below) where it is treated prior to transport off-site, primarily for use as alternative daily landfill cover. Treated material (“TASR”) is subject to a final magnetic scree...|$|R
40|$|Composting {{livestock}} carcasses is {{an economically}} and biologically safe method to convert carcasses into odorless, humus like material {{useful as a}} soil amendment. One of the key factors to determine {{the quality of the}} end product is stability. In this study, mortality composting is simulated using a laboratory set-up operating under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. 85 µm Carboxen/PDMS SPME fiber coating and 10 minutes sampling time are used to sample headspace of decaying plant (corn silage) and animal (<b>shredded</b> whole pig <b>body)</b> tissues. Compounds are separated and identified on a multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (MDGC-MS-O) system. Sulfur containing compounds (methyl mercaptan, carbondisulfide, dimethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, 1, 4 -dimethyl tetra sulfide) and 1 -H-indole and 3 -methyl- 1 H-indole are found as indicators of decaying animal tissue. Peak area counts of these compounds show a decrease after eight week composting time. This trend in VOC emissions can be explained by decrease in the microbial activity and stabilization of the composts. These results are also supported with respirometric measurements. The measured respiration rates of aerobically composted animal tissues during 60 days are half of the respiration rates of fresh animal tissues. Also, a significant difference is observed in VOC emissions from plant and animal materials composted under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The number of detected compounds during anaerobic decomposition is twice as much as the ones detected under aerobic decomposition. It can be concluded that monitoring VOC emissions can be a useful tool to estimate aeration status and completion of real life mortality composts...|$|R
