40|$|A {{learning}} {{neural network}} (30) implements a random weight change learning algorithm within a weight adjustment mechanism (28) for manipulating the weights applied to inputs {{of the network}} (30) {{in order to achieve}} a desired functionality for the network (30). Weights are changed randomly from an initial state with a small incremental weight change of either +? or -?. If the overall network output decreases by the weight change, the same weight change is iterated until the error increases. If, however, the overall network error increases, the weights are changed randomly again. After iterating the foregoing methodology, the network error gradually decreases and finally reaches approximately zero. Furthermore, a shift mechanism (36) and a multiplier (38) are employed as a weight application mechanism (16). The shift mechanisms (36) are connected in series with a random line (35) and are connected in parallel with a <b>shift</b> <b>line</b> (44). A random direction is successively channelled through the shift mechanisms (36) via the random line (35) {{under the control of the}} <b>shift</b> <b>line</b> (44) so that only a single random number need be generated for all of the shift mechanisms (36) within the neural network (30).

The (129) Xe NMR spectra of these various latexes reveal {{qualitative and quantitative}} differences {{in the number of}} peaks and in their line widths and chemical shifts. Above the glass transition temperature, exchange between xenon sorbed in the particle core and free xenon outside the particles is fast on the (129) Xe spectral time-scale and a single (129) Xe signal is observed. At temperatures below the glass transition temperature, the exchange between sorbed and free xenon is slow on the (129) Xe spectral time-scale and two (129) Xe NMR signals can be observed. If the signal of sorbed (129) Xe is observed, its chemical <b>shift,</b> <b>line</b> width and integral relative to the integral of free (129) Xe can be used for the characterization of the particle core.

40|$|Apomyoglobin from {{sperm whale}} {{is often used}} for studies of ligand binding, protein folding, and protein stability. In an effort to {{describe}} its conformational properties in solution, homonuclear and heteronuclear (13 C and 15 N) NMR methods were applied to the protein in its native state. Assignments were confirmed for nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) involving side chain and backbone protons in the folded regions of the structure. These NOEs were used to derive distance restraints. The shifts induced by the hydrophobic dye 8 -anilino- 1 -naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) were inspected in the regions remote from its binding site and served {{as an indicator of}} conformational flexibility. 3 JalphaH-NH values were obtained to assess dihedral angle averaging and to provide additional restraints. A family of structures was calculated with X-PLOR and an ab initio simulated annealing protocol using holomyoglobin as a template. Where the structure appeared well defined by chemical <b>shift,</b> <b>line</b> width, ANS perturbation, and density of NOEs, the low resolution model of apomyoglobin provides a valid approximation for the structure.

40|$|Solutions {{containing}} a polyoxy-ethylene/polyoxy-propylene/polyoxy-ethylene (PEO-PPO-PEO) block copolymer, indicated as F 68, in water were investigated {{as a function}} of composition and temperature. Hydrogen nuclear magnetic resonance (H- 1 NMR) line width, chemical shift, self-diffusion, spin-lattice relaxation times, laser light scattering and rheological methods were used. The monomer-micelle equilibrium and the micelle-liquid crystalline phase transitions depend on the F 68 content in the mixture and temperature. Significant changes in light scattering intensity and apparent hydrodynamic radius are associated to micelle formation above the critical micellar temperature (CMT). According to a Contin analysis, this behaviour is reflected in the presence of two populations in the intensity-intensity autocorrelation functions. The contributions due to molecules and micelles can be evaluated separately. No such effects are observed below the CMT. Micelle onset is also associated to variations in H- 1 NMR spectra, affecting the chemical <b>shift,</b> <b>line</b> width and spin-lattice relaxation time of the PPO methyl protons and self-diffusion, as well. Spin-lattice relaxation times of PEO chains, conversely, change significantly at temperatures close to the micelle-liquid crystalline thermal transition.

40|$|Context. Prominence {{oscillations}} {{have been}} mostly detected using Doppler velocity, {{although there are}} also claimed detections by means of periodic variations in half-width or line intensity. However, scarce observational evidence exists about simultaneous detection of oscillations in several spectral indicators. Aims. Our main aim here is to explore the relationship between spectral indicators, such as Doppler <b>shift,</b> <b>line</b> intensity, and line half-width, and the linear perturbations excited in a simple prominence model. Methods. Our equilibrium background model consists of a bounded, homogeneous slab, which is permeated by a transverse magnetic field, having prominence-like physical properties. Assuming linear perturbations, the dispersion relation for fast and slow modes has been derived, {{as well as the}} perturbations for the different physical quantities. These perturbations have been used as the input variables in a one-dimensional radiative transfer code, which calculates the full spectral profile of the hydrogen H-alpha and H-beta lines. Results. We have found that different oscillatory modes produce spectral indicator variations in different magnitudes. Detectable variations in the Doppler velocity were found for the fundamental slow mode only. Substantial variations in the H-beta line intensity were found for specific modes. Other modes lead to lower and even undetectable parameter variations. Conclusions. To perform prominence seismology, analysis of the H-alpha and H-beta spectral line parameters could be a good tool to detect and identify oscillatory modes.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Intermountain Precipitation Experiment (IPEX) is to improve {{understanding}} of precipitating systems in the Intermountain West. Instrumentation deployed during the field phase of IPEX sampled a strong cold front and associated convection that moved through northern Utah on 14 – 15 February 2000. The surface cold front was characterized by a sharp temperature drop (88 C in 8 min), strong pressure rise (3 hPa in 30 min), and gusts to 40 m s 21. The temperature drop at high-elevation surface stations (2500 – 3000 m MSL) preceded the temperature drop at low-elevation surface stations (1290 – 2000 m MSL) {{by as much as}} an hour, implying a forward- or downshear-tilting frontal structure. Consistent with the cooling aloft, a hydrostatic pressure rise and wind shift preceded the temperature drop at the surface. Radar captured the rapid evolution of the wind <b>shift</b> <b>line</b> into a gravity current. A forward-sloping cloud with mammatus and a 20 -hPa-deep superadiabatic layer underneath were observed by radar and radiosondes, respectively.

These and other observations reveal that the forward-sloping cloud generated by a shortwave trough aloft was producing precipitation that sublimated, melted, and evaporated in the dry subcloud air (dewpoint depression of 58 – 108 C), causing the cooling aloft and the nonclassical frontal structure...|$|E
40|$|Diffuse Ionized Gas (DIG) is {{prevalent}} in star-forming galaxies. Using {{a sample of}} 365 nearly face-on star-forming galaxies observed by MaNGA, we demonstrate how DIG in star-forming galaxies impacts the measurements of emission line ratios, hence the interpretation of diagnostic diagrams and gas-phase metallicity measurements. At fixed metallicity, DIG-dominated low Hα surface brightness regions display enhanced [SII]/Hα, [NII]/Hα, [OII]/Hβ, and [OI]/Hα. The gradients in these line ratios are determined by metallicity gradients and Hα surface brightness. In line ratio diagnostic diagrams, contamination by DIG moves HII regions towards composite or LI(N) ER-like regions. A harder ionizing spectrum is needed to explain DIG line ratios. Leaky HII region models can only <b>shift</b> <b>line</b> ratios slightly relative to HII region models, and thus fail to explain the composite/LI(N) ER line ratios displayed by DIG. Our result favors ionization by evolved stars as a major ionization source for DIG with LI(N) ER-like emission. DIG can significantly bias the measurement of gas metallicity and metallicity gradients derived using strong-line methods. Metallicities derived using N 2 O 2 are optimal because they exhibit the smallest bias and error. Using O 3 N 2, R 23, N 2 =[NII]/Hα, and N 2 S 2 Hα (Dopita et al. 2016) to derive metallicities introduces bias in the derived metallicity gradients {{as large as the}} gradient itself. The strong-line method of Blanc et al. (2015; IZI hereafter) cannot be applied to DIG to get an accurate metallicity because it currently contains only HII region models which fail to describe the DIG.

40|$|Using data {{obtained}} by the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode, we have per- formed a survey of obvious and persistent (without significant damping) Doppler shift oscillations in the corona. We have found mainly two types of oscillations from February to April in 2007. One type is found at loop footpoint regions, with a dominant period around 10 minutes. They are characterized by coherent behavior of all line parameters (line intensity, Doppler <b>shift,</b> <b>line</b> width and profile asymmetry), apparent blue shift and blueward asymmetry throughout almost the en- tire duration. Such oscillations {{are likely to be}} signatures of quasi-periodic upflows (small-scale jets, or coronal counterpart of type-II spicules), which may {{play an important role in}} the supply of mass and energy to the hot corona. The other type of oscillation is usually associated with the upper part of loops. They are most clearly seen in the Doppler shift of coronal lines with forma- tion temperatures between one and two million degrees. The global wavelets of these oscillations usually peak sharply around a period in the range of 3 - 6 minutes. No obvious profile asymmetry is found and the variation of the line width is typically very small. The intensity variation is often less than 2 %. These oscillations are more likely to be signatures of kink/Alfven waves rather than flows. In a few cases there seems to be a pi/ 2 phase shift between the intensity and Doppler shift oscillations, which may suggest the presence of slow mode standing waves according to wave theories. However, we demonstrate that such a phase shift could also be produced by loops moving into and out of a spatial pixel as a result of Alfvenic oscillations. In this scenario, the intensity oscillations associated with Alfvenic waves are caused by loop displacement rather than density change. Comment: 9 figures, accepted by Ap...|$|E
