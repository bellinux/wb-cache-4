40|$|Numerous {{studies in}} the last 60 years have {{investigated}} the relationship between land slope and soil erosion rates. However, relatively few of these have investigated slope gradient responses: (a) for steep slopes, (b) for specific erosion processes, and (c) {{as a function of}} soil properties. Simulated rainfall was applied in the laboratory on 16 soils and 16 overburdens at 100 mm/h to 3 replicates of unconsolidated flume plots 3 m long by 0. 8 m wide and 0. 15 m deep at slopes of 20, 5, 10, 15, and 30 % slope in that order. Sediment delivery at each slope was measured to determine the relationship between slope steepness and erosion rate. Data from this study were evaluated alongside data and existing slope adjustment functions from more than 55 other studies from the literature. Data and the literature strongly support a logistic slope adjustment function of the form S = A + B/[1 + exp (C - D sin theta) ] where S is the slope adjustment factor and A, B, C, and D are coefficients that depend on the dominant detachment and transport processes. Average coefficient values when interill-only processes are active are A - 1. 50, B 6. 51, C 0. 94, and D 5. 30 (r(2) = 0. 99). When rill erosion is also potentially active, the average <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> is greater and coefficient values are A - 1. 12, B 16. 05, C 2. 61, and D 8. 32 (r(2) = 0. 93). The interill-only function predicts increases in sediment delivery rates from 5 to 30 % slope that are approximately double the predictions based on existing published interill functions. The rill + interill function is similar to a previously reported value. The above relationships represent a mean <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> for all soils, yet the response of individual soils varied substantially from a 2. 5 -fold to a 50 -fold increase over the range of slopes studied. The magnitude of the <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> was found to be inversely related (log - log linear) to the dispersed silt and clay content of the soil, and 3 slope adjustment equations are proposed that provide a better estimate of <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> when this soil property is known. Evaluation of the slope adjustment equations proposed in this paper using independent datasets showed that the new equations can improve soil erosion predictions...|$|E
40|$|A decadal {{change in}} the {{character}} of ENSO was observed around year 2000 toward weaker-amplitude, higher-frequency events with an increased occurrence of central Pacific El Niños. Here these changes are assessed in terms of the Bjerknes stability index (BJ index), which {{is a measure of the}} growth rate of ENSO-related SST anomalies. The individual terms of the index are calculated from ocean reanalysis products separately for the time periods 1980 – 99 and 2000 – 10. The spread between the products is large, but they show a robust weakening of the thermocline feedback due to a reduced thermocline <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> to anomalous zonal wind stress as well as a weakened wind stress response to eastern equatorial Pacific SST anomalies. These changes are consistent with changes in the background state of the tropical Pacific: cooler mean SST in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific results in reduced convection there together with a westward shift in the ascending branch of the Walker circulation. This shift leads to a weakening in the relationship between eastern Pacific SST and longitudinally averaged equatorial zonal wind stress. Also, despite a steeper mean thermocline slope in the more recent period, the thermocline <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> to wind stress anomalies weakened due to a smaller zonal wind fetch that results from ENSO-related wind anomalies being more confined to the western basin. As a result, the total BJ index is more negative, corresponding to a more strongly damped system in the past decade compared to the 1980 s and 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|Sea breezes are {{characteristic}} features of coastal regions that can extend large distances from the coastline. Oscillations {{close to the}} inertial period are thought to account for around half the kinetic energy in the global surface ocean and {{play an important role}} in mixing. In the vicinity of 30 °N/S, through a resonance between the diurnal and inertial frequencies, diurnal winds could force enhanced anti-cyclonic rotary motions that contribute to near-inertial energy. Observations of strong diurnal anti-cyclonic currents in water of depth 175 m off the Namibian coastline at 28. 6 °S are analysed over the annual cycle. Maxima in the diurnal anti-cyclonic current and wind stress amplitudes appear to be observed during the austral summer. Both the diurnal anti-cyclonic current and wind stress components have approximately constant phase throughout the year. These observations provide further evidence that these diurnal currents may be wind forced. Realistic General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM) 1 -D simulations of diurnal wind forcing, including the first order coast-normal surface <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> to diurnal wind forcing, represent the principal features of the observed diurnal anti-cyclonic current but do not replicate the observed vertical diurnal current structure accurately. Cross-shelf 2 -D slice simulations suggest that the first order surface <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> approximation applies away from the coast (> 140 km). However, nearer to the coast, additional surface slope variations associated with spatial variations in the simulated velocity field (estimated from Bernoulli theory) appear to be significant and also result in transfer of energy to higher harmonics.

40|$|The Mw 7. 9 Wenchuan {{earthquake}} of May 12 th, 2008 shattered and induced failures on {{slopes of}} hills surroundings {{the centre of}} the town of Qiaozhuang, located 300 Km NE of the mainshock epicentre. This motivated the initial investigations on the possible occurrence of topographic amplification phenomena, which were conducted through a temporary accelerometer monitoring carried out between April and October 2009 on Weigan hill and Mount Dong, located SW and NE of the Qiaozhuang centre, respectively. In both cases, the amplification factors were found higher at sites closer to the hilltop and lower near the foot of the slope (Luo et al., 2014). However, the general characteristics of <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> also revealed that resonance phenomena were controlled by the local geological setting characterised by Silurian phyllites with sub-vertical schistosity (at Weigan) and by fractured Precambrian limestones (at Dong). To further investigate local <b>slope</b> <b>response,</b> ambient noise recordings, based on the calculation of horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVNR or Nakamura method), were also conducted on several sites in the peri-urban area, including those occupied by the accelerometer stations. The latter provided the possibility to validate the outcomes of ambient noise analysis. Data interpretation has been hampered by a contingent factor, i. e. the occurrence of environmental conditions characterised by a strong E-W oriented peak at low frequencies (below 1 Hz), and by the locally complex structural setting. For example, in the case of Weigan hill the sub-vertical schistosity appeared responsible for a considerable amplification of vertical ground motion. The former problem implies the need of a repetition of measurements under different environmental conditions to distinguish permanent, site-specific properties of noise related to slope dynamic response. By altering the H/V ratio, the presence of vertical amplification represents an obstacle for a routine data analysis and a straightforward interpretation of results. Therefore, further developments in advanced techniques of noise data analysis techniques appear necessary to facilitate the extraction of reliable information on seismic response of slopes in geologically complex conditions...|$|E

Analogous systems were also prepared from the novel pyridine-containing analogues of 1, namely dichlorocalix[2]pyrrole[2]pyridine (2) and tetrachlorocalix[4]pyridine (3). At lower pH values (i. e., 3. 5 and 5. 5), ISEs derived from 1 display strong anionic (negative <b>slope)</b> <b>responses</b> towards Br-, Cl-, and H 2 PO 4 - and, to a much lesser extent, F-. By contrast, at high pH (i. e. pH 9. 0) ISEs derived from 1 not only display cationic (positive <b>slope)</b> <b>responses</b> towards chloride and bromide anions but also selectivities (i. e., Br- < Cl- < OH- ? F- < HPO 42 -) that are non-Hofmeister in nature. This is considered consistent with the PVC-supported receptor 1 behaving as a direct anion binding agent at low pH but acting, at least in part, as an hydroxide-complexing receptor at higher pH. For the ISEs based on 2 and 3, no special non-Hofmeister selectivity is observed at pH 9. 0. However, at lower pH values both increased anionic responses and improved selectivities for hydrophilic anions (e. g., F- and H 2 PO 4 -) are observed. These observations are rationalized in terms of protonation effects involving the pyridine-containing receptors from which these ISEs are derived. For all the receptors discussed in this report, the addition of tridodecylmethylammonium chloride (TDDMA), a known lipophilic additive, serves to increase {{the magnitude of the}} ISE response but only at the price of greatly reduced anion selectivity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{response}} of submerged slopes on the continental shelf to seismic or storm loading {{has become an}} important element in the risk assessment for offshore structures and “local ” tsunami hazards worldwide. The geological profile of these slopes typically includes normally consolidated to lightly overconsolidated soft cohesive soils with layer thickness ranging from a few meters to hundreds of meters. The factor of safety obtained from pseudo-static analyses is not always a useful measure for evaluating the <b>slope</b> <b>response,</b> since values less than one do not necessarily imply slope failure with large movements of the soil mass. This paper addresses the relative importance of different factors affecting the {{response of}} submerged slopes during seismic loading. The analyses use a dynamic finite element code which includes a constitutive law describing the anisotropic stress-strain-strength behavior of normally consolidated to lightly overconsolidated clays. The model also incorporates anisotropic hardening to describe the effect of different shear strain and stress histories as well as bounding surface principles to provide realistic descriptions of the accumulation of the plastic strains and excess pore pressure during successive loading cycles. The paper presents results from parametric site response analyses on slope geometry and layering, soil material parameters, and input ground motion characteristics. The predicted maximum shear strains, permanent deformations, displacement time histories and maximum excess pore pressure development provide insight of slope performance during a seismic event. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{geophysical}} transient electromagnetics (TEM) measurements with HTS SQUID magnetometers, {{a so-called}} 'frequency dependence' of the stacked time transients on the repetition {{frequency of the}} transmitter, {{and the appearance of}} so-called 'sign reversals', the crossover of the stacked time transients to negative values, have been observed frequently. Recently, we have shown that both of these effects {{can be attributed to the}} summing of remnant responses from earlier transmitted pulses of the repetitive transmitter waveform [1], [2]. Although the step function inductive response for many TEM targets decays monotonically and is positive at all times, instances of sign reversal do occur. We postulate that this sign reversal is due to the typical bipolar waveform of the TEM transmitter and the stacking procedure. In this contribution, we systematically extend our analysis to binary and ternary power-law expressions for the step function response, modeling measured responses for typical ground structures. The conditions are determined under which sign reversals appear. It is shown that the effect occurs mainly in the case where a shallow <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> is followed by a rapidly decaying response at late times.

To obtain an evaluation of the induced displacement using analytical procedures accounting for time dependant seismic action, evaluation of <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> to earthquake loading should be carried out accordingly (Farghaly 2014). Regarding the population growth and expansion of urban areas, people are getting more close to the mountains in these areas without getting aware of the consequences at the time of major earthquake. The temporal and spatial distribution of the seismic forces in the soil mass is determined by response of slope under seismic loading which in turn depends on mechanical properties of the soil and the characteristics of the seismic input. In general, any construction been carried out on the vicinity of a hillside should be first studied and solution should be provided for anticipated problems. According to Lindell and Prater (2002) suggested that to reduce the hazard vulnerability, land use practices such as avoiding construction in hazard susceptible areas should be followed. They argued that government agencies should establish new rules and regulations which will encourage the adoption of appropriate land use practices and will prevent development in hazardous locations. They must also provide incentives that will encourage the people for moving to safer locations, or informing landowners about the risks and benefits of these locations throughout the community. Here the land use has been divided into five classes with high priorities been given to the settlements and oil tanks to reduce the loss of human lives in the event of any hazard occurrence.|$|E

They found an increase in slope (m V /ms) of the field excitatatory synaptic potential (EPSP), a reflection of system drive, for the conditioned group while a decrease was noted for the pseudoconditioned group. As for the reactivity of the granule cells in the dentate gyrus, population spike decreases were found in both groups. The primary goal {{of this study was to}} apply the conditioning methods of Doyere et al. (1995) and measure the perforant path-dentate gyrus responses during an anesthetized state using urethane. [...] Following a 30 min initial baseline period, animals in the conditioned group received 32 tone-footshock pairings over a 90 min conditioning period, followed by a 60 min rest period, and then a 90 min extinction period during which 32 tones were presented. Mean EPSP slope and population spike responses were plotted over time and compared to the responses recorded in a pseudoconditioned group where animals received 32 deliberate CS-US unpairings during the 90 min conditioning period. [...] The EPSP <b>slope</b> <b>responses</b> in both groups did not vary significantly from baseline level over the 300 min period and were not affected by the manner in which tone and footshock presentations were received. As for the population spike response, no group differences were noted during the conditioning period but a significant group by block interaction was found for the 60 min post-conditioning period. In contrast to the <b>slope</b> <b>responses,</b> significant group effects were found in the extinction period and the final 30 min period of recording. Consistent results were noted following analysis of the calculated ratios of the population spike/slope responses. Correlation analyses of the slope and population spike suggested that conditioning led to an increase in cell excitability such that a smaller slope was associated with a larger population spike. This effect occurred after conditioning and disappeared with extinction. [...] The overall pattern suggested that conditioning changes perforant path-dentate gyrus connections in the urethane anesthetized rat and that the changes are unlike those that occur during the awake state. While EPSP slope changes were non significant in both pseudoconditioned and conditioned rats, the difference in spike amplitude profile with conditioning relative to pseudoconditioning implies that pairing-related modifications can occur in the anesthetized state...|$|R

In the present experiment, the authors found that when ambient conditions during the gap were similar to the ITI, pigeons tended to reset memory, but when ambient conditions during the gap were different from the ITI, pigeons tended to stop timing, retain the duration of the stimulus in memory, and add to that time when the stimulus reappeared. Thus, when the gap was unambiguous, pigeons timed accurately. The peak procedure, used to examine the ability of animals to time the duration of a stimulus (Catania, 1970), involves the use of a fixed interval (FI) schedule of reinforcement in which reinforce-ment is provided for the first response that occurs after the interval has elapsed. It is possible to use an animal’s response rate through-out the interval to assess its timing ability. Typically, an upwardly <b>sloping</b> <b>response</b> scallop is found (Church, 1978; Gibbon, 1977; S...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{mountains}} of Campania are covered by airfall pyroclastic deposits in primary deposition generally in unsaturated conditions. These deposits are periodically subjected to rainfall induced landslides that may evolve into catastrophic flowslides. To protect towns EWS can be implemented in order to correctly and promptly predict the trigger. In the paper we detect some ‘essential ingredients’ for effective EWSs which are new with respect to those already employed and essentially based on pluviometric thresholds (Greco et. Al., 2013) and extremely simplified models not able to correctly follow the physical phenomena which are responsible of flowslides generation (Olivares et Al. 2009). Complex models, able to correctly simulate those physical phenomena such as infiltration processes {{and the effects of}} partial saturated conditions on shear strength contain the ‘essential ingredients’ that we discuss in the paper. A particular attention is devoted to define the relation between suction and shear strength and the water retention curve obtained from different techniques to assess a reliable hydro-geotechnical model to analyze the <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> of loose unsaturated pyroclastic deposits. An EWS that contains these elements can provide many advantages. In fact, catastrophic flowslides but even false alarms about such events, produce negative technological and productive shocks that strongly reduce the actual and prospective value added of investment in the areas at risk suggesting the opportunity of their shrinking and postponement. Of course this severely compromises the economic development of those areas. In the paper we propose to examine this subject in the Dixit e Pindyck framework of the Real Option Valuation Approach in order to explain the socio-economic value of effective EWS. In fact, such EWSs will embed valuable new real options in the investment opportunities in the areas at risk increasing their actual and prospective values...|$|E
40|$|Debris {{flows in}} slopes {{initially}} dry, such as post-wildfire debris flows, are initiated by surface runoff and sediment bulking due to reduced infiltration. Soil water repellency, extreme dry soils, and loose, cohesionless materials influence their initiation. The exact link between these features, the resulting infiltration processes and the initiation mechanism of a debris flow remains unclear. Here, {{we examine the}} relation between soil particle wettability and slope processes in physical models. Flume experiments were conducted in 10 % increments of mass ratios of wettable to water repellent sand, subjected to artificial rainfall with monitoring of soil water content, pore water pressure, sediment and water discharge and failure mode. To date, wettability was considered only for the water repellent end, because it reduces infiltration, enhancing surface runoff. This study demonstrates that slight wettability changes, in the full wettable to water repellent range, impact a variety of slope processes. The two extremes, fully wettable and water repellent gave opposite responses, retrogressive slides for infiltration-initiated in wettable sand and erosion by surface runoff in water repellent sand. The transition was dominated by surface runoff and preferential flow, yielding a combination of erosion and slides. From the tests, a continuous capping effect generated by water repellency was {{a necessary condition for}} erosion and sand bulking i. e., the generation of runoff-initiated debris flows. The sensitivity of the model <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> to artificial rainfall was particularly acute at high ratios of wettable to water repellent sand. For mixtures above a critical ratio of wettable to water repellent sand, the measurements with an index test revealed a fully wettable material despite differences in the infiltration, saturation and pore water pressure built-up trends. Implications for post-wildfire debris flows and debris flows in slopes initially dry in general are discussed. postprin...|$|E
40|$|Lead {{specificity}} {{of the maximum}} ST/heart rate <b>slope</b> <b>response</b> Sir, Once more correspondence columns have borne wit-ness to the confusion caused by the Leeds exercise test. Yet again Professor Linden {{and his colleagues have}} been able to claim that their protocol has not been adhered to-and of course on this occasion they are correct in that respect. ' 2 They have, however, chosen to ignore other studies that have followed their protocol meticulously and that have, never-theless, failed to reproduce their results. 34 This has surely now reached a point for real con-cern to be expressed. A considerable amount of time and money, much of the latter from charitable sources, has been spent trying to confirm the perfect accuracy of this test and this has proved a wild goose chase. This might be a cause for some amusement were the competition for scarce research funds not so intense. Nevertheless, the alleged usefulness of this test has been widely and uncritically accepted in many countries. There is {{reason to believe that the}} management ofmany patients may have been largely determined by the result of a Leeds exercise test, and of course this could well result in quite inappropriate decisions with regard to further investigation and treatment in individual cases. The fact is that the test works only in Leeds. No-body else, using the unmodified Leeds protocol, has been able to reproduce the results, and surely there-fore the test must now either be abandoned or else all patients undergoing it must be sent to Professor Lin-den's unit since that would appear to be the only place where it can be properly performed and inter-preted. It is of interest that the recent letter from Professor Linden and Dr Mary seems to indicate that the test, even in Leeds, is no longer perfect so perhaps the time has come for it to be abandoned...|$|E
40|$|The use of polymer-membrane pH {{electrodes}} as {{internal sensing}} elements for the fab-rication of inexpensive ammonia {{and carbon dioxide}} gas sensing systems is reported. The pH-responsive polymer membranes are prepared by incorporating tridodecylamine as the neutral carrier in plasticized poly(viny 1 chloride) membranes. Both static and con-tinuous-flow gas-sensing arrangements are described. For miniature static gas sensors, the internal polymer pH electrode {{can be made with}} or without an internal reference solution. In the latter case, the polymeric membrane is coated directly onto a graphite substrate. The polymer pH electrode can also be prepared in tubular form and used in conjunction with a gas dialysis chamber for automated continuous-flow determinations of carbon dioxide and ammonia. <b>Slopes,</b> <b>response</b> times, and reproducibility of these new gas-sensing systems are evaluated using optimized internal electrolytes, flow rates, and gas-permeable membrane materials. When appropriate reagents and materials are used, the static sensors exhibit slopes in the range 48 - 62 mV/decade with potentials repro-ducible to less than + 1. 5 mV at gas concentrations greater than lo 3 M.

40|$|The visual search {{paradigm}} has had {{an enormous}} impact in many fields. A theme running through this literature has been the distinction between preattentive and attentive processing, which I {{refer to as the}} two-stage assumption. Under this assumption, slopes of set-size and response time are used to determine whether attention is needed for a given task or not. Even though a lot of findings question this two-stage assumption, it still has enormous influence, determining decisions on whether papers are published or research funded. The results described here show that the two-stage assumption leads to very different conclusions about the operation of attention for identical search tasks based only on changes in response (presence/absence versus Go/No-go <b>responses).</b> <b>Slopes</b> are therefore an ambiguous measure of attentional involvement. Overall, the results suggest that the two-stage model cannot explain all findings on visual search, and they highlight how <b>slopes</b> of <b>response</b> time and set-size should only be used with caution...|$|R
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{model has been}} developed which relates physically accessible parameters {{to the formation of}} a membrane potential. The description is an extension of a theoretical description presented previously by our group, now including divalent cations and ion-pair association. Simulations of the overall membrane potential reveal several factors that may lead to non-Nernstian response curves. For monovalent and divalent cations a reduction in the <b>slope</b> of the <b>response</b> curve (sub-Nernstian response) should virtually always be expected when ion-pair association takes place in the membrane.
