[...] When they joined the band, they [...] "cleaned up and tightened our sound." [...] The new lineup's first song was [...] "Bonus Mosh Pt. II." [...] They began writing new material, {{and in a few}} months the group had enough songs for a second album. The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn't [...] "taking us anyplace new. We really wanted to grow musically with this [...]" [...] They pushed themselves, trying to write the best songs they could. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "didn’t spend as much time playing together in order to do exactly what we wanted to because <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> new." ...|$|E

According to Leng, with its combination of a defiant [...] "protest" [...] song in [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round", the anti-stardom [...] "The Lord Loves the One", and [...] "perfect pop confections" [...] in [...] "Give Me Love" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long", Living in the Material World was the last album to capture the same clear-sighted, utopian spirit that characterised the 1960s. Eder likewise welcomes Material Worlds bold idealism, saying: [...] "Even {{in the summer of}} 1973, after years of war and strife and disillusionment, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> still sort of looking – to borrow a phrase from a Lennon–McCartney song – or hoping to get from them something like 'the word' that would make us free. And George, God love him, had the temerity to actually oblige..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 1972 MacCallum {{provided}} lead vocals for [...] "It's Time", {{which was}} written and produced by Pat Aulton. The concept and words were by Paul Jones the Creative Director of the campaign. It {{was used as the}} theme on Australian Labor Party's TV and radio ads during Gough Whitlam's 1972 federal election campaign, making MacCallum a famous name through saturation radio and TV airplay, despite the single failing to chart. According to James Cockington [...] "even though Labor was not credited on the label nor mentioned in the lyrics, most radio stations were reluctant to play the song, sensing its party-political roots". MacCallum was joined in the TV ads with a variety of celebrities including Bert Newton, Col Joye, Judy Stone, John Dease, Hazel Phillips, Ted Hamilton, Bellbird cast members, and Bobby Limb. Some of the celebrities suffered a negative backlash from appearing in the ads, Stone recalled [...] "we didn't get paid for it, but we certainly lost a lot of work over it ... <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> black banned from clubs, and I had garbage thrown all over my lawn. And I wasn't the only one singled out".|$|E

The campaign has an anti-bullying and homophobia awareness platform with people writing [...] "So what?" [...] {{on their hands}} and posting their photos to social media. The official slogan of the campaign is: [...] "Some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have blue eyes, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> have green eyes. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> straight. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>are</b> gay...

60|$|We {{reached the}} famous river before four o'clock, {{and the night}} was so black {{that we could have}} ridden into it without seeing it. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> in an unhappy frame of mind. We waited and waited for daylight, but it did not come. Finally we went away in the dark and slept an hour on the ground, in the bushes, and caught cold. It was a costly nap, on that account, but {{otherwise}} it was a paying investment because it brought unconsciousness of the dreary minutes and put us in a somewhat fitter mood for a first glimpse of the sacred river.|$|E
40|$|Having {{a common}} {{language}} is important. Failure {{to understand what is}} being said usually leads to unnecessary conflict. A case in point has been misunderstandings of the radical behaviour-ist position by intellectuals such as Noam Chom-sky.
