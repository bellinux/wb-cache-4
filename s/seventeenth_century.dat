The building was designed using the trace italienne style popular during the <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century,</b> with a proportional geometric floor design. Bastions were used as the main defensive elements. The castle housed a garrison of 250 soldiers, and was the seat of government for the Province of Cumaná.|$|E

They often became the subject of superstitions, being used in divination. Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, Scottish kings, {{particularly}} James V, built palaces in a Renaissance style, beginning at Linlithgow. The trend soon spread {{to members of}} the aristocracy. Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish art, with works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists. While church art suffered iconoclasm and a loss of patronage {{as a result of the}} Reformation, house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy, with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century.</b> Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex polyphonic church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms. Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources of patronage, changing the direction of artistic creation and limiting its scope. In the early <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Stoicism, Mannerism and the Baroque.|$|E

5|$|Renaissance is {{a concept}} {{formulated}} by cultural historian Jacob Burckhardt {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} to describe the intellectual and artistic movement that began in Italy in the fourteenth century and saw an attempt to revive the principles of the Greek and Roman classical worlds. It encompassed a rational and sceptical attitude, a return to ideas of original sources and proportion and balance in art. The major ideas of the Renaissance are generally considered to have reached Northern Europe much later, in the late fifteenth century. Scotland has been seen as part of a wider Northern Renaissance that is generally considered to have stretched into the early <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century,</b> when it was replaced by the grander styles of the Baroque. However, the association of Baroque styles with Catholicism in predominantly Protestant Scotland tended to result in this trend being overlooked and the period from about 1620 {{to the end of the}} <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> is sometimes characterised as a late Renaissance.|$|E

Family worship was strongly encouraged by the Covenanters. Books of devotion were distributed to encourage the practice and ministers were encouraged to investigate whether this was being carried out. The <b>seventeenth</b> <b>century</b> marked the high-water mark of kirk discipline. Kirk sessions were able to apply religious sanctions, such as excommunication and denial of baptism, to enforce godly behaviour and obedience. In more difficult cases of immoral behaviour they could work with the local magistrate, in a system modelled on that employed in Geneva.|$|E
