50|$|From {{an early}} time, octroi {{collection}} was farmed out to associations or private individuals, and so great were the abuses which {{arose from the}} system that the octroi was abolished during the French Revolution. But such a drastic measure meant the stoppage of all municipal activities, and in 1798 Paris was allowed to re-establish its octroi. Other cities were allowed gradually to follow suit, and in 1809 a law was passed laying down the basis on which octrois might be established. Other laws were passed {{from time to time}} in France dealing with the octroi, in 1816, 1842, 1867, 1871, 1884, and 1897. By the law of 1809 octroi duties were allowed on beverages and liquids, food, fuel, forage, and building materials. A <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> was fixed, graduated according to the population, and farming out was strictly regulated. Under the law of 1816, an octroi could only be established at the wish of a municipal council, and only articles destined for local consumption could be taxed. The law of 1852 ended the payment of 10% of the gross receipts to the national treasury. Certain indispensable commodities were allowed to enter free, such as grain, flour, fruit, vegetables, and fish.|$|E

40|$|Explanations for the hypoallometric <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> {{metabolic}} <b>rate</b> through ontogeny generally {{fall into}} two categories: supply-side constraints on delivery of oxygen, or decreased mass-specific intrinsic demand for oxygen. In many animals, supply and demand increase together as the body grows, thus {{making it impossible to}} tease apart the relative contributions of changing supply and demand to the observed <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> metabolic <b>rate.</b> In larval insects, the large components of the tracheal system are set in size at each molt, but then remain constant in size until the next molt. Larvae of Manduca sexta increase up to ten-fold in mass between molts, leading to increased oxygen need without a concomitant increase in supply. At the molt, the tracheal system is shed and replaced with a new, larger one. Due to this discontinuous growth of the tracheal system, insect larvae present an ideal system in which to examine the relative contributions of supply and demand of oxygen to the ontogenetic <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> metabolic <b>rate.</b> We observed that the metabolic rate at the beginning <b>of</b> successive instars <b>scales</b> hypoallometrically. This decrease in specific intrinsic demand could be due to a decrease in the proportion of highly metabolically active tissues (the midgut) or to a decrease in mitochondrial activity in individual cells. We found that decreased intrinsic demand, mediated by a decrease in the proportion of highly metabolically active tissues in the fifth instar, along with a decrease in the specific mitochondrial activity, contribute to the hypoallometric <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> metabolic <b>rate...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis: The local {{dimensions}} of defence: the standing army and militia in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex 1649 - 1660. Part l: Interregnum governments faced numerous threats to their security and military power: internally from Royalist conspiracies and political dissidence, and externally from {{the danger of}} a combined Royalist and foreign invasion. The Eastern Counties were of strategic importance to Interregnum governments because of their proximity to London and the Continent, and because of their considerable economic resources. Interregnum governments were able to maintain their control over the region, and draw upon its resources for defence through the region's local and central administrative structures. Part II: The first arm of the Interregnum system of defence was the standing army. This consisted first of the units of horse and foot stationed in the region. The horse were used primarily to respond quickly to internal threats. The foot were stationed in the region primarily to await embarkation for foreign service. The coast was protected {{by a series of}} fortifiet garrisons, the governors of which {{played a key role in}} coordinating the defence and security of the region. A uniform assessment was levied which provided a sound basis for the pay and supply of the standing forces. Part Ill: The standing army was complemented by the militia. Like the standing forces, the traditional county and borough forces were reorganized and put on a sound basis after the Civil War. The new organization provided the framework for local defence up to and after the Restoration. Within this framework, Interregnum governments experimented with various select militias, but with only limited success. Both the 'general' and 'select' militias were administered in the localities by a group of trusted appointees, who worked closely with the garrison governors, and later with the Major-Generals of 1655 and 1659 to coordinate the regions' defence and security. The financial structure of the militia was based on a uniform and statutorily defined <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates.</b> Conclusion: Together the standing army and militia formed part of a single system comprised of three mutually dependent elements: the deployment of men and materials, the maintenance of security, and the raising of funds. The system was put on an efficient basis during the Interregnum and embodied the ideal of publicly uniform administration which characterized Interregnum government as a whole.

40|$|Introduction The {{addition}} {{of aerobic exercise}} to standard rehabilitation can improve functional outcomes and reduce the chance of secondary stroke. Measurement of exercise intensity can be difficult in clinical practice {{due to lack of}} specialised equipment often resulting in insufficient intensities to induce cardiopulmonary strain. Intensity may be assessed by proxy measures such as the Borg <b>Scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> Perceived Exertion (RPE). However, {{there is a lack of}} research investigating the relationship between the Borg RPE scale and objective measures of exercise intensity such as heart rate reserve in the stroke population. Aims and Objectives The primary aim of this research was to investigate whether there was a relationship between perceived exertion and heart rate in a sub-acute stroke population during aerobic exercise. The secondary aim was to determine whether guiding exercise intensity using the Borg RPE scale, was an effective way of achieving recommended target heart rate reserve (HRR) levels of at least 40...|$|R
