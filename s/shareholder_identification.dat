50|$|Using US definitions, {{a person}} who owns street name {{securities}} and {{who is not a}} member of an exchange, holds the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a fiduciary arrangement for the ultimate security holders. However, the ultimate security holders are still the legal owners of the securities. They are not merely beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities.Global securities safekeeping practices vary substantially with markets such as the UK, Australia and South Africa encouraging designated securities accounts in order to permit <b>shareholder</b> <b>identification</b> by companies.|$|E
40|$|Corporate philanthropy {{represents}} {{an increasingly important}} firm decision to demonstrate its sense of responsibility to its stakeholders {{in addition to its}} shareholders. Using China as the research context, we integrate social identity theory and institutional logic perspective by examining the interactions between the different identifications that chief executive officers (CEOs) and board directors have with the shareholders, stakeholders, and government, which jointly affect firms’ engagement in corporate philanthropy. Using the publicly listed Chinese firms for the period 2007 – 2013, we find that a CEO’s identity with stakeholders and government promotes the firm’s philanthropic decisions, but their <b>shareholder</b> <b>identification</b> discourages corporate donations. Further, we find that the firm’s engagement in or disengagement from corporate philanthropy is often strengthened when the identifications of the CEO and directors are aligned, but weakened when the identifications of the CEO and directors are mismatched...|$|E
40|$|Anonymity of {{shareholders}} and the requierements for their identification This thesis {{concentrates on the}} anonymity of shareholders which is currently {{one of the most}} discussed aspects of the corporate law. The topicality of this issue {{was one of the reasons}} for the selection of this topic. Czech legislation has been criticized both by NGOs and a large part of Czech population for the excessive simplicity of the use of anonymous shares and for owners identification impossibility [...] The paper is focused on ways of both hiding the beneficial owner of shares and also <b>shareholders</b> <b>identification.</b> This work is written during the ongoing debate on the abolition of bearer shares, which is considered to be an instrument for corruption or legalization of proceeds from criminal activities, so-called money laundering. Debates on the abolition (or at least reducing) of the shareholders anonymity are being held not only in the Czech Republic. Many countries have already implemented certain instruments in this area. Bearer shares have been canceled without compensations in some countries,, other countries allowed their demeterialized or immobilized form. The aim of this work is to analyze not only valid and effective legislation, but also the legislation enacted in connection with the recodification of private [...] ...|$|R
40|$|LL. M. (Commercial Law) Abstract: As {{a matter}} of {{international}} best practice, the proper regulation of the distribution by a company of its assets to or in favour of its shareholders {{is central to the}} protection of the interests of a company’s creditors and minority shareholders. This dissertation analyses whether the delimitation of the “incurrence of a debt or obligation” as a form of distribution under the Companies Act No. 71 of 2008 (SA Companies Act) and the restriction thereof under section 46 adequately safeguards these parties as interested stakeholders of the company. In so doing, it evaluates the relevant sections of the SA Companies Act against the analogous provisions of the New Zealand Companies No. 105 of 1993 and Model Business Corporation Act of the United States of America. Through a comparative study, this dissertation was able to distil key legislative shortcomings under the SA Companies Act that create confusion or irregularities that could potentially undermine the statute’s ability to shield creditors’ rights and keep minority shareholders from being disadvantaged by disproportionate payments within a single class or amongst different classes of <b>shareholders.</b> The <b>identification</b> of statutory frailties will allow this dissertation to, by way of conclusion, propose suitable legislative amendments which the author believes will reform the SA Companies Act to the extent necessary to ensure that a distribution by way of the incurrence of a debt or obligation cannot undermine the interests of either creditors or minority shareholders...|$|R
