40|$|Rotaxanes {{consisting}} of achiral axle and achiral ring components can possess supramolecular chirality {{due to their}} unique geometrical architectures. To synthesize such chiral rotaxanes, we adapted a prerotaxane method based on aminolysis of a metacyclophane type prerotaxane that had planar chirality, which is composed of an achiral <b>stopper</b> <b>unit</b> and a crown ether type ring component. The prerotaxanes were well resolved using chiral HPLC {{into a pair of}} enantiomerically pure prerotaxanes, which were transferred into corresponding chiral rotaxanes, respectively. Obtained chiral rotaxanes were revealed to have considerable enantioselectivity...|$|E
40|$|Hydrophobic {{self-assembly}} {{has been}} used to direct the synthesis of conjugated [2] and [3]rotaxanes (20 and 21) in aqueous solution, by Glaser coupling a water-soluble alkyne 3 {{in the presence of a}} cyclophane 6. No rotaxanes were formed when cyclodextrins were used instead of the cyclophane. NMR and electrospray mass spectrometry were used to probe the binding properties of the <b>stopper</b> <b>unit</b> 3. NMR ring current shifts and NOEs show that the cyclophane 6 binds mainly to the terminal phenylene unit of 3. In solution cyclodextrins bind less strongly than the cyclophane, whereas in the gas-phase cyclodextrins bind more strongly. The water-soluble rotaxanes are fully characterised by electrospray mass spectrometry, NMR and UV-VIS emission/absorption. Both rotaxanes tend to fragment, by unthreading and by dumbbell-cleavage, during electrospray ionisation, particularly at high cone voltages. The insulation of the conjugated dumbbell inside the [3]rotaxane results in increased fluorescence efficiency. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements show that these rotaxanes decompose during photolysis to give products with longer fluorescence lifetimes; the rate of this photodecomposition is slower for the [3]rotaxane than for the naked dumbbell. The extension of this synthetic approach to larger polyrotaxanes was explored by coupling alkyne 3 and diethynylbenzene 2 in the presence of cyclophane 6; this gives some longer [2] and [3]rotaxanes but higher polyrotaxanes are not formed...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a "threading-followed-by-swelling" protocol to synthesize [2]rotaxanes efficiently and atom economically. Our protocol employs cis- 1 -[(Z) -alk- 1 'enyl]- 2 -vinylcyclopropane units as the termini of the threadlike components; these end groups are converted into more-sizable cycloheptadiene motifs, which function as <b>stopper</b> <b>units,</b> through Cope rearrangements at elevated temperature. We used this approach to synthesize [2]rotaxanes in good yield from [2]pseudorotaxanes featuring either one or two swellable termini to interlock three different types of macrocycle. The chiral centers created by the swelling process were "erased" by hydrogenating the cycloheptadiene termini into the corresponding cycloheptane units, affording achiral molecular [2]rotaxanes as the only final products...|$|R
40|$|Mesoporous silica nanoparticles, {{capable of}} storing a payload of small {{molecules}} and releasing it following specific catalytic activation by an esterase, {{have been designed}} and fabricated. The storage and release of the payload {{is controlled by the}} presence of [2]rotaxanes, which consist of tri(ethylene glycol) chains threaded by α-cyclodextrin tori, located on the surfaces of the nanoparticles and terminated by a large stoppering group. These modified silica nanoparticles are capable of encapsulating guest molecules when the [2]rotaxanes are present. The bulky stoppers, which serve to hold the tori in place, are stable under physiological conditions but are cleaved by the catalytic action of an enzyme, causing dethreading of the tori and release of the guest molecules from the pores of the nanoparticles. These snap-top covered silica nanocontainers (SCSNs) are prepared by a modular synthetic method, in which the <b>stoppering</b> <b>unit,</b> incorporated in the final step of the synthesis, may be changed at will to target the response of the system to any of a number of hydrolytic enzymes. Here, the design, synthesis, and operation of model SCSNs that open in the presence of porcine liver esterase (PLE) are reported. The empty pores of the silica nanoparticles were loaded with luminescent dye molecules (rhodamine B), and <b>stoppering</b> <b>units</b> that incorporate adamantyl ester moieties were then attached in the presence of α-cyclodextrin using the copper-catalyzed azide−alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), closing the SCSNs. The release of rhodamine-B from the pores of the SCSN, following PLE-mediated hydrolysis of the stoppers, was monitored using fluorescence spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} and study of new electro-active compounds {{in order to improve}} understanding of controlling supramolecular interactions between host-guest systems in solution and at the solid-liquid interface ofa conducting polymer backbone. [...] . Firstly, a series of flavin functionalised electrodes has been produced by immobilisation of flavin units as an electropolymerised thin film. We have shown that thin films of the flavin polymer can be deposited onto an electrode surface and that electrochemically controllable hydrogen bonding interactions can occur between the pendant flavin units and diaminopyridine units in solution. Electrochemically tuneable flavin-functionalised C 60 derivatives have been synthesised and the redox-modulator role of hydrogen bonding interactions with diamidopyridine derivatives has been studied. We have shown that the attachment of the flavin unit onto C 60 does not interfere with the ability of the flavin to undergo hydrogen bonding interactions with diamidopyridine. Moreover, hydrogen bonding interactions between the flavin and diamidopyridine units influences the redox properties of the C 60 derivative. We have developed an attractive model system for flavoenzymes that have the cofactor directly attached to the apoenzyme,. by producing a flavin unit that is covalently linked to a diamidopyridineunit. The model compound self-assembles into an intramolecularly hydrogen bonded complex both iIi solution and the solid-state. The addition of an external stimulus disassembles the intramolecular hydrogen bonded complex. A CBPQr+ -based rotaxane has also b~en synthesised and electropolymerised onto an electrode surface by oxidative polymerisation of the 2, 5 -dithienylpyrrole <b>stopper</b> <b>units.</b> We have shown that the rotaxane can be deposited onto a surface. However, electrochemical measurements show that submonolayer coverage occurs. Finally, we have synthesised a range of new flavin building blocks. We have investigated the attachment ofone ofthese systems onto a diamond surface. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Natural cork stoppers are the main product associated to this activity and their production process generates low biodegradability wastewaters, namely during cork boiling and stoppers washing. The recalcitrant compounds present in these type of wastewaters, such as phenolic compounds, are the main responsible for its high toxicity and consequent low biodegradability, therefore conventional biological treatment plants aren´t the suitable {{for this kind of}} effluent. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify and characterize quantitatively and qualitatively the flows of wastewater in a natural cork <b>stoppers</b> production <b>unit</b> and suggest possible treatment scenarios in order to comply with the legal regulations regarding industrial wastewater discharge into municipal collection system. Exploratory coagulation/flocculation assays were carried out and the best results observed were obtained using a mixture of a conventional coagulant (aluminium sulphate) with a biopolymer (Flox®- QTH by Grove Chemicals) achieving a removal efficiency in COD and total phenols of 74 % and 91 %, respectively. Photodegration assays carried out in the washing waters achieved interesting results reaching 75 % of COD removal The coagulation/flocculation treatment using the mixture of aluminium sulphate and biopolymer proved to be a promising solution, however more assays should be carried out to adjust and optimize the dosages and operational condition...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{pioneering}} work {{carried out by}} Sauvage, Stoddart and co-workers [1], [2], {{has focused on the}} development of synthetic methodologies and the characterization of catenanes and rotaxanes. Catenanes and rotaxanes are examples of interlocked molecule. Unlike classical molecular structures, they consist of two or more separate components which are mechanically connected. Catenanes consist of two or more interlocked macrocyclic rings, while rotaxanes are constituted by a macrocyclic ring trapped on a linear unit, i. e., the thread, by two bulky <b>stoppers</b> The submolecular <b>units</b> may undergo relative motions such as “circumrotation ” (rotation of one ring inside the cavity of the other) and “shuttling ” (linear motion along the thread), which may be addressed by external stimuli, such as photons, electrons and solvent variations. This property makes rotaxanes and catenanes prime candidates for the construction of artificial molecular-level machines and possibly for the fabrication of molecular electronic devices [3], attracting considerable attention from chemists, physicists, and materials scientists.

40|$|Rotaxane stellen eine interessante Verbindungsklasse in der Supramolekularen Chemie dar. Diese supramolekularen Strukturen können durch Auffädeln einer Ringkomponente auf eine hantelförmige Achse aufgebaut werden. Das Besondere an Rotaxanen ist die mechanische, nicht kovalente Bindung des Ringes an die Hantelkomponente, weswegen sie als molekulare Shuttle-Systeme sowie für den gerichteten Stofftransport von großem Interesse sind. Im Rahmen des Sonderforschungs-bereiches SFB 677 „Funktion durch Schalten“ sollte eine lichtgetriebene Protonenpumpe auf Rotaxanbasis synthetisiert werden. Die Achse des Rotaxans sollte über zwei Bindestelle (Amid- und Carbonylfunktion) sowie über eine permante {{positive}} Ladung die Bewegung des Makrozyklus steuern. Außerdem sollte der Makrozyklus protonierbar sein, um Protonen von der einen zur anderen Seite des Rotaxans zu transportieren. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit konnten zwei verschiedene Achsen 33 und 34 mit einer permanenten positiven Ladung sowie den gewünschten Bindestellen Amid- und Carbonylfunktion synthetisiert werden. Außerdem konnten unterschiedlich große Makrozyklen 8 a-c erhalten werden. Die Hantelkomponenten 33 und 34 sowie die Makrozyklen 8 a-c wurden anschließend für die Synthese des Rotaxans nach dem slipping-Verfahren eingesetzt. Allerdings führten die slipping-Versuche nicht zum gewünschten [2]-Rotaxan. Aus diesem Grund wurde alternativ die trapping-Methode eingesetzt. Über eine Kupfer-katalysierte „click-Reaktion“ konnten die Rotaxane 50 und 62 erhalten werden. Allerdings ließ sich nur das Rotaxan 62 mit einer verlängerten Alkinkomponente isolieren. NMR-spektroskopische Untersuchungen konnten zeigen, dass die Ringkomponente durch den Zusatz von Säure zur zweiten Bindestelle geschaltet werden kann. In der lichtgetriebenen Protonenpumpe sollen die Protonen durch Tautomerisierung einer photoschaltbaren Säure erzeugt werden. Damit die Protonen auf den Makrozyklus übertragen werden können, muss die photoschaltbare Einheit an geeigneter Stelle in das Rotaxan integriert werden. Hierfür wurden vier verschiedene Photosäuren auf o-Nitrotoluolbasis synthetisiert und mit Pyridin-Stopper-Einheiten verknüpft. Rotaxanes {{represent an}} interesting class of compounds in supramolecular chemistry. These supramolecular structures {{could be obtained}} via threading a ring compound on a dumbbell-shaped axis. Due {{to the fact that}} the ring and the axis are not connected covalently, but mechanically interlocked, rotaxanes increasingly come into the focus of interest for the development of molecular shuttle systems as well as for electron and energy transfer or the transport of protons. Within the scope of the Collaborative Research Center (SFB 677) ”Function by Switching”, a rotaxane had to be synthesized acting as a light driven proton pump. Two different binding sites (an amide and a carbonyl function) as well as a permanent positive charge within the axis should control the movement of the macrocycle. In order to transport the proton from one recognition site of the rotaxane to the other, the ring has to contain a tertiary protonable amine. Two different axes 33 and 34 were synthesized with a permanent positive charge and the desired binding sites, amide and carbonyl function. In addition, three macrocycles 8 a-c of different size were synthesized. Rotaxane formation experiments were carried out via a slipping process using the dumbbell-shaped units 33 and 34 as well as the ring compounds 8 a-c. But no rotaxane could be obtained by this procedure. Alternatively the trapping method was used for rotaxane formation. Via copper catalysed click reaction, two rotaxanes 50 and 62 were synthesized. But only the compound 62 with a longer axis could be isolated. Rotaxane 62 was investigated via NMR spectroscopy. NMR spectra showed that the addition of acid to the rotaxane solution forces the macrocycle to move to the other binding site. In the light driven proton pump, protons are planned to be generated by the tautomerization of a photoswitchable acid. To transfer the proton from the acid to the ring compound, the photoswitchable unit has to be integrated into the rotaxane close to the pyridine ring of the axis. Therefore four different photo acids based on o-nitrotoluene were synthesized and connected to pyridine <b>stopper</b> <b>units...</b>|$|R
