A 2004 molecular study of cytochrome-b DNA sequences shows them to have <b>split</b> <b>off</b> from typical hawks and eagles at an earlier date than the Osprey, which has been classified in its own family.|$|E
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{started in}} mid-1986 with parties at popular science fiction conventions, such as Westercon and BayCon in the San Francisco Bay Area. Over time, these parties <b>split</b> <b>off</b> into conventions of their own, starting with ConFurence 0 in 1989.

5|$|Historically, most European newts were {{included}} in the genus, but taxonomists have <b>split</b> <b>off</b> the alpine newts (Ichthyosaura), the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton) and the banded newts (Ommatotriton) as separate genera. The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts (Calotriton). Two species of marbled newts and seven species of crested newts are accepted, of which the Anatolian crested newt was only described in 2016. Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap, hybridisation may take place.|$|E
50|$|In 1806, Genesee County {{was reduced}} in size by the <b>splitting</b> <b>off</b> of Allegany County.

5|$|Idaho Territory {{was created}} from Dakota Territory, Nebraska Territory, and Washington Territory on March 4, 1863. Initially, the {{territory}} included all of modern-day Idaho and Montana, {{and most of}} Wyoming. On May 26, 1864, Montana Territory was split from Idaho Territory, {{and most of the}} Wyoming portion was reassigned to Dakota Territory. The portion east of the 111th meridian was <b>split</b> <b>off</b> as part of the new Wyoming Territory on July 25, 1868, giving Idaho Territory its final borders.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 1941, the {{southern}} SH-30 was extended {{further to the}} south. The highway proceeded east from Hollis along US-62, then, at Gould, turned south along what was previously an unnumbered farm-to-market road. The route turned back east to end at SH-34 and SH-44 in Eldorado. This extension encompassed all of the present-day western SH-5. By January 1942, however, this extension of SH-30 would be <b>split</b> <b>off</b> to form the new SH-90.|$|E
5|$|Sampson felt, in 1995, {{that there}} was not enough {{evidence}} to conclude that Achelousaurus was a direct descendant of Einiosaurus. Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein Achelousaurus <b>split</b> <b>off</b> between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis.|$|E

50|$|State Highway 9 {{joins the}} interstate {{crossing}} over the South Canadian River into Cleveland County, after which it <b>splits</b> <b>off</b> again. It then {{serves as a}} major urban interstate in Norman and Moore. Between Norman and Moore, US-77 joins the interstate again. It then enters Oklahoma City and Oklahoma County near milepost 120. Near downtown, I-35 <b>splits</b> <b>off</b> the mainline (which becomes Interstate 235/US-77) and runs concurrent with Interstate 40 for a mile before <b>splitting</b> <b>off</b> to the north again. Interstate 44 then joins I-35 between mileposts 133 and 137. In Edmond US-77 joins the interstate yet again.|$|R
5|$|Along the Humboldt, {{the group}} met Paiute Native Americans, who joined {{them for a}} couple of days but stole or shot several oxen and horses. By now, it was well into October, and the Donner {{families}} <b>split</b> <b>off</b> to make better time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned the whip on him. Reed retaliated by fatally plunging a knife under Snyder's collarbone.|$|E

The Pacific Medical Center Clinic continues {{to operate in the}} first two floors of the building. In 2010, Amazon.com ended its sub-lease with WRC.Com Tower LLC and began the move of its headquarters to a new campus in the city's South Lake Union neighborhood. Much of the building was left vacant without new tenants moving into the space. The location outside of downtown Seattle was a constraint for businesses.|$|E
5|$|Arana's support {{began to}} be {{solicited}} by the landed elite, who felt threatened by Arévalo's reforms. Arana, who was not initially inclined {{to get involved with}} politics, began to make occasional statements against the government. In the 1948 parliamentary election, he backed a number of opposition candidates, all of whom were defeated. By 1949 the National Renovation Party and the PAR were both openly hostile to Arana, while a small fragment of the Popular Liberation Front <b>split</b> <b>off</b> to support him. The leftist parties decided to back Árbenz instead, as they believed that only a military officer could defeat Arana.|$|E

5|$|As the Ju 87s {{reached the}} coast, the {{respective}} groups <b>split</b> <b>off</b> {{and headed for}} their assigned targets. By this time, some 15 miles off the Isle of Wight, the Bf 109s had caught up and were now zigzagging around the dive-bombers. Bode led III./StG 77 to attack from the northwest, dead into wind in order to bomb accurately. Usually the Ju 87s attacked in line astern, but Bode chose to attack in groups of three to split the anti-aircraft fire. To keep the enemy's heads down, he fired his machine guns in an 80-degree dive. He soon left an altitude of 13,000feet, releasing his bombs and pulling out at 2,275feet. The rest of his unit followed.|$|E
5|$|Described by German {{zoologist}} Friedrich Boie in 1826, {{the genus}} Phylloscopus contains about 50 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and yellowish, white or buff below. The genus was formerly {{part of the}} Old World warbler family Sylvidae, but has now been <b>split</b> <b>off</b> as a separate family Phylloscopidae. The chiffchaff's closest relatives, other than former subspecies, are a group of leaf warblers which similarly lack crown stripes, a yellow rump or obvious wing bars; they include the willow, Bonelli's, wood and plain leaf warblers.|$|E

The Spanish had already mobilised their forces and {{at the start of}} September the Marquis of Villadarias, the captain-general of Andalusia, arrived in the vicinity of Gibraltar with an army of 4,000 men. Villadarias planned to increase his force to 12,000, consisting of 9,000 Spaniards and 3,000 Frenchmen. The Two Crowns force was also supplemented by many of the civilian refugees from Gibraltar.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, Horner {{admitted}} that specimen TMP2002.76.1 {{seemed to indicate}} that Achelousaurus was not descended from Einiosaurus, as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. But he stressed {{that even if the}} lineages <b>split</b> <b>off,</b> its ancestor might have resembled Einiosaurus. Furthermore, it might still be possible that Einiosaurus was a direct descendant of Rubeosaurus. Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{original}} routing {{of what is now}} I-84 existed as early as 1923; however the portion of now I-84 into Idaho was not yet constructed. In 1926, much of the route was signed as US-30S, from the now eastern terminus at I-80 (US-530 then), northwest into Ogden. Between Ogden and Brigham City, the highway was to be concurrent with US-91, then US-30S <b>split</b> <b>off</b> northwest to the Idaho border. The entire western branch of US-30S was an unimproved road, however the concurrency into Ogden was paved. The remainder of the route to its now terminus was mostly graded with a few improved sections, and by 1937, the entire route was paved.|$|E
5|$|NY365 is {{the only}} post-1930 state route that once entered Hamilton County, but no longer does. When it was {{assigned}} , the route entered Hamilton County from Herkimer County, overlapping with NY28 until Blue Mountain Lake. Here, it turned off NY28 and onto NY10 (later NY30) and NY28N. The three routes overlapped to Long Lake, where NY28N <b>split</b> <b>off</b> from both NY10 and NY365. The two highways continued northward, leaving Hamilton County and passing into Franklin County north of Long Lake. NY365 was truncated in the late 1950s to end near the Oneida County village of Holland Patent, eliminating a series of overlaps between NY365 and other state routes that collectively extended from Holland Patent to Plattsburgh, Clinton County.|$|E
