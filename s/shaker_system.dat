5000|$|The F-104 series {{all had a}} {{very high}} wing loading (made even higher when {{carrying}} external stores). The high angle of attack area of flight was protected by a stick <b>shaker</b> <b>system</b> to warn the pilot of an approaching stall, and if this was ignored, a stick pusher system would pitch the aircraft's nose down to a safer angle of attack; this was often overridden by the pilot despite flight manual warnings against this practice. At extremely high angles of attack the F-104 was known to [...] "pitch-up" [...] and enter a spin, from which in most cases {{it was impossible to}} recover. Unlike the twin-engined McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II for example, the F-104 with its single engine lacked the safety margin {{in the case of an}} engine failure, and had a poor glide ratio without thrust.|$|E

5000|$|There {{were two}} non-flying relief pilots {{in the cockpit}} during takeoff; both noticed the {{aircraft}} had lost approximately 40 knots indicated airspeed after the problems with #3 engine and shouted 'airspeed' to the first officer to alert him to the potential stall danger. At that point, the stick <b>shaker</b> <b>system</b> activated and the captain took {{over control of the}} aircraft. The captain later stated he held the aircraft level to gain airspeed and avoid a stall, but it had drifted to the right due to the imbalanced thrust and narrowly missed colliding with San Bruno Mountain, which rises to a height of 1319 ft above sea level, excluding the television and radio towers on its summit.According to the cockpit voice and flight data recordings, rather than using the rudders, the first officer had tried to compensate for the right drift by turning the aircraft to the left. Turning the aircraft involved the use of ailerons and spoilers on the wing, which increased the aircraft's drag and activated the stick shaker stall warning again. The relief pilots urged the first officer to enter a shallow dive to gain airspeed and avoid a stall, but this soon brought the aircraft close to San Bruno Mountain, and the ground proximity warning alerted the relief pilots and first officer to pull up to avoid striking the hill. By later accounts, the aircraft narrowly cleared San Bruno Mountain by only 100 ft. The aircraft had approached San Bruno Mountain so closely that air traffic control radars briefly stopped detecting the aircraft. An air traffic controller in the San Francisco tower was conversing with one of her colleagues and said, [...] "... Is United 863 still ... oh there he is, he scared me, we lost radar ..." [...] Residents in houses along the flight path, in South San Francisco, Daly City, and San Francisco, called into the airport to complain about the noise and voice their fears the aircraft was about to crash.|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} of dimensions and {{recent advances in}} lightweight design of space systems {{have led to the}} requirement of new structural dynamic qualification techniques. Dynamic qualification means experimental simulation of the structural dynamic environment in order to check the dynamic behaviour of spacecraft. Presently, structural dynamic qualification of space systems is accomplished by means of single-axis electrodynamic <b>shaker</b> <b>systems.</b> For the last ten years multi-axis hydraulic <b>shaker</b> <b>systems</b> have also been under investigation to supplement and possibly replace the current single-axis testing philosophy. Both methods apply base acceleration at the interface between the satellite and launcher. Thus, they require high forces in order to accelerate the total mass of the test structure. An alternative test philosophy was proposed and investigated in a study funded by ESA. The new concept called the Modal Force Combination (MFC) technique replaces the base acceleration by having a set of forces acting directly in a selected number of structural points. The forces compensate for the d'Alembert's inertia forces, which arise due to the transient multi-axial base acceleration. The transient forcing functions are calculated by means of modal deformations and related modal force distributions {{in order to get the}} same structural responses of the structure as would occur by base acceleration. The direct substitution of distributed forces by means of a set of single forces yielding the same responses is generally impossible. This would require too many exciters. However, the MFC method offers two possibilities to perform a simulation. The first version is based on the demand for the equality of the input energy expressed bymeans of the modes of vibration. The second version starts with the demand for the equality of the structural responses in the points o...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to their}} long and {{flexible}} structures, deep-water risers may experience multi-modal vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) with very high mode number. These multi-modal vibration responses usually {{depend on the}} modal parameters of riser vibration systems, such as modal natural frequencies, modal mass, modal damping and modal stiffness. This paper presents a model riser test, {{which was designed to}} investigate these modal parameters. In the test, a highly flexible model riser was used. It was made of rubber hose and was 8. 5 m in length and 0. 04 m in diameter. The model riser was fixed horizontally on a supporting frame below the tank carriage and was then placed at a water-depth of 1. 0 m. A <b>shaker</b> <b>system</b> was used to excite the riser in a controlled manner. The excitation forces and the vibration accelerations over the riser length were respectively measured by a load cell on the shaker and sixteen pairs of accelerometers inside the riser. The riser was excited harmonically and randomly by the <b>shaker</b> <b>system</b> and the frequency response functions (FRF) of the riser were obtained by the relationship between the shaker excitation forces and the riser vibration responses. The modal natural frequencies, the modal mass, the modal damping and modal stiffness were analyzed based on these FRFs. Three different models were respectively employed for the analysis. These models include a frequency-dependent model, a location-dependent model and a frequency- and location-independent model. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} numerical verification of a test method to realistically simulate the seismic structural response of full-scale buildings. The result is a new field testing procedure {{referred to as the}} linear shaker seismic simulation (LSSS) testing method. This test method uses a linear <b>shaker</b> <b>system</b> in which a mass mounted on the structure is commanded to follow a specified acceleration response history, which in turn induces inertial forces in the structure. The inertia force of the moving mass is transferred as dynamic force excitation to the structure. The key issues associated with the LSSS method are (1) determining for a given ground motion displacement, xg, a linear shaker motion which induces a structural response that matches as closely as possible the response of the building if it had been excited at its base by xg (i. e., the motion transformation problem) and (2) correcting the linear shaker motion from Step 1 to compensate for control-structure interaction (CSI) effects associated with the fact that linear shaker systems cannot impart perfectly to the structure the specified forcing functions (i. e., the CSI problem). The motion transformation problem is solved using filters that modify xg both in the frequency domain using building transfer functions and in the time domain using a least squares approximation. The CSI problem, which is most important near the modal frequencies of the structural system, is solved for the example of a linear <b>shaker</b> <b>system</b> {{that is part of the}} nees@UCLA equipment site...|$|E
40|$|The {{high level}} {{vibration}} of helicopter flight can cause physiological {{damage to the}} aircrew and may lead to occupational health issues. This paper presents {{the development of an}} active suspension system for helicopter seats to reduce the vibration levels transmitted to the aircrew body. Flight test on a Bell- 412 helicopter was conducted to measure the aircrew body vibration levels and vibration transmission through the seat structures. In addition, an experimental modal analysis on a Bell- 412 pilot seat equipped with a mannequin was carried out to investigate the seat and aircrew dynamics to identify critical vibration modes. Based on these tests, an active suspension system for the helicopter seat has been developed to be integrated on helicopter seats to reduce the vibration locally. This active suspension system included two stacked piezoelectric actuators installed on the seat frame as active struts to provide effective control authority to the critical mannequin vibration modes. A proof-of-concept active suspension system has been retrofitted on a full-scale Bell- 412 pilot seat and the performance has been evaluated through extensive closed-loop control experiments performed on a mechanical <b>shaker</b> <b>system.</b> The mechanical <b>shaker</b> <b>system</b> was able to generate the representative vibration environment of the seat during flight. Test results demonstrated simultaneous suppression of the critical mannequin vibration modes and achieved significant global reduction of body vibration levels, which verified the effectiveness of the active suspension system for the helicopter seat to mitigate the vibration transmitted to the helicopter aircrew. The test results verified the effectiveness of an active suspension system implemented on the seat as a potential solution to reduce long term health issues faced by the helicopter aircrew.

40|$|The {{increasing}} complexity {{with the}} decrease in size of EEE – components (Electronic, electric and electromagnetic) raises the question on how higher energy frequencies will affect the components and their continuous development.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the concept of}} the Higher Order Sinusoidal Output Describing Functions (HOSODF) is presented. HOSODF can be defined for the class of causal, stable, time {{invariant}} non-linear systems which give a sinusoidal response to a specific harmonic excitation. The HOSODF relate the magnitude and phase of the individual harmonics, which together compose that specific input signal, to the sinusoidal output signal of such a system. HOSODF are the dual of the Higher Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (Nuij 2006). Like the HOSIDF, the HOSODF are the results of an extension of linear techniques towards non-linear systems analysis. Using the HOSODF, the non-linear systems under investigation can be modeled as a cascade of the HOSODF and a Virtual Harmonics Compressor (VHC). The VHC is defined as a non-linear component which transforms a harmonic input signal ¿(t) into a sinusoidal output signal y(t) with frequency ¿, amplitude â and phase f. This input signal ¿(t) consists of an infinite amount of harmonics of the output signal y(t) with frequency n¿, amplitude â and phase nf with n= 0, 1,… 8. Special attention is paid to the non-parametric identification of the HOSODF. The identification requires control of the frequency and amplitude of the sinusoidal output of the system within its domain of possible sinusoidal output signals. This specific state of these non-linear systems can be reached by incorporating the system under test in a feedback loop. In this loop the desired sinusoidal output is defined as the control objective of a dedicated repetitive controller consisting of a memory loop with positive feedback. The design of the learning filter required for stability is also addressed. As a spinoff of the identification technique, the authors see opportunities for advanced non-linear control of <b>shaker</b> <b>systems</b> aimed at sinusoidal excitation of non-linear systems...|$|R

Loss of function mutations in NOTCH 1 cause bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and calcific aortic valve disease.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} {{demonstrated}} the large potential for hybrid active-passive systems for attenuating interior noise in aircraft fuselages. The main {{advantage of an}} active-passive system is, by utilizing the natural dynamics of the actuator system, the control actuator power and weight is markedly reduced and stability/robustness is enhanced. Three different active-passive approaches were studied in the past year. The first technique utilizes multiple tunable vibration absorbers (ATVA) for reducing narrow band sound radiated from panels and transmitted through fuselage structures. The focus is on reducing interior noise due to propeller or turbo fan harmonic excitation. Two types of tunable vibration absorbers were investigated; a solid state system based upon a piezoelectric mechanical exciter and an electromechanical system based upon a Motran shaker. Both of these systems utilize a mass-spring dynamic effect to maximize tile output force near resonance of the <b>shaker</b> <b>system</b> and so {{can also be used}} as vibration absorbers. The dynamic properties of the absorbers (i. e. resonance frequency) were modified using a feedback signal from an accelerometer mounted on the active mass, passed through a compensator and fed into the drive component of the <b>shaker</b> <b>system</b> (piezoelectric element or voice coil respectively). The feedback loop consisted of a two coefficient FIR filter, implemented on a DSP, where the input is acceleration of tile ATVA mass and the output is a force acting in parallel with the stiffness of the absorber. By separating the feedback signal into real and imaginary components, the effective natural frequency and damping of the ATVA can be altered independently. This approach gave control of the resonance frequencies while also allowing the simultaneous removal of damping from the ATVA, thus increasing the ease of controllability and effectiveness. In order to obtain a "tuned" vibration absorber the chosen resonant frequency was set to the excitation frequency. In order to minimize sound radiation a gradient descent algorithm was developed which globally adapted the resonance frequencies of multiple ATVA's while minimizing a cost based upon the radiated sound power or sound energy obtained from an array of microphones...|$|E
