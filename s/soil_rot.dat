Cellulose may be further hydrolyzed to cellobiose or glucose in an acidic medium, and eventually form valuable humus. Humans cannot digest cellulose and excrete the fibers in feces, because, unlike ruminant animals, termites, and some bacteria and fungi, they lack cellulolytic enzymes such as cellulase.

40|$|Strains of {{the sweet}} potato <b>soil</b> <b>rot</b> {{pathogen}} Streptomyces ipomoeae had previously been divided into three groups based {{on their ability to}} inhibit one another during pairwise cocultivation. While group I strains are not antagonistic to members of the other groups, group II and group III strains produce separate substances that are inhibitory to strains outside their respective cognate groups. Here, we purified the group III inhibitory substance from the culture supernatant of a representative strain and found that it consists of a single 10 -kDa cationic protein which is bacteriolytic for S. ipomoeae group I and II strains but which showed no inhibitory function against other streptomycetes or other bacterial genera tested. The structural gene for the inhibitor was cloned from a chromosomal library of the producing strain, and while the gene sequence revealed that the inhibitor is initially made in a larger precursor form, the deduced mature protein showed no significant homology to other known proteins. Our results demonstrate that S. ipomoeae group III inhibitory activity is manifested {{in the form of a}} highly specific, potentially novel bacteriocin, which we have designated ipomicin...|$|E

50|$|The Microascales are {{an order}} of fungi in the class Sordariomycetes, {{subclass}} Hypocreomycetidae. This is a relatively small order of mostly saprobic fungi that live in <b>soil,</b> <b>rotting</b> vegetation and dung. Some species are plant pathogens, such as Ceratocystis fimbriata, transmitted by beetles to living trees and causing cacao wilt and many other economically important diseases. Species in the genus Pseudallescheria (family Microascaceae) are pathogenic to humans, for example, Pseudallescheria boydii can cause allergic bronchopulmonary disease.

40|$|Fifty {{species of}} guanophilic (bat guano-loving) fungi were {{isolated}} from field-collected samples within three caves in southwestern Puerto Rico; most were mitosporic fungi (23 species). The caves studied were Cueva La Tuna (Cabo Rojo), Cueva de Malano (Sistema de Los Chorros, San Germán), and Cueva Viento (El Convento Cave-Spring System, Guayanilla-Peñuelas). The most conspicuous fungus by far was the zygomycete Circinella umbellata (Mucorales). Circinella umbellata dominated the bat guano incubation chambers (Petri dishes lined with sterile filter paper moistened with sterile water) at ambient laboratory conditions. Nineteen species of basidiomycetes (e. g., Ganoderma cf. resinaceum, Geastrum cf. minimum, Lepiota sp., Polyporus sp., Ramaria sp.) and three species of ascomycetes (Hypoxylon sp., Xylaria anisopleura, and X. kegeliana) were also recorded.

40|$|During {{the years}} 1981 - 1985, there were {{conducted}} {{studies of the}} healthiness of broad bean,'Nadwiślański' variety, cultivated in different {{soil and climate conditions}} of the two regions: i. e.

It was found that the main reason for a premature broad bean leaves dry in up in the Olsztyn-Elbląg Region was caused by the fungi Cercospora and Botrytis, and in the Bydgoszcz Region - the root rot which occurs here to a greater extent. Root gangrene was greater intensity in drier and lighter <b>soils.</b> <b>Rotting</b> broad bean roots were most frequently occupied by the fungi of the Fusarium family (ca. 70 %).

50|$|The {{habitat of}} Solenopsis molesta is vast, {{because they can}} survive just about anywhere. They can live in people’s homes, in the cracks or under the floorboards. They can build nests anywhere, such as under rocks, in any exposed <b>soil,</b> and <b>rotting</b> logs. If they cannot find any of these things, then they move into another colony.

50|$|Disease risk {{is further}} {{affected}} by the ecology. For example, many social insects nest and forage in habitats that are rich in pathogens, such as <b>soil</b> or <b>rotting</b> wood, exposing them to a plethora of microparasites, e.g. fungi, bacteria, viruses and macroparasites, e.g. mites and nematodes. In addition, shared food resources, such as flowers, can act as disease hubs for social insect pollinators, promoting both interspecific and intraspecific pathogen transmission. This may be a contributing factor in the spread of emergent infectious diseases in bees.|$|R
40|$|In {{semi-arid}} {{region of}} Northeast, Brazil, the giant cactus pear is a forage that contains, on average, 90 % water {{and helps to}} relieve the thirst of the catlle, mainly in the dry season. The use of Opuntia ficus-indica as fodder for animals has been gaining space, especially in the states of Alagoas, Pernambuco and Paraiba. This study aimed to investigate the effects of curing of cladodes in root emission in giant cactus pear. An experiment was established composed of 300 cladodes, planted with spacing of 0. 5 x 0. 5 m, a total area of 100 m 2 where the soil was classified as Neossol Regolithic Eutrophic. The cure of cladodes was conducted in the shade {{for a period of}} 0, 8, 16, 24 and 32 days. The results showed that the best treatment and that provided the greatest number of roots was the period of curing for 32 days and planted at 15 days. The greatest length of giant cactus pear roots was obtained when the cladodes were subjected to a cure period of 32 days and planted to 25 days after cure.

The residues of DDTs in different pH soils decreasing order was: pH 4. 5 >pH 3. 5 >pH 5. 5 >pH 2. 5 >pH 6. 5.

Endogone grows in <b>soil,</b> on <b>rotting</b> wood, {{sphagnum}} or other plant material either as saprobes or ectomycorrhizal associates. Endogone is especially important in the ecology of nutrient-poor soils. For example, Endogone fungi are known to grow in sand dunes, a nutrient-deficient substrate. Dune plants are dependent upon the fungus for growth and ecological success: the mycelium of the fungus helps aggregate and stabilize the sand in a network of hyphae, giving it cohesion and helping early succession plants establish roots. It also traps and binds fragments of organic material such as decaying roots and rhizomes.|$|R
