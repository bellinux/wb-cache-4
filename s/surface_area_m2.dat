This study ainu {{to describe the}} population pharmacokinetics of CBZ in {{children and young adults}} and rest the hypothesis that CBZ clearance correlates with weight, surface area, and age. CBZ therapeutic drug monitoring data (sparse data) were collected from child and adult epileptics, and rich data were obtained from a bioequivalence study of CBZ in young adults. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using NONMEM V. Forward stepwise, multiple regression was performed on the covariates. Bootstrap validation was performed. A total of 946 observations from 91 subjects, ages 0. 7 - 37 years, were collected and analyzed. A one-compartment, first-order absorption and elimination model, with exponential interindividual error and additive residual error models was developed.

40|$|A kind of {{mesoporous}} Zr-P-Al materials was synthesized by a three-step method, {{in which}} a hexagonal zirconium oxide-sulfate composite was prepared and subsequently treated with a phosphoric acid solution followed by the treatment with AlCl 3 solutions. These materials had ordered cylindrical pores, and their textual data depended {{on the amount of}} AlCl 3 and calcination temperature. Small amount of Al incorporation (Al/Zr = 0. 49) leaded to a microporous material with a Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of 314 <b>m(2)</b> /g and a pore size of 0. 6 nm. Increasing the Al/Zr ratio resulted in mesoporous materials with higher BET specific <b>surface</b> <b>area.</b> The mesoporous Zr-P-Al material exhibited a BET specific <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of 462 <b>m(2)</b> /g and a pore size of 2. 9 nm after calcination at 773 K. 973 K calcination led to a BET specific <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of 416 <b>m(2)</b> /g and a pore size of 2. 7 nm. Even after calcination at 1073 K, a BET specific <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> of 227 <b>m(2)</b> /g and a pore size of 3. 2 nm could still be observed. The pentacoordinated aluminium species seemed to be indispensable for the synthesis of mesoporous Zr-P-Al materials because of their effective reduction of the lattice contraction. NMR results showed that a hexacoordinated aluminium layer, a (HO) (2) P(O-Zr) (2) layer and a Zr(OH) layer combined with each other were formed after AlCl 3 treatment. Upon calcination, the layers of Al 2 O 3, (Zr-O) (2) PO 2 and ZrO 2 formed the walls of the mesoporous Zr-P-Al materials. This unique structure was suggested to be responsible for the high thermal stability (up to 1073 K). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
