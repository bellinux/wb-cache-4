5|$|The {{resulting}} power vacuums in {{the weeks}} following the Japanese surrender, created an atmosphere of uncertainty, but also one of opportunity for the Republicans. Many pemuda joined pro-Republic struggle groups (badan perjuangan). The most disciplined were soldiers from the Japanese-formed but disbanded Giyugun (PETA) and Heiho groups. Many groups were undisciplined, due to both the circumstances of their formation and what they perceived as revolutionary <b>spirit.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first weeks, Japanese troops often withdrew from urban areas to avoid confrontations.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how rennet (an enzyme from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in cheesemaking. This forms the embryo; {{it is then}} {{developed}} {{by the action of}} the pneuma (literally, breath or <b>spirit)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> semen. The pneuma first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The pneuma then makes the other organs develop.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To describe, evaluate, {{and suggest}} interpretations for an {{observed}} aggregate-level relation between trends in mortality from cirrhosis and {{per capita consumption}} of distilled <b>spirits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. DESIGN: Trend analysis using data on US cirrhosis mortality and per capita alcohol consumption. RESULTS: There is a consistent long-term trend relation between mortality from cirrhosis and per capita consumption of distilled <b>spirits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States from 1949 to 1994. Two instances of comparatively sharp drops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> consumption of <b>spirits</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940 s generated mixed results in predicting changes in cirrhosis mortality. CONCLUSIONS: An aggregate-level relation between trends in long-term cirrhosis mortality and the consumption of spirits falls considerably short of establishing a direct causal link between the two for individuals. Moreover, two sharp drops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> consumption of <b>spirits</b> generated only mixed results with respect to <b>the</b> short-term trend <b>in</b> cirrhosis. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> observed relation between the consumption of spirits and cirrhosis mortality merits further investigation...|$|R

5|$|It {{contained}} a mihrab ("niche indicating direction towards Mecca.") The maqam was noted by Guérin in 1863. Its eastern dome was {{constructed by the}} residents of Deir Ghassaneh, while local legend holds the western dome was completed by angels. The interior of the domes were simple and typical of most maqamat domes, lacking cross-vault roofing which was a common feature for most of Deir Ghassaneh's buildings. The sanctuary had a two-door entrance on its northern end. The interior walls were whitewashed, reflecting the Muslim tradition of heavenly light and <b>spirit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> color white. A few verses from the Qur'an were written on parts of the walls. The tomb of al-Khawwas was covered in white cloth. A small niche on the western wall was fitted for an oil lamp.|$|E
5|$|Mahler {{had been}} {{convinced}} {{from the start}} of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human <b>spirit.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W. Adorno, Robert Simpson and Jonathan Carr found its optimism unconvincing, and considered it artistically and musically inferior to Mahler's other symphonies. Conversely, it has also been compared—by Deryck Cooke—to Ludwig van Beethoven's Symphony No.9 as a defining human statement for its century.|$|E

The crew of the Ravenswood split into teams, but within moments of boarding, only one remains; Tom Hansen, who hears his shipmates being killed over the radio. He sets out to explore the ship and determine what is happening.|$|E

5|$|The {{ideology}} {{surrounding the}} living king was also {{affected by the}} Osiris myth. The Egyptians envisioned {{the events of the}} Osiris myth as taking place sometime in Egypt's dim prehistory, and Osiris, Horus, and their divine predecessors were included in Egyptian lists of past kings such as the Turin Royal Canon. Horus, as a primeval king and as the personification of kingship, was regarded as the predecessor and exemplar for all Egyptian rulers. His assumption of his father's throne and pious actions to sustain his <b>spirit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterlife were the model for all pharaonic successions to emulate. Each new king was believed to renew maat after the death of the preceding king, just as Horus had done. In royal coronations, rituals alluded to Osiris's burial, and hymns celebrated the new king's accession as the equivalent of Horus's own.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Lake and Hezmalhalch to America was an {{important}} turning point for the AFM. Le Roux was elected its president in 1913, a role he filled until 1943. During his leadership, the AFM distanced itself from the black Zionist movement with its distinctive taboos and dress and began looking to the Dutch Reformed heritage and respectability. During his leadership {{a large portion of}} the AFM's African constituency withdrew in 1919. Another schism occurred in 1928 when Maria Fraser led a number of AFM members to withdraw and form the Latter Rain Mission in South Africa. She and her followers, known as Blourokkies (Blue Dresses) for the dresses worn by female adherents, emphasized Holy Spirit-inspired prophecy to a degree seen as unbiblical, excessive and dangerous by AFM officials. The movement did, however, contribute to a re-emphasis on the work and presence of the Holy <b>Spirit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> church and ministry.|$|E
