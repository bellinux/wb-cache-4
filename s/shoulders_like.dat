25|$|The {{neckband}} of {{the hood}} usually has a loop of which original {{function is to}} hook onto the button of a cassock. Since many do not wear cassocks for graduation, the loop is sometimes hooked onto a shirt button instead. However, since the hood is rather heavy this {{has a tendency to}} pull the lightweight shirt upwards. The correct way to wear the hood is to allow the neckband to naturally hook itself onto the collar under the tie which secures the hood in place. Sometimes, the hood is worn too forward and down being hooked onto the jacket button or pinned which causes the hood to sit poorly and be more likely to slip down the <b>shoulders</b> <b>like</b> a shawl.|$|E
25|$|The literal commandment in {{the bible}} was not to wear a tallit but to attach tzitzit to the corners of one's four-cornered garments, {{implying}} that such clothes were worn in any event by people of the region. Such garments were large, white and rectangular and used a garment, bed sheet, and burial shroud. These four-cornered garments may have developed from similar garments suitable for the climate of West Asia where typically the days are hot and the garment can be draped around the body and head to provide cover from the sun or just bunched up on the shoulders for later evening use; the evenings can be dramatically cool and the garment could be draped around the neck and <b>shoulders</b> <b>like</b> a scarf to provide warmth. Such garments continue to be worn today in the region, for instance the Bedouin square-form abbaya.|$|E
25|$|The basic garment {{for both}} genders and all classes was the tunica (tunic), often worn beneath {{one or more}} {{additional}} layers. In its simplest form, the tunic was a single rectangle of woven fabric, originally woolen, but from the mid-republic onward, increasingly made from linen. It was sewn into a sleeveless tubular shape and pinned around the <b>shoulders</b> <b>like</b> a Greek chiton, to form openings for the neck and arms. In some examples from {{the eastern part of}} the empire, neck openings were formed in the weaving. Sleeves could be added. Most working men wore knee-length, short-sleeved tunics, secured at the waist with a belt. Some traditionalists considered long sleeved tunics appropriate only for women, very long tunics on men as a sign of effeminacy, and short or unbelted tunics as marks of servility. Women's tunics were usually ankle or foot-length, long-sleeved, and could be worn loosely or belted. Though essentially simple in basic design, tunics could also be luxurious in their fabric, colours and detailing.|$|E

500|$|The collar is worn {{around the}} neck, over the mantle and is secured with white ribbons tied in bows on the <b>shoulders.</b> <b>Like</b> the mantle, it was {{introduced}} in the 15th and 16th centuries. Made of pure gold, it weighs 30 troy ounces (0.933kg). The collar is composed of gold heraldic knots alternating with enamelled medallions, each showing a rose encircled by the Garter. During the reign of King Henry VII (1485-1509), commencing at the termination of the Wars of the Roses, each garter surrounded two roses — one red for the House of Lancaster and one white for the House of York — but he changed the design to encircle the Tudor rose alone, a combination of both forms. Today one of the most visible representations of the collar forms part of the monarch's heraldic achievement on the gates of Buckingham Palace.|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle lauded {{the film}} for {{containing}} {{a sense of}} urgency [...] "that keeps the pedestrian problems of an unremarkable 18th century family immediate and personal." [...] LaSalle concluded that the adaptation has a [...] "right balance of irony and warmth. The result is a film of great understanding and emotional clarity, filmed with an elegance that never calls attention to itself." [...] Film critic John Simon praised most of the film, particularly focusing on Thompson's performance, though he criticised Grant for being [...] "much too adorably bumbling... he urgently needs to chasten his onscreen persona, and stop hunching his <b>shoulders</b> <b>like</b> a dromedary." [...] However, many other major critics such as LaSalle, Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli and Janet Maslin praised Grant's performance. Maslin wrote, Grant [...] "rises touchingly to the film's most straightforward and meaningful encounters." ...|$|E
500|$|Childe's other hobbies {{included}} {{walking in}} the British hillsides, attending classical music concerts, and playing the card game contract bridge. Fond of poetry, his favourite poet was John Keats, although his favourite poems were William Wordsworth's [...] "Ode to Duty" [...] and Robert Browning's [...] "A Grammarian's Funeral". He was not particularly interested in reading novels but his favourite was D. H. Lawrence's Kangaroo (1923), a book echoing many of Childe's own feelings about Australia. He was a fan of good quality food and drink, and frequented a number of restaurants. Known for his battered, tatty attire, Childe always wore his wide-brimmed black hat, which he had purchased from a hatter in Jermyn Street, central London, {{as well as a}} tie, which was usually red, a colour chosen to symbolise his socialist beliefs. He regularly wore a black Mackintosh raincoat, often carrying it over his arm or draped over his <b>shoulders</b> <b>like</b> a cape. In summer he frequently wore shorts with socks, sock suspenders, and large boots.|$|E

500|$|The finale {{introduces}} parallel-universe {{versions of}} familiar characters, including the Fauxlivia version of Olivia Dunham, both played by actress Anna Torv. One {{topic of conversation}} among fans, journalists, and those working on the show was what to call the alternate Olivia to differentiate the two. Names varied, with many using [...] "Fauxlivia", [...] "Bolivia", and/or [...] "Altlivia". The writers chose Fauxlivia because {{a character in a}} season three episode referred to her as such. Torv and Akiva Goldsman discussed various ways to differentiate the two depictions of Olivia; ultimately two different physical demeanors were created. Torv wanted to make the new character [...] "completely different", but she and Goldsman recognized that the two share some major similarities, as they both are in the same profession and are [...] "fundamentally, genetically really the same person." [...] According to Torv, Fauxlivia holds herself differently and has [...] "a different silhouette. She's got a little firefighter, a little military in her." [...] Torv further explained, [...] "Olivia wants to be the best, but [...] just wants to win;" [...] "There's just a front-footedness I think to , simply because she just doesn't carry {{the weight of the world}} on her <b>shoulders</b> <b>like</b> Olivia does. Olivia's mum died when she was really little, and 's mum is still around. There's lots of little, subtle differences." [...] The producers discussed cutting her hair, but ultimately decided on the auburn hair color to differentiate her. They also made her [...] "a little bit more playful". Pinkner describes shooting the Fauxlivia scenes in the DVD audio commentary: [...] "When [...] first showed up on set in this different guise, she had really embodied this other character in a very playful and sexy way. She turned a lot of heads." [...] Goldsman remarked that Torv's depiction of Fauxlivia was actually much closer to the actress' real personality than her performance as Olivia. The producers were so pleased with her Fauxlivia depiction that they thought [...] "it really opened up a bunch of possibilities... it went from 'let's see if this experiment works' to 'how can we get more of this? ...|$|E
2500|$|At the Great Entrance, {{when the}} sacred vessels are brought in {{procession}} to the Holy Table (altar), the priest will place the Aër over the deacon's left shoulder [...] before he {{hands him the}} Diskos (the priest himself will carry the Chalice). For this reason, the Aër will often have ribbons sewn onto it, {{so it can be}} tied securely in place. If there is no deacon serving, the priest will place the Aër around his own <b>shoulders</b> <b>like</b> a cape, which will leave his hands free to take both the Diskos and the Chalice.|$|E
2500|$|Gardiner used similar {{methods to}} push the Don Valley Parkway project along. Engineers were {{interested}} in studying alternate routes, which Gardiner was able to prevent because [...] "councillors {{could not afford to}} stop, look and listen. Either the project was started forthwith, or the whole east end of the city will be on our <b>shoulders</b> <b>like</b> three tons of bricks." [...] Metro executive committee approved the preliminary plans one month later. When the plans were in draft, he secured section-by-section approval. The Parkway project went from proposal to approved policy in about two years, from January 1955 until February 1957.|$|E

2500|$|The Proctors {{wear the}} {{academic}} dress of a Master of Arts, {{but with a}} distinctive ruff which is like a cape or very short mantle over the gown. This is known as 'Congregation dress' and is worn with the MA hood over it.

The method of arranging this dress has been handed down, as has a pattern [...] "ruff", from Proctor to Proctor; but nowadays the repositories of such traditions are more often the Proctors' men, who, in these matters, perform the offices which judges expect of their clerks.|$|E

2500|$|The Duchess often squabbled {{with her}} {{mother-in-law}} on how {{she should be}} addressed at court. As the Tsar’s only daughter, Maria Alexandrovna had precedence over all the Grand Duchesses in Russia. She therefore deeply resented having to give precedence in England to the Princess of Wales. From her birth, Maria Alexandrovna was an Imperial Highness {{as the daughter of}} an Emperor. However, once she married her husband she was only entitled to the style of Royal Highness. Tsar Alexander II alleged that his daughter should continue to be styled as an Imperial Highness, not royal, [...] "as in all civilized countries". Queen Victoria replied that she did not care whether imperial was used or not, as long as royal came first. [...] There was also the added problem that Maria was both Duchess of Edinburgh and Grand Duchess of Russia, and which title should be written first. In retaliation for the quarrel over precedence, the Duchess of Edinburgh took great pleasure in showing off her magnificent jewellery. The English princesses were clearly jealous of her diamonds, as was Queen Victoria. Meriel Buchanan, daughter of the last British ambassador to Imperial Russia, described Maria’s first Drawing Room: [...] "The Queen compared the Duchess’s tiara with those of her own daughters, shrugging her <b>shoulders</b> <b>like</b> a bird whose plumage has been ruffled, her mouth drawn down at the corners, in an expression which those who knew her had learned to dread." ...|$|E
