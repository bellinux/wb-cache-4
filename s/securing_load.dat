40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present {{measures}} related to the <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> on European level. The road transport plays significant role in Europe. With the increasing volume of goods carried by road the number of vehicles are increasing and also the number of accidents involving trucks. The appro-priate <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> increases the safety of road freight transport. European Best Practice Guidelines on Cargo Securing for Road Transport issued by European Commission are the first document on European level offering the <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> information. There is also a lack of <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> training for truck drivers in most of the EU member states. In most member states the <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> is not the part of the training to obtain truck driving licence. The di-rective 2003 / 59 /EC on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers shall improve the situation. The education of truck drivers from <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> began since September 2009. The standard EN 12195 - 1 offers calculation base to design <b>load</b> <b>securing</b> arrangements. There were cases when it has created unreasonable demands for <b>load</b> <b>securing.</b> The standard has been revised and finally published in May 2011. However, still the differences between the designs according to the EN 12195 - 1, methods using in Nordic countries, Germany and according to the IMO/ILO/UN ECE Gu-idelines on packing of cargo transport units exists. European Best Practice Guidelines on Cargo Secu-ring for Road Transport are need to be revised to reflect the development in the area of <b>load</b> <b>securing...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The trucker's hitch is a {{compound}} knot commonly used for <b>securing</b> <b>loads</b> on trucks or trailers. This general arrangement, using loops and {{turns in the}} rope itself to form a crude block and tackle, has long been used to tension lines and is known by multiple names. [...] Knot author Geoffrey Budworth claims the knot {{can be traced back}} to the days when s and hawkers used horse-drawn conveyances to move their wares from place to place.|$|R

30|$|The {{operation}} mode based on distribution automation {{is focused on}} local feeder automation and do not make full use {{of the connection between}} substations. So the <b>secure</b> <b>loading</b> level for substation transformers is conservative. The new {{operation mode}} based on the proposed management system makes full use of connection between substations. The new idea is to combine the network transfer capability and substation supply capability, which results in a higher loading rate and better assets utilization within the N −  1 criteria.|$|R

30|$|This {{paper is}} further {{organized}} in 6 sections. Section  2 defines modelling of solar PV module as DER. Section  3 presents multi-agent system, JADE (Java Agent Development framework) platform for MAS, JADE architecture, features of JADE and purposed multi-agent system. Section  4 explains the simulation model developed in matlab Simulink. Section  5 describes {{the case study}} and the result and discussion after the successful implementation of proposed multi-agent system for <b>securing</b> critical <b>loads.</b> Section  6 concludes that with the help a centralized multi-agent system {{it is possible to}} <b>secure</b> critical <b>loads</b> during power system outages.|$|R
5000|$|A high-tensile chain, also {{referred}} to as a transport chain, is a link chain with a high tensile strength used for drawing or <b>securing</b> <b>loads.</b> This type of chain usually consist of broad (thick/heavy) metal, oblong torus-shaped links for high strength. All the links of the chain are usually identical, and on the ends are usually two hooks of the appropriate size and strength to slide easily over one chain link but small enough not let the links slip by. When the ability to grasp the load is required, a slip hook is used.|$|R
5000|$|In shipping, cargo {{lift nets}} {{are used to}} load and unload cargo. The net is spread out by stevedores, who load the goods onto it. They then attach the cinches to a crane hook. Lifting the hook draws {{the corners of the}} net around the cargo. This results in a {{balanced}} and <b>secure</b> <b>load</b> which can be safely hoisted. Goods are transferred {{from one place to another}} in the construction industry using cargo nets. When used to transfer cargo by helicopter, they are referred to as [...] "underslung" [...] cargo nets.|$|R

25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} for the Københavns disappearance have been advanced. The most commonly accepted {{is that the}} ship struck an iceberg in the dark or fog. If so, the ship may have sunk too quickly for the crew to react. The lack of wreckage found later {{may have been the}} result of the ship's particularly <b>secure</b> <b>loading</b> and rigging, a necessity against the strong winds known as the Roaring Forties. An alternate theory is that the ship, which was in ballast with no cargo, may have been capsized by heavy winds, disabling the lifeboats for survivors.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{recovery}} vehicles {{come with}} a bewildering number of accessories. These include power units to supply air for power tools or pumping off vehicle braking systems, etc. Generators supply 110 or 220 volt mains power for floodlighting, tools, etc. There are different shaped forks for attaching to lift points, or for modifying standard lifting devices {{to allow them to}} transport motorbikes. Most vehicles will be equipped with an assortment of lifting strops or chains and webbing to <b>secure</b> <b>loads.</b> A special form of webbing called a snatch strap is sometimes carried to assist with vehicles that are bogged down in mud, etc.|$|R
50|$|The vest is {{adjusted}} {{through four}} ladderlock fasteners and webbing, the shoulders are adjustable with Velcro material. The concept is {{to gain a}} <b>secure</b> <b>load</b> carrying system that fits over body armour comfortably. There are various types of this vest depending upon the year of manufacture. The originals are as described above but newer models have loops {{on the left side}} for the bayonet frog, clips for a large hydration pouch, name patches on the left side, and a small utility pouch. Most recently, the Spanish tab fasteners are being incorporated again, instead of the ITW Nexus clips.|$|R

50|$|The {{accident}} {{was caused by}} an improperly <b>secured</b> <b>load</b> of large pipes that broke loose from a gondola car on an eastbound freight train. The loose pipe, dragged by the moving train, damaged the eastbound passenger track. A passing westbound freight train notified the first train and it stopped to assess what had happened. A fast westbound passenger train then approached the scene. It was unable to stop and derailed from the damaged track, colliding with the westbound freight on the adjacent track. Then an eastbound fast passenger train approached and struck the derailed equipment from the first two trains. There were 21 deaths and 49 people were injured.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the basic}} targets of {{economic}} and social policy is reaching the full employment, it means reaching balance between manpower supply and demand, productive manpower use and citizen´s right of work <b>securing.</b> <b>Loading</b> business of labour policy, in relation to unemployed, is to finance and create projects aid to risky categories, to groups and the most disaster areas. Labour policy can support the labour market trends only, but can´t modify it by the distinct way. Ministry of labour and social matters and regional authorities of labour (Bureaus of Labor) secure the labour policy. Generally State labour policie´s Resources dispartable on passive and active labour policy. Resources of passive labour policy first of all represent the job applicant allowance...|$|R
50|$|The {{adhesion}} of a coating {{or several}} coated sample of any paint product {{is measured by}} assessing the minimum tensile stress needed to detach or rupture the coating perpendicular to the substrate. Unlike the other methods, this method maximizes the tensile stress, therefore results may not be comparable to the others. The test is done by <b>securing</b> <b>loading</b> fixtures (dollies) perpendicular {{to the surface of}} a coating with an adhesive. Then the testing apparatus is attached to the loading fixture and is then aligned to apply tension perpendicular to the test surface. The force that is applied gradually increases and is monitored until a plug of coating is detached, or a previously specified value is reached.|$|R
50|$|Loads are {{retained}} by being manually tied down with ropes. The bed of a flatbed truck has tie-down hooks around its edge and {{techniques such as}} a trucker's hitch are used to tighten them. Weather protection is optionally provided by manually 'sheeting' the load with a tarpaulin, held down by ropes. These manual loading techniques are slow and require some care and skill. There is also the risk that an improperly <b>secured</b> <b>load</b> may be shed in transit, often leading to accidents or road blockages. There is also little theft protection for such a load. The slowness of loading loads like {{this led to the}} development of more efficient truck designs with enclosed bodies.|$|R
5000|$|A flatcar (US) (also {{flat car}} (US) or flat wagon (UIC)) {{is a piece}} of {{railroad}} (US) or railway (non-US) rolling stock that consists of an open, flat deck mounted on a pair of trucks (US) or bogies (UK), one at each end containing four or six wheels. Occasionally, flat cars designed to carry extra heavy or extra large loads are mounted on a pair (or rarely, more) of bogeys under each end [...] The deck of the car can be wood or steel, and the sides of the deck can include pockets for stakes or tie-down points to <b>secure</b> <b>loads.</b> Flatcars designed for carrying machinery have sliding chain assemblies recessed in the deck.|$|R
5000|$|The {{seagoing}} RORO car ferry, {{with large}} external doors {{close to the}} waterline and open vehicle decks with few internal bulkheads, {{has a reputation for}} being a high-risk design, {{to the point where the}} acronym is sometimes derisively expanded to [...] "roll on/roll over". An improperly <b>secured</b> <b>loading</b> door can cause a ship to take on water and sink, as happened in 1987 with [...] Water sloshing on the vehicle deck can set up a free surface effect, making the ship unstable and causing it to capsize. Free surface water on the vehicle deck was determined by the Court of Inquiry to be the immediate cause of the 1968 capsize of the [...] in New Zealand.|$|R
