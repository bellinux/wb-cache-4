50|$|Veratridine is a steroid-derived {{alkaloid}} {{from plants}} in the Liliaceae family that functions as a neurotoxin by abolishing inactivation of sodium ion channels. It is primarily obtained from the herb Veratrum and <b>sabadilla</b> seeds. It binds to intramembrane receptor site 2 and increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration. It acts by preferentially binding to activated Na+ channels causing persistent activation that leads to increased nerve excitability.|$|E

50|$|In 1819 Pelletier and Caventou {{isolated}} {{a peculiar}} volatile and crystallizable acid from {{the seeds of}} Schoenocaulon officinalis, a Mexican plant of family Melanthaceae (also called cevadilla or <b>sabadilla).</b> Consequently, the substance was named sabadillic or cevadic acid. It was later found to be identical with Frankland and Duppa's methylcrotonic acid (1865). In 1870 Geuther and Fröhlich prepared an acid from croton oil to which they gave the name tiglic acid (or tiglinic acid) after (Croton) tiglium (Linn.), specific name of the croton oil plant. The compound was shown to be identical with the previously described methyl-crotonic acid.|$|E

Allergic rhinitis, {{otherwise}} {{referred to}} as hay fever, is a common allergic reaction affecting the nose, throat, eyes, and respiratory system, of persons {{of all ages and}} both sexes. This study attempted to demonstrate the effect of the homoeopathically prepared remedy <b>Sabadilla</b> officinarum 30 CH and <b>Sabadilla</b> officinarum 200 CH in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Thirty participants were selected for this one hour, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The participants were randomly placed into one of three groups of ten, consisting of the control group, and the two experimental groups. The control group received the placebo medication. The first experimental group received <b>Sabadilla</b> officinarum 30 CH, and the second experimental group received <b>Sabadilla</b> officinarum 200 CH. The patients were all supplied with: a stat dose of medication to use at the time of an allergic rhinitis attack, a diary card on which to score the severity of their symptoms at the time of such an attack, and a response to treatment questionnaire to fill in after the completion of their treatment. The results were statistically analysed using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test, the Kruskal Wallis Test, and descriptive statistics. The results show that treatment with <b>Sabadilla</b> officinarum 30 CH and 200 CH had a significant effect in improving the symptoms of allergic rhinitis...|$|E
40|$|Benefit to the Industry As fast as possible, {{we hope to}} {{continue}} to suggest solutions to the avocado thrips problem based on sound scientific research. We will determine how to use available insecticides most effectively, will search for new control materials, hopefully with different modes of action to reduce the potential for pesticide resistance development, and will evaluate alternative methods of pesticide application and timings of treatments. Baseline resistance monitoring with persea mite and avocado thrips is important before control materials are widely used (without such baseline data, after the material is used, {{it is more difficult}} to determine whether and to what degree resistance has developed). Should resistance appear (as has been the case with avocado thrips and <b>sabadilla</b> [Veratran D]), it will be important to determine how quickly resistance reverts, whether treatments after reversion are effective, and what resistance management protocols might maintain the useful life of these pesticides. In our opinion, it is unlikely that effective and selective materials like abamectin [Agri-Mek], spinosad [Success], and <b>sabadilla</b> will be easily replaced if these materials are lost due to resistance (i. e. the search for effective control alternatives has yet to yield effective and selective alternatives) ...|$|E

Homeopathy includes the drugs that potentiate and alleviate nasal inflammatory symptoms, as well as modify the rheological properties of nasal discharge. One such homeopathic drug is Coryzalia (Laboratoires Boiron, France), which is used for the treatment of rhinitis of various origins, i.e. viral, infectious and allergic. This drug contains extracts of Alium cepa (onion), Atropa belladonna (belladonna) <b>Sabadilla</b> ocinarum (<b>sabadilla,</b> Ranunculaceae), Kalium bichromicum (potassium bichromate), Gelsemium sempervirens (yellow jasmine), Pulsatilla vulgaris (pasqueflower); of which practical homeopathy recommends Alium cepa for the treatment of seasonal or perennial allergy, Pulsatilla for effective treatment of nasal obstruction and excessive mucous discharge, Gelsemium sempervirens for relief of headache, weakness and fatigue, and nasal discharge, and Kalium bichromicum for improvement of nasal breathing in nasal mucosa damage with viscous mucus. Atropa belladonna is recommended by clinical guidelines for use at the initial stages of inflammatory respiratory diseases with intoxication syndrome, without catarrhal signs.|$|E

40|$|Botanical {{insecticides}} {{are natural}} compounds with insecticidal properties {{and their use}} in crop protection {{is as old as}} agricultural practice. Although they have been in use for over one hundred years, the advent of synthetic insecticides has unfortunately displaced their use today. Due to fast action, low cost, easy application and efficiency against a wide range of harmful species, synthetic insecticides have become an important part of pest management in modern agricultural systems. However, after decades of use, their negative side effects, such as toxicity to humans and animals, environmental contamination, and toxicity to non-target insects have become apparent and interest in less hazardous alternatives of pest control is therefore being renewed. Plant species with known insecticidal actions are being promoted and research is being conducted to find new sources of botanical insecticides. The most important botanical insecticide is pyrethrin, a secondary metabolite of Dalmatian pyrethrum, neem, followed by insecticides based on the essential oils, rotenone, quassia, ryania and <b>sabadilla.</b> Th ey have various chemical properties and modes of action. However, some general characteristics include fast degradation in sunlight, air and moisture, and selectivity to non-target insects. Unfortunately, neither of these insecticides is widely used as a pest control agent but is recognized by organic crop producers in industrialized countries...|$|E

40|$|Veratrine {{manufactured}} {{from the}} seeds of Veratrum <b>Sabadilla,</b> Aiton, or Schoen-ocaulon officinale, Gray, {{is a mixture of}} various alkaloids. Its chief constituents are cevadine, veratridine, and cevine. Cevadine is the tiglic acid ester of cevine, and veratridine is the veratric acid ester of the same base. Previous studies made with the pure alkaloids have dealt essentially with the quantitative relation of the three alkaloids, while qualitative differences either have not been observed or have not been sufficiently emphasized. Cevacline and an amorphous alkaloid which was probably veratridine were first compared by Lissauer (1) in 1877, who found no differences between the two alkaloids. In 1899 Falk (2) adminis-tered cevine and cevadine to frogs and rabbits, and the brief note referring to his studies suggests some qualitative difference between these two substances. The present investigation was undertaken to extend our knowledge of the action of veratridine and cevine and of the quantitative relation between their effects, and to ascertain the existence of qualitative differences between the two substances. Certain observations on veratrine are included for comparison. Unless otherwise indicated, all dosages mentioned throughout this paper in con-nection with cevine, veratrine, and veratridine refer to cevine hydrochloride + 2 H 2 O, veratrine hydrochloride, and veratridine base respectively. The molec-ular weights of cevine and cevine hydrochloride dihydrate are 509 and 581 respectively, and that of veratricline is 673. The veratridine and one of the samples of cevine used in our experiments were isolated by Professor R. P. Linstead and Dr. D. Todd from veratrine hydro-chloride Merck (3).

40|$|The {{control of}} {{parasitic}} diseases {{is one of}} the most important goals in animal health and welfare as far as environment safeguards and quality of products. Unfortunately, parasitic infections are often treated by means of chemical products, resulting in anthelmintic resistance, ecotoxicological effects and deleterious consequences on animal health. These facts underline the needs for thorough parasite monitoring and the application of integrated parasite control practices. Among these, homeopathy could play a strategic role in combating health problems; however, at present there is a lack of scientific results that might indicate validated techniques to be used on a large-scale. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of homeopathy in the control of parasite burden in farm animals. The study was carried out on Zerasca breed, an Italian local sheep breed, whose farming system permits the stability and sustainability of land resources in a mountainous area in northern Tuscany. The study lasted 12 months. A homeopathic examination was performed at the beginning of the study and all useful information was collected in order to assess the farm’s situation and identify the proper remedy to administer. The study involved 30 ewes randomly divided in two groups (control =C and homeopathic = H). <b>Sabadilla</b> MK was administered twice, one after the first sampling and the other before the last one. Individual fecal and blood samples were regularly collected. Gastrointestinal strongyles fecal egg count (FEC) was performed using a modified McMaster technique. Blood count was estimated by cell counter (HeCo SEAC). Statistical analysis was performed by ANOVA. Data referring to parasites were logarithmically transformed [y = log(FEC + 25) ] to normalize error. Correlations between FEC and hematocrit (HCT) were estimated by Pearson’s correlations. FEC resulted influenced by the date of sampling confirming a fluctuation linked with the season especially in spring. Homeopathy did not influence parasite burden in the whole, but a significant decrease (P 0. 05) in egg output was observed corresponding with the first administration of the remedy. In March 2007, matching with the ‘spring rise’. we could notice a lower level of FEC in H group. Data referring blood parameters did not display differences between the two groups. FEC and HCT showed an inverse correlation (r = 0. 235) even if mean values of HCT were included in the normal range (28. 13. 5 %).

40|$|M. Tech. (Homoeopathy) Allergic Rhinitis (AR) is the {{inflammation}} of the nasal and often conjunctival mucous membrane. It manifests due to the exposure of inhaled allergic agents and results in an immunoglobulin E (lgE) mediated reaction (DiPiro et al., 2002; Shargel et al., 2001). Allergic rhinitis is characterised by four principle symptoms, watery rhinorrhoea, nasal obstruction, nasal itching and sneezing (Min, 2010). In addition to the cardinal symptoms experienced during AR other common symptoms include postnasal drip, pruritic eyes; ears; nose and palate (Kemp, 2009). Although allergic rhinitis is not life threatening, the adverse impact on {{quality of life is}} significant. Those affected by allergic rhinitis are restricted in their ability to carry out their normal daily activities (Nelson, 2007; Wilson et al., 2002). Sleep, social interaction, emotional well being as well as cognitive and psychomotor function are affected by allergic rhinitis, and can lead to impaired learning ability. Serious disorders such as eczema, asthma, sinusitis, otitis media, nasal polyposis, respiratory infections and orthodontic malocclusions are. frequently linked with allergic rhinitis (DiPiro et al., 2002; Kemp, 2009)., The therapeutic goal for patients suffering with allergic rhinitis is to prevent or minimise symptoms, using treatment with minimal or no side effects and of reasonable expense, so that patients may maintain a normal lifestyle (DiPiro et aI., 2002). One of the most frequent indications for which homoeopathic treatment is sought after is for respiratory allergies (Ramchandani, 2009). Thus it has been proposed that the remedies contained within Otirin Nasal Spray"; namely Allium cepa, Euphrasia officinalis, Luffa operculata and <b>Sabadilla</b> officinarummay be effective as a treatment for allergic rhinitis (Vermeulen, 2000). Otirin Nasal Spray" is a homoeopathic complex preparation indicated for allergic rhinitis. No specific research has been conducted on this product to determine its efficacy in this condition (Medford, 2008). The aim of this research {{study was to determine the}} efficacy of Otirin Nasal Spray" in the treatment of allergic rhinitis with regard to the severity Of symptoms; specifically on the symptoms relating to the nose, eyes, throat, mouth and ears. Diary cards and questionnaires were completed, making use of the severity of symptoms scores to grade the symptoms. This research study was a quantitative" double-blind, placebo-controlled study and included thirty participants suffering from AR. Participants volunteered to participate in the study, were over the age of eighteen and consented to the procedures of the research study. Participants involved in the study were randomly divided into a treatment (experimental) group and a control (placebo) group. The treatment group received the Otirin Nasal Spray'" as opposed to the control group who received the placebo nasal spray (saline nasal spray). The research study was conducted over a period of four weeks at the UJ Health Centre. Participants were instructed to complete an individual "Treatment Diary Card" (Appendix E) during each hayfever attack by scoring the severity of each symptom they suffered from. During the final consultation the "Response to Treatment Questionnaire" (Appendix F) was completed under the researcher's supervision. This questionnaire required participants to score an amelioration, aggravation, no change or not applicable for each symptom, as well as other associated symptoms. Results acquired from the research study were statistically analysed by Statkon at the University of Johannesburg by means of descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric tests. The parametric test included the Independent Samples TTest. Non-parametric tests included the Friedman Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank, and Mann-Whitney U Test. This research study determined that the homoeopathically prepared Otirin Nasal Spray" did have a statistically significant effect in the treatment of allergic rhinitis symptoms. A trend towards a decrease in the severity of the participant's symptoms was observed, in particular for rhinorrhoea, sneezing, nasal blockage/congestion, pruritic/itchy eyes and postnasal drip...|$|E
