The texture of the raw blanks is caused by lamellar ferrite particles [1] and {{the orientation of the}} [1   1   1] crystallographic axes along the compression axis.

Regarding the effect of dopants in MnZn ferrites, the investigation of the mechanism through which the addition of TiO 2 determines the magnetic properties and polycrystalline microstructure of MnZn ferrites and the detection of the process parameters that favour the controlled development of the polycrystalline microstructure led to the design of a new MnZn ferrite magnetic material which is ideal for high data transmission speed telecommunication applications, as it combines the absence of any chemical, structural and morphological imperfections with the demand for BH-loop linearity and significantly low signal distortion.

40|$|A {{laser-based}} magnet {{measurement system}} has been developed to measure the magnetostrictive strain of large cylindrical samples. The measurement system incorporates a solenoid capable of generating a maximum magnetic field intensity of 3000 Oe and a laser displacement sensor. For calibration and evaluation purposes, the positive magnetostrictions of {{two different types of}} giant magnetostrictive Tb–Dy–Fe-based materials were accessed with this system. A magnetostrictive strain of 622 ppm was obtained at 3000 Oe for TbxDy 1 -xFe 2 -y, compared with 725 ppm for Tb 0. 27 Dy 0. 73 Fe 2. A rod of <b>sintered</b> cobalt <b>ferrite</b> was also measured. This exhibited negative magnetostriction, with a maximum contraction of 260 ppm at 3000 Oe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. : In {{order to}} obtain desired {{electromagnetic}} properties, high initial permeability and good frequency depcndance of initial permeability, seeding effects are experimented in Mn-Zn ferrite system. As adding seed grain, calcined at sintering temperature, abnormal grains are disappeared clearly, but the density of <b>sintered</b> Mn-Zn <b>ferrite</b> body and initial permeability of this ferrite body are decreased. On the contrary, in case of adding seed grain which were calcined below the calcination temperature of matrix particle, abnormal grains were remain but the initial permeability is increased with proper seed content. Compared these results with those of experiments on additive variations, mean particle size controls, sintering conditions, seeding affects on the microstructure of Mn-Zn fenite similarly. 1...|$|R
