Pulse interval modulation (PIM) techniques are reputed for their inherent <b>synchronisation</b> <b>pulse,</b> subcarrier modulation offers increased throughput, resilience to the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and immunity against the fluorescent-light noise near DC, while pulse position modulation (PPM) provides the unparalleled power efficiency in line of sight (LOS) links but the performance degrades severely in dispersed communication channel.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} re-development of a subsystem of the tracking radar (TR) at Denel Overberg Test Range (OTR), {{defined as the}} Synchronisation and Video Conversion Unit (SVCU). The SVCU performs the task of baseband video processing, generation of all synchronisation triggers, and timing within the TR. The report {{is based on the}} Research and Design (R&D) project conducted at Denel OTR and built on the previous study where an SVCU model was designed and tested in SystemVue. A comprehensive measurement and analysis of all functions was first conducted on all (identical) TRs of Denel OTR to verify against the limited literature that is available relating to the SVCU. Various anomalies were discovered between the design specification documents and measured values. Modifications made to functions in the SVCU as a result of development done on other subunits of the TR and not documented were also discovered. A comprehensively revised design specification and high-level description for the SVCU was then generated. A new SVCU architecture was specified to improve the current tasks performed by various discrete analogue and digital components, Single-Board Microcontroller and data bus interfaces using commercial off the shelf (COTS) hardware. A prototype was built on the National Instruments (NI) PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation Express (PXIe) platform, utilising high-speed ADCs and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) modules. All functions of the SVCU were modelled and implemented on these modules using LabVIEW and LabVIEW FPGA software. Fractional Decimators were designed to meet the sample resolution requirement of the range gates (used for range and Doppler measurement). Custom functions were written to integrate samples to increase SNR and apply a correction for errors carried over during the I/Q demodulation. The jitter on the <b>synchronisation</b> <b>pulse</b> responsible for RF energy transmission (TX), the ADC sample clock, and triggers signals that need to travel over excessively long transmission lines used for calibration were found to be the most critical aspects of the SVCU. The rootsum- square of all the jitter on these synchronisation pulses was calculated to ensure that the specified measurement accuracy of the TR is satisfied. Based on these findings, the PXIe based SVCU is recommended for deployment. Further development of other subunits for the TR receiver on the current platform is recommended, and an outline for future work is provided...|$|E

30|$|Schemes {{that involve}} the {{transfer}} of vertical or horizontal or <b>synchronisation</b> <b>pulses</b> between the cameras in a multivision system, [44, 45], have similar shortcomings to the Genlock concept, from which they are derived. Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) and Delay-Locked Loops (DLLs) {{can be used to}} compensate for delays but this adds significant complexity and ultimately limits the pixel clock rate. Store and forward techniques proposed by the same authors [46] allow synchronous transmission of video data, but do nothing to guarantee synchronous frame capture. They also add complexity and the cost of a large high-speed buffer, and unavoidably introduce a small but distinct latency in the delivery of the video data which may be a significant disadvantage for certain high speed applications.|$|R

50|$|The {{network is}} used {{when it is}} {{required}} that two or more signals are matched {{to each other on}} some form of timing criterion. Delay is added to all other signals so that the total delay is matched to the signal which already has the longest delay. In television broadcasting, for instance, it is desirable that the timing of the television waveform <b>synchronisation</b> <b>pulses</b> from different sources are aligned as they reach studio control rooms or network switching centres. This ensures that cuts between sources do not result in disruption at the receivers. Another application occurs when stereophonic sound is connected by landline, for instance from an outside broadcast to the studio centre. It is important that delay is equalised between the two stereo channels as a difference will destroy the stereo image. When the landlines are long and the two channels arrive by substantially different routes it can require many filter sections to fully equalise the delay.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of stimulus evoked neuromuscular potentials or m-waves {{is a useful}} technique for improved feedback control in functional electrical stimulation systems. Usually, however, these signals are contaminated by stimulus artifact. A novel software technique, which uses a two-stage peak detection algorithm, has been developed to remove the unwanted artifact from the recorded signal. The advantage of the technique {{is that it can}} be used on all stimulation artifact-contaminated electroneurophys-iologic data provided that the artifact and the biopotential are non-overlapping. The technique does not require any estimation of the stimulus artifact shape or duration. With the developed technique, {{it is not necessary to}} record a pure artifact signal for template estimation, a process that can increase the complexity of experimentation. The technique also does not require the recording of any external hardware <b>synchronisation</b> <b>pulses.</b> The method avoids the use of analogue or digital filtering techniques, which endeavour to remove certain high frequency components of the artifact signal, but invariably have difficulty, resulting in the removal of frequencies in the same spectrum as the m-wave. With the new technique the signal is sampled at a high frequency to ensure optimum fidelity. Instrumentation saturation effects due to the artifact can be avoided with careful electrode placement. The technique was fully tested with a wide variety of electrical stimulation parameters (frequency and pulse width) applied to the common peroneal nerve to elicit contraction in the tibialis anterior. The program was also developed to allow batch processing of multiple files, using closed loop feedback correction. The two-stage peak detection artifact removal algorithm is demonstrate...|$|R

The control system of the LHC beam dump kickers {{will be based on}} a modular architecture composed of different subsystems, each with a specific function like slow control, beam energy tracking, beam abort gap <b>synchronisation,</b> fast <b>pulse</b> signal monitoring and post-mortem data acquisition. Depending on the required functionality, the subsystems will be based either on passive fault-tolerant redundant hardware solutions or on active fail-safe hardware and software solutions. In addition, for the most critical subsystems like the beam energy tracking and the beam abort gap synchronisation, two redundant solutions based on different technologies will be implemented in order to prevent common mode failures.

40|$|We give {{fault-tolerant}} algorithms {{for establishing}} synchrony in distributed systems {{in which each}} of the n nodes has its own clock. Our algorithms operate in a very strong fault model: we require self-stabilisation, i. e., the initial state of the system may be arbitrary, and there can be up to f<n/ 3 ongoing Byzantine faults, i. e., nodes that deviate from the protocol in an arbitrary manner. Furthermore, {{we assume that the}} local clocks of the nodes may progress at different speeds (clock drift) and communication has bounded delay. In this model, we study the <b>pulse</b> <b>synchronisation</b> problem, where the task is to guarantee that eventually all correct nodes generate well-separated local pulse events (i. e., unlabelled logical clock ticks) in a synchronised manner. Compared to prior work, we achieve exponential improvements in stabilisation time and the number of communicated bits, and give the first sublinear-time algorithm for the problem: - In the deterministic setting, the state-of-the-art solutions stabilise in time Theta(f) and have each node broadcast Theta(f log f) bits per time unit. We exponentially reduce the number of bits broadcasted per time unit to Theta(log f) while retaining the same stabilisation time. - In the randomised setting, the state-of-the-art solutions stabilise in time Theta(f) and have each node broadcast O(1) bits per time unit. We exponentially reduce the stabilisation time to polylog f while each node broadcasts polylog f bits per time unit. These results are obtained by means of a recursive approach reducing the above task of self-stabilising <b>pulse</b> <b>synchronisation</b> in the bounded-delay model to non-self-stabilising binary consensus in the synchronous model. In general, our approach introduces at most logarithmic overheads in terms of stabilisation time and broadcasted bits over the underlying consensus routine...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of mode-locked lasers {{suitable}} for telecommunications applications capable of generating picosecond-long pulses at high repetition rates. Although the direct generation of even shorter pulses at such high rates is possible it is generally considered far easier to compress the pulses of mode-locked lasers when sub-picosecond pulses are required. However, this can lead to problems in terms of <b>pulse</b> <b>synchronisation</b> and stability as km scale lengths of dispersion shifted or highly nonlinear silica fibre are typically needed. In this paper, a pulse compressor operating at 10 GHz is realized using just 2 meters of a connectorized Bismuth-Oxide highly-nonlinear fibre (Bi-HNLF).

Analytical {{results for the}} performance degradation caused by timing jitter can be combined with a suitable channel fading probability distribution function to form a combined probability distribution for the received signal power at {{the output of the}} correlator. This paper analyses the statistical distribution of the received power at the output of a correlation receiver for a single pulse with timing jitter. By treating the power degradation due to timing jitter as a mathematical equivalence, it is shown that path diversity combining can be a potential technique to mitigate the timing jitter as well as the multi-path fading...|$|R

Here, we attempt the application of HR-MAS to size-exclusion chromatographic NMR with limited success. Observed diffusion coefficients for polymer molecular weight reference standards are shown to be larger than those obtained on static samples.

We instantiate it both to the Kuramoto model, a model of synchronisation based on smooth interaction, and to the Peskin model of pacemaker cells in the heart, a model of <b>synchronisation</b> based on <b>pulse</b> interaction. We also introduce a logic, Biological Oscillators Synchronisation Logic (BOSL), that is able to describe collective synchronisation properties of a population of coupled oscillators. A model checking algorithm is proposed for the defined logic and it is implemented in a model checker.

40|$|Future mobile {{broadband}} communication systems aim {{to provide a}} wide range of multimedia services (telephony, video conferencing, audio and video broadcasting, etc.) to a large number of users. In order to achieve a global coverage and reach remote users, satellite is foreseen to be a key component in the development of such networks. When compared to first-generation mobile satellite communication systems, these future satellite networks will need to provide significantly higher data rates whilst achieving very low bit error probability values. In order to keep the mobile user terminal as well as on-board processing complexity as low as possible, it is important to reach the required quality of service with very low values of the signal-to-noise ratio. Hence, particular attention must be paid to the design of the air interface of these future satellite systems. The use of CDMA presents a number of advantages for mobile communication systems, and hence CDMA technology has recently received a lot of attention for both second generation and future terrestrial multimedia systems. However, less effort has been put into the design of CDMA solutions for satellite communications. Moreover, good air interface designs for terrestrial systems do not necessarily translate into efficient solutions for the satellite environment. Hence, different techniques aimed at improving the performance of CDMA satellite systems are proposed in this thesis. First, the performance of S-CDMA, which reduces the level of MAI by co-ordinating the transmission of the different users, is analysed in satellite fading channels. Comparisons with the more conventional A-CDMA are provided and the impact on the transmission quality of imperfect power control, <b>synchronisation</b> errors and <b>pulse</b> shaping is assessed. In order to meet the very tight requirements set for multimedia services, FEC coding is required. Hence, the performance of S-CDMA in fading channels is presented for different channel coding techniques. The performance of the different schemes is characterised with both power and spectral efficiency and comparisons are made. In order to reduce the performance degradation due to the MAI, it is also possible to use multiuser detection algorithms at the receiver. In this thesis, the performance of MUD algorithms using an ANN architecture is analysed in satellite fading channels. Different training strategies and algorithms are considered and the performance of the ANN receivers is compared to that of the conventional correlator as well as other MUD algorithms. Finally, a number of different multi-rate spreading techniques are proposed and their respective complexity is discussed and compared. The power fluctuations caused by these different multi-rate spreading techniques are analysed in order to evaluate their performance in the satellite non-linear channel...|$|R
40|$|The ultrashort pulses {{emitted by}} passive {{semiconductor}} mode-locked lasers (PSMLLs) {{can be applied}} {{to a wide range of}} applications, including modern optical communication systems, optical sampling, security, imaging or sensing. For most of these applications, it is of critical importance to gather detailed information on the mode-locked laser (MLL) dynamics as well as on the temporal intensity and phase profiles of the pulses. The pulse formation in a PSMLL is in fact a very complex mechanism that is governed by the close interplay between a number of linear and nonlinear phenomena, influenced by various semiconductor parameters. The complete characterisation of the devices as a function of the laser driving parameters, geometry and semiconductor material structure has therefore the potential to provide a deeper understanding of the PSMLL behaviour. As the available detectors are usually incapable of resolving the temporal structures of ultrashort pulses from the high repetition rate MLLs, a number of indirect measurement solutions have been developed for full pulse characterisation. However, these methods are designed for lasers with high-energy optical pulses or require <b>pulse</b> <b>synchronisation</b> or ultrafast modulation. This obviously restricts their suitability for the unsynchronised, low energy and high repetition rate pulses as those emitted by the mode-locked laser diodes. In this work, an extensive study of various dynamical regimes, such as mode-locking, self-pulsation and continuous-wave operations of the monolithically integrated AlGaInAs/InP MLLs is reported. The devices operate around 1. 55 µm and emit optical pulses with sub- 40 GHz repetition frequencies. The influence of the biasing conditions, laser geometry and semiconductor material on the lasers performance is analysed in detail. The complete characterisation includes the evaluation of both the phase and time profiles of pulses, using a sonogram system developed as part of this thesis. It is based on a self-referenced method, capable of ambiguity-free measurements of low power and sub-picosecond pulses. A sensitivity as low as 5 mW on the pulse peak power has been achieved through the design and fabrication of a two-photon absorption (TPA) detector, optimised for polarisation insensitivity and high nonlinear response. The travelling-wave operation enables the characterisation of high-repetition rate pulses and minimises the amount of introduced dispersion. The sonogram system has been successfully employed to study the evolution of the temporal intensity and group delay profiles as a function of the laser biasing conditions and for different device geometries. The obtained results indicate a prevailing positive chirp present in the pulses, which can be reduced by a careful adjustment of the device biasing. The minimum pulse width emitted from the investigated MLLs and measured with the sonogram technique was ~ 500 fs. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) is {{a lucrative}} {{wireless}} technology for Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) applications requiring a power restricted operation, {{high data rate}} and high level of miniaturisation. An Impulse Radio-UWB (IR-UWB) system transmits data by means of short duration pulses. Because of the pulse-based nature of this data transmission, less-complex modulation schemes, such as Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) and On-Off Keying (OOK), {{can be used in}} IR-UWB based systems resulting in significant power savings. Because of the simplicity of pulse generation, IR-UWB transmitters require a reduced hardware complexity compared to other candidates such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based UWB, enabling a low form factor and improved power efficiency. This dissertation contributes to {{the state of the art}} in the IR-UWB technology for WBAN applications in three major areas, namely: • Power efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol design for IR-UWB based WBAN applications. • Development of a low-power sensor platform and evaluation for on-body communication. • Feasibility analysis of the IR-UWB technology for human implant applications through study of the electromagnetic and thermal effects caused by UWB signals. Although IR-UWB transmitters provide excellent benefits, such as high data rate transmission, low power consumption and simple hardware implementation, IR-UWB receivers remain a bottleneck for the use of IR-UWB technology in WBAN applications because of the following reasons. Firstly, IR-UWB receivers are complex in design and consume excessive amount of power. Secondly, the <b>synchronisation</b> of IR-UWB <b>pulses</b> at the receive stage using low power front-end circuitry is a major difficulty that restricts the use of IR-UWB receivers in WBAN applications. An IR-UWB based communication system has to be designed in a manner such that it enhances the advantages provided by IR-UWB transmitters while avoiding the complexities introduced by IR-UWB receivers. In order to achieve this objective, this dissertation presents a dual band communication system that uses IR-UWB for data transmission from sensor nodes while using narrow band technology for data reception. The MAC protocol plays a vital role in determining the data transmission efficiency of IR-UWB-based WBAN applications. Unlike in wireless narrow band applications, MAC protocols for IR-UWB applications should be designed in a manner so as to incorporate the unique advantages provided by the physical layer properties of IR-UWB signals. This dissertation presents the design and evaluation of a new dual band MAC protocol for WBAN sensor nodes. This MAC protocol improves the advantages provided by IR-UWB signals, such as high data rate transmission and low power operation, while avoiding the complexities introduced by IR-UWB reception at the sensor node end. In addition, data priority is taken into consideration during the design of the MAC protocol and a guaranteed delivery mechanism is utilised to transfer high priority data. The performance of the suggested MAC protocol is analysed extensively using simulations in terms of critical parameters, such as packet error rate, throughput, packet delay and power consumption. These simulation studies have provided optimised design parameters for hardware implementation of sensor nodes that use the proposed MAC protocol for WBAN applications. Although IR-UWB has been identified as a viable wireless technology for WBAN applications, there are no full implementations of low-power and small size IR-UWB sensor platforms for healthcare monitoring applications in both commercial domain and research domain. This dissertation presents the implementation and evaluation of a complete communication platform for WBAN applications that includes sensor nodes, coordinator nodes and interfacing computer software. In order to overcome the limitations created by the use of IR-UWB receivers in IR-UWB based sensor platforms, this dissertation presents an implementation method for WBAN sensor nodes that uses IR-UWB for data transmission from sensor nodes to coordinator nodes (up-link) and a narrow band link to receive control messages from coordinator nodes to sensor nodes (down-link). This unique technique provides the means of achieving low-power consuming sensor nodes with high data rate capability. Wireless communication for implantable devices is another potential area for the use of the IR-UWB technology in WBAN applications. Implantable systems, such as neural recording systems and wireless endoscopy devices, require high data rates, low power consumption and small form factor. These requirements can be fulfilled by the use of IR-UWB technology. This dissertation demonstrates the feasibility of the IR-UWB technology for implant applications through the study of electromagnetic and thermal power absorption of human tissue that is exposed to IR-UWB signals. These studies are conducted through finite element simulations using human body models. In addition, the path loss of UWB signals for various implant applications, such as neural recording units and capsule endoscopy systems, are studied using numerical modelling techniques and provides a predictive model that can be used as a guide in designing IR-UWB systems for implant applications. The findings of this research contribute to the improvement of wireless healthcare monitoring systems by introducing a high data rate, low power and efficient communication mechanism. The dual band sensor nodes that are developed as the final product of this research are capable of operating at scalable data rates up to 5 Mbps with a power consumption as low as 11 nJ/bit. The unique features of the MAC protocol suggested in this dissertation enable the dual band communication system to operate in varying channel conditions with a controllable BER around 10 - 4. Simulation based analysis carried out in order to investigate the feasibility of IR-UWB for implant communication shows that it is possible to set the IR-UWB transmit power in the in-body channel at a higher level than the FCC spectral mask such that tissue power absorption levels fall within the regulatory levels while outdoor power levels meet the FCC spectral requirements. These peak transmit power levels depend on the position of the implant within the human body. The path loss analysis carried out for UWB based Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) devices shows an average path loss of 80 dB for an in-body propagation distance of 80 mm...|$|R
