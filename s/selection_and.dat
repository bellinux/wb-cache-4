40|$|Some new {{strategies}} for query optimization in object-oriented databases are proposed. Complex <b>selections</b> <b>and</b> joins containing path expressions and aggregation functions are classified into different types. It is shown that {{different types of}} <b>selections</b> <b>and</b> joins require different kinds of evaluation strategies. Some <b>selections</b> <b>and</b> joins with aggregation functions can be transformed into equivalent but more efficient forms without aggregation functions. Query graphs are employed not only to represent queries in object-oriented databases and to capture different kinds of complex <b>selections</b> <b>and</b> joins but also to generate efficient query evaluation plans. 1411 1 Introduction Query optimization {{is essential to the}} performance of object-oriented databases. Considerable research has been devoted to the improvement of query processing in objectoriented database systems with encouraging progress[1].

5|$|As {{a result}} of his writing, {{at the time of his}} death Wallace had been for many years a {{well-known}} figure both as a scientist and as a social activist.

He received honorary doctorates and a number of professional honours, such the Royal Society's Royal Medal and Darwin Medal in 1868 and 1890 respectively, and the Order of Merit in 1908. Above all, his role as the co-discoverer of natural <b>selection</b> <b>and</b> his work on zoogeography marked him out as an exceptional figure.|$|E
