25|$|Then, Albert Einstein in 1905, {{in order}} to explain the {{photoelectric}} effect previously reported by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, postulated consistently with Max Planck's quantum hypothesis that light itself is made of individual quantum particles, which in 1926 {{came to be called}} photons by Gilbert N. Lewis. The photoelectric effect was observed upon <b>shining</b> <b>light</b> of particular wavelengths on certain materials, such as metals, which caused electrons to be ejected from those materials only if the light quantum energy was greater than the work function of the metal's surface.|$|E

Pugh finished 2011–12 as Bournemouth's top scorer for the second season running, with 12 goals from 49 appearances, while they finished in 11th place in League One.

500|$|The Maxwell wave theory, however, {{does not}} account for all {{properties}} of light. The Maxwell theory predicts that the energy of a light wave depends only on its intensity, not on its frequency; nevertheless, several independent types of experiments show that the energy imparted by light to atoms depends only on the light's frequency, not on its intensity. For example, some chemical reactions are provoked only by light of frequency higher than a certain threshold; light of frequency lower than the threshold, no matter how intense, does not initiate the reaction. Similarly, electrons can be ejected from a metal plate by <b>shining</b> <b>light</b> of sufficiently high frequency on it (the photoelectric effect); the energy of the ejected electron is related only to the light's frequency, not to its intensity. W/cm2 at which point perturbation theory begins to break down. In contrast, in the intense regime, which for visible light is above approximately 1014 W/cm2, the classical wave description correctly predicts the energy acquired by electrons, called ponderomotive energy. (See also: Boreham et al. (1996). [...] "".) By comparison, sunlight is only about 0.1 W/cm2.|$|E

2500|$|Hughes' {{first season}} {{was a model}} of inconsistency. Easy {{victories}} against West Ham United, Sunderland, Portsmouth, Stoke City and Arsenal were paired with disappointing defeats, mainly away from home. Good form {{at the end of}} the season meant that City challenged for seventh place, though a defeat at Tottenham in the penultimate game of the season ended their challenge. Domestic Cup competitions show further unpredictable form: they were defeated in the League Cup Second round to Brighton & Hove Albion of League One on penalties, while in the FA Cup, City faced Nottingham Forest at home in the third round proper, losing 3–0. The middle of the season was overshadowed by the club's ambitious attempts to purchase Milan attacking midfielder Kaká.

The move, however, ultimately broke down, with Manchester City CEO Garry Cook claiming Milan had [...] "bottled it".

Arguably the <b>shining</b> <b>light</b> of the season was the UEFA Cup, in which City fared well, playing in more matches than any other team in the competition due to their early Fair Play start.
