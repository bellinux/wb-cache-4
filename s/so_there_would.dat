5|$|Other ideas {{put forward}} and {{discounted}} before the consultation stage included a complete {{restoration of the}} pre-1974 Worcestershire county boundary. This option included Stourbridge and Halesowen, as they were {{under the jurisdiction of}} Worcestershire County Council until 1 April 1974. The LGBCE deemed that this Local Government review did not include metropolitan counties (except a one-off review of Sefton on Merseyside), <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no change to the boundaries of Dudley Metropolitan Borough.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 25 July, {{information}} arrived at Arrah that a disturbance {{was to be expected}} in the district. Wake had been told by a railway engineer stationed nearby that the boats used to cross the Son River would be destroyed; when Wake was informed {{on the morning of the}} 26th that the mutineers were crossing the river, he realised that the boats had in fact not been destroyed as promised. Wake, who had no information about the number of mutinying sepoys and other forces approaching Arrah, noted that the local police force had disappeared and he decided not to abandon the town. Eighteen civilians and fifty members of the Bengal Military Police Battalion moved into Boyle's fortified building and bricked themselves up inside. The building had stores of food, drink and ammunition (with gunpowder and lead to make more if required), entrenching tools and weapons the men had brought with them. The supplies were thought to be sufficient for a few days and, since they expected the mutineers to be followed by pursuing forces, the men anticipated a brief siege of no more than 48 hours. Throughout the entire siege Wake kept a diary by writing on the walls of the building <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be a record of events if the besieged party did not survive. On the morning of 27 July the mutineers, joined by Kunwar Singh and his forces, arrived in Arrah. They released the prisoners from the jail and, joined by its guards, looted the treasury of 85,000 rupees. The mutineers and rebels (including the prison guards) then surrounded the house with drums and bugles playing, arranged themselves into formation and charged. When the mutineers were within 100 yards the men inside opened fire on them, killing eighteen instantly and forcing the rest to stop their charge and take shelter behind the surrounding trees and buildings.|$|E
5|$|The State of Illinois {{wanted a}} {{commemorative}} coin {{to be issued}} for the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union. A bill that would accomplish this, H.R. 8764, was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on January 16, 1918 by that state's Loren E. Wheeler. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on March 5. Wheeler told the committee (of which {{he was not a}} member) that the coins were desired for distribution during the celebrations in Illinois. He had been to see Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker. Neither had any objection to the legislation, though McAdoo had explained that the problem with commemorative coins was that they did not sell as well as expected, and many were returned to the Mint for melting. After telling of his meeting with the officials, Wheeler explained to the committee that the coins would be purchased by the State Treasurer of Illinois and <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no returns. James L. Slayden of Texas asked what the cost to the federal government would be, but Wheeler did not know. Slayden asked what had been the cost for the 1916â€“1917 McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar, and Ohio's William A. Ashbrook, the chairman of the committee, said that the cost of the dies had been borne by the group purchasing the coins from the government; Ashbrook proposed amending the bill to make this clear this would be an expense to be paid by Illinois. Wheeler had no objection, and stated that to avoid returns, it might be best if the issue was limited to 100,000 coins rather than the 200,000 in the original bill. Ashbrook then asked if the coins were to be sold at a premium by the centennial committee, and Wheeler denied this, indicating that they were to be circulated like any other half dollar. This concluded the public hearing on the bill, with the committee to take further action in executive session.|$|E

25|$|By 1940, PA 80 was {{extended}} west onto Bigelow Boulevard, Baum Boulevard, and Penn Avenue in Pittsburgh, modern designations of PA 380. By 1960, PA 380 replaced most of PA 80 from Dallas and Penn Avenues in Pittsburgh to Murrysville. On July 15, 1960, PA 380 replaced all of PA 80 from Interstate 479 (now I-579) to Dallas and Penn Avenues. This designation change {{was made to}} reduce the number of concurrent routes in Pittsburgh. The changes took effect a few months later and signs were changed by spring 1961. The reason for doing this was because Interstate 80 was created, so PA 80 was removed <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> not be two Route 80s.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{less than}} {{favorable}} forecast for Kennedy Space Center on Sunday that was not expected to improve by Monday, mission managers decided to call up Edwards Air Force Base {{for the first day}} of landing opportunities. There were two KSC opportunities, with two more opportunities for Edwards later in the day. If the first two opportunities at KSC were called off due to weather, Bryan Lunney, Entry Flight Director stated during the Mission Status Briefing that they would take the Edwards opportunities; the weather was not likely to improve, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no reason to delay landing for a day. The forecast at KSC called for thunderstorms within 30 miles of the landing site, as well as high crosswinds, both conditions that would violate the weather constraints for landing.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the first}} season was offered in volumes, with four episodes per disc. After the success of {{releasing}} seasons 2, 3, and 4 in slimpacks, {{the first season}} was re-released as a seven disc set, requiring new discs to be mastered and printed to include more episodes per disc <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be fewer discs in the set. For the complete series box set, the first season would be redone again, this time to six DVDs, retaining all bonus features. The individual volume discs for the first season are still in print, but are rare for lack of shelf space and because the slimpacks are more popular. In 2012, all season sets were reissued in slipcovered clear standard-sized amaray DVD cases, with season 1 being the 6-disc version {{as opposed to the}} 7-disc version.|$|E

25|$|The 1828 design {{originally}} {{filled the}} lock chamber {{through the use}} of culverts in the lock masonry. The wicket, i.e. large paddle valve, hidden in the masonry recess where the upper gate fit in, would be opened, and water would flow through the lock masonry to three openings in the lock chamber. Both sides of the lock had these, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be a total of 2 wickets, and 6 openings. The upper gate is above the breast wall. Most of the wicket openings in the upper gate recess have been closed with masonry, but one wicket at Violettes Lock is still intact as of 2013 (see photo). Note that modern replacement gates in locks 1-23, have the wickets in the gates, since the original wickets in the lock masonry are inoperable. This system of routing water through the masonry was abandoned due the tendency for debris to clog the opening.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, the {{bankrupt}} Volare Group (Volareweb, Air Europe) {{was put up}} for sale. Alitalia bid to buy the group (other bidders were Air One and Meridiana/Eurofly). Air One went to court claiming that Alitalia could not buy Volare Group as it had received state aid in the past. The TAR (Regional Administrative Tribunal) of Lazio tried to block Alitalia's acquisition of Volare Group but abandoned the attempt, claiming that Alitalia had repaid its â‚¬400 million loan and <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be nothing stopping it from buying Volare Group. Air One also went to court, unsuccessfully. Alitalia created Volare SpA to buy the Volare Group. The airlines were becoming closer and Volare Group had started providing soft maintenance services for some Alitalia aircraft in Milan Malpensa airport. However, the Italian Consiglio di Stato (State Council) on 23 May 2006 has once again blocked the acquisition of the airline. It {{is not clear what}} is going to happen as Volare is in serious financial difficulties. On 2 November 2006 TAR court decided that the administrative procedure used by the Italian government to sell Volare to Alitalia was invalid but the selling contract is still valid because the administrative court was declared incompetent about this topic. If Air One wants to obtain Volare it will have to go to the local civil court and ask it to declare that the selling contract is invalid. Alitalia's offer for 38 million euros was the winning bid. On 15 May 2006 the former Volare Group employees were transferred to Volare SpA (the Alitalia subsidiary).|$|E
500|$|Arriving in the west, Kesselring found Luftflotte 2 {{operating}} {{in support of}} von Bock's Army Group B.

The paratroopers were General der Flieger Kurt Student's airborne forces that depended on a quick link up with the mechanised forces.

[...] Laguerre reorganized the magazine, giving each sport its own separate department, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be a dedicated staff of writers in the baseball department, and a different boxing department, and another for pro football, and so on. [...] Laguerre also encouraged serious investigative journalism, and did not shy away from controversial issues. [...] In 1961, writer Ray Cave broke a story on point shaving in college basketball. [...] In 1968, under Laguerre's direction, and under secrecy from his superiors, the magazine ran a five-part series on the experience of black athletes in America.|$|E
500|$|The saucer in the {{original}} game design {{was supposed to take}} a shot as soon as it appeared. This action was altered <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be a delay before the saucer shoots, leading to [...] "lurking" [...] from players. Lurking is a strategy in which the player uses thrust to keep the ship in motion, leaves 1 or 2 asteroids undamaged, and hunts for saucers, allowing the player to pick off as many 1,000-point UFOs as possible and play indefinitely on a single credit. Since the saucer could only shoot directly at the player's position on the screen, the player could [...] "hide" [...] {{at the opposite end of}} the screen and shoot across the screen boundary, while remaining relatively safe. Complaints from operators losing revenue due to lurking led to the creation of an EPROM restricting such chances. Usage of the names of Saturday Night Live characters [...] "Mr. Bill" [...] and [...] "Sluggo" [...] to refer to the saucers in an Esquire article about the game led to Logg receiving a cease and desist letter from a lawyer with the [...] "Mr. Bill Trademark." ...|$|E
500|$|By May 1892, it was {{apparent}} that additional funds were needed to complete the fair's buildings. The Company had sold stock, and the City of Chicago had issued bonds to pay for the exposition, but the construction budgets had been greatly underestimated. The Company sought a subsidy of $5 million from the federal government to complete the work. When a direct appropriation met congressional opposition, supporters proposed that the $5 million be in the form of special half dollars which could be sold as souvenirs. The United States had never struck a commemorative, and it was anticipated by organizers that the coins could be sold to the public at double their face value. The bullion would come from the melting of underweight and obsolete silver coins already held by the Treasury, <b>so</b> <b>there</b> <b>would</b> be no expense to the government beyond the costs of production. During the debate over the bill in the Senate, Iowa Senator William B. Allison foresaw, [...] "they would not only be souvenirs for this day and generation but would be transmitted... to the 200 millions that were to dwell here in the future. Children would cry for them and the old men would demand them." [...] But Ohio Senator John Sherman warned, [...] "the enormous number of [...] half dollars would destroy their value as souvenirs". With Congress anxious to escape the summer Washington heat, the matter was compromised and the amount cut to $2.5 million, thus five million half dollars. Congress passed authorizing legislation on August 5, 1892.|$|E
