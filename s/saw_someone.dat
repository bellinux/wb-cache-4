25|$|On August 1, Greenlee asks David {{for help}} about her leg numbness. She tells David that she <b>saw</b> <b>someone</b> else besides herself, him and Gale, in the {{hospital}} room. He admits that there is someone {{in the room and}} that he will help her. However, she has to go with him to a clinic that is in Brazil. On August 2, Ryan tells Greenlee that he wants her to go to Brazil. On August 4, it was revealed that Greenlee lied about her leg numbness. The only reason she went with David was so that she could see Leo. David injects her with something before leaving. When Greenlee wakes up, she sees Leo, laying on the hospital bed. On August 5, when Greenlee and Leo share a kiss, it turns out that Greenlee was dreaming; it is revealed that the person who was next to her was Zach. She is soon brought back from The Orpheus Project that David created.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, Poirot is {{contacted by}} Maude Williams, who had approached {{him a few}} days earlier, telling him that she had known Bentley when they worked together briefly for the same estate agents. She told Poirot that she liked Bentley and did not believe he was guilty or even capable of murdering Mrs McGinty. She now offers to help Poirot who takes up her offer by getting her to pose as a maid {{in the house of}} Mrs Wetherby, a resident in the village for whom Mrs McGinty worked as housekeeper, and whose daughter, Deirdre, Poirot suspects may have some connection with the circumstances surrounding Mrs McGinty's murder. During the maid's night off, Mrs Upward's son Robin, a somewhat flamboyant theatre director, and Ariadne Oliver, a famed mystery novelist who has been working on a theatre adaptation with Robin, leave for an evening at the theatre, leaving Mrs Upward alone at the house. When they return, they find Mrs Upward strangled to death. She has evidently had coffee with her murderer, and the lipstick on a coffee cup and perfume in the air points to a woman having committed the crime. Mrs Upward had invited three people to her house that night: Eve Carpenter, Deirdre Henderson and Shelagh Rendell. Any of the three women could be someone from the photographs. Additionally, the postmistress's assistant, Edna, <b>saw</b> <b>someone</b> with blonde hair enter the house, which points to either Carpenter or Rendell, as Henderson is not blonde. Confusing matters even further is the fact that a book is discovered in the Upward house with Evelyn Hope's signature written on the flyleaf, suggesting Mrs Upward was actually Eva Kane. Poirot connects the final piece of the puzzle when he finds the photo Mrs McGinty saw at Maureen Summerhayes' house. It is of Eva Kane and has the inscription “my mother” on the back. Poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer – Robin Upward.|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{director}} David Lynch began casting for his psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. He interviewed Watts {{after looking}} at her headshot, without having seen any of her previous work, and offered her the lead role. Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>someone</b> that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I <b>saw</b> <b>someone</b> who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities {{for a lot of}} different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of it in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled thinking at the time, [...] "just my dumb luck, that I'm in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day." [...] Instead, Lynch filmed an ending in October 2000, turning it into a feature film which was picked up for distribution.|$|E

Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day [...] "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, [...] "I <b>saw</b> <b>someone</b> that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I <b>saw</b> <b>someone</b> who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed all in black, with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar clothes and the same hairstyle.|$|E

Peering in the keyhole, he <b>saw</b> <b>someone</b> [...] "bending over something on the floor". [...] Wheeler later secured a key from the landlord and saw that a large packing crate was missing and that the floor had been scrubbed. On September 22, 1841, Colt visited Adams' print shop inquiring about the status of his books and the whereabouts of Adams. Adams' bookbinder, Charles Wells, told Colt that the last time Adams had been seen was on the way to visit Colt himself. Colt made no reply to the implied allegation, and excused himself.|$|E

500|$|At one point, {{the project}} was nearly {{abandoned}} because Peirce was not satisfied {{with most of the}} people who auditioned. In 1996, after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected, the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project. Swank successfully passed as a boy to the doorman at her audition. During her audition, Swank, who was 22, lied to Peirce about her age. Swank said that like Brandon she was 21 years of age. When Peirce later confronted her about her lie, Swank responded, [...] "But that's what Brandon would do". Swank's anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her; Peirce said she did not want a [...] "known actor" [...] to portray Teena. In addition, Peirce felt that Swank's audition was [...] "the first time I <b>saw</b> <b>someone</b> who not only blurred the gender lines, but who was this beautiful, androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants, who smiled and loved being Brandon." ...|$|E

500|$|Pete Michels, {{director}} of the episode, had read {{a story in the}} newspaper about people with famous names.

While creating the Homer Simpson television character, the production staff was deciding if the character should be [...] "cool" [...] throughout the episode, or if he should be an idiot from the beginning. The staff decided to use both methods and have him become an idiot after being seen as cool in the first episode of the new program. The hat Homer wears while walking through the mall is a parody of one owned by Woody Allen. [...] Ron Hauge, a The Simpsons show producer, suggested the name Max Power to a friend who wanted to change his name. His friend, however, did not take it. The episode would also inspire Tom Martin's cousin to name his son Max Power. One scene from the episode features Ned Flanders commenting that cartoons are easily able to change voice actors; to enhance the joke for his one line of dialogue, Flanders is voiced by recurring cast member Karl Wiedergott instead of his regular voice actor Harry Shearer.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1997, {{attorney}} Vernon Petria filed {{a lawsuit}} against First Baptist Church of Hammond, accusing the church and its pastor of allowing a mentally retarded woman to be sexually assaulted for six years. The civil suit filed in Lake Superior Court in Gary claims the woman was [...] "induced by agents" [...] of the church in 1991 to ride a bus to attend Sunday school at First Baptist and {{when she was in the}} care of the church she was sexually assaulted, molested, battered and raped more than once until 1996.
