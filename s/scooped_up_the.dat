5|$|The 1996 Orange Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1996, exactly {{one year after}} the Hokies' {{previous}} bowl game. Instead of New Orleans, however, the Hokies were playing in stormy Miami, Florida at Pro Player Stadium. Neither team scored until late in the first quarter when Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller put Virginia Tech on the board with a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Hokies' 7–0 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter didn't last long, however. Nebraska scored a field goal early in the second quarter and tacked on a touchdown to take a 10–7 lead halfway through the second quarter. Then Nebraska got its biggest play of the game as Tech's Druckenmiller fumbled the ball. A Nebraska player <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball, returning it 31yards for a touchdown. Tech was able to score a touchdown before halftime, but Nebraska still held a 17–14 lead as the second half began.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} quarter with {{a first down}} at its 29-yard line. After Williams carried the ball for a four-yard gain, Taylor {{completed}} a 14-yard pass to Andre Smith for a first down at the Tech 47-yard line. Two plays gained only one yard, then Taylor completed a 46-yard throw to Coale for a first down at the Florida State 6-yard line. Three plays later, Taylor ran five yards into the end zone, finishing an 11-play, 82-yard drive that spanned two quarters. Tech increased its margin to 41–24, but as Virginia Tech attempted the extra point, Florida State's Nigel Bradham disrupted and blocked the kick. Bradham <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> loose ball and returned it {{the length of the}} field to the opposite end zone for an unusual defensive two-point conversion.|$|E
5|$|The 1993 Independence Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1993 in Shreveport, Louisiana. Indiana jumped {{out to an}} early lead {{courtesy}} of a 75-yard pass from quarterback John Paci. Virginia Tech equalized the score before the first quarter ran out, then took a 14–7 lead with a second-quarter touchdown run by fullback Joe Swarm. Indiana climbed back with two field goals that cut Tech's lead to 14–13. With Indiana in possession of the ball and time running down, it appeared that Indiana would {{have at least one}} more attempt on offense before halftime. Before the Indiana drive could get moving, John Paci fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech and returned 20yards for a touchdown. On Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Indiana returned the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory, setting up a potential field goal by kicker Bill Manolopoulos. During the kick, Virginia Tech defender Jeff Holland broke through the Indiana offensive line and blocked the field goal attempt. Tech's Antonio Banks <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball and ran 80yards for another touchdown—Virginia Tech's second in less than 40seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{exercise}} was played indoors with two riders a side and markers {{on the wall}} from which the ball bounced back into play. The goals were elongated basketball nets hung {{at each end of}} the arena. The sticks were old polo sticks that had the polo mallet removed and replaced with a squash racquet head. This had a shallow string net, which they used to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball. The idea was to <b>scoop</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball, which was a little larger than a tennis ball, ride with it to the end of the arena and drop it into the net to score.|$|R

5|$|The Cardinals {{began their}} second drive {{of the quarter}} at their own 25-yard line. In fits and starts, the Louisville offense {{advanced}} down the field. Kolby Smith ran for a yard, Michael Bush for two, then six yards, and Cantwell completed two passes of seven yards each. The Cardinals were also helped by a defensive pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech, which gave Louisville a first down by penalty. As Louisville began to enter Tech territory in earnest, however, the Cardinals suffered their first turnover of the game. Facing third down and three yards from the Virginia Tech 40-yard line, Cantwell was sacked and fumbled the ball. Tech defender Xavier Adibi <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> loose ball, and Tech gained the initiative. Following the fumble, the Hokies began a drive at their 47-yard line. On the first play, Tech was aided by a pass interference penalty on Louisville. The penalty {{was followed by a}} three-yard Cedric Humes rush and yet another pass interference penalty against Louisville. Humes rushed twice more for five yards, and Vick completed a 16-yard pass to David Clowney before Vick completed a five-yard touchdown pass to Jeff King. The score and subsequent extra point gave Virginia Tech a 28–24 lead—its first of the game—with 6:03 remaining.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} all 16 {{games at}} outside cornerback in 2014, Munnerlyn settled into nickel back role, playing in all 16 regular season games with five starts {{as well as}} the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. He helped the Vikings defensive unit rank fifth in the NFL in defensive points allowed at 18.9 points per game, playing {{a key role in the}} Vikings winning the NFC North title over long-time reigning champs Green Bay Packers for the first time since 2009. In Week 10, he started the game at Oakland and posted a season-best 7 tackles against the Raiders. Four weeks later, he recorded seven solo tackles again in the loss at Arizona Cardinals on December 20. He posted his first sack as a Viking when he corralled Packers' quarterback Aaron Rodgers in Week 11. The following week, he got his first pick of the season when he intercepted Falcons' quarterback Matt Ryan. In the final game of the regular season against the Green Bay Packers for the NFC North title, the Vikings had a 13-3 lead with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter. On a 3rd-and-12 play, Aaron Rodgers dropped back to his own 45-yard line to make a pass, but Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen got a hand on Rodgers' arm, causing him to fumble; Munnerlyn <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball at the 55-yard line and with blocking support from safety Andrew Sendejo and linebacker Anthony Barr, ran it all the way back for a touchdown (his first on a fumble recovery). Munnerlyn recorded 55 tackles, a sack, one fumble recovery for a touchdown, 2 interceptions, and 4 pass deflections in his second season in Minnesota.|$|E
25|$|UCF trailed 17–10 late in {{the fourth}} quarter, but pulled off a come from behind victory with two touchdowns in 9 seconds. With 2:05 left in regulation, running back Storm Johnson fumbled at the goal line, but Chris Martin {{recovered}} it in the endzone for a UCF touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, Memphis returner Marquis Warford fumbled the ball as he was tackled by William Stanback. UCF's Drico Johnson <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball and returned it 12 yards for another touchdown. In the final minute, Memphis drove to the UCF 6 yard line, but quarterback Brandon Hayes was intercepted in the endzone, and the Knights secured a 24–17 victory.|$|E

25|$|The Broncos then staged one of {{the most}} memorable comebacks in Monday Night Football history. On the opening drive of the second half, Manning led the Broncos on an 8-play, 85-yard drive, {{culminating}} with a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. On the Chargers' next possession, Broncos' defensive end Elvis Dumervil forced a fumble off Rivers, and cornerback Tony Carter <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> football and returned it 65 yards for a touchdown. After the Broncos' defense forced a three-and-out, Manning hooked up with Decker on a 7-yard touchdown pass to pull the Broncos within 24–21 early in the fourth quarter. On the Chargers' next possession, Carter picked off Rivers, and four plays later, Manning tossed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Stokley to give the Broncos a 28–24 lead with 9:09 remaining in the fourth quarter. The Chargers were attempting to rally, but Rivers was intercepted by cornerback Chris Harris, Jr. with 6:54 remaining. However, the Broncos were forced to punt seven plays later, giving the Chargers' offense the football with four minutes remaining. The Chargers once again tried to rally, but six plays later, Harris stepped in front of another Rivers' pass, returning an interception 46 yards for a touchdown, sealing the win for the Broncos.|$|E
500|$|The {{series was}} tied at three wins apiece {{and a tie}} {{entering}} the eighth and deciding game, with millions of Canadians watching [...] "the game of the century". With the game tied at five late in the third, the Soviets were met with a concerted Canadian attack in the final seven minutes. [...] With 34 seconds remaining in the game, Esposito took a shot at Vladislav Tretiak from 12 feet out. Paul Henderson <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> rebound and put it past the fallen Soviet goalie to score the goal that won the game, 6–5, and the series. [...] Later, Alexander Yakolev, the former Soviet ambassador to Canada, argued that the Summit Series planted the seeds of glasnost and perestroika in the Soviet Union, as {{it was one of}} the first times that the Soviet people had seen so many foreigners who had not come to do harm, but to share in the game.|$|E

2500|$|Steelers fullback Franco Harris, after {{initially}} blocking on the play, had run downfield in case Bradshaw needed another eligible receiver. He <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sailing ball {{just before}} it hit the ground (3). Harris ran past Raiders linebacker Gerald Irons, while linebacker Phil Villapiano, who had been covering Harris, was blocked by Steelers tight end John McMakin (4). Harris used a stiff arm to ward off Raiders defensive back Jimmy Warren (5), and went in for a touchdown. The touchdown gave the Steelers a 12–7 lead with Roy Gerela adding the ensuing extra point.|$|E
2500|$|Game Three was {{the long}} trek from Limerick {{all the way}} up to old rivals the Carrickfergus Knights. The Vikings went there to make a {{statement}} and that they did defeating the Knights 55-13. The Knights points coming from Gary [...] "Potter" [...] McElkerky a player who has ended up with the ball in the Vikings end zone several times in recent years. Despite the scoreline in the first half the game was a lot closer than you would expect of a game so high in scoring, with just seconds left in the first half the knights went for a field goal if successful would leave the sides at 7–3 for the whistle. The Vikings experience in this department showed by not only blocking the points but Seamus Hogan <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> pig skin saw a ray of light and ran the length of the pitch to make the score 15–0 and make even more of an upward struggle for the knights after such a deflating play. The stand out player of this game was by far Craig Switzer, the previous years special teams player of the year put his skills to work with 3 picks all ran back for substantial yards.|$|E
2500|$|In 1892, when Charles F. Lummis {{was visiting}} Acoma {{he listened to}} the old Indian governor, Martín Valle, who told the story of how the Acoma people used to live on Enchanted Mesa. [...] Their access to the top was on the {{southern}} side where a large piece of the butte was said to have spalled off and formed a ramp, a [...] "stone ladder", up to the top. In reality, access was by climbing a ladder in a narrow fissure. Evidence of holes carved into the sandstone {{on either side of the}} fissure can be seen, located in the horseshoe shaped bowl at the southern end[...] The early inhabitants had a precipitous climb up the fissure, but it assured their safety. Into these holes were placed stout lengths of wood, the 'rungs' of the ladder. Today, this is still the only means of climbing access to the top of the mesa. Their fields, and the springs that were their water source, were in the valley. [...] In the summer, the entire village would descend into the valley to tend the crops. [...] One afternoon a severe thunderstorm washed away the [...] "stone ladder", leaving only sheer rock faces all the way around the butte. Legend has it that three old women and a young boy had been left in the village, but they could not get down, nor could anyone else get back to the village. A giant thunderbird swooped down and <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> four and carried them to the valley floor. The Acoma people abandoned Enchanted Mesa and moved to White Rock Mesa, now called Acoma.|$|E

2500|$|A similar {{incident}} {{occurred in the}} Second Test, though {{it might not have}} been seen as a problem if it had not followed the events of the first. Bradman was on 22 when he appeared to snick another catch to Ikin at short leg, but [...] "this time there may have been some cause for doubt; it was an appeal that could have gone either way". Bradman was given not out and made 234, so in his first two innings he made 421 runs, but if he had he been given out he would have made only 50. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Cyril Washbrook was given out to Ray Lindwall to a ball that Don Tallon scooped off the ground. Washbrook [...] "stood there transfixed. Even some of the Australian leg-side fielders expressed amazement". Tallon was known for his impetuous appealing - [...] "he was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision" [...] - and Bradman asked him if he still wanted to appeal. Tallon said he did and Bradman stood by the decision. It was later suggested that Tallon told Bradman {{that it was not a}} clean catch and Clif Cary thought if Bradman had gone into the matter further he would have recalled Washbrook as had happened in other such cases. The Australian reporter Ray Robinson wrote [...] "I believe nearby fieldsmen were impetuous in appealing as the wicket-keeper <b>scooped</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> ball, and that the hesitant umpire would have been wiser to have asked his square-leg colleague whether it carried to the gloves or was gathered on the half-volley". Hammond tried to locate a press photograph of the ball touching the ground to show the ABC, who demanded proof of the incompetence of the umpires before they were willing to change them, but no photo was found.|$|E
