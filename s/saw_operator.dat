40|$|Introduction. Woodcutters’ working {{conditions}} are difficult {{due to the}} presence of numerous occupational hazards. Petrol –fuelled chain saws commonly used in forestry produce vibration, which may lead to the development of non-specific disorders in the upper extremities of the chain <b>saw</b> <b>operator,</b> referred to as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). The magnitude of coupling forces exerted on a vibrating tool handle may affect the severity of HAVS and hand-wrist cumulative trauma disorders. The aim of the presented study was to measure coupling forces exerted by fellers on various chain saws and to find correlation between force magnitude and type of tool used. Material and methods. Coupling forces applied by workers on different types of chain saws were measured by means of a hydro-electronic force meter. All measurements were carried out during the harvesting of wood in real work conditions. Results. Mean force applied by forestry workers on their tools was 44. 2 N. Coupling forces registered during cutting wood with small universal chain saws were larger than forces exerted on models characterized by higher power profile. Forces applied on comparable tools produced by various manufacturers also differed. Conclusions. The relationship between coupling forces and power of the chain saw should lead to ergonomic improvements of the tool and vibration-reducing devices. These results can also be used as a recommendation for fellers in a range of using proper machines for different types of cut or types of wood. They may also be applicable to develop more effective methods for assessing vibration exposure risks among woodcutters...|$|E
40|$|A high-beam walking {{ironworker}} atop a skyscraper {{develops a}} severe case of vertigo. A power <b>saw</b> <b>operator</b> develops narcolepsy. Must the employers {{of these individuals}} with disabilities tolerate the risk that they pose to their own safety in fear of facing disability discrimination charges by removing the employees from their jobs? The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) clearly provides a defense to a discrimination claim by an individual with a disability when the employer takes action based on the individual’s posing {{a direct threat to}} the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace. This is commonly referred to as the direct threat defense. But what if the employee poses a direct threat to his own health or safety, but does not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace? Will the direct threat defense shield an employer who discriminates against an individual with a disability in those circumstances? Framed another way, does the ADA’s direct threat defense include a direct threat (to self) defense? This article thoroughly addresses the sometimes thorny and complex direct threat defense. The article describes the ADA’s textual direct threat defense, which applies only to threats to others, and illustrates how the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) expanded the direct threat defense to include direct threats to one’s own health or safety in addition to the safety of others in the workplace. The EEOC defines direct threat as “a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. ” The EEOC’s expansion of the direct threat defense prompted confusion among federal courts. Some federal courts deferred to the EEOC’s regulations, which inherently limited protection for employees with disabilities; other federal courts refused to defer to the EEOC’s expanded direct threat defense, concluding that the ADA itself was the proper standard for the direct threat defense and that the ADA’s text did not include threats to self in the direct threat defense. Still other courts adopted a hybrid approach, which inherently transported the direct threat defense from the employer’s case to the employee’s case by requiring them to establish that they are able to perform the essential functions of a job without risk of injury to themselves. After letting the authorized scope of the direct threat defense percolate in the lower courts for a few years, the Supreme Court then addressed the disagreement among circuit courts. The Court held that the ADA permits the EEOC’s enhanced regulation and allows deference to the EEOC’s interpretation of the direct threat defense. The Court reasoned that Congress included the harm-to-others provision in the ADA as simply an example of a legitimate qualification standard that is job-related and consistent with business necessity. But the use of that example did not limit the scope of the ADA’s direct threat defense only to threats to another and not to oneself. The Court rejected the idea that the EEOC’s direct threat defense encourages discriminatory paternalism. Instead, the Court concluded that the EEOC reasonably interpreted the ADA {{in a way that would}} not force employers to ignore “specific and documented risks to the employee himself, even if the employee would take his chances for the sake of getting a job. ” Even though the Supreme Court validated the EEOC’s expanded direct threat defense, this article explains how to properly analyze the scope of the defense in light of the Supreme Court’s narrow and strict interpretation of it. Despite the Court’s validation of the expanded direct threat defense, including threats to self, attorneys must understand that such a defense only applies in limited circumstances and that employment decisions based on unsubstantiated fears and stereotypes will not (and must not) be accommodated by the defense. Moreover, the direct threat defense does not permit an employer to exclude an individual with a disability when that individual’s disability might pose a direct threat to his own health or safety; rather, the employee must pose a significant risk to his health or safety. Additionally, an employer still must conduct an individualized assessment based on the most current medical knowledge or best available objective evidence to determine whether an individual poses a significant risk of substantial harm to himself. Even if an individual’s disability poses a direct threat to his health or safety, an employer is still required to conduct a reasonable accommodation analysis to determine whether the individual with a disability can perform the position’s essential functions. In sum, the Supreme Court’s blessing of the EEOC’s expanded direct threat defense does not open additional avenues of discrimination against individuals with disabilities. Indeed, the use of the direct threat defense in cases involving direct threats to oneself should not be readily attainable and most likely will be sparingly utilized in practice. If an attorney for either an employer or employee with a disability uses the framework outlined in this article to navigate the direct threat defense when faced with the difficult question of whether an individual poses a direct threat to his own health or safety, a workable and humane balance can be achieved between ensuring that individuals with disabilities do not unnecessarily endanger themselves while ensuring that individuals with disabilities are not unlawfully discriminated against based on stereotypes, myths, speculation, or unfocused paternalism...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In a {{study of}} vibration-induced white finger (VWF) 39 chain <b>saw</b> <b>operators,</b> being {{representative}} of 365 lumberjacks according to a completed questionnaire, underwent clinical investigation. In a medical interview 13 of the 39 had VWF and 26 were without finger symptoms. In the subjects with VWF both hands were equally affected, {{the third and fourth}} finger most frequently; the thumbs were always normal. A cold provocation test, measuring the finger systolic blood pressure with a cuff technique during combined body cooling and finger cooling to 30, 15, and 6 °C, was applied to the 39 chain <b>saw</b> <b>operators</b> and to 20 age-matched outdoor workers who had not used vibrating hand tools. The finger most often showing Raynaud's phenomenon was cold provoked, and a non-affected finger was used as a reference. The systolic pressure gradient measured at 30 °C from the upper arm to the cooled finger was increased in the chain sawyers most severely affected by VWF compared with the control group and with the chain sawyers without VWF (p < 0 · 02). Raynaud's phenomenon was verified by digital arterial closure (zero pressure in the finger) at 15 or 6 °C in 12 of 13 chain sawyers having anamnestic and clinical evidence of VWF. Chain sawyers without VWF had an increased digital arterial response to cold at 15 and 6 °C compared with the control group (p < 0 · 05) and had a decreased cold response compared with chain sawyers with VWF (p < 0 · 05). In chain sawyers without VWF 13 subjects with an exposure period of 10 - 23 years had an increased cold response at 6 °C compared with 13 subjects with an exposure period of one to three years (p < 0 · 05). Only one of 38 chain saws did not exceed the exposure limit proposed by the International Standardisation Organisation. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that vibrations induce hyperresponsiveness to cold in the exposed arteries, even in chain sawyers without finger symptoms. The exposure to vibration therefore should be reduced to eliminate this damage. The presented cold provocation test may be used to diagnose Raynaud's phenomenon and to disclose an abnormal digital arterial cold response before subjective symptoms have appeared...|$|R

The study relied on mainstream institutional theory and critical institutionalism to investigate the effectiveness of local management institutions. The aim of the study was mainly to 1) assess whether the design principle framework is applicable to local management institutions for forest and water/fisheries in Lake Bosomtwe Basin; 2) explore how issues of access, representation and accountability affect the poor and vulnerable in the local community; 3) understand the role of chieftaincy in institutional factors of power and how it affects resource management. Following from qualitative research methods for data collection, the study drew on interviews, group discussions and observation to gather information from household heads (farmers and fisher folks), key informants and chain <b>saw</b> <b>operators</b> on the topic.

30|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} logging wounds on diameter growth of standing beech trees in the Caspian forest 12  years after selection logging. Pre-harvest planning and identification of the winching area before logging operation commences can reduce damage to the standing trees in these forests. Also, skid-trail planning before a felling operation can reduce the skidding damage (Naghdi et al. 2008; Majnounian et al. 2009). The skidder and chain <b>saw</b> <b>operators</b> are important factors that can influence productivity and environmental impacts during logging operations. It {{has been reported that}} residual stand damage decreases substantially by careful planning and skilful operators (Cline et al. 1991; Pinard et al. 30). Nikooy et al. (2010) reported that skilled operation of a skidder can decrease the level of damage. So training of forest workers can be useful to reducing logging damage to the residual stand. All workers should be made aware of the purpose of the selection cutting and that both minor and major injuries to the residual stands as well as excessive ground disturbance may result in significant volume losses (Davis and Nyland 1991) and natural regeneration of the forest (Picchio et al. 2012).|$|R
