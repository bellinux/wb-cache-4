André Bikey got the third on the half hour mark. Noel Hunt got the fourth on the fiftieth minute. Doyle scored his third {{of the game and}} two minutes later Reading were 6–0 up.

25|$|The F3000 race at the Birmingham Superprix {{was just}} as sunny as the two {{previous}} ones, there was a carnival atmosphere. But not certainly for Martin Donnelly as he {{got a lot of}} attention for wrong reasons. During the qualifying session after a spin at the Holts Corner, he abandoned his car, and watched with horror as Erico Cheli t-boned his car. His Eddie Jordan Racing team worked very hard to get the Reynard car repaired, and thankfully he started the race with an incomplete livery. His team mate Jean Alesi fought throughout the race with Marco Apicella. It <b>stayed</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> at the end, with Alesi beating Apicella by a slender margin. Donnelly came back to finish third.|$|E

William Austin, who played Alfred, had a trim physique and sported a thin mustache, while the contemporary comic book version of Alfred was overweight and clean-shaven prior to the serial's release.

The details of the pitch are unknown, though the design for [...] "Ultimate Death's Head" [...] (based mainly on DHII) is available online, as is a poster image marked [...] "Death's Head reboot pic" [...] that showed a recoloured Minion marked with the Saint George Cross and holding a tattered English flag.

2500|$|At Imola in Italy, [...] "normal service" [...] was resumed. McLaren {{settled on}} {{the front row of}} the grid and <b>stayed</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> for the race, with Mansell's Ferrari {{retiring}} midway with gearbox issues. Gerhard Berger, despite showing promise by setting the fastest time in the wet Friday qualifying, suffered a brake problem and careened off the track at Tamburello at high speed, forcing the race to be stopped after the third lap. Berger miraculously survived with just a broken rib, shoulder bone and burns to his back and hands. He gave a thumbs up and the race was restarted not too long after. Senna went on to win with Prost second. Patrese's engine failed and Boutsen was disqualified (but he got his 4th position back in an appeal), so the third place was taken by the Benetton Ford of Alessandro Nannini.|$|E

[...] The Great Smoky Mountains Association paid three million dollars for the buildings (the other being a highly efficient restroom facility {{between it and the}} original center), and Friends of the Smokies donated over half a million more for the exhibits inside. [...] Trotter & Associates Architects, LLC was the architect of record for the new visitor center. [...] No government or taxpayer money was allocated for the project, so construction costs had to come entirely from donations to the two groups, which in turn donated the center to the National Park Service. [...] The center and restrooms are open year-round, and after 64 years of [...] "temporary" [...] use, the original building has finally been reverted to its original administrative use, though its rustic and historic [...] "parkitecture" [...] remains untouched on the outside.|$|E

[...] Why do those who supervise the Wikipedia franchise in Romania allow this grave disinformation of the public, by forcefully maintaining a vandalized page? The absence of such an indignation is the most significant contribution to our country's morally unbreathable air." ...|$|E

Although Josh Devore missed the ball with his glove, he managed to catch it with his bare left hand, allowing the Giants to hang on for a 2–1 victory and even the series at a game apiece.|$|E
