5000|$|An air-jet loom is a <b>shuttleless</b> <b>loom</b> {{that uses}} a jet of air to propel the weft yarn through the shed. It {{is one of two}} types of fluid-jet looms, the other being a {{water-jet}} loom, which was developed previously. [...] Fluid-jet looms can operate at a faster speed than predecessor looms such as rapier looms, but they are not as common.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{power looms}} used a shuttle {{to throw the}} weft across, but in 1927 the faster and more {{efficient}} <b>shuttleless</b> <b>loom</b> came into use. Sulzer Brothers, a Swiss company had the exclusive rights to shuttleless looms in 1942, and licensed the American production to Warner & Swasey. Draper licensed the slower rapier loom. Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximise production for specific types of material. The most common of these are Sulzer shuttleless weaving machines, rapier looms, air-jet looms and water-jet looms.|$|E
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of the <b>shuttleless</b> <b>loom,</b> a major {{innovation in the}} textile industry, has been relatively slow {{in spite of the}} undisputed improvement with respect to the conventional shuttle loom used for weaving textiles. The {{diffusion of}} shuttleless looms in industrialized countries is analysed in the framework of an epidemic diffusion model where the diffusion speed parameter is allowed to vary. Of the various factors affecting the speed of diffusion, trade liberalization seems to have the most potent impact in accelerating diffusion. This finding is consistent with the idea that trade liberalization is conducive to speeding up the diffusion of innovations. ...|$|E
5000|$|Textilmash (JSC), {{is a major}} {{exporter}} and is {{the only}} company in Russia that manufacturers <b>shuttleless</b> <b>looms</b> and other textile equipment. The company, which has representation in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America, exports products to 35 countries around the world. They have approximately 5,000 employees.|$|R
50|$|From 1942 {{the faster}} and more {{efficient}} <b>shuttleless</b> Sulzer <b>looms</b> and the rapier looms were introduced. Modern industrial looms can weave at 2,000 weft insertions per minute.|$|R
50|$|Draper's {{strategy}} was to standardise {{on a couple of}} models which it mass-produced. The lighter E-model of 1909 was joined in the 1930 by the heavier X-model. Continuous fibre machines, say for rayon, which was more break-prone, needed a specialist loom. This was provided by the purchase of the Stafford Loom Co. in 1932, and using their patents a third loom the XD, was added to the range. Because of their mass production techniques they were reluctant and slow to retool for new technologies such as <b>shuttleless</b> <b>looms.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{producing}} a three dimensional angle interlock ceramic fiber which is stable to high aeroacoustic noise of about 170 decibels and to high temperatures of about 2500 F is disclosed. The method uses multiple separate strands of a ceramic fiber or ceramic tow suitable for weaving having multiple warp fibers and multiple fill fibers woven with a modified fly-shuttle loom or rapier <b>shuttleless</b> <b>loom</b> which has nip rolls, a modified fabric advancement mechanism and at least eight harnesses {{in connection with a}} Dobby pattern chain utilizing sufficient heddles for each warp fiber and a reed which accommodates at least 168 ends per inch. The method produces a multilayered top fabric, rib fabric and single-layered bottom fabric...|$|E
50|$|A rapier <b>loom</b> is a <b>shuttleless</b> weaving <b>loom</b> {{in which}} the filling yarn is carried through the shed of warp yarns {{to the other side}} of the loom by finger-like {{carriers}} called rapiers.|$|R
40|$|At present, many <b>shuttleless</b> <b>looms</b> in Chinese {{enterprises}} {{still use}} the mechanical let-off and take-up machine, and {{to fulfill the}} requirements of modern textile technology and consider the factor of saving cost, most enterprises begin to alter their old looms. Taking the rapier loom SAURER 400 as the research object, the original let-off and take-up machine of loom SAURER 400 was analyzed in the article, and the electric let-off and take-up system was designed, and the revs of the let-off input end and the take-up input end were respectively computed, which could provide some references for the alteration of future electric let-off and take-up control system. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} {{on how the}} international diffusion of industrial process innovations is affected by a country's level of economic development. It analyses annual data on newly installed machinery in the spinning and weaving industries, where open-end rotors and <b>shuttleless</b> <b>looms,</b> respectively, represent easily identifiable innovations. A variable coefficient model, based on an S-shaped diffusion curve, is estimated from pooled data {{to assess the impact}} of the level of economic development on the diffusion of each innovation. It is found that the level of economic development affected the timing of the start of the diffusion process, but not the speed of diffusion within each country. ...|$|R
50|$|Shuttle looms weave a {{narrower}} 30-inch fabric, {{which is on}} average half the width of modern <b>shuttleless</b> Sulzer <b>looms.</b> Consequently, a longer piece of fabric is required to make {{a pair of jeans}} from selvedge denim (approximately three yards).|$|R
40|$|A {{common problem}} faced in fabric {{manufacturing}} is {{the production of}} inconsistent fabric width on <b>shuttleless</b> <b>looms</b> {{in spite of the}} same fabric specifications. Weft-wise crimp controls the fabric width and it depends on a number of factors, including warp tension, temple type, fabric take-up pressing tension and loom working width. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of these parameters on the fabric width produced. Taguchi’s orthogonal design was used to optimise the weaving parameters for obtaining controlled fabric width. On the basis of signal to noise ratios, it could be concluded that controlled fabric width could be produced using medium temple type and intense take-up pressing tension at relatively lower warp tension and smaller loom working width. The analysis of variance revealed that temple needle size was the most significant factor affecting the fabric width, followed by loom working width and warp tension, whereas take-up pressing tension was least significant of all the factors investigated in the study...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of modern, efficient technology has far-reaching {{consequences for the}} geography of economic activity, inequality and environmental quality. This article examines two popular yet highly controversial claims about the conditions most favorable to the rapid spread of new technology. The first states that latecomer advantage allows developing countries to diffuse new technology faster than developed countries. The second claim, widely articulated by advocates of neo-liberal policy reform, is that new technologies diffuse more rapidly where countries are “open” to international trade and investment. To investigate these claims we use event-history analysis to estimate the determinants of diffusion speed across a large panel of developed and developing countries for three very different technologies. These are: continuous steel casting, <b>shuttleless</b> textile weaving <b>looms</b> and digital telephone mainlines. Our results broadly support both propositions. Countries which adopt new technology later or have a smaller existing capital stock – characteristic features of developing countries – diffuse new technology more rapidly than countries that adopt earlier or have more installed capacity – two characteristics of developed countries. Trade openness is also found to influence the rate of diffusion positively for all three technologies. Yet, consistent with recent empirical studies, we fail to find support for the idea that foreign direct investment (FDI) accelerates the {{diffusion of}} new technology in host economies. The article concludes by discussing the geographical implications of our findings...|$|R
