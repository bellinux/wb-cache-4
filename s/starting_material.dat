The concentrations of cadmium in meat and meat products collected from central Slovakia, in the central Europe region and from different countries of West Europe were assessed using by AA spectrometer with graphite furnace (PerkinElmer AAnalyst 80, MA, USA). Within <b>starting</b> <b>materials</b> we detected the highest values of cadmium in beef from foreign production (0. 1101 ppm), followed by pork from foreign production (0. 0901 ppm) in Lovecka salama and pork thigh (0. 0523 ppm) in selected ham. In Lovecka salami we were found the highest concentration of cadmium in final samples from foreign <b>starting</b> <b>materials,</b> followed by homogenized samples from foreign <b>starting</b> <b>materials,</b> final samples from domestic <b>starting</b> <b>materials</b> and homogenized samples from domestic <b>starting</b> <b>materials</b> (0. 3728, 0. 3549, 0. 2387, 0. 2112 ppm, respectively).

5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual <b>starting</b> <b>material</b> for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox transmetalation and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E

The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in gelatin, possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component.
