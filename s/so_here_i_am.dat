When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of stars in the sky and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... <b>So</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? Would we have come so far? ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E

About midnite a courier brought me a note that each brigade should move with its own ordnance. By a very dim light and just aroused, I read the note incorrectly, that each {{division}} shall move with its own ordnance. When I discovered my mistake I explained the matter to General S. He said that my explanation was perfectly satisfactory and asked me to make it in writing in order that he might forward it to Gen. Lee. I did so and just before Lee rec'd the explanation he ordered S. to arrest me and prefer charges. <b>So</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in arrest." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{official}} single released from Send Away the Tigers was [...] "Your Love Alone Is Not Enough", which features Cardigans vocalist Nina Persson {{and according to}} the band they always had a duet in mind, seeing that the lyrics have a question/reply style to it. [...] According to singer Bradfield the title was the last line of a suicide note left by the friend of someone close to the group.

Gasso noted: Money was tight, and my husband, Jim, had actually gone back to California because {{it was hard to}} find a job here at the time. <b>So</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> raising our two children and trying to coach a Division-I softball program, which was very demanding of my time and energy.|$|R

In sooth, these graces have left me so far behind in foolery that I have not a jest left in my pouch! <b>So</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>be,</b> while my Lord Cardinal is shut up with Madame d'Angouleme in the castle--the real old castle, mind you--doing the work, leaving the kings and queens {{to do their own}} fooling." ...|$|R

My siblings had {{the same kind of}} pressure. There was such a need, like {{they were looking for a}} miracle." [...] At the time of her turmoil in college, King recalled having not known Malcolm X and [...] "didn't understand daddy, <b>so</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to defend something I thought I knew about but really didn't." [...] On April 4, 1975, King joined her family in placing azaleas over her father's crypt, marking the seventh anniversary of his assassination.|$|R

6000|$|<b>So</b> <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> a meek and studious milk-drinking hobo, {{and behold}} what I got for it. One {{afternoon}} I {{arrived at the}} park, a fresh book-purchase under my arm and a tremendous buttermilk thirst under my shirt.

It <b>was</b> right where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> crossing the street, so I stopped to see the cause of the collection of curious men. At first I could see nothing. Then, from the sounds I heard and from a glimpse I caught, I knew that it was a bunch of gamins playing pee-wee. Now pee-wee is not permitted in the streets of New York. I didn't know that, but I learned pretty lively. I had paused possibly thirty seconds, in which time I had learned the cause of the crowd, when I heard a gamin yell [...] "Bull!" [...] The gamins knew their business. They ran. I didn't.|$|R
