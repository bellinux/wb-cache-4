40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to confirm the role of water level and water temperature in inducing the spawning of tropical walking catfish. Mature males and females reared under 23 - 25 °C, were paired and induced to spawn by controlling water level and water temperature.

Decreasing water level with simultaneous increase in water temperature, followed by returning the respective levels to their originals gave high <b>spawning</b> <b>rates</b> (41. 7 — 50 %); whereas the same treatment but without any water temperature decreased when the water level was returned to the initial level, gave a low <b>spawning</b> <b>rate</b> (16. 7 %).

40|$|In maximizing {{reproductive}} success, individuals face {{a trade-off}} between parental {{care for their}} current offspring and investing in androgen-dependent sexual traits to produce further offspring. It has thus been proposed that parental effort would suppress androgen levels. Here, we studied parental effort by manipulating brood size in the peacock blenny, Salaria pavo, a littoral fish species in which males show long periods of paternal care. We focused {{on the effects of}} brood size on female <b>spawning</b> <b>rate</b> (measured as number of eggs received in the nest by focal males) and androgen levels. We found a positive linear relationship between brood size and the number of eggs received subsequently. Accordingly, <b>spawning</b> <b>rate</b> increased for males with experimentally enlarged broods while it decreased for males in which brood size was reduced. However, over a longer time interval, brood sizes of both treatments returned to the nonmanipulated brood size, suggesting an effect of additional factors such as male quality. Brood size did not show the expected negative relationship with levels of testosterone and 11 -ketotestosterone. On the contrary, testosterone levels were positively correlated with brood size. However, in agreement with the prediction, changes in the level of parental care by manipulation of brood size showed an inverse relationship with testosterone levels. As with brood size, given time, testosterone levels tended to return to nonmanipulated levels. Such changes suggest that males adjust their brood size to an individual value through androgen modulation of courtship or other traits influencing female <b>spawning</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R

In Brazil, {{research and development of}} cultivation techniques, selection of strains to increase mushroom yield and production of bioactive molecules is needed as the industry is relatively young (1990 's) and is focused on the mushroom formerly known as Agaricus blazei or A. brasiliensis. Recent studies have clarified the taxonomic status of these fungi and they are considered to be synonyms of A. subrufescens however the name A. brasiliensis is used in many publications on the Brazilian medicinal mushroom. In this paper we evaluate medicinal strains presently cultivated in Brazil, strain ATCC 76739 and wild strains of A. subrufescens from various countries for (i) mycelial growth at different temperatures, (ii) mycelium efficiency to colonize the substrate, and (iii) mushroom yield under various cultivation conditions (<b>spawn</b> <b>rate,</b> light, cold shock). Most of the medicinal cultivars showed higher mycelial growth rates than the wild A. subrufescens. A temperature of 35 °C was not lethal for the cultivars, but seemed so for two A. subrufescens strains. Cultivation experiments were performed using commercial compost used for A. bisporus. The efficiency of compost colonization was estimated by measuring H 2 O 2 after 20 days of incubation. Cultivars produced variable concentrations of H 2 O 2 (39 - 217 nmoles/g of compost) whilst low concentrations were found in the group of wild A. subrufescens (47 - 91 nmoles/g). There was no relationship between compost colonization and others parameters studied (yield, time to fruiting and sporophore mean weight). When taken as a whole, the group of cultivars differed from the group of wild strains for the time taken to first fruiting, yield and sporophore mean weight.

Progesterone (5 mg) with 60 mic. g LHRHa gave high <b>spawning</b> <b>rates,</b> oocyte numbers, and fertilization rates but neurulation rates were low. Progesterone alone in high repeated doses did not result in ovulation. High doses of LHRHa (60 mic. g) with hCG, progesterone, and Pimozide gave the greatest number of toads spawning, however, they resulted in low oocyte numbers, fertilization and neurulation rates. A low dose of LHRHa (4 mic. g) with hCG, or hCG alone as a second administration, and progesterone with Pimozide produced few good quality oocytes. Toads were given normal ovulatory doses of hormones 24 or 48 hrs after their initial dose, but these resulted in low oocyte numbers followed by poor fertilization. Overall, these results suggest that progesterone with a dose between 20 mic. g and 60 mic. g of LHRHa may be optimal for the induction of ovulation in these toads. Moreover, Pimozide can supplement low doses of LHRHa but not replace it. </p...|$|R

Female C. cainii were found to mature at a considerably larger size in the Hutt River, the northernmost population in this state, compared with other riverine and most reservoir populations occupying more southerly (higher latitude), cooler habitats. The orbital carapace length (OCL) at which 50 % of the females matured (L 50) {{was estimated to be}} ~ 70 mm, cf. ~ 32 mm OCL reported from a population near the centre of its range. The modified Von Bertalanffy growth functions, which incorporated seasonal oscillation in growth, were not different between sexes and the curve of pooled sexes had a growth coefficient (K) of 0. 42 and an asymptotic orbital carapace length (Linfin) of 101. 9 mm. The L 50 s for females (~ 70 mm OCL) and males (~ 40 mm OCL) equated to ages of ~ 36 and ~ 16 months, respectively.

PROTOCOL 1 mimicked {{changes in the}} natural environment from winter to spring when ovarian maturation and spawning in Penaeus merguiensis starts. PROTOCOL 2 evaluated whether a clear improvement of temperature from a fluctuation period to a stable one could help trigger ovarian maturation. In phase A (first 30 days) of the experiment, temperature and day length were gradually increased from 22 to 27 àand from 10 to 14 h, respectively, while light intensity was stepwise reduced from 360 to 240, 120 and 5 lx for PROTOCOL 1. For PROTOCOL 2, light intensity and day length were manipulated as for PROTOCOL 1, but temperature was cycled from 22 to 27 àevery 3 days. In phase B (the following 30 days) temperature, light intensity and day length were stably maintained at optimal levels (27 ì 5 lx and 14 h light, respectively). During phase B, the proportion of female prawns reaching stages III and IV was significantly (P< 0. 05) highest in PROTOCOL 1 and lowest in the CONTROL.

The {{effect of}} various doses of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone {{analogue}} (LHRHa) ranging from 1 to 100 Î¼g/kg body {{weight on the}} spawning response of mature female sea bass, Lates calcarifer (Bloch) was tested. A single intramuscular injection of LHRHa resulted in a dose-related increase in the <b>spawning</b> <b>rate</b> (number of spawnings of each fish over four consecutive days) of mature fish. An LHRHa dose of 5 Î¼g/kg and less induced low <b>spawning</b> <b>rates</b> of 16. 7 % to 37. 5 % {{or at least one}} spawning every four days. However, mature sea bass spawned more than once (43. 8 â€“ 58. 3 %) in four days at dose levels of 10 Î¼g/kg and above. Hormone treatment within the dose range tested did not influence the number, fertilization and hatching <b>rates</b> of <b>spawned</b> eggs. The influence of initial oocyte size on the LHRHa-induced spawning response of mature sea bass was also examined. Sea bass with an initial oocyte diameter of 0. 30 â€“ 0. 39 mm did not respond to the single injection of 100 Î¼g LHRHa/kg. In contrast, LHRHa induced spawning among sea bass with an initial egg size of 0. 40 â€“ 0. 49 mm, although two of four sea bass of the same stage of ovarian maturity spawned spontaneously. Fish having an initial oocyte size of 0. 50 â€“ 0. 55 mm spawned with and without LHRHa treatment. Spontaneous spawning among saline-injected sea bass occurred at a later time (24 â€“ 58 h post-injection) compared to fish induced to spawn by a single injection of LHRHa (8 â€“ 36 h post-injection). The initial spawning response time interval for fish with an initial egg size of 0. 50 mm or greater was further reduced to 8 â€“ 9 h by LHRHa. These results indicate that LHRHa can successfully induce spawning in mature female sea bass which have attained a critical oocyte diameter and that the spawning response interval is reduced with a further increase in egg size beyond the critical oocyte diameter limit...|$|R

50|$|The {{increased}} urbanization around streams {{connected to}} the Puget Sound {{has led to the}} annual increase in premature (adult salmon who have not yet <b>spawned)</b> <b>spawner</b> mortality <b>rates.</b> The exposure to metals and petroleum hydrocarbons which originate from motor powered vehicles in the urban area, have led to the recurring fish kills. Salmon that transition from saltwater to freshwater are vulnerable to the toxic substances found in the urban streams.|$|R
50|$|During the {{simulation}} stage, {{the number of}} new particles that must be created is calculated based on <b>spawning</b> <b>rates</b> and the interval between updates, and each of them is spawned in a specific position in 3D space based on the emitter's position and the spawning area specified. Each of the particle's parameters (i.e. velocity, color, etc.) is initialized according to the emitter's parameters. At each update, all existing particles are checked to see if they have exceeded their lifetime, in which case they are removed from {{the simulation}}. Otherwise, the particles' position and other characteristics are advanced based on a physical simulation, which {{can be as simple as}} translating their current position, or as complicated as performing physically accurate trajectory calculations which take into account external forces (gravity, friction, wind, etc.). It is common to perform collision detection between particles and specified 3D objects in the scene to make the particles bounce off of or otherwise interact with obstacles in the environment. Collisions between particles are rarely used, as they are computationally expensive and not visually relevant for most simulations.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic process {{management}} is {{a feature of}} MPI- 2 that allows an MPI process to create new processes and manage communication with these processes. The dynamic creation of processes allows application writers to develop multiscale applications or master/worker based programs. Although several MPI implementations support this feature we {{are not aware of}} any studies on the issues in designing the dynamic {{process management}} interface and benchmarking of dynamic process framework. In this paper we design a MPI- 2 dynamic process management interface over InfiniBand. We consider two alternative designs using Unreliable Datagram (UD) and Reliable Connection (RC) transport modes of InfiniBand with two job startup models. In our evaluations we found that having an UD baseddesign allows for much higher <b>spawns</b> <b>rates</b> with existing job launch frameworks. We also design a set of microbenchmarks to evaluate the performance of our design and other MPI libraries. Finally, we provide an evaluation of the dynamic process framework using a re-designed ray-tracing application. Keywords: MPI- 2, Dynamic Process Management, InfiniBand I...|$|R
