40|$|Price {{changes and}} output growth, {{both at the}} {{aggregate}} and the sectoral level, appear to be negatively correlated. At a basic level, this suggests that sectoral “supply ” shocks are more prevalent than sectoral “demand ” shocks. However, {{it is not clear}} what these sectoral price-output correlations mean once one thinks in terms of general equilibrium. To help us understand the implication of these price-output correlations, this paper examines a multi-sector dynamic general equilibrium model that includes <b>sectoral</b> <b>technology</b> shocks and <b>sectoral</b> demand shocks, as well as aggregate money growth shocks. We show that while a model driven solely by <b>sectoral</b> <b>technology</b> shocks can generate “plausible ” price-output correlations, “demand ” shocks, particularly sectoral demand shocks, are needed for the model to generate the sectoral price-output correlations observed in the data. We also show that technology shocks do not always look like “supply ” shocks. Positive technology shocks to sectors producing goods that are used for investment frequently result in increases in output and prices in other sectors while positive technology shocks to sectors producing goods that are used primarily as intermediate inputs look like supply shocks in other sector...|$|R
40|$|Summary. The present {{paper is}} focused on an {{empirical}} analysis {{about the existence of}} sectoral technological catch-up process in the Spanish regions. We test the role of international trade flows as one of its sources. Technological knowledge diffusion among regions may be encouraged by goods trade, because each imported good incorporates technological advances that can be imitated. <b>Sectoral</b> <b>technology</b> level in one region is measured by the total factor productivity (TFP). This variable includes individual aspects of <b>sectoral</b> <b>technology</b> in each region that held fixed in time, as well as the specific local technology of each sector corresponding to its specific location. Results show that there exists a diminishing sectoral technological gap among regions. Moreover, imported goods in each region contribute to reduce the differences in sectoral technological progress among regions. 21. Introduction. From pioneering studies of Barro and Sala- i-Martín (1991, 1992) about the convergent trend of the economies, many papers focused on testing both σ-convergence and β convergence hypothesis have been published. The existence of σ-convergence implies the second one but not necessarily this relationship can be established inversely. Numerous empirical studies try to find th...|$|R
