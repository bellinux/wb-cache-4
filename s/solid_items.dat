40|$|Detection of {{packages}} or storage containers {{relies heavily on}} the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) tagging, though such technology provides no means to determine the quantity of items within them. This paper presents a comprehensive study of ultra wideband (UWB) detection in the reactive near field as a low cost, low power way of detecting <b>solid</b> <b>items</b> within a package to complement RFID. For proof of concept, egg boxes within a smart fridge are used as a chosen test case. Simulations and measurements are carried out to evaluate the filtering of the UWB impulse response from which it can resolve the quantity of eggs in a box, using an array of sensors either attached to the package or placed underneath. Correlation coefficients are derived as a metric of this filtering in a reactive near field detection scenario. The robustness of the approach is further evaluated by considering other food cluttered around and above the egg box. The results show smart packages which detect an item directly above the sensor are not affected by surrounding clutter...|$|E
40|$|Anoplolepis tenella is a ground-nesting ant of the {{tropical}} forest zone of Central Africa, commonly associated with African root and tuber scale, Stictococcus vayssierei Richard, an emerging cassava pest. Understanding the ant’s foraging activity and diet breadth {{is an important step}} towards developing control measures against S. vayssierei. The present study was carried out in cassava fields in Awae II and Mengomo, southern Cameroon, during the short wet and dry seasons of 2006. Foraging activity of A. tenella was continuous during the circadian cycle and showed four peaks of activity; two during the day and two at night at both localities and in both seasons. Activity was greater at night than during the day, and greater in the wet than in the dry season. During the day, activity was significantly positively correlated with relative humidity, and negatively correlated with air temperature. During the night, it was positively correlated with relative humidity but not with air temperature at both localities. The diet of A. tenella consisted of <b>solid</b> <b>items,</b> mainly live prey (63. 3 %) but also dead prey (36. 7 %) and sugary secretions collected from various hemipterans. Stictococcus vayssierei was the most commonly tended hemipteran (98. 5 %). Continuous foraging activity, omnivory and especially association with hemipterans are factors that favour the numerical dominance of A. tenella in cassava fields.

40|$|In the safeguards, arms control, and nonproliferation regimes {{measurements}} are required which give {{the quantity of}} fissile material in an accounting item, e. g., a standard container of plutonium or uranium oxide. Because {{of the complexity of}} modeling the absorption of gamma rays in high-Z materials, gamma-ray spectrometry is not customarily used for this purpose. Gamma-ray measurements can be used to determine the fissile mass when two conditions are met: (1) The material is in a standard container, and (2) The material is finely divided, or a <b>solid</b> <b>item</b> with a reproducible shape. The methodology consists of: (A) Measurement of the emitted gamma rays, and (B) Measurement of the transmission through the item of the high-energy gamma rays of Co- 60 and Th- 228. We have demonstrated that items containing nuclear materials possess a characteristic ''fingerprint'' of gamma rays which depends not only on the nuclear properties, but also on the mass, density, shape, etc [...] The material's spectrum confirms its integrity, homogeneity, and volume as well. While there is attenuation of radiation from the interior, the residual radiation confirms the homogeneity of the material throughout the volume. Transmission measurements, where the attenuation depends almost entirely on Compton scattering, determine the material mass.

40|$|In {{previous}} decades, {{the experimental}} and numerical studies of multiphase flows have remarkably increased especially gas-solid flows. Research {{of this type}} has abundant applications in energy, chemical processes, among others. Moreover, common applications include fluid catalytic cracking for petroleum refineries, fluidized bed reactors (type of chemical reactors), interface modification, such as applying a coating onto <b>solid</b> <b>items,</b> and an important technology breakthrough in coal gasification. The work presented on this thesis concentrates on the investigation of gas-solid flows utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods. The gas-solid flows studies performed on this investigation assumed the solid phase as a continuum with averaged properties and treated the gas-solid flow as constituting of interpenetrating continua. ^ The fluid flow computation has been achieved using two different solvers. One of them is FLUENT, a general-purpose CFD code based on the finite volume method on a collocated grid. FLUENT technology offers {{a wide array of}} physical models that can be applied to a wide array of industries. The other solver is MFIX (Multiphase Flow with Interphase eXchanges), a solver developed at the Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for multiphase flows; MFIX is a general-purpose hydrodynamic model that describes chemical reactions and heat transfer in dense or dilute fluid-solids flows, which are flows that typically occur in energy conversion and chemical processing reactors. MFIX calculations give detailed information on pressure, temperature, composition, and velocity distributions. ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although the {{pathogenesis}} of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is multifactorial, abnormal function of the lower oesophageal sphincter has been established, {{and in some cases}} motility defects in the oesophageal body has been described. In some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease delayed gastric emptying has also been observed. METHODS: Oesophageal and gastric motor function, as evaluated by use of scintigraphy and manometry, were studied concomitantly in 105 patients with chronic, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease before and after antireflux surgery. In a subgroup of these patients (n = 29) similar data were retrieved also at 2. 7 years after antireflux surgery. RESULTS: Impaired oesophageal motor function expressed as delayed transit of a labelled bolus was closely associated with motor dysfunction also recorded in the stomach as determined by delayed emptying of labelled <b>solid</b> food <b>items.</b> A similar relationship was found when oesophageal motor dysfunction was characterized as the frequency of failed primary peristalses after water swallows during manometry.

40|$|Background: The modern {{food supply}} is often {{dominated}} by a large variety of energy dense, softly textured foods that can be eaten quickly. Previous studies suggest that particular oral processing characteristics such as large bite size and lack of chewing activity contribute to the low satiating efficiency of these foods. To better design meals that promote greater feelings of satiation, we need an accurate picture of the oral processing characteristics {{of a range of}} <b>solid</b> food <b>items</b> {{that could be used to}} replace softer textures during a normal hot meal. Aim: The primary aim of this study was to establish an accurate picture of the oral processing characteristics of a set of solid savoury meal components. The secondary aim was to determine the associations between oral processing characteristics, food composition, sensory properties, and expected satiation. Methods: In a within subjects design, 15 subjects consumed 50 g of 35 different savoury food items over 5 sessions. The 35 foods represented various staples, vegetables and protein rich foods such a meat and fish. Subjects were video-recorded during consumption and measures included observed number of bites, number of chews, number of swallows and derived measures such as chewing rate, eating rate, bite size, and oral exposure time. Subjects rated expected satiation for a standard 200 g portion of each food using a 100 mm and the sensory differences between foods were quantified using descriptive analysis with a trained sensory panel. Statistical analysis focussed on the oral processing characteristics and associations between nutritional, sensory and expected satiation parameters of each food. Results: Average number of chews for 50 g of food varied from 27 for mashed potatoes to 488 for tortilla chips. Oral exposure time was highly correlated with the total number of chews, and varied from 27 s for canned tomatoes to 350 s for tortilla chips. Chewing rate was relatively constant with an overall average chewing rate of approximately 1 chew/s. Differences in oral processing were not correlated with any macronutrients specifically. Expected satiation was positively related to protein and the sensory attributes chewiness and saltiness. Foods that consumed in smaller bites, were chewed more and for longer and expected to impart a higher satiation. Discussion: This study shows a large and reliable variation in oral exposure time, number of required chews before swallowing and expected satiation across a wide variety of foods. We conclude that bite size and oral-sensory exposure time could contribute to higher satiation within a meal for equal calories...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of melted products flow at exothermic interaction of mixes of organic solids (organic self-propagating high-temperature synthesis) was thoroughly investigated for controlling of hollow <b>solid</b> products and <b>items</b> formation directly during this combustion-like process. It was shown appearance of liquid reagents, products and intermediate {{products in the}} reaction front. In the reacting mixes characterized by high shrinkage and condensed gas formation a set of directed flows of the substances was observed. The flows level gradients of the temperature, concentration, density, viscosity and vapor pressure. That leads to formation of hollow structure of the final solid organic products. Electron microscopy, photo- and videotaping both the process and behavior of color labels entered into a green mix, statistic methods were attracted for the investigation. There were registered a temperature profile (maximal temperature 100 - 104 Co) and speed of reaction front (0, 5 mm), features of radial and axial flows of reacting melt, microstructure of a solid product, vapor bubbles sizes and number distribution function in a radial and axial direction {{in a wave of}} synthesis and in the solid product. The radial flow of reacting melt and heat-transfer were supported basically by repeating of a cycle: evaporation of water in hot area (center) of the sample, foaming of the melt, coalescence of bubbles, vapor condensation and collapse of the bubbles in cold area (outside wall) of the sample. Described process of natural radial shrinkage is influenced by many factors, such as the gradients of temperature, concentration, density, viscosity, pressure, adhesion and gravitation forces. Actually, the flow is caused by mechanical work of water vapor based on a difference between of temperatures at the center and lateral wall of the sample...|$|R
40|$|The work {{is devoted}} to the mythological group of {{evidence}} about the Phrygian king Midas. The literary shaping of the story about his punishment by the gold food which doomed him to starvation was done by Ovid. The poet of the time of Augustus gave a final touch to the Alexandrine scholastic tradition. The “golden touch” of Midas was almost absent from the earlier pieces of written evidence. The objects which the Phrygian king touches had a cosmogonic, as well as demiurgic meaning. He first reached for a green bush, a stone, a handful of soil, a wheat-ear and an apple, and then he touched the high gates of his palace, and failed to wash his hands with water. Finally he sat at the table full of meals and baked “fruits of Cerera” – they all turned into <b>solid</b> gold. The <b>items</b> mentioned by the poet characterize the Phrygian king’s cosmogonic and socio-regulative functions. The opposition nature/culture requires demiurgic behaviour as well. The alimentary code is preferred in the mythological narrative to emphasize the ruption of all the functions of the ruler in an archaic non-literary society. A comparison between Tantalos’ nether-world torments and Midas’ “gold table” is suggested. The analysis supports the assumption that the literary character of Midas could have been shaped after the model of some other, earlier initial sinners of “Phrygian origin” in Greek mythology. The cosmology where the fabulous gold or the gold object marked the confines of the oecumene, as well as the earliest Greek ideas about Asia, might have influenced Midas’ image as well. Although the character of king Midas, as rendered by Ovid, seems a complete literary work, it preserves references of earlier evidence when Midas was a sage and was entitled with Apollonine and Dionysian features at the same time. These could convey ritual practices seen by the Greeks in Thrace and in Phrygia...|$|R
