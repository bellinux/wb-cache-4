5|$|A hemlock-mixed {{hardwood}} palustrine {{forest is}} present in the vicinity of Scotch Run east of the reservoir on the stream. The forest contains wooded wetlands and vernal pools. Trees inhabiting the forest include white oak, red oak, tulip poplar, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, American beech, and red maple. Other plants in the forest include teaberry, sphagnum moss, wood anemone, false hellebore, skunk cabbage, goldthread, and <b>sensitive</b> <b>fern.</b>|$|E
5|$|Five {{species of}} shrubs {{grow in the}} {{vicinity}} of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky dogwood, gray dogwood, spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include skunk cabbage, bloodroot, <b>sensitive</b> <b>fern,</b> sedge, wood anemone, woolgrass, and others. There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard in the area.|$|E

50|$|Osmunda claytoniana {{is found}} in humid zones, mostly in forests, but also in more open {{habitats}} and biomes, although rarely in bogs. The interrupted fern is often found alongside ostrich, cinnamon and <b>sensitive</b> <b>ferns.</b>|$|R
50|$|It grows {{best in a}} shaded or {{partially}} {{shaded area}} in a moist soil. The plant can tolerate dryer conditions in shade, and will tolerate wet soils and so occurs in soggy ground {{or at the very}} edge of water in shade or sun. <b>Sensitive</b> <b>ferns</b> spread to form colonies and are often the first species to inhabit disturbed areas. They can become weedy if not sited properly.|$|R
5000|$|Onoclea sensibilis (<b>sensitive</b> <b>fern)</b> - North America {{and eastern}} Asia, with the American and Asian populations being {{recognized}} as distinct varieties ...|$|E
5000|$|Fern Glade - almost 150 {{species of}} ferns, {{including}} Christmas Fern (Polystichum acrostichoides), Northern Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum pedatum), Southern Maidenhair Fern (Adiantum capillus-veneris), <b>Sensitive</b> <b>Fern</b> (Onoclea sensibilis), Royal Fern (Osmunda spectabilis), and Cinnamon Fern (Osmundastrum cinnamomeum).|$|E
50|$|The Kennard Park and Conservation Area is a post-agricultural forest {{grown up}} on 19th century farmland. The mixed and conifer {{woodlands}} reveal colonial stone walls, a red maple swamp with century-old trees, and a <b>sensitive</b> <b>fern</b> marsh.|$|E
50|$|Several ferns are noxious weeds or {{invasive}} species, including Japanese climbing fern (Lygodium japonicum), mosquito fern and <b>sensitive</b> <b>fern</b> (Onoclea sensibilis). Giant water fern (Salvinia molesta) {{is one of}} the world's worst aquatic weeds. The important {{fossil fuel}} coal consists of the remains of primitive plants, including ferns.|$|E
50|$|Arboretum trees include Apples, White Ash, Quaking Aspen, Gray Birch, Paper Birch, Yellow Birch, American Beech, Black Cherry, Dogwood, Eastern Hemlock, Hop-hornbeam, Red Maple, Sugar Maple, Northern Red Oak, White Oak, and Eastern White Pine. Other plants include Speckled Alder, Cattails, <b>Sensitive</b> <b>Fern,</b> Christmas Fern, Bracken, Clubmoss, Partridge Berry, Trillium, and Wintergreen.|$|E
50|$|This clade {{includes}} some important ferns, including the <b>Sensitive</b> <b>fern,</b> Onoclea sensibilis, which grows as a virtual weed {{throughout much of}} its temperate North American range, and ferns of the genus Thelypteris, a genus that has shown remarkable speciation. It also includes {{one of the more}} common horticultural ferns, the Ostrich fern, Matteuccia struthiopteris.|$|E
50|$|Matteuccia struthiopteris is {{the only}} species in the genus Matteuccia. Some sources include two Asian species, M. orientalis and M. intermedia, but {{molecular}} data shows that M. struthiopteris is {{more closely related to}} Onocleopsis and Onoclea (<b>sensitive</b> <b>fern)</b> than it is to M. orientalis and M. intermedia, and so the latter should be moved to a genus Pentarhizidium which contains those two species.|$|E

50|$|Onoclea sensibilis, the <b>sensitive</b> <b>fern,</b> {{also known}} as the bead fern, is a coarse-textured, medium to large-sized {{deciduous}} perennial fern. The name comes from the observation by early American settlers that it was very sensitive to frost, the fronds dying quickly when first touched by it. It is sometimes treated as the only species in Onoclea, but some authors do not consider the genus monotypic.|$|E
50|$|In the {{wetlands}} of Fallow Hollow, numerous shrubs and herbaceous plants live. These include <b>sensitive</b> <b>fern,</b> highbrush blueberry, cinnamon fern, winterberry holly, various sedges, {{and numerous other}} species. The hollow's seepy woods contain trees such as white pine, yellow birch, and eastern hemlock, and pignut hickory. Other plants {{in this part of}} the hollow include Japanese barberry, lowbush blueberry, partridge berry, red trillium, Indian cucumber, and witch hazel.|$|E
50|$|Habitats along Little Shickshinny Creek include {{mainly a}} Hemlock Palustrine Forest Natural Community, {{but also a}} red maple swamp, a highbush {{blueberry}} shrub swamp, and a dry oak-heath forest. Tree species in the creek's Hemlock Palustrine Forest Natural Community include mainly eastern hemlock, but also black gum, white pine, and beech. Other plants found here include Jack-in-the-pulpit, rhododendron, <b>sensitive</b> <b>fern,</b> skunk cabbage, hay-scented fern, and mountain laurel. The creek's shrub swamps and red maple swamps are home to gray birch, sedge, royal fern, silky dogwood, and numerous others.|$|E
40|$|Certain {{fatty acids}} in the C 5 to C 18 range, at {{concentrations}} {{as low as}} 10 âˆ’ 5 M, were found to inhibit the germinations of spores of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>fern,</b> Onoclea sensibilis L. The addition of gametophytic culture flltrates of the bracken fern, Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn, containing antheridogen A, was found to overcome this inhibition and allow the spores to germinate and the gametophytes to develop in a normal fashion. Some fatty acids were found to increase the antheridium-inducing potency of antheridogen A as much as 10 -fold. An effect similar to this may promote the diecious reproduction of ferns...|$|E
