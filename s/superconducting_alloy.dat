40|$|In {{the present}} paper we have {{analysed}} a fermionic infinite-ranged quantum Heisenberg spin glass (s= 1 / 2) with a BCS coupling in real space {{in the presence of}} an applied magnetic field. This model has been obtained by tracing out the conducting fermions in a <b>superconducting</b> <b>alloy.</b> The magnetic field is applied in the resulting effective model. The problem is formulated in the path integral formalism where the spin variables are defined as bilinear combinations of the Grassmann fields. The static approximation is used to treat both the pairing and the spin terms together with the replica symmetry ansatz. Henceforth, the problem can be reduced to a one site problem. The field in the z direction, Hz, separates the order parameters in two groups: parallel and transverse to it. We have obtained a phase diagram in T-g space with zero transverse spin-glass ordering, g being the strength of the pairing interaction. It has been possible to locate the transition temperature between the normal paramagnetic phase (NP) and the phase where there is a long range order corresponding to formation of pairs (PAIR). The transition ends at the temperature Tf, the transition temperature between the NP phase and the spin glass (SG) phase. Tf decreases for stronger fields allowing us to calculate the NP-PAIR line transition even at low temperatures. The NP-PAIR transition line has a complex dependence with g and Hz, having a tricritical point depending on Hz from where second order transitions occur for higher values of g and first order transitions occur for lower values of g.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of a superconducting coil used in fusion devices reveals that {{a wide spectrum of}} coupled physical problems should be taken into account during its design. This is also a good example of a general {{analysis of}} a hierarchical structure. Due to the large number of repetitive superconducting strands, the single cable can be considered as a homogeneous body in meso-scale, each strand being {{at the same time a}} micro composite of several components. A bundle of cables makes in turn a substantial part of a larger, D shaped superconducting coil. The above problems are numerically analysed using various, specialised algorithms of FE method. The single strand has its internal structure. It is made of filaments of <b>superconducting</b> <b>alloy</b> embedded in a matrix of bronze. The detailed geometry of the microstructure depends on the strand type. At this stage the classical model of Kirchhoff-Bernoulli beam is applicable, for which the beam type stiffness is computed by means of homogenisation theory and beam-type kinematical hypothesis. A triplet of strands can be seen as a single beam, but in this case the Kirrchhoff-Bernoulli hypothesis is not sufficient to define the mechanics of the structure. The common mechanical work of the triplet is influenced by friction between strands, their pointwise contacts and the helicoidal geometry. We propose a mixed Kirchhoff-Timoshenko approach with a torsion-tension coupling to model the beam-like behaviour at this stage and at the higher order cabling stages. Thus we are performing a successive substitution of discrete models involving many beams (three at the level of the triplet, four at the level of quadruplet) with a single, continuous beam model, that can be qualitatively different and the parameters of which can be deduced from the preceding cabling stages. This recursive substitution allows to maintain the number of beam elements in the model around a reasonable optimum. Since the thermo-mechanical loading is applied at the macro level, the analysis of the macro structure is indispensable. On the other hand, the most important engineering phenomena are related to the micro components of the composite. In our approach we can recover the micro-structural effects from the results at the macro level via suitable unsmearing procedures. All along the hierarchically organised FE analysis of the structure we deal with coupled thermo-mechanical phenomena and local material yielding occurring at the level of the micro structure. The lecture is illustrated with some examples revealing the specific properties of the different beam models at several cabling stages and with an overview of the model of the bundle of strands...|$|E

In addition, E_ 0 is positive for all five dopings, reflecting the abnormal behavior of the flux-flow resistivity ρ_ ff: it increases with decreasing magnetic field.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{theory of}} <b>superconducting</b> <b>alloys</b> {{does not take}} into account a discreet character of impurities. Experimental data for superfluid ^ 3 He in aerogel and for some of high-T_c superconductors reveal a significant discrepancy between the observed temperatures T_c of their transitions in the superfluid or superconducting state and that predicted by the theory. Here a theoretical scheme is presented for finding corrections to the T_c originating from spatial correlations between impurities. Analysis is limited to the Ginzburg and Landau temperature region. The shift of T_c with respect to the pure material is represented as a series in concentration of the impurities x. In the first order on x the conventional mean-field result for the lowering of T_c is recovered. Contribution of correlations enters the second order term. It is expressed via the structure factor of the ensemble of impurities. For superfluid ^ 3 He in silica aerogel the sign of the correction corresponds to an enhancement of the T_c so that the resulting pairbreaking effect of impurities is weakened. When correlation radius of impurities R exceeds the coherence length of the superfluid ξ_ 0 the contribution of correlations to the shift of T_c acquires a factor ∼(R/ξ_ 0) ^ 2 and the weakening of the pairbreaking effect becomes appreciable.
