5|$|In as {{different}} groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both <b>stabilising</b> and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising polyadenylation targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The <b>stabilising</b> ones {{start at the}} stop codon, and without them the stop codon (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part. Plant mitochondria have only destabilising polyadenylation, and yeast mitochondria have no polyadenylation at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget for}} the works was £420,000, with initial work focused on <b>stabilising</b> the {{foundations}} and lower masonry. Much of this was achieved through the injection of <b>stabilising</b> materials into the foundations, which needed time to cure and solidify. Works then progressed to the walls and roof, and finally the decorative embellishments. Today, while part of the Orangery is a dedicated café, the rest is an international education centre of excellence for the Trust, training new craftsmen and restoration specialists.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stabilised</b> soil {{products}} such as <b>stabilised</b> soil blocks, rammed earth and <b>stabilised</b> adobe are being used for building construction since the last 6 - 7 decades. Major advantages of <b>stabilised</b> soil products include low embodied carbon, use of local materials, decentralized production, and easy to adjust the strength, texture, size and shape. Portland cement and lime represent {{the most commonly used}} stabilisers for <b>stabilised</b> soil products. The mechanism of strength development in cement and lime <b>stabilised</b> soils is distinctly different. The paper presents results of scientific investigations pertaining to the status of clay minerals in the 28 day cured cement and lime <b>stabilised</b> soil compacts. XRD, SEM imaging, grain size distribution and Atterberg's limits of the ground <b>stabilised</b> soil products and the natural soil were determined. Results reveal that clay minerals can be retrieved from cement <b>stabilised</b> soil products, whereas in lime <b>stabilised</b> soil products clay minerals get consumed in the lime-clay reactions and negligible percentage of clay minerals are left in the <b>stabilised</b> soil compacts. The results of the present investigation clearly demonstrate that cement stabilisation is superior to lime stabilisation in retrieving the clay minerals from the <b>stabilised</b> soil compacts.

5|$|Due to {{the large}} size of the heavy s-block elements, {{including}} strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 {{all the way to}} 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Ca2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in <b>stabilising</b> strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.|$|E
5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{are often}} {{designed}} {{to mimic the}} transition state or intermediate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. This ensures that the inhibitor exploits the transition state <b>stabilising</b> effect of the enzyme, resulting in a better binding affinity (lower Ki) than substrate-based designs. An {{example of such a}} transition state inhibitor is the antiviral drug oseltamivir; this drug mimics the planar nature of the ring oxonium ion in the reaction of the viral enzyme neuraminidase.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the compressive strength of lateritic bricks <b>stabilised</b> with cement, lime and termite-hill, moulded with CINVA-Ram. The engineering characteristics and classification of the lateritic soil sample were determined, also the characteristic compressive strength of <b>stabilised</b> bricks {{as well as}} the unstabilised bricks were investigated after 7, 14 and 28 days of curing. The total number of bricks moulded was ninety and they were 290 mm x 140 mm x 90 mm in size. Each of the three stabilisers were added in varying proportions of 8 %, 10 % and 12 % by weight of the lateritic soil for producing the bricks. Compressive strength test conducted after 28 days curing revealed that the cement <b>stabilised</b> bricks developed a rapid increase in strength than the lime <b>stabilised</b> and termite-hill stablised bricks. In all, the compressive strength increased with increasing proportion of the stabilisers. However, the unstabilised bricks developed strength which was more than the 10 % termite-hill <b>stabilised</b> bricks after 28 days. It was deduced that cement stabilization is adequate where early strength is targeted on the field...|$|R

This paper is focused on understanding the compaction characteristics and physical properties of compacted cement <b>stabilised</b> soil mixtures and cement <b>stabilised</b> rammed earth (CSRE). This experimental study addresses (a) influence of soil composition, cement content, time lag on compaction characteristics of <b>stabilised</b> soils and CSRE and (b) effect of moulding water content and density on compressive strength and water absorption of compacted cement <b>stabilised</b> soil mixes. Salient conclusions of the study are (a) compaction characteristics of soils are not affected {{by the addition of}} cement, (b) there is 50 % fall in strength of CSRE for 10 h time lag, (c) compressive strength of compacted cement <b>stabilised</b> soil increases with increase in density irrespective of moulding moisture content and cement content, and (d) compressive strength increases with the increase in moulding water content and compaction of CSRE on the wet side of OMC is beneficial in terms of strength...|$|R

5|$|Plasmid <b>stabilising</b> toxin-antitoxin {{systems have}} been used as {{examples}} of selfish DNA as part of the gene centered view of evolution. It has been theorised that toxin-antitoxin loci serve only to maintain their own DNA, {{at the expense of the}} host organism. Other theories propose the systems have evolved to increase the fitness of plasmids in competition with other plasmids. Thus, the toxin-antitoxin system confers an advantage to the host DNA by eliminating competing plasmids in cell progeny. This theory was corroborated through computer modelling. This does not, however, explain the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems on chromosomes.|$|E

The rest of the division had no option but to fall back to the line of First World War trenches. During the chaotic withdrawal all the artillery sub-units got lost. By 19:00 hours the town was in Russian hands.|$|E

5|$|By 1958 the castle's {{condition}} {{had deteriorated}} and the Ministry of Works took legal {{custody of the}} site, although it continued to be owned by the Howard family. Conservation work {{took place during the}} 1960s, <b>stabilising</b> the stonework of the keep. Archaeological investigations were then carried out, focusing on the keep in 1970, the church and the earthwork defences during 1971 and 1972, and the inner bailey from 1973 to 1976. This research centred on archaeological excavations and the recording of remains; as with similar castles investigated during this period, the site was then preserved as a monument, and grass lawns laid down around the remaining stonework and foundations. Further excavations were carried out in 1987 during the construction of the ticket office beside the castle.|$|E

Louis's forces moved to attack Aquitaine. Stephen responded by placing Wallingford Castle, a key fortress loyal to Henry along the Thames Valley, under siege, possibly {{in an attempt to}} force a successful end to the English conflict while Henry was still fighting for his territories in France. Henry moved quickly in response, avoiding open battle with Louis in Aquitaine and <b>stabilising</b> the Norman border, pillaging the Vexin and then striking south into Anjou against Geoffrey, capturing one of his main castles. Louis fell ill and withdrew from the campaign, and Geoffrey was forced {{to come to terms with}} Henry.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for a trait that can vary across {{a range of}} values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in <b>stabilising</b> selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends, which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E

In addition to <b>stabilising</b> the body while swimming, a quick flick of the tail fan can rapidly propel the animal backwards, which may have functioned as a means of escaping predators like in modern shrimp. Traces of four fused segments are evident in the three faint lines dividing each lobe of the tail fan. A long telson is present {{at the end of the}} body. Traces of a rounded stomach, small digestive glands, and an intestine that terminates into a tiny anal opening on the telson can also be observed in some specimens.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} inductive effect of the alkyl groups, further <b>stabilising</b> the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The irreversibility of the substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.|$|E
