40|$|For {{more than}} a decade, the European governments have focused their energy {{policies}} on creating one European competitive electricity market. Several regulations are introduced into the European electricity industries for this purpose: the energy firms have to unbundle the electricity networks from electricity generation and retail, and the consumers {{should be able to}} choose their electricity retailer. This thesis analyses which new governance structures emerged in the Dutch and French electricity industries {{as a result of these}} regulations for four types of electricity transactions: the network connection, network access, balancing and <b>switching</b> <b>transactions.</b> The parties in these electricity industries did not adopt a market, but hybrid forms of governance that remained extensively regulated. The efficiency of these new governance structures cannot be explained with the attributes of the transactions, as is proposed by transaction cost economics. This thesis therefore introduces the concept of adaptation into transaction cost economics. Adaptation is the adjustment by economic actors from one governance structure to another, and is characterized by three attributes: the identity of the future contracting party, the laterality of the adaption, and the type of response in the adaptation process. These attributes explain the governance transformations and the new governance structures in the two industries. Regulation continues to play a pervasive role in the liberalized electricity industries. It influences the attributes of the transactions, the new governance structures and the adaptation process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{algorithm}} for mining complete frequent itemsets. This algorithm {{is referred to as}} the TM (Transaction Mapping) algorithm from hereon. In this algorithm, transaction ids of each itemset are mapped and compressed to continuous transaction intervals in a different space and the counting of itemsets is performed by intersecting these interval lists in a depth-first order along the lexicographic tree. When the compression coefficient becomes smaller than the average number of comparisons for intervals intersection at a certain level, the algorithm <b>switches</b> to <b>transaction</b> id intersection. We have evaluated the algorithm against two popular frequent itemset mining algorithms- FP-growth and dEclat using a variety of data sets with short and long frequent patterns.

30|$|Switching from a cash based {{economy to}} a cashless economy would require {{a concerted effort to}} develop a network of {{critical}} mass that deals with cashless transactions. Network effects are in place when an addition of one more individual to an existing network of individuals increases the value of all the members in the current network. This makes it costlier for the existing members to switch from the current network. With each additional cashless transaction, the value to all the members currently using cash increases. In simple words, users find it more attractive to <b>switch</b> to cashless <b>transactions</b> if more users are using them (Shy and Tarakka 2002). Therefore, it is important that policy initiatives are in place to develop a critical mass of this network of non-cash users.|$|R

We develop a decision framework for analyzing the situation in which banking firms, facing a choice between two networks, choose when to adopt to maximize their net benefits flow. We assess the impact of a move to network <b>transaction</b> <b>switching</b> called duality, a strategic decision to create technological compatibility between the networks. We also test two network externalities hypotheses with an econometric analysis, using growth data for CIRRUS and PLUS, the two largest nationally shared electronic banking networks. The empirical models are motivated by the decision framework. We found that technological compatibility resulted in additional growth of the electronic banking industry as well as the individual national shared networks. The results of this study are consistent with our network externalities hypotheses, and shed light on the competitive adoption and diffusion of IT innovations...|$|R
40|$|The recent rise of {{electricity}} generation based on {{renewable energy sources}} increases the demand for transmission capacity. Capacity expansion via the upgrade of transmission line capacity, e. g., by conversion to a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line, is an attractive option. In this paper, it is shown that if the upgrade to HVDC is applied systematically to selected transmission lines across the grid, a hybrid architecture is obtained that enables an efficient and globally optimal solution of the optimal power flow (OPF) problem. More precisely, for conventional meshed AC transmission grids the OPF problem is nonconvex and in general NP-hard, rendering it hard to solve. We prove that after the upgrade to the proposed hybrid architecture, the same mesh topology facilitates an exact convex relaxation of the OPF problem, enabling its globally optimal solution with efficient polynomial time algorithms. This OPF method is then employed in simulations, which demonstrate that the hybrid architecture can increase the effective transmission capacity and substantially reduce the generation costs, even compared to the AC grid with optimal transmission <b>switching.</b> Comment: IEEE <b>Transactions</b> on Power System...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Concurrent data accesses in {{high-level}} languages like Java and C # {{are typically}} mediated using mutual-exclusion locks. Threads use locks {{to guard the}} operations performed while the lock is held, so that the lock’s guarded operations can never be interleaved with operations of other threads that are guarded by the same lock. This way both atomicity and isolation properties of a thread’s guarded operations are enforced. Recent proposals recognize that these properties can also be enforced by concurrency control protocols that avoid well-known problems associated with locking, by transplanting notions of transactions found in database systems to a programming language context. While higher-level than locks, software transactions incur significant implementation overhead. This overhead cannot be easily masked when there is little contention on the operations being guarded. We show how mutual-exclusion locks and transactions can be reconciled transparently within Java’s monitor abstraction. We have implemented monitors for Java that execute using locks when contention is low and <b>switch</b> over to <b>transactions</b> when concurrent attempts to enter the monitor are detected. We formally argue the correctness of our solution with respect to Java’s execution semantics and provide a detailed performance evaluation for different workloads and varying levels of contention. We demonstrate that our implementation has low overheads in the uncontended case (7 % on average) and that significant performance improvements (up to 3 ×) can be achieved from running contended monitors transactionally. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in semiconductor technology have greatly increased {{the performance and}} range of application of switched mode circuits. Periodic switching can give rise to acoustic noise [Y. -S. Lai, Random switching techniques for inverter control, Electronics Letters 33 (9) (1977) 747 – 749] or undesirable electromagnetic radiation. These problems can be reduced {{through the use of}} random switching policies [S. Y. R. Hui, S. Sathiakumar, K. -K. Sung, Novel random pwm schemes with weighted <b>switching</b> decision, IEEE <b>Transactions</b> on Power Electronics 12 (0885 - 8993) (1997) 945 – 951], but it is not always clear how this could be done without affecting other performance measures, such as RMS ripple or stability. We use the buck/boost regulator as an example for analysis and determine some simple techniques for choosing appropriate component values. The circuit is simulated and it is shown that strict adherence to the formal limits of stability, suggested by control theory, does not always guarantee a satisfactory output. We demonstrate that if switching is performed quickly enough then a state-space averaged model may be used for the buck/boost controller. This model is stable within wide bounds. It is possible to use some of this freedom to optimise EMC performance {{through the use of a}} control law which is random within certain limits. In the popular mind, the idea of “randomness ” seems to be completely opposed to the idea of “control. ” We show that not necessarily the case. Some randomness can beneficial, from the point of view of minimising the maximum power spectral density of the noise waveforms i...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{demonstrates}} {{the relevance of}} looking at discursive construction of trust in the marketing context. Consumers and users {{of goods and services}} want confidence in the transaction and this can build into ongoing relationships whereby customers will return to the supplier rather than <b>switch</b> supplier between <b>transactions.</b> Confidence creation is a relatively common tool for marketers to include in their relationship marketing plans. Yet the topic is rarely examined as a discursive process. We make the argument that discursive processes of trust, entrustment and trustworthiness are a central aspect of marketing relationships with themes such as identity, legitimacy, and transparency, even conflict of interest and manipulation??? the dark side of trust. Relationships are the outcome of these processes as they reduce risk. Reputation/brand building is a relational marketing task, which reduces customer risk by demonstrating trustworthiness and calling forth trust in the expertise of the healthcare worker or the marketing consultant or salesperson. In this way risk is mitigated by knowledge of organizational reputation/brand or by personal knowledge of the actual service encounter personnel. This knowledge enables initial trust to be placed and various service encounters may then foster and build trust. The service encounter is where the supplier and customer meet, and so is the focus of marketing effort. A critical literature review addresses both beneficial aspects of relational marketing and the ???dark side??? of calls to entrust. Case studies provide discourses from purchasers of service from two related settings where there is choice of supplier and opportunity for relationship building through the service encounter We present a narrative analysis of shared, interactively created organized by the themes noted above, assisted by qualitative analysis software. Our analysis is based on the understanding that all actors are situated in particular interactions within social, cultural and institutional discourses. This analysis concludes with insight into how trust processes create value for consumers...|$|R
