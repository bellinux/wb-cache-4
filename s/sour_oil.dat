5000|$|The {{majority}} of the sulfur in crude oil occurs bonded to carbon atoms, {{with a small amount}} occurring as elemental sulfur in solution and as hydrogen sulfide gas. <b>Sour</b> <b>oil</b> can be toxic and corrosive, especially when the oil contains higher levels of hydrogen sulfide, which is a breathing hazard.

50|$|Like <b>sour</b> <b>oil,</b> {{there is}} some natural gas {{naturally}} high in sulfur, called sour gas (natural gas {{with little or no}} sulfur is called sweet gas). The sulfur is present in the form of hydrogen sulfide, a toxic gas that must be removed for safety reasons. Most natural gas has less than 1 percent hydrogen sulfide, but deposits have been discovered with more than 80 percent hydrogen sulfide. Sour gas is most often associated with carbonate rocks, and especially with anhydrite. Hydrogen sulfide is also corrosive, so that gas high in hydrogen sulfide requires special corrosion-resistant production equipment,as well as extra safety precautions. The requirement that gas processors remove the sulfur causes sour gas to receive a lower producer price than sweet gas.|$|E
5000|$|A Vaportight tank is a horizontal, atmospheric, {{crude oil}} storage tank. Vaportight tanks can {{hold up to}} 14.7 PSI and use that {{pressure}} to force gas vapors to a flare stack. Because Vaportight tanks allow no fugitive gas to escape they are classified as process equipment, therefore they can be spaced as such and are secondary containment exempt. This also allows them to be operated in situations with a high H2S content. Vaportight tanks also known as (Tornado type tanks, Positive Pressure Systems, and OSY Tanks) are frequently packaged with an integral separator package, flare stack, and all other equipment downstream of the wellhead to form a complete single well battery. Because of this Vaportight tank packages are a mostly used in the temporary production of oil wells. The intended use for Vaportight tank packages was <b>sour</b> <b>oil</b> production (as H2S gas is deadly in low concentrations) but with ease [...] The first vaportight tanks were constructed from used crude oil rail tankers by Tornado Technologies.

5000|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S, {{also known}} as sour gas) is found to varying degrees in crude petroleum. The gas is flammable, corrosive, poisonous, and explosive; thus, oil {{with higher levels of}} H2S {{presents}} challenges such as [...] "health and environmental risks, corrosion of wellbore, added expense with regard to materials handling and pipeline equipment, and additional refinement requirements." [...] Bakken oil has historically been characterized as [...] "sweet", meaning that it has little or no H2S. However, increased concentration of H2S over time has been observed in some Bakken wells, believed to be due to certain completion practices, such as hydraulic fracturing into neighboring formations, and may contain high levels of H2S. Some other formations in the Williston Basin have always produced [...] "sour" [...] (high H2S) crude oil, and because sweet oil brings a higher price, oil transporters suspect that some <b>sour</b> <b>oil</b> is being blended into sweet Bakken crude. H2S in crude oil is being investigated as a possible cause of the explosive nature of the Lac-Mégantic rail disaster. Pipeline operators Tesoro and Enbridge no longer accept crude with more than five parts per million H2S, citing safety concerns.|$|E

40|$|Marun {{oil field}} {{is located in}} the {{southwest}} of Iran and consists of two oil reservoirs named Asmari and Bangestan. Asmari oil reservoir has been producing sweet oil and gas since 1964, {{but for the first time}} a high amount of hydrogen sulfide gas was observed in one well of this reservoir in 1980. Moreover, the Bangestan oil reservoir is located deeper than the Asmari oil reservoir and has been producing <b>sour</b> <b>oil</b> and gas since 1972. This paper represents the conducted study on the determination of hydrogen sulfide oil pollution sources in the Asmari oil reservoir. There are two hypotheses for sources of hydrogen sulfide oil pollution in the Asmari oil reservoir; first, hydrogen sulfide gas migration from Bangestan oil reservoir and second, sour gas injection migration. Data of well souring history, hydrogen sulfide gas concentration of wells, volume of gas injection and RFT analysis were used to investigate these hypotheses. The results showed a similar trend of gas injection volume and hydrogen sulfide gas concentration of wells, which decreased over time. Also, the results demonstrated that the migration of gas injection is a source and cause of spreading of hydrogen sulfide gas in the Asmari oil reservoir...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{constraints}} and high costs, especially offshore, are making conventional well testing {{less and less}} feasible and accepted by the public Administration. New options were thoroughly evaluated to find {{a viable alternative to}} standard production tests for characterizing the well productivity without surface production. An accurate investigation demonstrated that injection tests could provide all the information needed to calculate the well productivity at reasonably low costs and with a good degree of reliability. Based on the results of laboratory and field pilot tests it was proved that injectivity tests could be successfully applied to a real <b>sour</b> <b>oil</b> field. Laboratory tests proved that brine could be a suitable injection fluid because there were no compatibility problems with the oil and the reservoir rock. It was verified that the interpretation of the pressure transients should be referred to the fall-off period rather than to the injection phase. The formation permeability thickness product (kh) could be correctly identified from the pressure derivative analysis only if multiphase-flow was assumed. The total skin value could also be obtained from the test interpretation. The total skin comprises two components, a mechanical component due to permeability damage, and a bi-phase component due to fluid interaction in the reservoir. Except for a limited number of cases, the bi-phase skin can only be evaluated with numerical well testing, provided that the fluid relative permeability curves are available. It was also demonstrated that the bi-phase component mainly depends on the injection rate, but is independent from the formation permeability. Then, the well-known transient equation was applied to determine the well productivity index (PI) based on the kh and the mechanical skin. PI values calculated from injection tests compared satisfactorily with PI values measured from 6 DST tests performed on appraisal well...|$|E
