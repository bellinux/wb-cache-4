50|$|In meiotic sporogenesis, a diploid <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> {{within the}} {{sporangium}} undergoes meiosis, producing a tetrad of haploid spores. In organisms that are heterosporous, {{two types of}} spores occur: Microsporangia produce male microspores, and megasporangia produce female megaspores. In megasporogenesis, often {{three of the four}} spores degenerate after meiosis, whereas in microsporogenesis all four microspores survive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sporophyte}} produces spores (hence the name) by meiosis, {{a process}} {{also known as}} [...] "reduction division" [...] that reduces the number of chromosomes in each <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> by half. The resulting meiospores develop into a gametophyte. Both the spores and the resulting gametophyte are haploid, meaning they only have one set of chromosomes. The mature gametophyte produces male or female gametes (or both) by mitosis. The fusion {{of male and female}} gametes produces a diploid zygote which develops into a new sporophyte. This cycle is known as alternation of generations or alternation of phases.|$|E
30|$|The {{development}} of sporangia from their initiation to maturation took nearly 1  year. Microscopic observations {{showed that the}} sporangial walls were developed from epidermal cells via initiation, cell division, and maturation. The structure of the mature sporangial wall is composed of one layer of epidermis, two middle layers of cells, and one layer of tapetum. Therefore, the sporangium is the eusporangium type. Spore development is characterized into six stages, initiation from epidermal cell and formation of sporogenous cells, primary sporogenous cell, secondary sporogenous cell, <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cell,</b> tetrad, and maturation.|$|E

40|$|Strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce insecticidal proteins. These strains {{have been}} {{isolated}} from diverse ecological niches, such as soil, phylloplane, insect cadavers and grain dust. To effectively propagate, these strains produce {{a range of}} molecules that facilitate its multiplication in a competing environment. In this report, we have examined synthesis of a chitin-binding protein and evaluated its effect on fungi encountered in environment and its interaction with insecticidal proteins synthesized by B. thuringiensis. The gene encoding chitin-binding protein has been cloned and expressed. The purified protein has been demonstrated to interact with Cry insecticidal protein, Cry 1 Ac by Circular Dichrosim spectroscopy (CD) and in vitro pull down assays. The chitin-binding protein potentiates insecticidal activity of bacillar insecticidal protein, Cry 1 Ac. Further, chitin-binding protein was fungistatic against several soil fungi. The chitin binding protein is expressed in <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> and deposited along with insecticidal protein, Cry 1 Ac. It interacts with Cry 1 Ac to potentiate its insecticidal activity and facilitate propagation of Bacillus strain in environment by inhibiting growth of certain fungi...|$|E
40|$|Micrographs of dictyosomes in face {{view and}} in profile, {{together}} with serial sections representing both these planes, are reproduced from three sample cells at different developmental {{stages in the}} meristem of Anthoceros. The stages are: a vegetative cell at anaphase of a mitotic division, a vegetative cell in {{an early stage of}} postmitotic extension growth, and a young <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> in the act of rounding up before the onset of meiosis. The observations suggest that proliferation of tubules from the edges of the dictyosomal cisternae into the cytoplasm is occurring with varying intensity and with slightly different morphological expression in all three cells. In all, the tubules are joined into a reticulum which exhibits local swellings at varying distances from the unfenestrated part of the subtending cisterna. A comparison is suggested between the observed reticulum and "smooth" endoplasmic reticulum of animals but it is not claimed that all the cytoplasmic tubules detectable in Anthoceros need have arisen in this way. Morphological differences discernible between tubules near their point of attachment to dictyosomes and others apparently involved {{in the formation of the}} new nuclear membrane at the end of a cell division could mean that more than one category of tube may exist in these cells. A plea is registered for restraint in the formulation of far reaching theories until more facts are available on unequivocal evidence...|$|E
40|$|Population biology data {{collected}} during 1995 – 2009 {{from more than}} a dozen localities in Central India have revealed that both the interspecific as well as intraspecific chromosome variations are inherent in many species of Ophioglossum L. The lowest count of chromosome recorded for any plant of Ophioglossum eliminatum Khandelwal et Goswami reported to be n = 30 chromosomes has not been confirmed even in a single <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> or in any mitotically dividing root tip cell. This is emphatically emphasised to be characterised by n = 86 ± 2 chromosomes little lower than originally suggested 90 ± 2 chromosomes. Therefore this is reemphasised that lowest chromosome count for the genus is n = 86, not n = 30 as claimed earlier. Somatic chromosomes from root tip squashes and microtome sections of root tip cells stained with haematoxylin clearly reveal polysomaty (chromosome variations in multiples within the same tissue) in O. eliminatum and O. costatum, which have been probably ignored by earlier workers. Additionally, typical epidermal feature of linear splitting of cells to form several openings in the mesophyll, inherent and expressed only by leaves of O. eliminatum {{has been found to be}} a diagnostic trait of the species collected from original localities in Shivpuri forest in Central India and far away in Rajasthan in Western India. As far as known, no living or a fossil leaf has ever shown such natural tearing of the mesophyll tissue...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in {{flowering plants}} offers {{a number of}} remarkable aspects to developmental biologists. First, the <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> - precursors of the plant reproductive lineage - are specified late in development, as opposed to precocious germline isolation during embryogenesis in most animals. Second, unlike in most animals where meiosis directly produces gametes, plant meiosis entails the differentiation of a multicellular, haploid gametophyte, within which gametic as well as non-gametic accessory cells are formed. These observations {{raise the question of}} the factors inducing and modus operandi of cell fate transitions that originate in floral tissues and gametophytes, respectively. Cell fate transitions in the reproductive lineage imply cellular reprogramming operating at the physiological, cytological and transcriptome level, but also at the chromatin level. A number of observations point to large-scale chromatin reorganization events associated with cellular differentiation of the female <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> and of the female gametes. These include a reorganization of the heterochromatin compartment, the genome-wide alteration of the histone modification landscape, and the remodeling of nucleosome composition. The dynamic expression of DNA methyltransferases and actors of small RNA pathways also suggest additional, global epigenetic alterations that remain to be characterized. Are these events a cause or a consequence of cellular differentiation, and how do they contribute to cell fate transition? Does chromatin dynamics induce competence for immediate cellular functions (meiosis, fertilization), or does it also contribute long-term effects in cellular identity and developmental competence of the reproductive lineage? This review attempts to review these fascinating questions...|$|R
50|$|In conifers, the {{reproductive}} structures are borne on cones. The cones are either pollen cones (male) or ovulate cones (female), but some species are monoecious and others dioecious. A pollen cone contains hundreds of microsporangia carried on (or borne on) reproductive structures called sporophylls. <b>Spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> in the microsporangia divide by meiosis to form haploid microspores that develop further by two mitotic divisions into immature male gametophytes (pollen grains). The four resulting cells {{consist of a}} large tube cell that forms the pollen tube, a generative cell that will produce two sperm by mitosis, and two prothallial cells that degenerate. These cells comprise a very reduced microgametophyte, that is contained within the resistant wall of the pollen grain.|$|R
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of {{flowering}} plants is marked by several post-embryonic developmental transitions during which novel cell fates are established. Notably, the reproductive lineages are first formed during flower development. The differentiation of <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells,</b> which are destined for meiosis, marks the somatic-to-reproductive fate transition. Meiosis entails {{the formation of the}} haploid multicellular gametophytes, from which the gametes are derived, and during which epigenetic reprogramming takes place. Here we show that in the Arabidopsis female megaspore <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> (MMC), cell fate transition is accompanied by large-scale chromatin reprogramming that is likely to establish an epigenetic and transcriptional status distinct from that of the surrounding somatic niche. Reprogramming is characterized by chromatin decondensation, reduction in heterochromatin, depletion of linker histones, changes in core histone variants and in histone modification landscapes. From the analysis of mutants in which the gametophyte fate is either expressed ectopically or compromised, we infer that chromatin reprogramming in the MMC is likely to contribute to establishing postmeiotic competence {{to the development of the}} pluripotent gametophyte. Thus, as in primordial germ cells of animals, the somatic-to-reproductive cell fate transition in plants entails large-scale epigenetic reprogramming...|$|R
40|$|Development of a tetrad of meiospores {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{widespread}} examples of geometrically precise cell morphogenesis in plants. We have studied the process in the moss Funaria hygrometrica. Changes leading to a quadripolar organization of the pro-phase <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> (SMC) start in the arche-sporial cells several cell generations before meiosis. The number of plastids per cell is reduced to two and these play an increasing part in subsequent mitoses and meiosis. During meiotic prophase, the plastids elongate until they enclose the peripheral nucleus. The nucleus is then drawn back into the centre of the cell as the plastids rotate and ulti-mately assume a mutually perpendicular configur-ation. The tips of the plastids thus lie at the vertices of a tetrahedron arranged around the nucleus, which itself becomes deformed into a tetrahedral shape. Quadripolarity has now been set up in anticipation of the two meiotic divisions. The first division spindle is also somewhat tetra-hedral, with broad poles oriented perpendicular to one another along two opposite edges of the tetra-hedron. As a consequence, the daughter nuclei are, from their inception, mutually perpendicular and elongated along the first spindle poles, ready for the second division, which places one haploid nucleus opposite each of the four plastid tips. Simultaneous cytokinesis then bisects the plastids and generates a tetrad of spores. The morphological evidence thus indicates that the plastids are involved in the development of internal quadripolarity in the outwardly apola...|$|E
30|$|Transcriptome analysis, such as {{microarray}} and RNA-sequencing, has superior {{power because}} of its high throughput, cost performance and well developed statistical methods for data interpretation. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), a lot of microarray and RNA sequencing data representing transcriptome of vegetative and reproductive organs, including developing flowers at several stages, have been compiled in the RiceXPro (Rice Expression Profile Database), TIGR (Rice Genome Annotation Project Database), and GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus Database) (Ouyang et al. 2007; Sato et al. 2013). Besides these databases, transcriptome analyses of meiosis process (Aya et al. 2011; Deveshwar et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2015; Li et al. 2016), developing pollen (Wei et al. 2010), germinating pollen (Wang et al. 2008), and developing seed and endosperm (Nie et al. 2013; Jung et al. 2015) have also been reported. Based on these public available databases, several gene expression profiles involved important pollen development stage, especially in the detailed analysis of meiosis-stage specific and the <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> developing stage can be acquired (Deveshwar et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2015). The reliability of these data confirmed by the comparison with the published gene expression profile of previously identified anther specific genes in rice (Hobo et al. 2008). Our previous transcriptome analysis revealed significant variations between autotetraploid and diploid rice hybrids harboring triple pollen sterility loci (SaSbSc) interactions, {{and we found that}} polyploidy enhanced F 1 pollen sterility loci interactions that increase meiosis abnormalities and pollen sterility in autotetraploid rice (Wu et al. 2015). In the present study, we used near-isogenic autotetraploid rice lines to develop autotetraploid hybrids with different pollen sterility loci interactions, including with Sa, Sb, Sc, SaSb and SaSbSc pollen sterility loci interactions. Then, we employed WE-CLSM (whole-mount eosin B-staining confocal laser scanning microscopy) and transcriptome analysis to conduct further studies. The specific objectives of the present study were (i) to determine the pollen abortion stage in different autotetraploid rice hybrids; (ii) to detect major pollen sterility locus or loci that cause high pollen sterility in autotetraploid rice hybrids; (iii) to identify differentially expressed genes among different hybrids and their association with meiosis and transcription regulation; (iv) and to evaluate the role of neutral genes for overcoming pollen sterility in autotetraploid rice hybrids. Our findings have important implications to understand the complex mechanisms of pollen sterility loci interactions in polyploid rice.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} {{relating to}} apomixis in {{members of the}} Gramineae is reviewed, particularly {{as it relates to}} the types of mechanisms found and to the occurrence of apomixis in the different systematic divisions of the family. Apomixis is more prevalent in the Subfamily Panicoideae than in the Pooideae, and the course of development of the unreduced embryo sac is distinctive in the two subfamilies. Throughout the grasses somatic apospory predominates over gonial apospory, and pseudogamy is much more prevalent than non-pseudogamy. In Cortaderia jubata the <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> (or its derivatives) degenerate and nucellar cells develop as somatic embryo sacs. These follow a course of development similar to the Hieracium type. The synergid develops a prominent haustorium which usually protrudes beyond the micropyle. No functional pollen forms and embryogenesis begins well before anthesis. The species is, therefore, non-pseudogamous. Since no other non-pseudogamous grass also exhibits somatic apospory the situation in Cortaderia would appear to be unique among apomictic grasses. The sexual species of this genus are gynodioecious and exhibit a Polygonum type, 8 -nucleate, 7 -celled embryo sac, which the polar nuclei fuse at or near fertilization and the two synergids develop haustorial extensions through the micropyle during the organisation of the megagametophyte. The structure of the component cells of the somatic embryo sac is described at the ultrastructural level and compared with published accounts. The progress of nucellar degeneration is discussed, and its association with dilatations of the nuclear envelope is noted. A deeply lobed nucleus which is intimately associated with both the apomictic egg and the synergid is characteristic of the central cell. Wall ingrowths of transfer-cell type appear during the organization of the somatic embryo sac and occur all over the central cell, except adjacent to the antipodal cells. Sexual species of Cortaderia also show this feature prior to fertilization. The structure of the haustorium and synergid is described and their role in nutrient uptake and transport is discussed in the light of their morphology. Antipodal cells appear also to be adapted to a nutritional function. The formation walls between the coenocytic endosperm cells follows the pattern already described for this tissue, but wall formation between the cells of the megagametophyte follows a distinctive course. A preliminary account is given of the ultrastructure of the cells of the young globular embryo and the unusual presence of layers of dilated endoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the suspensor is recorded. Finally, notes are given on some miscellaneous topics revealed by the electron microscope...|$|E
40|$|The haploid gametophytes of the fern Ceratopteris richardii are {{autotrophic}} {{and develop}} {{independently of the}} diploid sporophyte plant. While haploid genetics is useful for screening and characterizing mutations affecting gametophyte development in Ceratopteris, {{it is difficult to}} assess whether a gametophytic mutation is dominant or recessive or to determine allelism by complementation analysis in a haploid organism. This report describes how apospory can be used to produce genetically marked polyploid sporophytes whose gametophyte progeny are heterozygous for mutations affecting sex determination in the gametophyte and a known recessive mutation affecting the phenotype of both the gametophyte and sporophyte. The segregation ratios of wild-type to mutant phenotypes in the gametophyte progeny of polyploid sporophyte plants indicate that all of the mutations examined are recessive. The presence of many multivalents and few univalents in meiotic chromosome preparations of <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> confirm that the sporophyte plants assayed are polyploid.

40|$|In {{flowering}} plants, the somatic-to-reproductive cell fate {{transition is}} marked by the specification of <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> (SMCs) in floral organs of the adult plant. The female SMC (megaspore <b>mother</b> <b>cell,</b> MMC) differentiates in the ovule primordium and undergoes meiosis The selected haploid megaspore then undergoes mitosis to form the multicellular female gametophyte, which will give rise to the gametes, the egg cell and central cell, together with accessory cells. The limited accessibility of the MMC, meiocyte and female gametophyte inside the ovule is technically challenging for cytological and cytogenetic analyses at single cell level. Particularly, direct or indirect immunodetection of cellular or nuclear epitopes is impaired by poor penetration of the reagents inside the plant cell and single-cell imaging is demised {{by the lack of}} optical clarity in whole-mount tissues. Thus, we developed an efficient method to analyze the nuclear organization and chromatin modification at high resolution of single cell in whole-mount embedded Arabidopsis ovules. It is based on dissection and embedding of fixed ovules in a thin layer of acrylamide gel on a microscopic slide. The embedded ovules are subjected to chemical and enzymatic treatments aiming at improving tissue clarity and permeability to the immunostaining reagents. Those treatments preserve cellular and chromatin organization, DNA and protein epitopes. The samples can be used for different downstream cytological analyses, including chromatin immunostaining, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and DNA staining for heterochromatin analysis.

40|$|This {{is being}} {{hypothesised}} that the heterospory to begin with, might have originated within one specific sporangium thereafter separate {{male and female}} sporangia would have evolved in due course of time. This new category of a sporangium, is hereby named as “heterosporangium”, conceived {{to have been the}} cradle sporangium for the origin of heterospory. Such a sporangium may have possessed three types of spores, viz. microspores, megaspores and morphologically distinct spores possessing resemblances with spores of past lineages/fossils. Such a classical structure has been exemplified by a fundamental discovery of “intrasporangial heterospory” in 1968. This appears that this evolutionary phase could have followed the path of sequential evolution of isosporangium-anisosporangium-heterosporangium and finally, leading to “intersporangial heterospory” in the form of independent microsporangium and megasporangium. The independent sex differentiated sporangia must have had evolved by selective degeneration of <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> in a differentiating young heterosporangium. In other words, a microsporangium should have evolved by the degeneration of megaspore <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> and megasporangium by early degeneration of microspore <b>mother</b> <b>cells.</b> This selective degeneration must have been operative on account of some genetic mechanism as suggested by Bell in 1996 and later, demonstrated by our observations on epigenetic mechanisms suspecting mainly abrupt hypomethylation of DNA, to be responsible event as indicated in heterosporangia of Isoetes pantii Goswami et Arya. This paper exclusively establishes heterosporangium as a structure of rare evolutionary importance genetically inherent within the genome of the species observed consistently for more than five decades. Recent decline of such plants of I. × pantii does not lower down importance of heterosporangium because its physical presence can never be denied.

Strains cured of these plasmids produced only the free inclusion. Since the plasmid-cured strains did not contain DNA sequences homologous to plasmid DNA, the gene for the free-inclusion protein must be encoded in the chromosome. In contrast, the enclosed parasporal inclusion was produced only when the plasmid of 98 MDa was present. In addition, transfer of the 98 -MDa plasmid to Bacillus cereus resulted in transcipients that produced small inclusions enclosed within the exosporium, and the protein extracted from these inclusions reacted with antibody specific for enclosed inclusion protein of B. thuringiensis subsp. finitimus.

40|$|The {{sex of the}} {{gametophyte}} of the homosporous fern Ceratopteris richardii (Brongn.) {{is determined}} by the pheromone antheridiogen (ACE). Wild-type spores germinating {{in the absence of the}} pheromone will develop into hermaphroditic gametophytes, whereas spores continuously exposed to the pheromone will develop as males. The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is able to inhibit the antheridiogen response, causing wild-type gametophytes to develop as small hermaphroditic gametophytes with reduced cell size in the presence ACE. The abscisic acid-resistant (abr) mutants abr 1 and abr 2 have been previously characterized. Twelve additional mutants were isolated in this study. Five of these mutants were characterized, along with abr 1 and abr 2. The abr mutants develop as males in the presence of ACE and 10 μM ABA. Linkage analysis shows that the seven mutations comprise at least four loci: abr 1, 4, and 5; abr 2; abr 3 and 6; and abr 7. The abr mutants of Ceratopteris do not have impaired stomatal regulation, cold tolerance, germination, or altered response to sugars, phenotypes associated with ABA resistance in Arabidopsis. Tests of epistasis suggest a role for ABA and the ABR genes in inhibiting antheridium formation by inhibiting the repression of the TRA genes by ACE and the HER genes in the developing gametophyte. In a separate study, the feasibility of using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) to construct a framework map of the Ceratopteris genome for use in cloning genes of Ceratopteris was examined. 150 polymorphic markers were detected between the Hnn and N 8 strains of Ceratopteris. Chi-square analysis revealed segregation distortion in 75 % of the markers scored in 71 individuals from one mapping population, and in 80 % of the markers scored in 118 individuals from a second mapping population, indicating that AFLP markers can not be used to construct a map at this time. Two of eight her loci tested for segregation in her (Hnn) × N 8 hybrids also exhibited segregation distortion, indicating that the observed segregation distortion is not limited to AFLP markers.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{existence}} of a small open reading frame (usd) that is located between the promoter and coding sequence for the sporulation gene spoIIID in Bacillus subtilis. The mRNA from the usd-spoIIID operon contains an inverted repeat sequence that is predicted to form a stem-loop structure that would sequester the ribosome binding site for spoIIID. A mutation eliminating the ribosome binding site for the upstream open reading frame caused an oligosporogenous phenotype and interfered with the translation, but not the transcription, of the downstream gene spoIIID. We propose that efficient synthesis of SpoIIID requires that the putative stem-loop structure be disrupted by translation through the upstream open reading frame.

40|$|Sporogenesis and spores of Equisetum bogotense (Equisetaceae) from {{mountain}} areas of Colombia. Studies on some reproductive traits in Equisetum species are scarce and valuable to understand species distribution. Therefore, a {{detailed study of}} the sporogenesis process and spore development in E. bogotense is presented, with {{an analysis of the}} main events during meiosis, maturation of spores, spore wall ultrastructure, orbicules and elaters. Specimens were collected from 500 to 4 500 m in Cauca, Colombia. Strobili at different maturation stages were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in resin, and ultra-microtome obtained sections were stained with Toluidine blue. Observations were made with optical microscopy with differential interference contrast illumination technique (DIC), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM). Ultrathin sections (70 - 80 μm) for TEM observations were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate; while samples for SEM observations, were fixed, dehydrated in 2. 2 -dimethoxypropane and dried at critical point as in standard methods. Strobili have numerous mature sporangiophores, each one with a peltate structure, the scutellum, bearing five-six sessile sporangia attached to the axis of strobilus by the manubrium. Immature sporocytes (<b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells)</b> are tightly packed within the young sporangia. The sporocytes quickly undergo meiosis, by passing the stage of archesporium and give origin to tetrads of spores. The tapetum loses histological integrity during early stages of sporogenesis, intrudes as a plasmodial mass into the cavity of the sporangium, partially surrounding premeiotic sporocytes, and then, tetrads and adult spores. The tapetum disintegrates {{towards the end of the}} sporogenesis, leaving spores free within the sporangial cavity. Spores present several cytological changes that allow them to achieve greater size and increase the number of plastids, before reaching the adult stage. Sporoderm includes three layers external to the cytoplasmic membrane of the spore cell, and they are pseudoendospore, exospore and perispore. Viewed with SEM, the exospore is smooth to rugulate, with micro perforations, while the perispore is muriform, rugate, with narrow, delicate, discontinuous, randomly distributed folds delimiting incomplete, irregular areolae, externally covered by of different size, densely distributed orbicules. These orbicules are also found all over the external face and margins of the elaters, while the internal face is smooth and lack orbicules. Viewed with TEM, the exospore is a thick layer of fine granular material, while perispore is a thinner layer of dense, separate orbicules. The elaters are composed by two layers of fibrillar material: an inner layer with longitudinally oriented fibrils and an outer, thicker and less dense layer with fibrils transversely fibrils and abundant, external orbicules. It is suggested that the processes of ontogeny and characters of the sporoderm are relatively constant in Equisetum; however, sporogenesis in E. bogotense is synchronous and this condition has been observed so far only in E. giganteum, a tropical genus also found in Colombia.

40|$|In {{response}} to unfavorable environmental {{conditions such as}} nutrient starvation, the gram positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis enters into a developmental pathway known as sporulation. Shortly following the commitment to sporulation, B. subtilis divides asymmetrically, dividing the cell into two compartments, a smaller forespore (the future spore) and a larger <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> Subsequently, {{in a process that}} resembles eukaryotic phagocytosis, known as engulfment, the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> membranes migrate up and around the forespore. The completion of engulfment is marked by the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> membranes fusing at the forespore pole, releasing the immature <b>spore</b> into the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> cytoplasm where further spore maturation takes place. Three <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> expressed proteins, SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP have been shown to mediate both the early step of engulfment, septal thinning and subsequent membrane migration. Research presented in this dissertation addresses how SpoIID, SpoIIM and SpoIIP are targeted to the sporulation septum, and in particular, the role of SpoIID during engulfment. My studies of the engulfment proteins led to the discovery of two pathways that are involved in targeting SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP (DMP) to the septum. Normally, SpoIID, SpoIIM, and SpoIIP localize to the septum in a SpoIIB-dependent manner. However, in the absence of SpoIIB, cells were able to complete engulfment, albeit at a slower rate than wild type. This suggested the presence of a secondary, SpoIIB- independent pathway for targeting the DMP complex to the septum. In fact, my studies showed that a secondary, compensatory targeting pathway does exist, and is mediated by the SpoIIQ-SpoIIIAH (Q-AH) zipper via the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> expressed proteins SpoIVFA and SpoIVFB. Thus, the Q-AH zipper not only provides a compensatory mechanism for membrane migration during engulfment when DMP activity is reduced, but also indirectly mediates a compensatory septal localization pathway for DMP when its primary targeting pathway is disrupted. My research also demonstrated that SpoIID functions as a peptidoglycan hydrolase. Site directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acids within SpoIID has led to the identification of residues important for the proteins enzymatic activity as well as its function in vivo. I have thereby demonstrated that the peptidoglycan hydrolase activity of SpoIID is required during engulfment, and have found mutations which suggest that SpoIID also functions later in sporulation, as they block spore formation but not membrane migration. In collaboration with the Popham lab at Virginia Tech, we have determined that SpoIID acts as an endopeptidase capable of cleaving the peptide cross-bridges that link adjoining glycan strands. These studies, in total, have added to our mechanistic knowledge of engulfment by further characterizing the biochemical activity of SpoIID and correlating its in vitro activities with its function in viv...|$|R

Vistos con TEM, el exosporio es una capa de material granular fino y el perisporio, una capa mucho más delgada con orbículas discretas. Los eláteres están formados por dos capas de naturaleza fibrilar, orientadas longitudinalmente y transversalmente. La esporogénesis en E. bogotense es sincrónica, similar a la de E. giganteum, otra especie de distribución tropical que también crece en Colombia. Studies on some reproductive {{traits in}} Equisetum species are scarce and valuable to understand species distribution. Therefore, a {{detailed study of}} the sporogenesis process and spore development in E. bogotense is presented, with {{an analysis of the}} main events during meiosis, maturation of spores, spore wall ultrastructure, orbicules and elaters. Specimens were collected from 500 to 4 500 m in Cauca, Colombia. Strobili at different maturation stages were fixed, dehydrated, embedded in resin, and ultra-microtome obtained sections were stained with Toluidine blue. Observations were made with optical microscopy with differential interference contrast illumination technique (DIC), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM). Ultrathin sections (70 - 80 μm) for TEM observations were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate; while samples for SEM observations, were fixed, dehydrated in 2. 2 -dimethoxypropane and dried at critical point as in standard methods. Strobili have numerous mature sporangiophores, each one with a peltate structure, the scutellum, bearing five-six sessile sporangia attached to the axis of strobilus by the manubrium. Immature sporocytes (<b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells)</b> are tightly packed within the young sporangia. The sporocytes quickly undergo meiosis, by passing the stage of archesporium and give origin to tetrads of spores. The tapetum loses histological integrity during early stages of sporogenesis, intrudes as a plasmodial mass into the cavity of the sporangium, partially surrounding premeiotic sporocytes, and then, tetrads and adult spores. The tapetum disintegrates {{towards the end of the}} sporogenesis, leaving spores free within the sporangial cavity. Spores present several cytological changes that allow them to achieve greater size and increase the number of plastids, before reaching the adult stage. Sporoderm includes three layers external to the cytoplasmic membrane of the spore cell, and they are pseudoendospore, exospore and perispore. Viewed with SEM, the exospore is smooth to rugulate, with micro perforations, while the perispore is muriform, rugate, with narrow, delicate, discontinuous, randomly distributed folds delimiting incomplete, irregular areolae, externally covered by of different size, densely distributed orbicules. These orbicules are also found all over the external face and margins of the elaters, while the internal face is smooth and lack orbicules. Viewed with TEM, the exospore is a thick layer of fine granular material, while perispore is a thinner layer of dense, separate orbicules. The elaters are composed by two layers of fibrillar material: an inner layer with longitudinally oriented fibrils and an outer, thicker and less dense layer with fibrils transversely fibrils and abundant, external orbicules. It is suggested that the processes of ontogeny and characters of the sporoderm are relatively constant in Equisetum; however, sporogenesis in E. bogotense is synchronous and this condition has been observed so far only in E. giganteum, a tropical genus also found in Colombia...|$|R
40|$|Two {{species of}} the {{familiar}} goat's beard or salsify genus Tragopogon were studied to determine the role and significance of interspecific hybridization in speciation within the genus. Field observations indicate the common occurrence of interspecific hybrids between T. pratensis, a yellow-flowered species and T. porrifolius, a species with purple flowers. The occurrence of Tragopogon interspecific hybrids could allow for {{one or more of}} the following three evolutionary developments to take-place: 1) the hybrids could develop into a new species via allopolyploidy; 2) introgressive hybridization could modify the two parental gene pools; and/or 3) a hybrid swarm having no evolutionary significance could be formed. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether interspecific hybridization between T. pratensis and T. porrifolius is of major significance in the evolution of genus Tragopogon. Of the four basic criteria (isolation, time, mutation and adaptation) required to produce evolutionary change, the presence or absence of isolation is the focus of the present investigation. Five evidences of isolation were studied: (1) A comparison was made for the three Tragopogon taxa between the incidence of seed germination when inflorescences were covered prior to anthesis versus when they were left uncovered. (2) Pollen viability counts were made to determine the incidence of viable microspores produced by plants of the three taxa. (3) Cytologic studies of microsporogenesis in the two parental species and their interspecific hybrid were made to compare chromosome homologies by determining whether synapsis was regular in the <b>spore</b> <b>mother</b> <b>cells.</b> (4) Paper chromatographic analysis of amino acids and secondary substances (flavonoids) was performed to see if chemical similarities and dissimilarities exist among the Tragopogon taxa studied. (5) Finally, insect pollinators which frequent the three Tragopogon taxa were collected and identified to investigate whether there is a commonality of insects visiting the Tragopogon flowers. The data indicate that the three taxa have a lower seed set and lower germination rate when the flower heads are covered prior to opening than when the flower heads are left undisturbed so that open pollination occurs. The results from seed germination rates indicate that the seeds derived from open pollinated inflorescences sprouted more quickly than did seeds from flowers which were bagged prior to anthesis. The pollen viability studies indicate that T. porrifolius had the highest level of pollen viability [...] 94 %; T. pratensis ranked second with 90 % viable pollen; and the hybrid had the least viable pollen [...] 19 %. Microscopic examination of PMC's undergoing meiosis to produce microspores reveals a somatic chromosome count of 2 n = 12 for each of the three taxa studied. Synapsis during prophase appears normal in both the parental species and the interspecific hybrids. Single dimensional paper chromatography reveals a chemical similarity between T. pratensis and the hybrid for the amino acid distributions. T. porrifolius displayed a dissimilar amino acid pattern when compared with the other two taxa. Two dimensional paper chromatograms of secondary substances indicate that the Tragopogon interspecific hybrids contained a blend of the flavonoids which were found in the two parental species. Many insects are found feeding or resting upon the inflorescences of the three taxa. Most of the insects are dipterans of the family Syrphidae. Many of the same insect genera are found on the flowers of the three Tragopogon taxa. Evidence from the current study does not suggest that a new Tragopogon species has formed or is forming. Before a diploid interspecific hybrid could diverge, genetically, from its parental ties there must be reproductive isolation coupled with hybrid fertility. These two criteria were not met; no fertile allotetraploid hybrid derivatives were identified. So, a Tragopogon micton or alloploidion is not forming. The two parental Tragopogon species are homogameons. There is no indication of introgression taking place. The highly infertile F 1 interspecific hybrids do not appear to be cross-pollinating with the two parental species. This lack of introgression may be explained by the low incidence of viable pollen grains from the hybrid plants within the populations. Many highly sterile interspecific Tragopogon hybrids are formed year after year and there is no indication of genetic mingling with the parental populations. This situation indicates that a hybrid swarm is present which has no evolutionary significance. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R

Immediately after division, the transcription factor σF becomes {{active in the}} smaller prespore, followed by activation of σE in the larger <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> We recently showed that a delay in σE activation resulted in the novel phenotype of two spores (twins) forming within the same <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> <b>Mother</b> <b>cells</b> bearing twins are substantially longer than <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> with single <b>spores.</b> Here we explore the regulation of the growth and DNA replication of the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> We find that length correlates with chromosome number in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> We show that replication and growth could occur after asymmetric division in <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> with no active σE. In contrast, when σE was active, replication and growth ceased. In growing <b>mother</b> <b>cells,</b> with no active σE, Spo 0 A-directed transcription levels remained low.

40|$|Epulopiscium sp. type B, {{a member}} of the Firmicutes, is a large (up to 300 μm), cigar-shaped {{bacterial}} symbiont of surgeonfish that propagates itself by forming multiple intracellular offspring. This unusual form of reproduction is an apparent modification of a developmental program used by some Firmicutes to produce an endospore. At the onset of offspring formation, the Epulopiscium cell divides at both poles. The polar cells are engulfed by the larger <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> and grow within the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> At the final stages of development, the Epulopiscium <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> lyses. Here we describe changes in Epulopiscium cell structure, focusing on <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> DNA replication and cell death. DNA replication was examined by labeling cells with the nucleotide analog bromodeoxyuridine. As expected, DNA replication occurs in the developing offspring. However, well after passage of genetic information from parent to offspring is complete, DNA within the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> continues to replicate. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that {{near the end of the}} offspring growth cycle, <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> DNA disintegrates. The <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> membrane and wall deteriorate as well. DNA replication within this terminally differentiated cell indicates the importance of <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> nucleoids in cell maintenance and the development of offspring. The synchronized timing of <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> deterioration within a population suggests that the Epulopiscium <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> undergoes a programmed cell death.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the antigenic structures of the morphologically distinct cells of the Coxiella burnetii developmental cycle. Postembedding immunoelectron microscopy with polyclonal antibodies produced in rabbits to (i) phase I cells, (ii) a chloroform-methanol residue fraction of cells, (iii) the cell walls (CW) of large and small cells and small dense cells (SDC), and (iv) the peptidoglycan-protein complexes of small cells and SDC labelled the continuum of morphologically distinct cells. But these antibodies did not distinguish between the antigenic structures of the various cells. Monoclonal antibodies to the phase I lipopolysaccharide labelled the CW of a majority of the smaller cells, but there was diminished reactivity to the larger cells. Although monoclonal antibodies to a 29. 5 -kDa outer membrane protein labelled the CW of the large <b>mother</b> <b>cells,</b> the large cells, and the small cells, a minority of the SDC with compact CW were not labelled. The endogenous <b>spore</b> within the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> was not labelled by the polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies to cellular components. A selected population of SDC was prepared by osmotic lysis of large cells, differential centrifugation, Renografin step-gradient fractionation, and breakage of the small cells in a French press at 20, 000 lb/in 2. The pressure-resistant SDC collected as fraction CL did not contain the 29. 5 -kDa protein, as evidenced by the lack of (i) Coomassie brilliant blue staining of protein in the 29. 5 -kDa region of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and (ii) reactivity of the 29. 5 -kDa protein antigenic epitopes in immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies to the protein. In contrast, CW of the pressure-sensitive small cells contained the 29. 5 -kDa protein. Therefore, the observed ultrastructural differences between large and small cells and SDC reflect differences in sensitivity to breakage by pressure treatment and in cell-associated antigens. Although the process of differentiation in C. burnetii remains an enigma, we have taken steps toward identifying cellular antigens as markers of differentiation. The pressure-resistant SDC in fraction CL that are devoid of the 29. 5 -kDa protein may be useful for answering questions about the physiological events required for triggering outgrowth and sequential regulation of the Coxiella developmental cycle...|$|R

Using single budding yeast <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> analyses we found that, even early after telomerase inactivation (ETI), yeast <b>mother</b> <b>cells</b> show transient DNA damage response (DDR) episodes, stochastically altered cell-cycle dynamics, and accelerated <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> aging. The acceleration of ETI <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> aging was not explained by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), Sir protein perturbation, or deprotected telomeres. ETI phenotypes occurred well before the population senescence caused late after telomerase inactivation (LTI). They were morphologically distinct from LTI senescence, were genetically uncoupled from telomere length, and were rescued by elevating dNTP pools.

40|$|During {{formation}} of spores by Bacillus subtilis the RNA polymerase factor σG ordinarily becomes active during spore formation {{exclusively in the}} prespore upon completion of engulfment of the prespore by the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> Formation and activation of σG ordinarily requires prior activity of σF in the prespore and σE in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> Here we report that in spoIIA mutants lacking both σF and the anti-sigma factor SpoIIAB and in which σE is not active, σG nevertheless becomes active. Further, its activity is largely confined to the <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> Thus, there is a switch in the location of σG activity from prespore to <b>mother</b> <b>cell.</b> Factors contributing to the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> location are inferred to be read-through of spoIIIG, the structural gene for σG, from the upstream spoIIG locus {{and the absence of}} SpoIIAB, which can act in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> as an anti-sigma factor to σG. When the spoIIIG locus was moved away from spoIIG to the distal amyE locus, σG became active earlier in sporulation in spoIIA deletion mutants, and the sporulation septum was not formed, suggesting that premature σG activation can block septum formation. We report a previously unrecognized control in which SpoIIGA can prevent the appearance of σG activity, and pro-σE (but not σE) can counteract this effect of SpoIIGA. We find that in strains lacking σF and SpoIIAB and engineered to produce active σE in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell</b> without the need for SpoIIGA, σG also becomes active in the <b>mother</b> <b>cell...</b>|$|R
