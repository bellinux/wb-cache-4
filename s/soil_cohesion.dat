40|$|The {{infinite}} {{slope method}} {{is widely used}} as the geotechnical component of geomorphic and landscape evolution models. Its assumption that shallow landslides are infinitely long (in a downslope direction) is usually considered valid for natural landslides {{on the basis that}} they are generally long relative to their depth. However, this is rarely justified, because the critical length/depth (L/H) ratio below which edge effects become important is unknown. We establish this critical L/H ratio by benchmarking infinite slope stability predictions against finite element predictions for a set of synthetic two-dimensional slopes, assuming that the difference between the predictions is due to error in the infinite slope method. We test the infinite slope method for six different L/H ratios to find the critical ratio at which its predictions fall within 5 % of those from the finite element method. We repeat these tests for 5000 synthetic slopes with a range of failure plane depths, pore water pressures, friction angles, <b>soil</b> <b>cohesions,</b> <b>soil</b> unit weights and slope angles characteristic of natural slopes. We find that: (1) infinite slope stability predictions are consistently too conservative for small L/H ratios; (2) the predictions always converge to within 5 % of the finite element benchmarks by a L/H ratio of 25 (i. e. the infinite slope assumption is reasonable for landslides 25 times longer than they are deep); but (3) they can converge at much lower ratios depending on slope properties, particularly for low <b>cohesion</b> <b>soils.</b> The implication for catchment scale stability models is that the infinite length assumption is reasonable if their grid resolution is coarse (e. g. > 25 ?m). However, it may also be valid even at much finer grid resolutions (e. g. 1 ?m), because spatial organization in the predicted pore water pressure field reduces the probability of short landslides and minimizes the risk that predicted landslides will have L/H ratios less than 25.

5000|$|The {{application}} {{of the principles of}} mechanics to soils was documented as early as 1773 when Charles Coulomb (a physicist, engineer, and army Captain) developed improved methods to determine the earth pressures against military ramparts. Coulomb observed that, at failure, a distinct slip plane would form behind a sliding retaining wall and he suggested that the maximum shear stress on the slip plane, for design purposes, was the sum of the <b>soil</b> <b>cohesion,</b> , and friction [...] , where [...] is the normal stress on the slip plane and [...] is the friction angle of the soil. By combining Coulomb's theory with Christian Otto Mohr's 2D stress state, the theory became known as Mohr-Coulomb theory.

50|$|Water can {{increase}} or decrease the stability of a slope depending on the amount present. Small amounts of water can strengthen soils because the surface tension of water increases <b>soil</b> <b>cohesion.</b> This allows the soil to resist erosion better than if it were dry. If too much water is present the water may act to increase the pore pressure, reducing friction, and accelerating the erosion process and resulting in different types of mass wasting (i.e. mudflows, landslides, etc.). A {{good example of this}} is to think of a sand castle. Water must be mixed with sand in order for the castle to keep its shape. If too much water is added the sand washes away, if not enough water is added the sand falls and cannot keep its shape. Water also increases the mass of the soil, this is important because an increase in mass means that there will be an increase in velocity if mass wasting is triggered.|$|E

We have simulated 3 D direct shear tests using the standard implicit Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Discrete Element Method (DEM), aiming to (i) evaluate the RR models and (ii) compare the two numerical approaches. Methods In homogeneous <b>soil</b> with low <b>cohesion,</b> 36 straight, non-branched and thin root models were implanted in three parallel lines. Root traits, including orientation relative to the shear direction (45 °, 90 ° and ? 45 °), longitudinal modulus of elasticity (10 MPa and 100 MPa), and bending and compressive behaviours (beam, truss and cable) were investigated. Results Compared to the FEM, the DEM achieved consistent results and avoided convergence problems, but required longer computation time and used parameters potentially difficult to identify. Root reinforcement did not occur until significant plastic deformation of soil. The RR values estimated by the shear tests were much lower than those estimated by the usual RR models and were significantly dependent upon root traits. Conclusions Ignoring the effect of root traits in RR models might lead to an important bias when using slope stability models. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

In our paper we summarize the most important methods which {{can be applied to}} compute the towed force in tire-soil interface situations. We have carried out many in situ soil shearing tests with different soil moisture contents and in different soil depressions. We conducted the soil shearing test before and after the vehicle movement, which means there are different soil compactions.

40|$|As organic root exudates cause soil {{particles}} to adhere firmly to root surfaces, roots significantly increase soil strength and therefore {{also increase the}} resistance of the topsoil to erosion by concentrated flow. This paper aims at contributing to a better prediction of the root effects on soil erosion rates in the EUROSEM model, as the input values accounting for roots, presented in the user manual, do not account for differences in root density or root architecture. Recent research indicates that small changes in root density or differences in root architecture considerably influence soil erosion rates during concentrated flow. The approach for incorporating the root effects into this model is based on a comparison of measured soil detachment rates for bare and for root-permeated topsoil samples with predicted erosion rates under the same flow conditions using the erosion equation of EUROSEM. Through backwards calculation, transport capacity efficiencies and corresponding <b>soil</b> <b>cohesion</b> values can be assessed for bare and root-permeated topsoils respectively. The results are promising and present <b>soil</b> <b>cohesion</b> values that are in accordance with reported values in the literature for the same soil type (silt loam). The results show that grass roots provide a larger increase in <b>soil</b> <b>cohesion</b> as compared with tap-rooted species and that the increase in <b>soil</b> <b>cohesion</b> is not significantly different under wet and dry soil conditions, either for fibrous root systems or for tap root systems. Power and exponential relationships are established between measured root density values and the corresponding calculated <b>soil</b> <b>cohesion</b> values, reflecting the effects of roots on {{the resistance of the}} topsoil to concentrated flow incision. These relationships enable one to incorporate the root effect into the soil erosion model EUROSEM, through adapting the <b>soil</b> <b>cohesion</b> input value.

In this paper the development of a three dimensional (3 D) discrete element model (DEM) for the simulation of the soil–cone penetrometer interaction in a slightly cohesive loamy sand soil is presented. The aim was to investigate the effects of the soil model’s geometrical (e. g., soil model cross section shape and size and model’s height) changes on variations in the soil penetration resistance. The model area ratio and height ratio values were adopted to analyse the effects of the cross section size and the model’s height, respectively. The results of penetration resistance of the DEM simulations were compared with the in-situ measurement with a cone penetrometer of the same geometry. This comparison allowed the derivation of the contact properties between the elements. To simulate the soil material the so-called Parallel Bond and Linear Models were used in the 3 D version of the Particle Flow Code (PFC) software. Finally the mechanical properties of the <b>soil,</b> namely the <b>cohesion</b> and internal friction angle were estimated by DEM simulation of direct shear box.

In the present study, we develop a complementary module to our large-scale slope stability assessment tool {{to take into account the}} effects of vegetation on the mechanical <b>soil</b> properties (<b>cohesion</b> and over-load), but also on the slope hydrol-ogy (change in interceptions, run-off, and infiltration). Hence the proposed meth-od combines a mechanical stability model (using finite slope analysis), a hydro-logical model, and a vegetation module which interfere with both aspects. All these elements are interfaced within a GIS-based solution. Uncertainties on input data are propagated in the models through distributions laws. The method has first been applied to a Pyrenean Valley, a site which is part of the Observatoire Pyré-néen du Changement Climatique (OPCC). A second application is being under-taken on another Pyrenean Valley, for the ANR Project SAMCO...|$|R
