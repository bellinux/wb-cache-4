25|$|A written {{document}} that addresses a student's specific individual needs. It may specify accommodations, materials, or classroom instruction. IEPs are often created {{for students with}} disabilities, who are {{required by law to}} have an IEP when appropriate. Most states are not required to have IEPs for students who are only identified as gifted. Some students may be intellectually gifted in addition to having learning and/or attentional disabilities, and may have an IEP that includes, for instance, enrichment activities as a means of alleviating boredom or frustration, or as a reward for on-task behavior. In order to warrant such an IEP, a <b>student</b> <b>needs</b> to be diagnosed with a separate emotional or learning disability that is not simply the result of being unchallenged in a typical classroom. These are also known as Individual Program Plans, or IPPs.|$|E
25|$|Bermudian Springs School District {{engages in}} {{identification}} procedures {{to ensure that}} eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet <b>student</b> <b>needs.</b> At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening {{results suggest that the}} student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation.

30|$|Cubric and Tosic (2017) built a {{question}} generator which used the ontology-based generation strategies defined by Papasalouros. However, they extended the property-based strategies {{to include more}} sub-strategies, which used the annotation properties in the ontology. Moreover, instead of using Papasalouros’s stem template, which {{is not related to}} an educational theory, Cubric and Tosic defined a set of stem templates, which aimed to assess student cognition at different levels in the Bloom’s taxonomy, which is widely used in the educational research (BS 1956; Krathwohl 2002; Anderson and Sosniak 1994). Bloom’s taxonomy categorise the assessment questions into the following six major levels, which are arranged in a hierarchical order according to the complexity of the cognitive process involved (BS 1956; Krathwohl 2002; Assessment 2002): 1) Knowledge: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> only to recall certain concepts in the domain. For example <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to list, define, and describe specific concepts in the domain without understanding how they are related to other concepts. 2) Comprehension: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to start thinking about the meaning of the concepts in terms of their relationship with other concepts in the domain. 3) Application: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to demonstrate their ability to use the concepts they have learned in real situations. For example the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to provide and show examples that prove their understanding of the domain concepts. 4) Analysis: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to understand the domain terminology structure. For example the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to have a good overview of the concepts in the domain by analysing how they are classified and related to each other. 5) Synthesis: at this level the students should be able to relate concepts from different domains to create and develop new ideas. 6) Evaluation: at this level the <b>students</b> <b>need</b> to make judgments, assess and compare ideas and evaluate the data.|$|R

500|$|Another {{legislative}} package {{was introduced by}} State Senators Armistead Boothe and Ted Dalton. The Boothe-Dalton plan was less ambitious in scope. It proposed a plan in which: 1) Student school assignments would be made on factors other than race; 2) Parents unhappy with their child's school assignment would have access to an administrative appeals system; and 3) Teachers could transfer schools only as conditions warranted. The key element of the Boothe-Dalton plan was in how it differed from the Gray Commission student assignment plan. The Gray Commission plan assigned students {{on the basis of}} student welfare, availability of facilities and transportation, health, and aptitude, whereas the Boothe-Dalton plan expanded the list of factors to include school attendance areas, academic background, student personality, and <b>student</b> <b>needs.</b> Additionally, the Boothe-Dalton plan provided for an administrative appeal process, which the Gray Commission plan did not. It also identified a very specific, time-consuming process for assignment appeals (to the local school board, the state board of education, state circuit courts, state supreme court, and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court). Finally, it contained a [...] "local option" [...] that would allow racial integration in public schools [...] "where localities are ready" [...] (according to Boothe).|$|E
