50|$|Sonor drums {{have several}} design features, {{including}} undersized shells (a similar concept to a violin bridge - {{designed to enhance}} response), and tension rods that are round and feature a slot instead of the traditional square style (though recently Sonor made square heads standard, with slotted heads available as an option). Recently, Sonor re-introduced the designer X-Ray Acrylic drums, {{the first time in}} 20 years Sonor offered acrylic drums. These shells are made from <b>seamless,</b> <b>extruded</b> acrylic and feature acrylic hoops.|$|E
5000|$|Pearl created several drum products, such as shells in the 1970s {{that were}} made of wood with a fiber-glass lining. There was also a shell made of a {{composite}} called [...] "Phenolic." [...] Additionally, Pearl combined roto-toms and these Phenolic shells to create the Vari-Pitch line of drums. Other early innovations included shells that were slightly undersized, so that the drum head would extend over the edges, much like a gong drum. Pearl manufactured <b>seamless,</b> <b>extruded</b> acrylic shells that were different from the tabbed-and-seamed Vistalite shells used by Ludwig. Pearl also developed the hinged tube tom-arm, a design widely copied by many other drum manufacturers.|$|E
