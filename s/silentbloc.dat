5000|$|Reynosa, Tamaulipas - Products: bushing <b>silentbloc,</b> bonded products, Clevebloc products, STA Bars, {{control arm}} links, engine mounts ...|$|E
50|$|For 1930 a {{stronger}} frame was provided together with longer springs employing <b>Silentbloc</b> spring shackles and improved brakes.|$|E
50|$|Dampers were {{mounted to}} the chassis and axle through <b>Silentbloc</b> bushes at each end. <b>Silentbloc</b> bushes were another {{development}} of the early 1930s, a vulcanised rubber bush bonded into a steel tube. These provided the stiff location that accurate suspension required, but reduced vibration and road noise, compared to earlier cars. Many cars used a different design for front and rear, where the rear arms were rigidly bolted to the chassis, rather than with a swivelling bush.|$|E
5000|$|The frames were {{initially}} available with AMC and Norton telescopic front forks and British Hub Co. (Motoloy) brakes front and rear. The pivoting rear-forks on all models were fitted with <b>Silentbloc</b> bushes. A later option was Metal Profiles (REH) front forks.|$|E
50|$|Theodore Bernard André, from Essex, {{took over}} the UK {{dealership}} in 1909. He was also involved {{in the manufacture of}} <b>Silentbloc</b> rubber bushed bearings; Hartford shock absorbers; Len Brake Co brake shoes; the Marlborough-Thomas from 1923-24; plus the André car between 1933 and 1934.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cabin is}} rounder than the SBB Am841 {{from which it}} is derived. It has 2 full control desks and is {{equipped}} with air-conditioning. Bogies {{are the same as}} its predecessors and have primary (coil springs with <b>Silentbloc,</b> plus vertical shock absorbers) and secondary ("Sandwich" [...] blocs) suspension. There are two traction motors per bogie powered by IGBT based electronics. Brake equipment only consists of wheel brakes which are equipped with plastic brake pads.|$|E
50|$|The {{bodies were}} mounted on an updated pre-war Alvis 12/70 chassis that was widened and {{lengthened}} but retained the rigid-axle leaf spring suspension. Employing <b>Silentbloc</b> bushes (except {{at the front}} of the front springs to maintain steering precision) it is controlled by double acting Armstrong hydraulic dampers. Hypoid bevel final drive was fitted for the first time and greatly reduced the height of the transmission tunnel. Steering is by Marles with a spring spoked steering wheel. Mechanically operated brakes are two-leading-shoe type by Girling. Disc wheels replaced the 12/70's wire wheels and are fitted with larger tyres.|$|E
50|$|This 7-seater {{limousine}} {{has four}} good doors and six side windows. Front seat is fixed as is unfortunately the windscreen but {{the screen is}} large and gives a good view. The back seat has three armrests. The occasional seats fold away neatly, give enough support to the back and knee and toe room is well arranged. Equipment includes such fittings as: two interior lights, five blinds, parcel net and ventilator in the roof, bag pockets on the doors. Upholstery in the rear is cord and in front is leather. There is a large cupboard {{to the left of}} the instruments. An amplifying telephone (to the driver) is provided. The gear lever has a catch for reverse and a quiet-second together with syncro-mesh is provided. There are just the four brakes which are applied by rods and cables by hand lever or by pedal. The half-elliptical springs have <b>Silentbloc</b> shackle bushes and zinc interleaves and are damped by hydraulic shock absorbers. Price £575.|$|E
50|$|After the Rolls-Royce {{take over}} of Bentley in 1931 Rolls-Royce took {{a stake in}} Park Ward. Beginning in 1933 when they {{obtained}} patents Park Ward developed a technically interesting all-steel saloon in conjunction with Rolls-Royce and from 1936 offered it on the 4¼-litre Bentley chassis. These bodies were supported by <b>Silentbloc</b> rubber bushes to reduce road-shock engine-noise and vibration. The cars were produced in small batches giving quite noticeable economies in manufacture with a consequent reduction in selling price. By 1937 as many as ten cars a week were passing through Park Ward's works and in 1939 Rolls-Royce completed its acquisition of the business. After World War II, Park Ward continued to produce special coachwork and the all-steel technology was used by Rolls-Royce to produce a standard body range on its cars starting with the Bentley Mark VI. Twenty years later Park Ward was merged with H. J. Mulliner & Co. in 1961 to form Mulliner Park Ward. Mulliner Park Ward operations were centralized in the former Park Ward factory in Willesden.|$|E
