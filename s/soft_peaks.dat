5000|$|The cake has a {{reputation}} as being difficult to make, but this is no longer as true as it once was. When the recipe originated, there were no stand mixers, nor electric hand mixers, and even hand-crank eggbeaters were not universally available, which meant a lot of hard labor beating egg whites to frothy <b>soft</b> <b>peaks.</b> The wood-fired ovens of the time had no thermostats, making it difficult to produce a white cake. The pecans, raisins and coconut had to be chopped by hand or, more often, put through a meat grinder. [...] The filling ingredients can be chopped in an electric food processor today. Modern refrigeration also makes it easier to produce a stiff filling, allowing one to build an orderly multi-layer cake, rather than a sticky, lopsided dessert. Even with modern conveniences, making a traditional Lane cake is still quite a task to undertake. It is still a special cake, best made several days in advance of an important family event, so the flavors have time to mingle. During the war, Lane cakes were a favorite among service men lucky enough to receive one for Christmas.

The peak flux correlates with the time-averaged peak energy in both classes of bursts. The peak energy evolution, {{as a function}} of time, tracks the evolution of the flux on short timescales in both short and long GRBs. We do not find evidence of an hard-to-soft spectral evolution.

We find that the rest frame Ep of long bursts can be as high or even larger than that of short GRBs and that short and long GRBs follow the same Ep-Liso correlation, {{despite the fact that they}} likely have different progenitors.

The source was detected with a flux of ~ 4 x 10 ^(- 9) erg cm^(- 2) s^(- 1) (in 0. 1 - 120 keV range). The broadband spectrum, typical for accreting pulsars, is well described by a cutoff power law with a cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) at ~ 38 keV. This value is consistent with earlier reports based on the observations with Suzaku at factor of ten lower luminosity, which implies that the feature is formed close to the neutron star surface {{rather than in the}} accretion column. Pulsations with P ~ 15. 82 s were observed up to ~ 70 keV. The pulse profile strongly depends on energy and is characterised by a "soft" and a "hard" peaks shifted by half period, which suggests a strong phase dependence of the spectrum, and that two components with roughly orthogonal beam patterns are responsible for the observed pulse shape. This conclusion is supported {{by the fact that the}} CRSF, despite its relatively high energy, is only detected in the spectrum of the <b>soft</b> <b>peak</b> of the pulse profile. Along with the absence of correlation of the line energy with luminosity, this could be explained in the framework of the recently proposed "reflection" model for CRSF formation.

The outer portions suffer a thermal limit-cycle instability owing to partial ionization of hydrogen and helium, thereby modulating mass flow into the inner portions. In order to produce weak X-rays during the quiescence, however, the instability should be suppressed in the inner portions, probably due to small optical depths. Instead, the inner portions undergo forced bimodal transitions between the optically thick and thin branches in response to variable mass input from the outer portions. The inner part is on the optically thin, advection-dominated branch in the quiescence and rise phases, thus producing hard power-law radiation, while {{it is on the}} optically thick branch in the early decay phase, predominantly emitting soft radiation.

The same techniques described by Emslie et al. (JGR, 109, A 10104, 2004) are used to take the RHESSI imaging spectroscopic observations and compute the energies in the thermal plasma and in the nonthermal electrons {{as a function of}} time throughout the flares. Radiative and conductive cooling rates are estimated and total thermal and nonthermal energies are computed for each flare. Typically, the energy in nonthermal electrons integrated up to the time of <b>peak</b> <b>soft</b> X-ray emission is equal to or exceeds the energy in the thermal plasma at that time. This suggests that energy must have been converted into a form not visible with RHESSI and that the total energy released by the flares may be significantly greater than the sum of energies calculated from the RHESSI observations alone.

The hard X-ray fluences for these 19 events correlate with the <b>soft</b> X-ray <b>peak</b> fluxes, implying strong non-thermal particle acceleration even for these relatively slow energy-release rates.

40|$|Two {{different}} luminosity indicators {{have been}} recently proposed for Gamma Ray Bursts {{that use the}} lag between light curve peaks with hard and soft photons {{as well as the}} variability (’spikiness’) of the burst light curve. Schaefer, Deng, & Band have proven that both of these luminosity indicators are valid by finding a lag/variability relation for 112 BATSE bursts. Here, I provide simple and general explanations for both indicators. The lag/luminosity relation is a consequence of conservation of energy when radiative cooling dominates. High luminosity bursts cool rapidly so the lag between when hard and <b>soft</b> photons <b>peak</b> is short, while low luminosity bursts cool slowly so the lag is long. The variability/luminosity relation arises within internal shock models because the luminosity and variability both scale as strong functions of the bulk relativistic motion of the jet, Γ.
