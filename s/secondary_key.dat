The song {{is in the}} key of A major, although MacDonald gives B minor as a <b>secondary</b> <b>key.</b> The opening organ part ends with {{a preview of the}} melody over which the song title appears in the song proper. After this short introduction, the composition is structured into two portions consisting of two verses and a chorus each, which are followed by a single verse, a final chorus and an outro, with some of these sections rendered as instrumental passages.|$|E

50|$|For {{database}} storage {{the basic}} unit is a tuple. Tuples in tuple sets handle {{the same role}} as rows in tables for relational databases, but tuples have an arbitrary number of fields, and fields do not need names. Every tuple in a database has one (unique not null) primary key and one or more <b>secondary</b> <b>keys,</b> which are enabled for immediate lookup via indexes. Supported index types are binary tree, hash, bitmap, and R-tree (spatial). Fields in a tuple are type-agnostic. Users may insert, update, delete, or select {{if they have been}} granted appropriate privileges.|$|R

50|$|Initial Pick {{implementations}} had no index structures as {{they were}} not deemed necessary. Around 1990, a B-tree indexing feature was added. This feature makes <b>secondary</b> <b>key</b> look-ups operate much like keyed inquiries of any other database system: requiring at least two disk reads (a key read then a data-record read).|$|E
50|$|Formally, Orpheus is a {{modified}} sonata form with a <b>secondary</b> <b>key</b> area containing two themes. The second theme lacks {{the energy of}} the first, remaining a static motif hovering over oscillating major and minor harmonies. Nevertheless, it contains an especially poignant quality. This theme is presented by various solo instruments to a primarily harp accompaniment. The orchestration, together with the style, suggests an interpretation of this theme as Orpheus' voice.|$|E

50|$|Many {{connectors}} are keyed, {{with some}} mechanical component which prevents mating except with a correctly oriented matching connector. This {{can be used}} to prevent incorrect or damaging interconnections, either preventing pins from being damaged by being jammed in at the wrong angle or fitting into imperfectly fitting plugs, or to prevent damaging connections, such as plugging an audio cable into a power outlet. For instance, XLR connectors have a notch to ensure proper orientation, while Mini-DIN plugs have a plastic projection, which fits into a corresponding hole in the socket and prevent different connectors from being pushed together (they also have a notched metal skirt to provide <b>secondary</b> <b>keying).</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{transition}} (TR) follows P, sometimes emerging seamlessly out of it. The chief goal of TR is {{to build}} up energy, although TR also frequently modulates away from the tonic to prepare the sonata's <b>secondary</b> <b>key.</b> The most common goal for the transition's energy gain is {{to drive to the}} first moment of [...] "structural punctuation," [...] the medial caesura. If this option is chosen, a Two-Part Exposition is produced; if not, TR leads directly to the essential expositional closure (described below), producing a Continuous Exposition.|$|E
50|$|Although G♯ major {{is usually}} notated as the enharmonic key of A♭ major, because A♭ major has only four flats {{as opposed to}} G♯ major's eight sharps (including the F), it does appear as a <b>secondary</b> <b>key</b> area in several works in sharp keys - most notably in the Prelude and Fugue in C-sharp major from Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1. The G-sharp minor prelude (and, in some editions, the fugue) from the same set ends with a Picardy third, on a G-sharp major chord.|$|E

However, McClary {{also points out that}} the same techniques used in opera to represent madness in women were historically highly prized in avant-garde instrumental music, [...] "In the nineteenth-century symphony, Salomes chromatic daring is what distinguishes truly serious composition of the vanguard from mere cliché-ridden hack work."

40|$|Surrogates or {{internal}} identifiers {{can be made}} {{to facilitate}} both fast access and storage in-dependence if they are implemented properly. Such an implementation is discussed here; it permits the tuplcs of a relation to be accessed very fast by primary key for both random and sequential search without retarding the per-formance of <b>secondary</b> <b>keys.</b> It employs a key compression and a hasiiing algorithm and attempts to place tuples on data pages in the primary key sequence. Subsequent updates are absorbed by a dynamic allocation of overflows. An indexing technique called a hash tree holds surrogates in primary key order, and facili-tates fast sequential access. The access speed remains high even at a 90 % load factor, with-out being significantly affected by storage reorganisation resulting from the addition of new attributes, deletion of old attributes or change of data page sizes. These techniques have been implemented in the PRECI database system at Aberdeen. 1...|$|R
