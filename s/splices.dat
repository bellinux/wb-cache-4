Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which <b>splices</b> viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E

Beyond the conventional classification for alternatively <b>spliced</b> exons (ASEs) and constitutively <b>spliced</b> exons (CSEs), we have classified exons from alternatively <b>spliced</b> human genes and their mouse orthologs (12, 314 and 5, 464, respectively) into four types based on their <b>splicing</b> frequencies.

25|$|Because {{the actual}} bond stress varies {{along the length}} of a bar {{anchored}} in a zone of tension, current international codes of specifications use the concept of development length rather than bond stress.

However, if the actual available length is inadequate for full development, special anchorages must be provided, such as cogs or hooks or mechanical end plates.

40|$|Alternative <b>splicing</b> in {{mammalian}} cells {{has been}} suggested to be largely controlled by combinatorial binding of basal <b>splicing</b> factors to pre-mRNA templates. This model predicts that distinct sets of pre-mRNA <b>splicing</b> factors are associated with alternatively <b>spliced</b> transcripts. However, no experimental evidence for differential recruitment of <b>splicing</b> factors to transcripts with distinct <b>splicing</b> fates is available. Here we have used quantitative single-cell imaging to test this key prediction in vivo. We show that distinct combinations of <b>splicing</b> factors are recruited to sites of alternatively <b>spliced</b> transcripts in intact cells. While a subset of serine/arginine protein <b>splicing</b> factors, including SF 2 /ASF, SC 35, and SRp 20, is efficiently recruited to the tau gene when exon 10 is included, these factors are less frequently associated with tau transcription sites when exon 10 is excluded. In contrast, the frequency of recruitment of several other <b>splicing</b> factors is independent of <b>splicing</b> outcome. Mutation analysis of SF 2 /ASF shows that both protein–protein as well as protein–RNA interactions are required for differential recruitment. The differential behavior of the various <b>splicing</b> factors provides the basis for combinatorial occupancy at pre-mRNAs.
