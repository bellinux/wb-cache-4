40|$|Targeted {{sequence}} capture is {{a promising}} technology {{in many areas}} in biology. These methods enable efficient and relatively inexpensive sequencing of hundreds to thousands of genes or genomic regions from many more individuals than is practical using whole-genome sequencing approaches. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of target enrichment using sequence capture in polyploid cotton. To capture and sequence both members of each gene pair (homeologs) of wild and domesticated Gossypium hirsutum, we created custom hybridization probes to target 1000 genes (500 pairs of homeologs) using information from the cotton transcriptome. Two widely divergent samples of G. hirsutum were hybridized to four custom NimbleGen capture arrays containing probes for targeted genes. We show that the two coresident homeologs in the allopolyploid nucleus were efficiently captured with high coverage. The capture efficiency was similar between the two accessions and independent of whether the samples were multiplexed. A significant amount of flanking, nontargeted <b>sequence</b> (<b>untranslated</b> regions and introns) was also captured and sequenced along with the targeted exons. Intraindividual heterozygosity is low in both wild and cultivated Upland cotton, as expected from {{the high level of}} inbreeding in natural G. hirsutum and bottlenecks accompanying domestication. In addition, levels of heterozygosity appeared asymmetrical with respect to genome (A(T) or D(T)) in cultivated cotton. The approach used here is general, scalable, and may be adapted for many different research inquiries involving polyploid plant genomes...|$|E

40|$|The {{crucial role}} of the non-coding portion of genomes is now widely acknowledged. In particular, mRNA untranslated regions are {{involved}} in many post-transcriptional regulatory pathways that control mRNA localisation, stability and translation efficiency. A review is given {{of the most recent}} research works on the functional characterisation of eukaryotic mRNA untranslated regions. In order to make possible a systematic and detailed sequence analysis of mRNA untranslated regions (UTRs), a non-redundant database of metazoan mRNA <b>untranslated</b> <b>sequences</b> annotated for the occurrence of specific functional elements, UTRdb, was devised. These elements, whose consensus structure has been devised on the basis of experimental assays and of comparative analyses, have been collected in the UTRsite database. A suitable pattern-matching software has been devised to search UTRsite patterns in user-submitted sequences, also assessing their statistical significance.

40|$|Most of the {{phenotypic}} {{diversity that}} we perceive {{in the natural}} world is directly attributable to the peculiar structure of the eukaryotic gene, which harbors numerous embellishments relative to the situation in prokaryotes. The most profound changes include introns that must be spliced out of precursor mRNAs, transcribed but untranslated leader and trailer <b>sequences</b> (<b>untranslated</b> regions), modular regulatory elements that drive patterns of gene expression, and expansive intergenic regions that harbor additional diffuse control mechanisms. Explaining the origins of these features is difficult because they each impose an intrinsic disadvantage by increasing the genic mutation rate to defective alleles. To address these issues, a general hypothesis for the emergence of eukaryotic gene structure is provided here. Extensive information on absolute population sizes, recombination rates, and mutation rates strongly supports the view that eukaryotes have reduced genetic effective population sizes relative to prokaryotes, with especially extreme reductions being the rule in multicellular lineages. The resultant increase in the power of random genetic drift appears to be sufficient to overwhelm the weak mutational disadvantages associated with most novel aspects of the eukaryotic gene, supporting the idea that most such changes are simple outcomes of semi-neutral processes rather than direct products of natural selection. However, by establishing an essentially permanent change in the population-genetic environment permissive to the genome-wide repatterning of gene structure, the eukaryotic condition also promoted a reliable resource from which natural selection could secondarily build novel forms of organismal complexity. Under this hypothesis, arguments based on molecular, cellular, and/or physiological constraints are insufficient to explain the disparities in gene, genomic, and phenotypic complexity between prokaryotes and eukaryotes...|$|R

40|$|The En/Spm encoded {{suppressor}} function {{has been}} reconstituted in transgenic tobacco protoplasts. The suppressor affects genes which contain an En/Spm responsive transposable {{element in the}} transcribed sequences. The En/Spm encoded protein tnpA binds a defined cis element in the inserted transposon, repressing expression of the adjacent gene.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} genetic studies {{aiming at}} enlarging our knowledge regarding the genetic factors underlying two immune-mediated diseases, hypothyroidism and autoimmune Addison’s disease (AAD), in dogs and humans, respectively. Genetic {{and environmental factors}} are indicated to contribute to canine hypothyroidism, which {{can be considered a}} model for human Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT). In Paper I we performed the first genome-wide association (GWA) study of this disease in three high-risk dog breeds (Gordon Setter, Hovawart and Rhodesian Ridgeback). Using an integrated GWA and meta-analysis strategy, we identified a novel hypothyroidism risk haplotype located on chromosome 12 being shared by the three breeds. The identified haplotype, harboring three genes previously not associated with hypothyroidism, is independent of the dog leukocyte antigen region and significantly enriched across the affected dogs. In Paper II we performed a GWA study in another high-risk breed (Giant Schnauzer) and detected an associated locus located on chromosome 11 and conferring protection to hypothyroidism. After whole genome resequencing of a subset of samples with key haplotypes, we fine mapped the region of association that was subsequently screened for the presence of structural variants. We detected a putative copy number variant overlapping with the upstream region of the IFNA 7 gene, which is located in a region of high genomic complexity. Remarkably, perturbed activities of type I Interferons have been extensively associated with HT and general autoimmunity. In Paper III we performed the first large-scale genetic study of human AAD, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by dysfunction and ultimately destruction of the adrenal cortex. We resequenced 1853 immune-related genes comprising of their coding <b>sequences,</b> <b>untranslated</b> regions, as well as conserved intronic and intergenic regions in extensively characterized AAD patients and control samples, all collected in Sweden. We identified BACH 2 gene as a novel risk locus associated with AAD, and we showed its independent association with isolated AAD. In addition, we confirmed the previously established AAD association with the human leukocyte antigen complex. The results of these studies will hopefully help increasing the understanding of such diseases in dogs and humans, eventually promoting their well-being...|$|R
