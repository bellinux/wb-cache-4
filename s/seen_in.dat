5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids.

The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even been reported to be a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
