40|$|CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools {{have played}} a {{critical}} role in improving software productivity and quality by assisting tasks in software development processes since 1970 ’s. Several parametric software cost models adopt “use of software tools ” as one of environmental factors that affect software development productivity. However, most software development teams use CASE tools that are assembled over time and adopt new tools without establishing formal evaluation criteria. Several software cost models assess the productivity impacts of CASE tools based just on breadth of tool coverage without considering other productivity dimensions such as degree of integration, tool maturity, and user support. This paper provides an extended <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> rating scales based on the completeness of tool coverage, the degree of tool integration, and tool maturity/ user support. It uses these scales to refine the way in which CASE tools are effectively evaluated within COCOMO (COnstructive COst MOdel) II.

Several parametric software cost models adopt “use of software tools ” as one of the environmental factors that affects software development productivity. Several software cost models assess the productivity impacts of CASE tools based just on breadth of tool coverage without considering other productivity dimensions such as degree of integration, tool maturity, and user support. This paper provides an extended <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> rating scales based on the completeness of tool coverage, the degree of tool integration, and tool maturity/user support. Those scales are used to refine the way in which CASE tools are effectively evaluated within COCOMO (COnstructive COst MOdel) II.

The extended model using the three TOOL rating scales is validated by using the cross-validation methodologies, data splitting, and bootstrapping. This approach can be used to disaggregate other parameters that have significant impacts on software development productivity and to calibrate the best-fit weight values based on data-determined and expert-judged distributions. It results in an increase in the prediction accuracy in software parametric cost estimation models and an improvement in insights on software productivity investments...|$|E

APE is implemented as a plug-in for the Eclipse platform.

The shifting bottleneck heuristic is a decomposition approach that solves the overall scheduling problem by solving a sequence of tool group scheduling problems and determines the overall solution by using a disjunctive graph. We discuss a distributed version of the original shifting bottleneck heuristic. By using a hierarchical approach we first assign planned ready and completion dates to all lots with respect to a certain work area where a work area is defined as a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>tool</b> groups. We study several order release strategies. It turns out that the distributed shifting bottleneck heuristic performs well compared to dispatching rules only in high loaded job shops.
