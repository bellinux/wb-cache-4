5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on Løvøya island, Telemark county, Norway. He was a Norwegian {{priest and}} amateur {{mineralogist}} {{who studied the}} minerals in Telemark, where he served as vicar. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as this one, to his father, Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Oslo. The elder Esmark determined {{that it was not}} a known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> reducing KThF5 with potassium metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source mineral thorite.|$|E

25|$|A body sample means {{a sample}} of blood, {{a sample of}} head hair (including the root), a swab taken from the person's mouth, or {{any other type of}} sample {{prescribed}} to be a body <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> the Minister for Home Affairs.|$|E
25|$|If, otherwise, the {{analyzer}} is oriented {{at a small}} angle (detuning angle) {{with respect}} to the monochromator then X-rays refracted in the <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> a smaller angle will be reflected less, and X-rays refracted by a larger angle will be reflected more. Thus the contrast of the image is based on different refraction angles in the sample.|$|E

25|$|Impedance {{microbiology}} is a rapid microbiological {{technique used}} to measure the microbial concentration (mainly bacteria but also yeasts) of a <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> monitoring the electrical parameters of the growth medium. It is {{based on the fact that}} bacteria metabolism transforms uncharged (or weakly charged) compounds into highly charged compounds thus changing the growth medium electrical properties. The microbial concentration is estimated on the time required for the monitored electrical parameters to deviate from the initial baseline value.|$|E
25|$|Pyro{{sequencing of}} {{bisulfite}} treated DNA. This is sequencing of an amplicon {{made by a}} normal forward primer but a biotinylated reverse primer to PCR the gene of choice. The Pyrosequencer then analyses the <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> denaturing the DNA and adding one nucleotide {{at a time to}} the mix according to a sequence given by the user. If there is a mis-match, it is recorded and the percentage of DNA for which the mis-match is present is noted. This gives the user a percentage methylation per CpG island.|$|E
25|$|The gold {{standard}} for diagnosis is identification of trypanosomes in a patient <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> microscopic examination. Patient samples {{that can be used}} for diagnosis include chancre fluid, lymph node aspirates, blood, bone marrow, and, during the neurological stage, cerebrospinal fluid. Detection of trypanosome-specific antibodies can be used for diagnosis, but the sensitivity and specificity of these methods are too variable to be used alone for clinical diagnosis. Further, seroconversion occurs after the onset of clinical symptoms during a T. b. rhodesiense infection, so is of limited diagnostic use.|$|E

25|$|A {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} (SEM) {{is a type of}} electron microscope that produces images of a <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition. The electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the beam's position is combined with the detected signal to produce an image. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Specimens can be observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{demonstrated}} that dark-field imaging with the grating interferometer {{can be used to}} extract orientational information of structural details in the sub-micrometer regime beyond the spatial resolution of the detection system. While the scattering of X-rays in a direction perpendicular to the grating lines provides the dark-field contrast, the scattering in a direction parallel to the grating lines only lead to blurring in the image, which is not visible at the low resolution of the detector. This intrinsic physical property of the setup is utilized to extract orientational information about the angular variation of the local scattering power of the <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> rotating the sample around the optical axis of the set-up and collecting a set of several dark-field images, each measuring the component of the scattering perpendicular to the grating lines for that particular orientation. This can be used to determine the local angle and degree of orientation of bone and could yield valuable information for improving research and diagnostics of bone diseases like osteoporosis or osteoarthritis.|$|E
25|$|In {{secondary}} electron imaging, or SEI, the {{secondary electron}}s are emitted from {{very close to}} the specimen surface. Consequently, SEM can produce very high-resolution images of a sample surface, revealing details less than 1 nm in size. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> elastic scattering. They emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and consequently the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution of different elements in the sample. For the same reason, BSE imaging can image colloidal gold immuno-labels of 5 or 10nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images in biological specimens. Characteristic X-rays are emitted when the electron beam removes an inner shell electron from the sample, causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy. These characteristic X-rays are used to identify the composition and measure the abundance of elements in the sample.|$|E

[...] "N.Y. State of Mind" [...] focuses on a mind state that a person obtains from living in Nas's impoverished environment in New York City. Critic Marc Hill of PopMatters wrote that the song [...] "provides as clear a depiction of ghetto life as a Gordon Parks photograph or a Langston Hughes poem." ...|$|E
500|$|George Otto Gey, {{the first}} {{researcher}} to study Lacks's cancerous cells, observed that her cells were {{unique in that}} they reproduced {{at a very high}} rate and could be kept alive long enough to allow more in-depth examination. Until then, cells cultured for laboratory studies only survived for a few days at most, which wasn't long enough to perform a variety of different tests on the same sample. Lacks's cells were the first to be observed that could be divided multiple times without dying, which is why they became known as [...] "immortal." [...] After Lacks' death, Gey had Mary Kubicek, his lab assistant, take further HeLa samples while Henrietta's body was at Johns Hopkins' autopsy facility. The roller-tube technique was the method used to culture the cells obtained from the samples that Kubicek collected. Gey was able to start a cell line from Lacks's <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> isolating one specific cell and repeatedly dividing it, meaning that the same cell could then be used for conducting many experiments. They became known as HeLa cells, because Gey's standard method for labeling samples was to use the first two letters of the patient's first and last names.|$|E

Looking {{for information on the}} pathogen, Spike is given a <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> a man named Rashid, who was the former lead on its development. Spike also encounters Elektra Ovilo, an agent of Cherious Medical. Upon examination, the [...] "pathogen" [...] proves to be a type of protein-based nanomachine that mimics human lymphocytes then breaks down into protein after death, making it undetectable. Attempting to infiltrate Cherious Medical, Spike fights with Elektra, planting a listening device on her. Elektra, who is sent by Cherious Medical to kill Vincent, is tailed by Spike, who attempts to take down Vincent on a train. Vincent easily defeats Spike, severely wounding him and throwing him from the train before releasing another cloud of the nanomachines: everyone in the train dies except Elektra, who was unknowingly immunized when she had been in a relationship with Vincent prior to the test on Titan. She secretly gives a friend in the company a sample of her blood to prepare a stock of vaccine. During this time, Faye relocates Sampson, who has been working with Vincent, but fails to catch him. Ein and Ed manage to find him again, but the two run off before Faye can get there. She arrives just as Vincent breaks one of the nanomachine containers with him, killing Sampson. Although Faye is also infected, Vincent gives her some of his blood through a kiss, immunizing her.|$|E
500|$|Post was {{released}} on 13 June 1995, as a 12" [...] record, CD, and compact cassette. It was issued on One Little Indian Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States and Canada; Polydor Records issued Post in Australia and Japan, also releasing the European edition of the album. Lead single [...] "Army of Me" [...] {{was released}} on 21 April 1995, shortly after the album's production concluded. It was released in the United Kingdom as two different CD releases, with [...] "Cover Me", [...] "You've Been Flirting Again", [...] "Sweet Intuition", and various remixes as its B-sides. It debuted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming her first UK Top 10 single. Although it {{dropped out of the}} Top 20 the next week, [...] "Army of Me" [...] remained in the Top 75 for five weeks. The ending of [...] "Army of Me" [...] music video depicted Björk bombing an art museum, and due to a recent terrorist bombing in Oklahoma City, MTV removed it from its playlist before it even aired. Within weeks it was broadcast, although this [...] "foreshadowed a string of unlucky events that would further hinder Posts unveiling". An unsourced <b>sample</b> <b>by</b> Robin Rimbaud, prominently heard throughout [...] "Possibly Maybe", resulted in a lawsuit demanding a co-songwriter credit. After Rimbaud's label New Electronica refused Birkett's standard sample clearance compensation of £1,000, he and Björk resolved to destroy over 100,000 copies of the album, and [...] "remixing, remastering, and reprinting a new version". However, and at the request of Rimbaud, New Electronica later let Björk use his sample completely free of charge, meaning One Little Indian did not have to issue another version after all, since stores had yet to run out of stock of Post initial run. Björk was also due back in court as a witness in Simon Fisher's lawsuit against Nellee Hooper and herself (regarding Debuts writing credits), charges that were eventually cleared by judge Robin Jacob. Author Mark Pytlik writes: [...] "The strange combination of events had conspired to form the strangest promotional tour anyone could have ever envisioned: in the week since Post had been released, Björk had seen her album deleted, her video banned, and two separate lawsuits brought against her". One Little Indian were also better prepared to promote the album, scheduling a string of European and American tour dates from the beginning of July into late August.|$|E
