5000|$|James Long {{believed}} that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators. His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan (the original Bengali play was written by him) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860. Mitra sent Long {{a copy of the}} play as early as 1861. Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton-Karr, Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission. Seton-Karr, sensing its importance, mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor, Grant.Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends. After the discussion, Seton-Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English. Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long. Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a <b>short</b> <b>prefatory</b> <b>note</b> for the play. When the translation was complete, Seton-Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant's wish of a few copies. Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel, the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs.300. It was published in April or May 1861. Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor, Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading: [...] "on her Majesty's Service". The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters. It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo-Indian Press against the publisher and the translator. One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer- C. H. Manuel. The words mentioned in Long's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was [...] "plain but true". This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements.|$|E
40|$|FIG is {{the second}} {{installment}} of the ongoing series Goan Atom. It is a colllection of 12 poetic pieces written between 1996 and 2004. They have each previously been produced as off-page collaborations or text-installations. This range of artistic and poetic contexts and the compositional processes that result from these is a crucial aspect of the goanatom poetics represented in FIG. Each piece has been carefully rethought and twelve <b>short</b> <b>prefatory</b> <b>notes</b> have been written and developed especially for the book. They function as an additional textual layer, a poetic dimension in their own right. The pieces in FIG explore the connections between the materialities of written or inscriptive language and the materialities of human physicality. Language inscribed in the speaking, listening, writing body. This includes the pursuit of physical and sexual imaginaries, bilingual and translative poetics, time-led and context-specific writings, textual and spoken patterns of misrecognition. It {{is one of the}} premises of FIG that the poetic texts are written with an accent and with body. The book’s drawings and photographic material add to the traffic between verbal and visual textualities.
