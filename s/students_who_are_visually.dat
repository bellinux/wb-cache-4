40|$|Abstract: A <b>student</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>visually</b> {{impaired}} <b>was</b> {{trained to}} evaluate his social behavior and to recruit feedback from his sighted peers, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> trained by him {{to provide the}} feedback. The self-recruitment of feedback improved the student's accuracy in evaluating social skills requiring visual cues. In addition, the peers extended their feedback to {{other aspects of the}} social environment than social behavior. Visual impairment (that is, blindness or low vision) can affect a child's social development and the formation of friendships with sighted peers (Rosenblum, 1998). One factor that inhibits a child's social development and formation of friendships is the lack of visual cues. According to MacCuspie (1996, p. 37), "Limited access to both learning and using visual cues can be observed to detract from the social development of children with visual impairment from a very early age. " Similarly, nonverbal communication and feedback, which are important components of social interaction, are available to sighted children but are not easy for children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired to follow. It has been observed that unless they are prompted, significant others in the environment (such as teachers, peers, and family members) fail to supply feedback that is meaningful to individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired (Jindal-Snape, 2004).

Research in the field of visual impairment has yet to provide precise and reliable estimates of the level of assistive technology use by U.

Providing visually impaired students with some degree of autonomy and independent decision-making {{has been shown to be}} necessary for the healthy development of the child. Without the use of assistive technology in learning experiences, students without vision struggle to be independent. The aim of this study, then, was to estimate the level of assistive technology experience with text-to-speech devices and screen reading software nationwide and investigate some of the contextual circumstances that may contribute to the use of this special technology for the blind. The population of study was visually impaired students in the U. S. The sample for this study came from the SEELS, a nationally representative longitudinal data base of elementary and middle school students with disabilities. Data analysis methods included descriptive analyses of assistive technology use and binary logistic multilevel longitudinal modeling of assistive technology use and rate of change in assistive technology use as a function of mathematics ability, parent involvement, school placement, and school environment support. Data analysis strategies accounted for the attributes of a binary outcome with the binary logistic application of multilevel modeling. Analysis of the data showed that the vast majority of students with visual impairments in the U. S. were not using assistive technology during each of the three measured time periods. It was determined that any change in assistive technology use as the three years of the survey progressed was not statistically significant. Children who had parents that attended any parent meeting, programs, or trainings for families of students with disabilities were significantly more likely to use assistive technology. Students attending residential schools were significantly more likely to use assistive technology than students not attending residential schools.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to report on the {{mainstreaming}} and full-inclusion experiences of secondary school instrumental music <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> blind or <b>visually</b> impaired. Four research questions addressed the following topics: (a) informant’s motivations for participation in instrumental music; (b) the extent to which informants’ abilities to develop learning strategies for participation in instrumental music affected quality of experience; (c) the extent to which intervention of other people in instrumental music participation affected informants’ quality of experience; and (d) informants’ perceptions of social connection in instrumental music ensembles and quality of experience. Eleven informants, <b>who</b> <b>were</b> identified through contact with a variety of national and local organizations serving blind and visually impaired students, participated in semi-structured telephone interviews with the researcher. Informants reported the following: (a) multiple motivations for participation in instrumental music ensembles; (b) positive and negative effects associated with self-developed learning strategies; (c) positive and negative effects associated with the intervention of other people in their music learning; and (d) social connection experiences that related to motivations for participation in instrumental music class. When analyzing the data through the sociocultural perspective of James Wertsch, memorizing emerged as the most commonly employed strategy for participation in band and orchestra of study informants. Participants also accessed “tools” or “mediational means” such as Braille music notation, enlarged print notation, fellow ensemble members, parents, and ensemble directors to facilitate participation.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the attitude of}} lecturers towards the visually impaired students {{in one of the}} universities in the Limpopo Province. First, it is argued that the experience of a visual impairment by a student has a greater effect on the strategies and methodologies used for instruction than on the curricular content to which the student is exposed. Specialized instructional strategies facilitate the visually impaired students ’ successful participation within regular education classrooms. The degree of specialized intervention needed depends upon the intensity of the students’ impairments. Despite the fact that the university has each year been registering <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired, {{there is no indication that}} staff members are being trained to handle these students. Both qualitative and quantitative findings from interviews with visually impaired students, HODs (heads of departments), and deans/directors of centers suggest that lecturers found teaching visually impaired students is a problem, because they were never trained to teach visually impaired students and that the institution should employ a permanent specialist in teaching visually impaired students and create a resource centre for them. This paper examines some of the concerns that the visually impaired students encounter and raises questions about how they learn and how they are being taught...|$|E
40|$|The {{significance}} of blindness for a child’s development depends on many variable factors. A blind child {{who does not}} suffer from additional disabilities, who is well cared for by parents and is helped to compensate for his sensory loss {{is able to develop}} very much as others do. Different people have different perceptions on disability and for this case visual impairment. This study sought to establish the perception of students and teachers on the integration programme of students with visual impairment in secondary schools. The study was carried out in Ainamoi sub county, Kericho County, Kenya. A case study design method was used. The data collecting techniques included questionnaires, focus group discussion and document analysis. A total of 200 respondents participated in the study and data was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings revealed that majority of the students had a positive perception of the policy of integration. This is attributed to the fact that some visually impaired students actually excel in class far much better than their sighted peers. However, those who negated this view cited a number of challenges that are experienced by the visually impaired students. Nonetheless, the teachers differ significantly with the student perception and attitudes towards the policy of integration. The reasons given are enormous and it emanates right from the fact that majority of them had not only been sensitized but {{that they do not have}} the required skills to handle the <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired...|$|E

Childhood obesity has more than doubled since 1990, and the health consequences are reflected in the rising cost of health care. There has also been a significant drop in physical activity across the country and physical education is no longer required in middle schools. The lack of physical activity and issues of weight can compromise the ability of the individual who is blind or visually impaired to maneuver through the environment safely and efficiently. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the perceptions of itinerant teachers of students with visual impairments about the importance of physical activity for their students with visual impairments and its effect on academic success and social relationship. Data was gathered from 175 teachers of students with visual impairments concerning their perceptions regarding the importance of physical activity and obesity and their relationship with academic success and social relationships. The teachers indicated that physical activity for their students is very important. They described a multitude of barriers that account for a lack of involvement in the general physical education classes in which they were enrolled. Teachers reported on their own personal physical activity levels in relationship to the importance they placed on their students' need to be active. The teachers did not indicate that being overweight was a particular issue with their visually impaired students, but they acknowledged that being overweight and a lack of physical activity create additional barriers for academic success and appropriate social relationships. The teachers also reported that the same barriers in physical education classes and access to recreation activities in the community that have been listed in past research studies were still in existence, and these barriers were also part of their dilemma in creating positive physical activity experiences for their <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>visually</b> impaired.
