In the case ofsmall developing cumulus cloud, updraft area topped with cumulus proceeds the cloud in the boundarylayer. However, marure cumulus cloud has updraft area, delaying with descending height, whichcenters the horizontal circulation. In the <b>strato-cumulus</b> case, cloud has no correlation with con-vective action in the boundary layer...|$|E
40|$|Wang, Lian-PingCollisions of sedimenting {{droplets}} in {{a turbulent}} flow {{is of great}} importance in cloud physics. Collision efficiency and collision enhancement over gravitational collision by air turbulence govern {{the growth of the}} cloud droplets leading to warm rain initiation and precipitation dynamics. In this thesis we present direct numerical simulation (DNS) results for collision statistics of droplets in turbulent flows of low dissipation rates (in the range of 3 cm 2 /s 3 – 100 cm 2 /s 3) relevant to <b>strato-cumulus</b> clouds. First, we revisit the case of gravitational collision in still fluid to validate the details of the collision detection algorithm used in our code. We compare the collision statistics with either new analytical predictions regarding the percentages of different collision types, or results from published papers. The effect of initial conditions on the collision statistics and statistical uncertainties are analyzed both analytically and through the simulation data. Second, we consider the case of weak turbulence (as in <b>strato-cumulus</b> clouds). In this case the particle motion is mainly driven by gravity. The standard deviation (or the uncertainty) of the average collision statistics is examined analytically in terms of time correlation function of the data. We then report new DNS results of collision statistics in a turbulent flow, showing how air turbulence increases the geometric colli- sion statistics and the collision efficiency. We find that the collision-rate enhancement due to turbulence depends nonlinearly on the flow dissipation rate. This result calls for a more careful parameterization of the collision statistics in <b>strato-cumulus</b> clouds. Due to the low flow dissipation rate in stratocumulus clouds, a related challenge is low droplet Stokes number. Here the Stokes number is the ratio of droplet inertial response time to the flow Kolmogorov time. A very low Stokes number implies that the numerical integration time step is now governed by the droplet inertial response time, rather than the time step necessary for the flow simulation. This situation makes the simulations very expensive to perform. With the motivation to speed up the simulations, we implement the asymptotic expansion approach (as in Maxey, 1987) for particle tracking as this method is suitable for low particle Stokes number and avoids the numerical integration of the stiff equation of motion of droplets. We first validate our implementation using the simpler 2 -D cellular flow. Next, we compare the collision statistics of the newly implemented asymptotic approach with our existing approach of particle tracking as well as with published results from journal papers. Finally, we provide the run time comparison for both methods. University of Delaware, Department of Mechanical EngineeringM. S. M. E...|$|E
40|$|The ideal {{solution}} to the problem of global warming would be for everybody to change immediately from fossil fuel to cheap, reliable and plentiful renewable sources of energy. But China will be building 1000 MW of coal-fired plant every four or five days for the next eight years and India the same every two weeks. World fossil fuel consumption rose by 4 % in 2004. Coal consumption rose by 6 %. Our leaders are betting the planet on the hope that carbon sequestration, renewable energy and improved efficiency will be able to compensate. The 2004 increase in the rate of rise of CO 2 to 2. 5 ppm suggests that the goal has not yet been achieved. If the leaders are wrong and the Siberian permafrost melts to release its stored methane, the global temperature rise will accelerate even more than now, even if we were to succeed in reducing carbon emissions. Back-up plans are urgently needed. This paper describes the hardware of a plan based on John Latham’s 1990 proposal to exploit the Twomey effect. Wind-driven spray-vessels will release micron-sized drops of sea water beneath marine <b>strato-cumulus</b> clouds. This will increase their albedo and so reflect enough solar energy back out to space to allow double present CO 2 levels with no change of mean global temperature...|$|E
40|$|Fiedler (1985) {{demonstrates}} {{the inadequacy of}} three convective instability theories in explaining the large aspect ratio of mesoscale cellular convec-tion (MCC). As an alternative explanation, he suggests mesoscale entrainment instability (MEI), an instability resulting from the entrainment fluxes {{at the top of}} the mixed layer. Fiedler uses the acronym MCC to designate “the cellular cloud pattern in marine <b>strato-cumulus</b> cloud decks”, i. e. closed convection cells. In fact, “Mesoscale cellular convection ” was first used by Hubert (1966) as a collective name for open as well as closed convection cells (see also Agee (1984) for some nice examples). Nowhere does Fiedler allude to the large differences between open and closed cells. Cloud cover in open cells may be only 10 %. while Fiedler assumes 100 % cloud cover. Since a coupling between entrainment and conden-sation of water vapour is definitely necessary for the occurrence of ME 1 (Fiedler. 1984. p. 98). it is very doubtful whether ME 1 can explain the existence, let alone the structure and large aspect ratio, of open cells. The conditional nature of latent heat release seems to be a much better candidate (Van Delden, 1985). To me it even seems doubtful that ME 1 can explain the large aspect ratio of closed cells with a cloud cover close to 100 %. This can be seen from eq. (3. 22) (Fiedler, 1985) which gives the small-scale cut-off. According to this equation ME 1 occurs only whe...|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that Peruvian stratocumulus {{play an important}} role on both the annual mean and annual variations of sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific is examined. The problem is addressed by performing sensitivity experiments using the University of California, Los Angeles, coupled atmosphere– ocean GCM with different idealized temporal variations of stratocumulus in a region along the coast of Peru. The results obtained are consistent with the notion that Peruvian stratocumulus are a key component of the interhemispherically asymmetric features that characterize the annual mean climate of the eastern equatorial Pacific, including the cold SSTs off Peru and the absence of a southern ITCZ. The principal new finding {{of this study is that}} the annual variations (i. e., deviations from the annual mean) of Peruvian stratocumulus are linked to the differences between the amplitude, duration, and westward propagation of the warm and cold phases of the equatorial cold tongue. In the model’s context, only if the prescribed annual variations of Peruvian <b>strato-cumulus</b> have the same phase as the observed variations are those differences successfully captured. The impact of Peruvian stratocumulus on equatorial SST involves ‘‘dynamical’ ’ and ‘‘thermal’ ’ effects. The former develop through an enhancement of the northerly component of the surface wind from the Peruvian coast to the equator. The thermal effects develop through the special relationships between SST and surface evaporation over the equatorial cold tongue, which contributes to extend the cold phase until the end of the year. A successful portrayal of this behavior requires a realistic simulation of the annual variations of surface wind over the equatorial cold tongue. 1...|$|E
40|$|Vertical {{velocity}} is used {{to isolate}} the effect of large-scale dynamics on the observed radiation budget and cloud properties in the tropics, using the methodology suggested by Bony et al. Cloud and radiation budget quantities in the tropics show well-defined responses to the large-scale vertical motion at 500 hPa. For the tropics as a whole, the ratio of shortwave to longwave cloud forcing (hereafter N) is about 1. 2 in regions of upward motion, and increases to about 1. 9 in regions of strong subsidence. If the analysis is restricted to oceanic regions with SST 28 °C, N does not increase as much for subsiding motions, because the <b>strato-cumulus</b> regions are eliminated, and the net cloud forcing decreases linearly from about near zero for zero vertical velocity to about 15 W m 2 for strongly subsiding motion. Increasingly negative cloud forcing with increasing upward motion is mostly related to an increasing abundance of high, thick clouds. Although a consistent dynamical effect on the annual cycle of about 1 W m 2 can be identified, {{the effect of the}} probability density function (PDF) of the large-scale vertical velocity on long-term trends in the tropical mean radiation budget is very small compared to the observed variations. Observed tropical mean changes can be as large as 3 W m 2, while the dynamical components are generally smaller than 0. 5 W m 2. For relatively small regions in the east and west Pacific, changes in the relative magnitude of longwave and shortwave cloud forcing can be related to the PDF of vertical velocity. The east Pacific in 1987 and 1998 showed large reductions of N in association with an increase in the fraction of the area in the domain with upward motion, and concomitant increases in high cloud. For the west Pacific in 1998, a large increase in N was caused not so much by a change in the mean vertical motion, but rather by a shift from top- to bottom-heavy upward motion. 1...|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] UNITED STATES ARMY AIR FORCES Tuesday My Darling, A solid day of sack-time, (solo). As usual I didn’t fly today, it rained, and I mean rain. And, did it rain. But- I predict I will {{be clear}} {{tomorrow}} seein’ as which a cold front, with low <b>strato-cumulus</b> and swelling cumulonimbus passed, followed by a high broken condition of alto stratus (understand?) (I don’t) but anyhow {{it should be clear}} with the weather we had today it should have rained itself out. But let’s not talk about the weather, let’s talk about us. Well, I couldn’t get hold of the C. O. today, all the nowboats were being used for official business, so I had to stay on my side of the street. So I’m going to nail him on the line tomorrow morning. We still haven’t gotten any mail in, this is pitiful. I haven’t got any questions to answer, and there’s no news, so I guess I’ll just have to tell you how much I love you and miss you; - and gosh baby, that’s a job. Oh, one thing, we did wade to the movin’-pictures tonight. The local theater (as they call it) is equipped with the finest 16 mm projector available, the only thing is they can’t get any 16 mm (mm= millimeter) film, so we have to suffer through colossal productions of some two-bit company that frowns on knee length dresses. Tonight the might spectacle was “The Dancing Pirate”. The Dancing pirate was some (I can’t spell it) bent 4 -F who could dance about as well as Ricky. What a show. Oh well, there’s only 11 more days to go. The last class they had here in March fired exactly 400 rounds per pilot, and they’re all in combat now, I guess. It’s a fine thing. It takes them {{about a year and a}} half to teach you to fly the airplane, and then they expect you to learn the most important thing, that might mean your neck someday, in 17 days! You can be the best flyer in the Air Corps. But if you can’t knock ‘em down, what the hell good are you? I can think of alot [sic] of good changes they could make in this program. Honey, do you like Nebraska, Lincoln in particular? I’m just wondering that’s all. So don’t bother packing your skis, yet. Say darling, what do you do for a stiff neck- neck? Boy I’ve got a beaut. This lying in the sack all day is killin’ me. Speaking of that angel, I guess I’d better climb back in, it’s getting late, as it usually does this time of night. Can’t understand it, every night at this time it gets late, -funny. I love you my darling and miss you terribly. If I don’t see you this weekend I will Sunday the 1 st sometime. That will be Easter Sunday won’t it? I hope I can be with you then darling. You have all my love and devotion- always. Your devoted husband, Judd [Translation ends...|$|E
