40|$|A UK {{company may}} give its {{shareholders}} {{the option to}} elect to receive additional shares in the company {{in lieu of a}} cash dividend. The share alternative is referred to as a scrip dividend. Scrip dividends offer tax savings to some UK companies, and may be beneficial to certain shareholders. The type of company that can benefit from scrip dividends is one that has <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> advance corporation tax (ACT). This may arise because the company distributes either foreign source profits or preference income (income that is subject to tax). There has been a {{decline in the number of}} companies with <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT over the past ten years. This has been largely due to the reduction of preference income following the Finance Act of 1984. On the basis of the analysis presented in the paper it is expected that companies with <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT will offer scrip dividends and, as the number of companies in this position has declined over the past decade, there will be a reduction in the number of companies offering scrip dividends. A company without <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT obtains a timing benefit rather than a tax savings by offering scrip dividends. As there are costs in offering scrip dividends, it is expected that companies without <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT will not offer scrip dividends. The results of the study show that the scrip dividends became popular amongst UK companies when fewer companies had preference income as the effect of the Finance Act of 1984. Also, contrary to expectations, companies without <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> ACT offer scrip dividends. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in the paper. The tax rules on scrip dividends make a scrip dividend equivalent to the value of the net cash dividend unattractive to some groups of shareholders. It is therefore expected that the take-up of the scrip alternative will be low. This is confirmed by the results of the stud...|$|R

30|$|From {{a policy}} viewpoint, these {{findings}} {{should be set}} {{in relation to the}} ongoing international tendency towards implementing more stringent accounting standards in order to foster governmental transparency. Obviously, governments must be prevented from cooking their books to disguise an unsustainable financial situation. However, in countries like Switzerland where budgetary policy follows a rather conservative stance, the possibility given to the government to use political finessing to somehow manage the fiscal performance allows it to sustain this stance and to fulfil the requirement of the fiscal rules when they exist. Depreciations management fosters a kind of elbow room to ensure <b>structural</b> <b>surpluses</b> or to prevent structural deficits. If accounting standards would rule it out, the structural surplus would be reported en pleine lumière, generating claims for tax cuts or spending increases which eventually threaten fiscal sustainability. Ultimately, a trade-off exists between the conflicting wishes for fiscal soundness and true and fair financial reporting in the public sector.|$|E

There are hints that the economy did not work in a Keynesian way but there is no proof of the existence of a Non-Keynesian effect.

Whereas standard consumption estimations failed, a model adding a factor containing asset wealth and expectations was finally able to explain consumption from 1996 onwards. This has important implications for policy. Moreover, compositional effects were found to be important. The two main findings of the paper, namely an asset wealth/expectations effect and compositional effects support the interpretation of a positive link between public savings, asset values and growth.

40|$|This paper calculates {{structural}} balances for EU-countries and relates them to fiscal sustainability. Although the Stability Pact implicitly {{accepts the}} need {{to distinguish between the}} structural and the cyclical component of net deficits, the issue of long-term sustainability is only covered by the need not to exceed a certain threshold value of the net lending. While the OECD and the European Commission (EU) assume constant elasticities when calculating cyclical budget components to derive structural deficits from the net deficits, the present paper choses time series technique to extract the structural balances directly. = Structural balances are calculated on a disaggregated level considering five different government receipts and expenditure components. With the same method, structural primary balances are estimated to analyse long-term sustainability of fiscal policy in the EU. Therefore, we set the structural primary surpluses against those primary balances, necessary to stabilise the debt to GDP ratio. It is shown that in some of the so-called core-countries like Germany and France, <b>structural</b> <b>surpluses</b> are still below those required to stabilize the debt ratio. ...|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to assess the role of {{institutions}} in the process of agricultural change. Throughout this study, the need for an institutional approach in studying contemporary change in rural areas is stressed; moreover, the structure of this institutional approach, capable of being extended to other substantive contexts, has been elaborated. The context for the study of institutions is agricultural despecialisation, an important context when related to regions in which agriculture has become specialised in products now in structural surplus. In this study, the European Community (EC) is singled out as the major institution tackling the problem of <b>structural</b> <b>surpluses</b> in agricultural production. The table wine sector provides the focus for the study of agricultural surpluses since it is characterised by large volumes of unsold surplus production and the need for winegrowers to be 'eased' into other types of agricu 1 tural production. Between the levels of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the viticultural holding, there are a range of institutions mediating in the process of despecialisation. The Languedoc-Roussillon, and in particular the departement of Herault, a highly specialised table wine producing region in southern France, is selected as the context for the study of these institutions and their impact upon the process of agricultural despecialisation out of vines...|$|E

40|$|From 2001 {{the fiscal}} policy in Chile {{has been based}} on a <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> rule. Under this rule, the {{government}} is committing itself to maintain its expenditures equal to the structural revenue minus the target for the <b>structural</b> <b>surplus,</b> which is expressed in terms of the GDP.

While the latter is calculated with a reference price determined as the average of past prices, panels of independent experts, who meet once a year, determine the two former. The fact that independent experts have substantial influence on the fiscal budget makes the Chilean fiscal rule different from similar rules applied in other countries.

40|$|The Stability and Growth Pact sets a {{medium-term}} {{target for}} fiscal policy of a budgetary position 'close to balance or in surplus'. This {{addition to the}} deficit rule defined by the Maastricht Treaty has been interpreted {{as an attempt to}} reconciliate the objective of sound public finances with the availability of adequate margins for stabilisation. However, with the debt rule set in the Treaty unchanged, there is a risk that the Pact will not fully achieve the desired reconciliation. Using the budget to implement stabilisation policy while still ensuring a reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio during cyclical downturns, as required by the Treaty, is likely to require large <b>structural</b> <b>surpluses.</b> Assuming positive nominal growth rates, the closer the debt ratio is to 60 per cent the larger are the surpluses needed. If countries with debt ratios higher than 60 per cent set insufficiently ambitious deficit targets, {{they will not be able}} to make full use of the margins allowed by the 3 per cent threshold. During cyclical downturns such countries may have to adopt a pro-cyclical budgetary stance.

40|$|James I, {{like his}} contemporaries Emperor Frederick II and Fernando III of Castile, {{was a major}} figure of the Mediterranean and Iberian Middle Ages. The scope of his {{achievements}} fully justifies the scientifically rigorous and forward-looking analysis of his work and inheritance being undertaken in 2008 by the peoples who were once part of the Catalan-Aragonese crown. For indeed, though some of his enterprises reveal insufficient foresight, a lack of vision of the future, {{much of what we}} are today in the demographic, economic, social, political and cultural spheres — and much of what we are not — was initially forged during his reign. Great personages, however, do not arise from nowhere or operate in a void: they are always the fruit of earlier ages and act within a particular context. Their powerful actions, moreover, produce an impact on their own era, causing it to evolve in accordance with their projects and building up a legacy. So what were the essential traits of the historical context of James I? When he occupied the throne, the final phase in the long period of demographic and economic growth fuelled by the feudal system all over the Western World was drawing to a close; a strong upsurge in trade was getting underway, closely associated with <b>structural</b> <b>surpluses</b> of farm produce caused by the reclaiming of barren land for two hundred years, increases in the amount of money in circulation and the availability of credit, and advances in technology and thought. During the first two-thirds of the 13 th century, the development of long-distance trading gave shape to western Europe along the Mediterranean and Atlantic seaboards and boosted the role of the bourgeoisie in economic, political and cultural life. It was a period of transition, during which the new Roman law vied with ancient feudal norms and the concentration of {{power in the hands of}} monarchs who no longer considered themselves merely the leading members of the nobility laid the foundations of the new territorial states. It was an age when sovereigns strove to make inroads into seigneuries that enjoyed immunity so as to recover jurisdictional and fiscal control over all the lands in their respective kingdoms; an age of rebellious nobles and administrative and tax reform, of the advance of ius commune over consuetudinary law. And it was then that curricula were renewed in the nascent universities, starting with law and medicine. While all these changes were taking place, the crusaders' last enclaves in Holy Land were slowly waning under pressure from the Mamluks, the Mongols were advancing on eastern Europe, and Christianity was fast gaining ground at the expense of Islam in the western Mediterranean...|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to assess empirically the {{sustainability}} of budgetary policy in Poland in Years 1992 - 2005. Our results show that <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> did not respond in a way that would stabilize the level of public debt, thus not fulfilling the condition of sustainability. It also showed asymmetric behaviour of revenues and expenditures: while the former tended to adjust to the level of debt in a stabilizing manner, the latter moved independently from debt, while also in a non-stationary way, which made fiscal policy unsustainable in the long run. Fiscal institutions were unable to respond in a debt- stabilizing manner to two large negative budgetary shocks: structural reforms of the public sector, and joining the EU. This makes them unlikely to respond to the future fiscal shocks, and suggests that fiscal institutions in Poland lack the ability to run sustainable fiscal policy. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} Chile’s <b>structural</b> <b>surplus</b> {{fiscal rule}} {{in the face of}} shocks to the world copper price. Two results are obtained. First, Chile’s current fiscal rule performs well if the policymaker (i) puts a premium on avoiding excessive volatility in fiscal instruments, and (ii) puts a relatively small weight on output volatility relative to inflation volatility in his/her objective function. A more aggressive countercyclical fiscal rule can attain lower output volatility, but there is a trade-off with somewhat higher inflation volatility and much higher instrument volatility. The ranking of in-struments between government spending and labor income taxes depends mainly on the instrument volatility the policymaker will tolerate. Second, given its then current stock of government assets, Chile’s adoption of a 0. 5 % surplus target starting in 2008 was desirable because the earlier 1 % target would have required significant further asset accumulation that could only have been accomplished at the expense of greater volatility in fiscal instruments and therefore in macroeconomic variables.
