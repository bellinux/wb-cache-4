5|$|Marriage was {{considered}} a civil ceremony, rather than a religious one. <b>Such</b> <b>an</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{may have been a}} habit that had developed during the Leiden years, as civil marriage was common in the Netherlands. However, the Pilgrims saw this arrangement as biblical, there being no evidence from Scripture that a minister should preside over a wedding.|$|E

Tensions between the United States and Britain had been high for several months {{as a result of}} British interference in U.S. commerce with France. As early as 1810, British agents had sought to secure an alliance with Native Americans to assist in the defense of Canada should hostilities break out, but the Natives had been reluctant to accept their offer, fearing they had little to benefit from <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>arrangement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Troop cars saw service through 1947, {{after which}} many were {{sold by the}} U.S. Army Transportation Corps to the railroads and {{subsequently}} converted into mail cars, express service boxcars, or refrigerator cars, while others remained in sleeper configuration for use in maintenance of way (MOW) service as bunk cars for the maintenance workers. Subsequent conflicts have not created the need for <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>arrangement,</b> partially due to the much smaller level of manpower involved but primarily due to the wider use of aircraft for long-distance transportation of troops.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Nuckols, laser-driven inertial fusion confinement {{was expected to}} require lasers {{of a few hundred}} kilojoules and use fuel droplets created by a perfume mister arrangement. LLNLs research since that time has demonstrated that <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>arrangement</b> cannot work, and requires machined assemblies for each shot. To be economically useful, an IFE machine would need to use fuel assemblies that cost pennies. Although LLNL does not release prices for their own targets, the similar system at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester makes targets for about $1 million each. It is suggested that NIF's targets cost more than $10,000.|$|E
5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to bleeding off air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>arrangement</b> would not be to easy to build.|$|E
5|$|Although the Offaly revolt was {{followed}} by a determination to rule Ireland more closely, Henry was wary of drawn-out conflict with the tribes, and a royal commission recommended that the only relationship with the tribes was to be promises of peace, their land protected from English expansion. The man to lead this effort was Sir Antony St Leger, as Lord Deputy of Ireland, who would remain into the post past Henry's death. Until the break with Rome, it was widely believed that Ireland was a Papal possession granted as a mere fiefdom to the English king, so in 1541 Henry asserted England's claim to the Kingdom of Ireland free from the Papal overlordship. This change did, however, also allow a policy of peaceful reconciliation and expansion: the Lords of Ireland would grant their lands to the King, before being returned as fiefdoms. The incentive to comply with Henry's request was an accompanying barony, and thus a right to sit in the Irish House of Lords, which was to run in parallel with England's. The Irish law of the tribes did not suit <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>arrangement,</b> because the chieftain did not have the required rights; this made progress tortuous, and the plan was abandoned in 1543, not to be replaced.|$|E

50|$|Initially the Faskari {{ruling class}} were first {{approached}} and pin-pointed for the District head (During {{the reign of}} Faskari Abu and Kogo Ummaru) but later on they declined the offer in favour of “Kogawa” {{as a result of}} chain of intermarriages between the Beri-Beri and the Gabirawa. After <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>arrangements</b> Faskari became the headquarters of the district area. Going by the history, Birnin Kogo was founded by Wanke Dan Jatau in 1848 during the reign of Sarkin Katsina Muhammed Bello. Among the notable rulers of Kogo Kingdom were Kogo Muhammadu Yamaman, Kogo Ali, Kogo Umar, Kogo Musa II, Kogo Abdu and Kogo Ibrahim. The death of Kogo Ibrahim and ascension of a new ruling family of the fulani brought about the change of the District head's title to Sarkin Yamma in 1975.|$|R
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{learns that}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) {{will be taking}} {{a leave of absence}} to go on jury duty for the Scranton Strangler trial, leading the {{corporate}} office to send Holly Flax (Amy Ryan) to cover for him. Michael forces Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to plan a second, classier Christmas party on the day Holly returns to Scranton. Michael welcomes Holly back, but becomes upset when she tells him that she and A.J. (Rob Huebel) are still in a relationship. Holly then tells the women of the office that she's giving A.J. an ultimatum: either propose to her by year's end or their relationship is over. Michael lies to Holly and tells her that he's seeing a woman named Tara from New York, and Holly shows curiosity, but Michael interprets this as potential jealousy. When Michael gets further upset over hearing about Holly's relationship with A.J., he takes her toy Woody from Toy Story—a present from A.J.—throws it in the trash, and pours his coffee on it. When Holly demands to know who did it, Michael comes forward and admits that he still has feelings for her and is hurt that, while they had to break up due to their long distance, she is nevertheless able to make <b>such</b> <b>an</b> <b>arrangement</b> work with A.J. This, in turn, makes her feel bad for Michael. A.J. arrives in Scranton to surprise Holly and Michael welcomes him politely. After cleaning Holly's Woody, he leaves the office and Pam follows him out, where he breaks down. In order to lift his spirits, Pam tells him about Holly's ultimatum, suggesting their relationship is not going to last very long. He returns to the party where he overhears Holly and A.J. talking about Woody, with Holly fabricating a story to cover for Michael's actions.|$|E

40|$|Diploma thesis "Eight-year grammar schools - escape or opportunity?" {{deals with}} {{controversial}} {{part of the}} czech educational system. Eight-year grammar schools have been established in 1849 and are part of czech educational system ever since with an interruption since 1948 to 1990. Their renewal in 1990 was motivated by return to tradition and need for high quality education for future elite. These arguments aren't to persuasive in closer view. Firstly grammar schools nowadays {{are different from those}} in the past and secondly results of researches do not confirm advantages of ability tracking. Approach of Ministery of Education to this institution changes with time, its inconsistency mirrors in differences in supply of this kind of education in regions and cities throughout the Czech Republic.
