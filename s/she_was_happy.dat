5|$|On 8 June 2010 Walton filmed {{her final}} scenes for the series, {{along with two}} fellow cast members Scare and Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris Fisher). She spoke of her upset over leaving her fellow cast members, but later said she {{was looking forward to}} {{pursuing}} other projects. Walton also confirmed that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> the door was left open for a potential return, stating that she would consider reprising her role as Loretta in the future. Walton also said she understood why Marquess axed her character, he did not feel Loretta had anywhere left to go after the cancellation of her main storyline. However, she also felt like she deserved another chance to prove herself.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of the Prince Imperial, Beatrice's brother, Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, {{suggested}} that she marry their sister Alice's widower, Louis IV, the Grand Duke of Hesse, who had lost his wife to diphtheria in 1878. Albert Edward argued that Beatrice could act as replacement mother for Louis's young children and spend most of her time in England looking after her mother. He further suggested the Queen could oversee the upbringing of her Hessian grandchildren with greater ease. However, at the time, it was forbidden by law for Beatrice to marry her sister's widower. This was countered by the Prince of Wales, who vehemently supported passage by the Houses of Parliament of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, which would have removed the obstacle. Despite popular support for this measure and although it passed in the House of Commons, it was rejected by the House of Lords because of opposition from the Lords Spiritual. Although the Queen was disappointed that the bill had failed, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> to keep her daughter at her side.|$|E

Instead, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> just showing <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>happy</b> while <b>she</b> types the message, or <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>happy</b> to have a feeling of {{enhanced}} friendship by texting the message. So it’s not realistic or practical for researchers to distinguish if the emotion is aroused by the content of the utterance or just emotions emerging parallel to the typing behavior or those related to the behavior. So function 7 was merged with 6.|$|R

5|$|Hoshino enjoyed drawing Lenalee's hair, despite {{finding her}} D.Gray-man {{character}} Yu Kanda's hair impossible to top. She enjoyed drawing Lenalee {{because of her}} personality, and her relationship with other series' characters such as Komui and Reever Wenhamm. Because her hair grew longer as the series went on, the author gave her different hairstyles. When the manga moved to Jump Square, a magazine for older readers, Hoshino decided to increase Lenalee's sex appeal by having her skirt shorter {{even though she is}} also wearing shorts beneath it. After Allen Walker became a fugitive from the Order, Hoshino wanted to have Lenalee chase after him, {{to the point where they}} would clash. When asked about Allen's farewell hug with Lenalee as he leaves the Order, Hoshino joked that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> with how Lenalee had matured, and at the same time become taller than Allen, in contrast to the beginning of the series when they were both the same height.|$|E
5|$|The Yakamas {{also have}} a legend {{attempting}} to explain Adams’ squat appearance. Long ago, the Sun was a man and he had five wives who were mountains: Plash-Plash (the Goat Rocks), Wahkshum (the Simcoe Mountains), Pahto (Adams), Rainier, and St. Helens. Because she was the third wife to be greeted by the Sun in the morning, Pahto became jealous. She broke down both Plash-Plash and Wahkshum, but left Rainier and St. Helens alone. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> that she was now {{the first to be}} greeted, but wanted more, so she crossed the Columbia and took plants and animals from the mountains there. The other mountains were afraid of her, but Klah Klahnee (the Three Sisters) convinced Wyeast (Hood) to confront Pahto. Wyeast initially tried being nice, but Pahto would have none of it. So Wyeast hit her head and knocked it off, creating Devils Garden. Wyeast then shared what Pahto had taken {{with the rest of the}} mountains. After this, Pahto became mean and she would send thunderstorms, heavy rain, and snow to the valleys below. The Great Spirit had been watching all this time and came to Pahto. He gave her a new head in the form of White Eagle and his son Red Eagle and he reminded her that she was his daughter. Pahto repented and promised to stop being mean and greedy.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, she volunteered for the Union Army as a civilian. The U.S. Army had no female surgeons, and at first she was allowed to practice only as a nurse. During this period, she served at the First Battle of Bull Run (Manassas), July 21, 1861, and at the Patent Office Hospital in Washington, D.C. She worked as an unpaid field surgeon near the Union front lines, including at the Battle of Fredericksburg and in Chattanooga after the Battle of Chickamauga. As a suffragist, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> to see women serving as soldiers, and alerted the press to the case of Frances Hook, in Ward 2 of the Chattanooga hospital, a woman who served in the Union forces disguised as a man. Walker was the first female surgeon of the Union army. She wore men's clothing during her work, claiming it to be easier for high demands of her work.|$|E
25|$|In late 2005 {{she felt}} the urge to return athletics, juggling her {{training}} and caring for her son. A loss to Nataliya Tobias at the 2006 national championships inspired her to restart her professional career and she began training with Iryna Lishchynska. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> with her improving times but suffered a narrow exit in the semi-finals at the 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships. The outdoor season in 2007 {{proved to be a}} turning point however; she took the silver medal at the 2007 European Cup and set new 400 metres and 800metres personal bests. She ran the 800m under two minutes {{for the first time at}} the national championships, winning in 1.59.60seconds. Further improvements came shortly afterwards at the 2007 Summer Universiade where she won the gold medal, setting a world-leading time of 1.57.63seconds. The pressure to compete at the 2007 World Championships as world-leader proved too much for Krevsun, and she was knocked out in the heats with a below-par 2.02.45minutes. However, at the end of the season she was still the fifth fastest 800m athlete that year.|$|E

25|$|Yaroslavna {{is alone}} {{worrying}} about why {{she has not}} heard from Igor and his companions (Yaroslavna's Arioso). She sings of her tearful nights and nightmares and reminisces about when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>happy</b> with Igor by her side. The nurse brings in the young women who tell Yaroslavna of their abducted friend. They are reluctant at first to reveal the culprit but eventually name Galitsky and talk of {{how he and his}} drunken followers cause trouble around Putivl. Galitsky enters and the women run away. Yaroslavna questions him as to the truth of their story and he mocks her saying she should treat him as a guest in her house. She threatens him with what Igor will do on his return, but Galitsky replies that he can seize the throne whenever he wants. Yaroslavna accuses him of repeating the betrayal that he carried out against their father, but he replies that he was only joking and asks if she has a lover now her husband is away. She threatens him with sending him back to their father. He replies that he will return the girl but will take another later and leaves. The council of boyars arrive to inform Yaroslavna that the Polovtsy under Khan Gzak are about to attack Putivl. Igor's army has been utterly destroyed and he has been wounded and captured with his son and brother. After a moment of faintness, Yaroslavna orders messengers sent to the city's allies, but the Boyars report that the roads are cut, some towns are in revolt and their princes will be captured. The Boyars say that they will organise the defence but Galitsky returns with his followers to demand that a new Prince be chosen. His retinue say it should be him as he is Yaroslavna's brother and Igor's brother-in-law. The boyars refuse. The argument is interrupted by the sight of flames and the sound of crying women. Some of the boyars flee; some join the battle, others guard the Princess. They call the attack God's judgment.|$|E
