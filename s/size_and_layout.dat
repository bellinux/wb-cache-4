5|$|Early in {{its life}} the site {{consisted}} of a single ditch encompassing an area of about , with two gateways, one in the south-west and another in the east; two more rings of ditches were added later. The north part of the fort was occupied by four-post structures, probably granaries, which were later replaced by storage pits, and in the south part, there were roundhouses in between granaries and storage pits. When Danebury {{was built in the}} 6th century BC, it coincided with the construction of several other hillforts in the Wessex region, all of a similar <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout.</b>|$|E
5|$|Blore's {{new plan}} for the corps de logis of house was {{constrained}} by Vorontsov's wish to use the footings and foundations which had been built for Harrison's original design; this severely restricted the shape, <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> of the palaces principal rooms. However, rather than erect a compact and low classical villa, as Harrison had designed, Blore's plan was radically different, with strong English Tudor Renaissance features on the northern side, and an eclectic medley of western and Islamic features on the southern. The central bay of the southern facade was inspired by Delhi's Jummah Masjid mosque, which enabled the classical exedra of Harrison's design to be incorporated, once given an Islamic makeover, harmoniously into the design.|$|E
40|$|Thispaper {{proposes a}} method for {{achieving}} low-power control-logic modules {{using a combination of}} CMOS complex gate reorganiza-tion, transistor <b>size</b> optimization, <b>and</b> transistor <b>layout.</b> Complex gate reorganization minimizes transistor count and net count with-out changing the functionality of the circuit. Transistor <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> are interdependent, the optimization of one results in the optimization of the other. The authors applied the reorganization method to a 2400 -transistor circuit, and succeeded in reducing the transistor count by 12 %, and the net count by 13 %. Transistor <b>sizing</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> compaction reduced the average transistor size by one eighth, while the same delay was maintained. Power dissipa-tion was cut to less than half, even when wiring capacitances were dominant. ...|$|R

25|$|The <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> of {{the airport}} and overall {{complexity}} caused {{by the lack of}} taxiways mean that the airport gets very busy during peak hours. The air traffic controllers have to deal with over 38 flights an hour on a runway requiring a lengthy backtrack for each aircraft needing to depart from runway 27 or land on runway 09. Operations are restricted to 06:30 to 22:30 Monday to Friday, 06:30 to 13:00 on Saturdays and 12:30 to 22:30 on Sundays. These restrictions are related to noise.|$|E
25|$|Player {{and team}} {{strategy}} {{varies depending on}} the <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> {{of the field and}} the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents {{to reduce the number of}} directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get a good shot at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.|$|E
500|$|Krak des Chevaliers can be {{classified}} both as a spur castle, due to its site, and after the 13th-century expansion a fully developed concentric castle. It was similar in <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> to Vadum Jacob, a Crusader castle built in the late 1170s. Margat has also been cited as Krak des Chevaliers' sister castle. The main building material at Krak des Chevaliers was limestone; the ashlar facing is so fine that the mortar is barely noticeable. Outside the castle's entrance was a [...] "walled suburb" [...] known as a burgus, no trace of which remains. To {{the south of the}} outer ward was a triangular outwork and the Crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it. It is unknown how it was defended {{at the time of the}} 1271 siege, though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber palisade. South of the castle the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill, so that siege engines can approach on level ground. The inner defences are strongest at this point, with a cluster of towers connected by a thick wall.|$|E

2500|$|After the Spanish {{conquest of}} the Aztec empire in 1521, the Spanish rebuilt and renamed Tenochtitlan as Mexico City.

2500|$|Dissatisfied {{with the}} <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> of the West Wing, President Franklin D. Roosevelt engaged Gugler to {{redesign}} it in 1933. To create additional space without increasing the apparent {{size of the}} building, he excavated a full basement, added a set of subterranean offices under the adjacent lawn, and built an unobtrusive [...] "penthouse" [...] story. The directive to wring the most office space out of the existing building was responsible for its narrow corridors and cramped staff offices. His most visible addition was {{the expansion of the}} building eastward for a new Cabinet Room and Oval Office.|$|E
2500|$|The twenty-five mounds {{that are}} now {{recognized}} range from barely noticeable rises to the massive Mound A, which is [...] high and covers nearly two acres. [...] It is believed that the lower rises were used as house substructures and repeatedly reconstructed. The larger mounds were most likely used for ceremonial purposes rather than residential. [...] Until recent erosion, earthen ramps could be seen climbing to the summits of these large mounds. Seven of the mounds are situated along the bank of George Lake and six more are located within the embankment. The remaining twelve mounds are positioned around the two plazas situated {{to the east and}} west of Mound A.

2500|$|Paintball {{is played}} at both {{commercial}} venues, which require paid admission, and private land; {{both of which}} may include multiple fields of varying <b>size</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout.</b> Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain, and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or urban area, and may involve a historical context. [...] Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable bunkers; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers {{are little more than}} air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe. The use of plastic pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as [...] "can" [...] and [...] "snake" [...] bunkers, were derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract â€” We {{address the}} problem of {{crosstalk}} computation and reduction using circuit <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> techniques in this paper. We provide easily computable expressions for crosstalk amplitude and pulse width in resistive, capacitively coupled lines. The expressions hold for nets with arbitrary number of pins and of arbitrary topology under any specified input excitation. Experimental results show that the average error is about 10 % and the maximum error is less than 20 %. The expressions are used to motivate circuit techniques, such as transistor <b>sizing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>layout</b> techniques, such as wire ordering and wire width optimization to reduce crosstalk.
