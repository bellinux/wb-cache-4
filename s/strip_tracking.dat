40|$|Robust {{tracking}} is {{an essential}} tool to address {{the full range of}} physics which can be accessed at LHC. The CMS Collaboration has chosen the detector technology for the Silicon <b>Strip</b> <b>tracking</b> system. Over the last few years considerable {{progress has been made in}} the understanding of the operation of silicon strip detectors in the harsh environment of the LHC. An overview of recent results is given with particular emphasis on resistivity and crystal orientation of the substrate, strip capacitance and breakdown voltage. (2 refs) ...|$|E
40|$|In the {{finishing}} mill, steel strip is rolled from thick slabs through pairs of rollers {{housed in a}} continuous train of seven roll stands. As the strip is rolled, unwanted lateral movement, known as <b>strip</b> <b>tracking,</b> can cause the strip to collide {{with the edge of}} the mill. <b>Strip</b> <b>tracking</b> control is currently a manual operation, relying on the skill of the operators. When tracking is observed, the stand tilt is adjusted asymmetrically, causing a camber in the strip, steering it towards the centreline. Tracking control can be automated if a reliable measurement of position is available. A vision-based system was developed to measure strip position. Cooling water, steam, high temperatures and electrical noise create a hazardous environment for electronic equipment and hamper image analysis. Hardware was specified to protect all equipment against the environment. A novel image analysis method combining predictive elements, filtering and Bezier curve fitting was created to allow measurements to be made with large amounts of cooling water obscuring the strip edges. The measurement system was designed to integrate with the existing mill systems, using the OPC protocol for communication. The system was created as a development system with only two cameras included, but allowed for additional cameras to be easily added and automatically detected. The results of the system showed that the image analysis techniques were effective, providing an estimated final resolution of 3. 5 mm/pixel, with measurements ± 2 mm within 60 % confidence. Hardware performance provided good protection of the equipment against the environment but poor quality installation limited overall system performance. A computer model was developed to simulate tracking behaviour in the mill with non-linear variations of strip properties across the strip. The model was not completed to a satisfactory standard capable of producing useful results but the theories described could be developed further.

40|$|This {{proposal}} {{is for the}} continuation of the High Energy Physics Program at the University of California, Riverside. In 1990, we will concentrate on analysis of LEP data from the OPAL detector. We expect to record 10 {sup 5 } Z`s by the end of 1989 and 10 {sup 6 } in 1990. This data will be used to measure the number of quark-lepton families in the universe. In the second half of 1990 we will also be occupied with the installation of the D-Zero detector in the Tevatron Collider and the preparation of software for the 1991 run. A new initiative made possible by generous university support is a laboratory for detector development at UCR. The focus will be on silicon <b>strip</b> <b>tracking</b> detectors both for the D-Zero upgrade and for SSC physics. The theory program will pursue further various mass-generating radiative mechanisms for understanding small quark and lepton masses as well as some novel phenomenological aspects of supersymmetry...|$|E
40|$|The Tracker of the CMS silicon <b>strip</b> <b>tracking</b> {{detector}} {{covers a}} surface of 206 m 2. 9648128 channels {{are available on}} 75376 APV front-end chips on 15232 modules, built of 24328 silicon sensors. The power supply of the detector modules is split up in 1944 power supplies with two low voltage for front end power and two high voltage channels each for the bias voltage of the silicon sensors. In addition 356 low voltage channels are needed to power the control chain. The tracker will run at - 20 °C at low relative humidity for at least 10 years. The Tracker Control System handles all interdependencies of control, low and high voltages, as well as fast ramp downs in case of higher than allowed temperatures or currents in the detector and experimental cavern problems. This is ensured by evaluating $ 10 ^{ 4 }$ power supply parameters, $ 10 ^{ 3 }$ information from Tracker Safety System and $ 10 ^{ 5 }$ information from the tracker front end...|$|E
40|$|In {{about ten}} years from now, the Phase- 2 upgrade of the LHC is planned. This {{will result in a}} severe {{radiation}} dose and high particle rates for the multipurpose exeperiments because of a foreseen luminosity of ten times higher the LHC design luminosity. Several detector components will have to be upgraded in the experiments. In the ATLAS experiment the current inner detector will be replaced by an all silicon tracking detector aiming for high performance. The poster will present the development and the latest prototyping of the upgrade silicon <b>strip</b> <b>tracking</b> detector. Its layout foresees low mass and modular double-sided structures for the barrel and forward region. Silicon sensors and readout electronics, so-called modules, are planned to be assembled double-sided on larger carbon-core structures. The modularity allows assembly and testing at multiple sites. Many components need to be developed and their prototyping towards full-size components is ongoing. New developments and test results will be presented. Both silicon sensors and latest electronic readout components and assembly procedures will be shown. The poster will also discuss the experience with the prototyping and give an outlook towards final production...|$|E

40|$|Neovascularization after vein {{stripping}} is well {{recognized as}} a contributory cause of varicose vein recurrence. Treatment is challenging because of segment tortuosity and fibrous web formation. Surgical re-exploration is practiced, but foam sclerotherapy is becoming preferred.

40|$|The Beam Condition Monitor (BCM) of the CMS {{detector}} at the LHC is {{a protection}} device {{similar to the}} LHC Beam Loss Monitor system. While the electronics used is the same, poly-crystalline Chemical Vapor Deposition (pCVD) diamonds are used instead of ionization chambers as the BCM sensor material. The main purpose {{of the system is}} the protection of the silicon Pixel and <b>Strip</b> <b>tracking</b> detectors by inducing a beam dump, if the beam losses are too high in the CMS detector. By comparing the detector current with the instantaneous luminosity, the BCM detector efficiency can be monitored. The number of radiation-induced defects in the diamond, reduces the charge collection distance, and hence lowers the signal. The number of these induced defects can be simulated using the FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation. The cross-section for creating defects increases with decreasing energies of the impinging particles. This explains, why diamond sensors mounted close to heavy calorimeters experience more radiation damage, because of the high number of low energy neutrons in these regions. The signal decrease was stronger than expected from the number of simulated defects. Here polarization from trapped charge carriers in the defects is a likely candidate for explaining the difference, as suggested by Transient Current Technique (TCT) measurements. A single-crystalline (sCVD) diamond sensor shows a faster relative signal decrease than a pCVD sensor mounted at the same location. This is expected, since the relative {{increase in the number of}} defects is larger in sCVD than in pCVD sensors...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} of two Technical Design Report {{documents}} that describe the upgrade of the central tracking system for the ATLAS experiment for the operation at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) starting in the middle of 2026. At this time the LHC will have been upgraded to reach a peak instantaneous luminosity of 7. 5 x 10 ^ 34 cm^[- 2]s^[- 1], which corresponds to approximately 200 inelastic proton-proton collisions per beam crossing. The new Inner Tracker (ITk) will be operational for more than ten years, during which ATLAS aims to accumulate a total data set of 3, 000 fb^[- 1]. Meeting these requirements presents a unique challenge for the design of an all-silicon tracking system that consists of a pixel detector at small radius close to the beam line and a large-area <b>strip</b> <b>tracking</b> detector surrounding it. This document presents in detail the requirements of the new tracker, its layout and expected performance including the results of several benchmark physics studies at the highest numbers of collisions per beam crossing. The design, construction and expected performance of the large-area silicon-strip tracker are set out in detail. These include the results of measurements of prototype modules and associated support structures and the plans for their mass production. A short description is given {{of the state of the}} development of the pixel tracker, which will be presented in detail in the second Technical Design Report document one year from now. This document will also describe the management of the project, its schedule and major milestones. The costs of the new tracker and the collaboration that plans to build it are also presented...|$|E

40|$|The Medium Energy Gamma-ray Astronomy (MEGA) {{telescope}} concept {{will soon}} be proposed as a MIDEX mission. This mission would enable a sensitive all-sky survey of the medium-energy gamma-ray sky (0. 4 – 50 MeV) and bridge the huge sensitivity gap left after {{the demise of the}} COMPTEL and OSSE experiments on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. The scientific goals include compiling a much larger catalog of sources in this energy range, performing far deeper searches for long-lived nuclear lines from supernovae, novae, and supernova remnants, studying prompt decay lines from solar flares and the interstellar medium, better measuring the diffuse galactic continuum and line emissions, identifying the components of the cosmic diffuse gamma-ray emission, searching for nuclear resonance absorption features in bright continuum spectra, and studying the medium-energy properties of black holes, pulsars, and gamma-ray bursts.
