5000|$|The best {{starter in}} the team's {{rotation}} {{is called the}} ace. He is usually followed in the rotation by 3 or 4 other starters before he would be due to pitch again. Barring injury or exceptional circumstances, the ace is usually the pitcher that starts on Opening Day. Aces are also preferred to start crucial games {{late in the season}} and in the playoffs; sometimes they are asked to pitch on shorter rest if the team feels he would be more effective than the 4th or 5th starter.

40|$|Introduction. Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that differences in rescuer strength and compression <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> are strongly associated with the quality of chest compression. We hypothesised that changing the <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> from two minutes to one would {{have a positive effect on}} the quality of chest compression in two-rescuer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), regardless of rescuer strength. Methods. Thirty-nine senior medical students participated in this prospective, simulation-based, crossover study. After evaluation of muscle strength using a handgrip dynamometer, each participant was required to perform two sets of compressions separated by a 15 -minute rest. Participants started with either four cycles of chest compressions for one minute followed by a one-minute rest (1 -MCS), or with two cycles of chest compressions for two minutes followed by a two-minute rest (2 -MCS). After a 15 -minute break, participants switched groups and performed the other set of compressions. Mean compression depth (MCD), mean adequate compression (MAC), and adequate compression ratio (ACR) per minute were measured for each group. Subjective fatigue was reported after the completion of each set of compression cycles. Results. Rescuer strength was strongly correlated with MCD (p < 0. 01), MAC ratio (p < 0. 01), and ACR (p < 0. 01), and cycle group was correlated with MCD (p < 0. 01) and ACR (p = 0. 03). Subjective fatigue with 1 -MCS was lower than with 2 -MCS, regardless of rescuer strength. Conclusion. We found that the quality of chest compressions could be improved by changing the <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> from two minutes to one, regardless of rescuer strength. Therefore, reducing the existing <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> recommended in guidelines for two rescuers could be beneficial...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Scan shift {{power can}} be reduced by {{activating}} only a subset of scan cells in each <b>shift</b> <b>cycle.</b> In contrast to shift power reduction, the use of only a subset of scan cells to capture responses in a cycle may cause capture violations, thereby leading to fault coverage loss. In order to restore the original fault coverage, new test patterns must be generated, leading to higher test-data volume. In this paper, we propose minimum-violations partitioning (MVP), a scan-cell clustering method that can support multiple capture cycles in delay testing without increasing test-data volume. This method {{is based on an}} integer linear programming model and it can cluster the scan flip-flops into balanced parts with minimum capture violations. Based on this approach, hierarchical partitioning is proposed to make the partitioning method routingaware.

40|$|Power {{dissipation}} during scan {{testing is}} becoming an important concern as design sizes and gate densities increase. While several approaches have been recently proposed for reducing power dissipation during the <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> (minimum transition don't care fill, special scan cells and scan chain partitioning), very little work {{has been carried out}} towards reducing the peak power during test response capture and the few existing approaches for reducing capture power rely on complex ATPG algorithms. This paper proposes a scan architecture with mutually exclusive scan segment activation which overcomes the shortcomings of previous approaches. The proposed architecture achieves both shift and capture power reduction with no impact on the performance of the design, and with minimal impact on area and testing time (typically 2 - 3 %). An algorithmic procedure for assigning flip-flips to scan segments enables reuse of test patterns generated by standard ATPG tools. An implementation of the proposed method had been integrated into an automated design flow using commercial synthesis and simulation tools which was used {{on a wide range of}} benchmark designs. Reductions up to 57 % in average power, and up to 44 % and 34 % in peak power dissipation during shift and capture cycles, respectively, were obtained when using two scan segments. Increasing the number of scan segments to six leads to reductions of 96 % and 80 % in average power and respectively maximum number of simultaneous transitions...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a promising candidate to replace the conventional fossil fuel, and thus attracted enormous research efforts. However, hydrogen storage remains {{to be a big}} challenge to its practical applications. Consequently, the investigation of suitable hydrogen storage materials has become a highly active research field. Here we reported the first high pressure studies of three promising hydrogen storage materials, N(CH 3) 3 BH 3, NH(CH 3) 2 BH 3 and NaNH 2 BH 3 by Raman and IR spectroscopy. First, N(CH 3) 3 BH 3 was studied at room temperature and pressures up to 30 GPa. Under ambient conditions, N(CH 3) 3 BH 3 forms rhombohedral crystals. During compression, two phases transitions were observed, which was evidenced by the rich profile changes in Raman and IR spectra as well as by examining the pressure dependence of Raman and IR modes. Raman and IR spectra collectively revealed consistent structural information of N(CH 3) 3 BH 3. The pressure-induced phase transitions were reversible, indicated by the recovered Raman and IR modes upon decompression. Similarly, the other two hydrogen storage materials, NH(CH 3) 2 BH 3 and NaNH 2 BH 3 were investigated under high pressures up to 20 and 14 GPa, respectively. NH(CH 3) 2 BH 3 was found to experience two phase transitions from the parent monoclinic structure. An interesting red shift and subsequent blue <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> of N-H stretching mode was also observed. The decompression experiment suggested that the pressure-induced phase transitions were reversible. The changes of Raman and IR spectra under pressure together with factor group analysis provided us a chance to examine the possible high-pressure structure. On the other hand, NaNH 2 BH 3, which crystalizes into orthorhombic structure at ambient pressure,underwent two phase transitions during the compression process. The pressure-induced phase transitions turned out to be reversible upon decompression. Moreover, the bonding behaviors of NaNH 2 BH 3 were found to be different from NH 3 BH 3, which has implications for improved hydrogen storage performance...|$|E

40|$|Napping {{has been}} {{explored}} extensively {{as a means}} of counteracting the negative effects associated with shift work. A significant amount of this research has focused on the implementation of scheduled naps, with few studies considering flexible nap schemes. The current study therefore aimed to assess the effects of a flexible nap opportunity on the physiological, cognitive, performance, neurophysiological and subjective responses of a group of non shift workers {{over the course of a}} three-day simulated night shift regime. Additional foci were the effects of the nap condition on the extent of the circadian adaptation of the subjects to the irregular work schedule and the circadian-related influences associated with being awake during the night. 36 subjects – 18 males and 18 females – were recruited to participate in the current study. The data collection spanned twelve days, during which four, three-day long shift cycles were set up: three night shift cycles and one day <b>shift</b> <b>cycle.</b> During each night <b>shift</b> <b>cycle,</b> three separate experimental conditions were staggered, namely the nap condition, the no nap condition and a booster break condition (a collaborative study that completed the setup). The day shift served as a further comparison. Each cycle comprised of 12 subjects, which meant there were four subjects per condition during each cycle. The shifts were 8 hours in duration, with the no nap group following a standard break schedule evinced in industry. The three breaks taken during the shifts amounted to a total time of 1 hour. The nap group was afforded a 1 hour flexible nap opportunity between 00 h 00 and 03 h 00 with no other breaks. Therefore, both conditions had the same amount of work time. During the shifts, subjects performed two simple, low arousal tasks (beading and packing) and completed a test battery roughly every two hours which was comprised of physiological, performance, neurophysiological and subjective measures. It was found that the inclusion of the nap opportunity significantly improved output performance and response time during a low precision, modified Fitts tapping task over the course of three night shifts, relative to no napping. Physiologically, napping resulted in higher heart rate frequency measures by the end of the shifts, which were also accompanied by significant reductions in subjective sleepiness ratings during all iii the night shifts. The nap group’s responses in this case, did not differ significantly from those of the day shift. Both simple reaction time and memory performances improved as a result of the nap inclusion, but only during the third night shift. The majority of the measures included in the research also depicted the effects of the circadian rhythm, which was indicative of the pronounced effect that this natural biological down regulation has on performance during the night. Napping reduced the severity of these effects during beading performance and measures of subjective sleepiness. With regard to habituation, the nap opportunity also resulted in positive changes in the responses of beading performance, high precision response time, simple reaction time and both subjective sleepiness measures, relative to no napping. Sleep diary responses indicated that although sleep length and quality during the day were significantly reduced for both night-time conditions, recovery sleep (length and quality) for the nap group did not differ significantly from the no nap group. The findings of this research indicate that the inclusion of a flexible napping opportunity during the night shift had positive effects on some physiological, performance and subjective responses, and that this intervention is as beneficial as scheduled napping. Specifically, napping resulted in a significantly higher output during the beading task, relative to the no nap group despite the duration of work time being the same. As such the introduction of a flexible, self-selected nap opportunity is a practical, effective and individual-specific means of alleviating the negative effects of shift work, while improving certain performance parameters. Therefore, industries should consider its inclusion in their fatigue management programs. However, contextspecific considerations must be made, with regard work scheduling, individual differences and task demands when implementing such an intervention. This will ensure that its introduction will be well received and in time, lessen the health and work-related decrements associated with shift work...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the findings from}} three separate studies. The first two studies (chapter two) {{are concerned with the}} impact of the compressed workweek (CWW) on the well-being of shiftworkers. One study was based in a Coal mine and the other, in a Steelworks. The Steel study also included an interview of the shiftworkers (Chapter three), an analysis of absenteeism (Chapter four) and safety (Chapter five). The third study (Chapter six) made use of a road accident database to demonstrate the effect of time of day on the distribution of single vehicle accidents (SVA). In addition this database also allowed an investigation of the omission recording errors by shiftworking policeman as a function of time of day (Chapter seven). The Coal and Steel studies used a longitudinal repeated measures design to examine the impact of a change from a continuous weekly 8 -h shift to a continuous fast rotating 12 -h shift. In both these studies, survey and sleep data served as dependent measures. The survey material was primarily based on scales from the Standard Shiftwork Index (Barton et al. 1995). Sleep data was obtained across complete shift cycles using sleep diaries. The sleep data were examined in terms of the expectations from the Sleep Deprivation Model (Tepas 2 ̆ 6 Mahan, 1989). The quantitative analysis of these data were supported by some qualitative analysis of changes in sleep pattern. Specifically, changes in the daily deviation from mean sleep and cumulative sleep gain/loss across the <b>shift</b> <b>cycle,</b> between 8 -h and 12 -h shifts were examined. In the Steel study, the effect of the change to 12 -h shifts was further supported by additional studies. The interview study (chapter three) had two primary aims. The first was to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the change in rotation speed and shift length by interviewing the shiftworkers. The second was to explore the changes in sleep strategies {{as a result of the}} change to a faster rotation. Shiftworkers completed 2 ̆ 7 estimated 2 ̆ 7 sleep durations based on a number of hypothetical shift patterns and provided a rationale for these choices. Consistent with many studies, strong support was found for 12 -h shifts and this was attributed to the increased time away from work and the reduced number of consecutive night shifts. In general, a number of SSI measures showed improvements but few were significant. Self report and interview data both recorded shiftworker awareness of trading sleep loss for social gain. The intent to leave shiftwork was reduced but nonetheless present on 12 -h shifts. This suggested that 12 -h shifts do not solve, but reduce the problems associated with shiftwork. In the Coal study, shiftworkers reported a willingness to 2 ̆ 7 slow 2 ̆ 7 their 12 -h shifts to provide more rest days between work periods. Other indicants of fatigue were self reported increases in sleep need and changes in napping behaviour. No main effects for total sleep time (TST) were found between 8 -h and 12 -h shifts. Mean TST was achieved by a marked redistribution of sleep on 12 -h shifts. In particular, 12 -h shifts were associated with significant reductions in sleep for night shifts and increased sleep on day shift and days off. These findings need to consider the high probability of a type II error due to the low power findings associated with the small sample size, expected effect size and choice of alpha. While the changes in mean TST were of interest, the sample size also allowed for an extensive analysis of complete sleep records as a function of the change in shift schedules. In particular, it was suggested that changes in mean distribution of TST may be a more important indicant of fatigue than simply using the mean as the marker. The effect of the faster rotation on cumulative sleep gain/loss across the <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> provided mixed results. In the Coal study, the number of shifts worked and the total number of days in the cycle when mean daily sleep was below the cycle mean sleep average, decreased on 12 -h shifts. In the Steel study, the number of shifts worked increased when mean TST was below the mean for the cycle but an improvement was found for the total number of days. These differences may be attributed to the different forms of the 12 -h shifts in the two studies. Absence (chapter four) in the Steel study was significantly less on 12 -h shifts but this was best explained by a remuneration policy that no longer provided overtime payment A case study analysis of absence suggested that absence was used in combination with other factors to redesign the shift schedules. During 8 -h shifts absence was used o 2 ̆ 7 compress 2 ̆ 7 the workweek and overtime was used to increase mean earnings. On 12 -h shifts, absence was augmented by examining when single days of annual leave and small periods of annual leave, were taken across the <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> (non-attendance). This analysis suggested non-attendance was used to reduce exposure to three consecutive shifts, especially night shifts. This strategy also served to increase the number of days off from two to three days. The interview data also reported three night shifts were problematic and that two days off were insufficient. The change to 12 -h shifts in the Steel study had no effect on safety (chapter five). This is most likely due to the fact that accidents are rare events and that too short a time period for comparison had elapsed. Nonetheless, some indication of increased accident frequency was found for the same time of day on 12 -h shifts. The methodological and practical difficulties of examining performance in the Coal and Steel studies, led to the use of a road accident database to demonstrate the performance implications by time of day. This database was used to conduct two studies. Chapter six examined the time of day distribution in single vehicle accidents by driver age, gender and day of the week. Chapter seven examined the time of day variability in omission errors by shiftworking police officers. The time of day accident distribution for SVA was in line with international findings (Home 2 ̆ 6 Reyner, 1995 a, 1995 b). Correcting the accident rate for traffic density suggested the greatest accident risk was at 03. 00, with a secondary peak at 14. 00. The effect of age, gender and day of the week on accident frequency was also demonstrated. These data were also used to develop an alternative method to using traffic density to adjust accident frequency. The Driver Characteristics Model may provide a better measure for examining the effects of sleepiness. The timing of these single vehicle accidents suggested the influence of the sleepiness rhythm on performance, after a number of other accident causation factors were removed from the analysis. This database also reflected the accuracy in accident form completion of shiftworking policemen. Performance was lowest at 02. 00 but a clear afternoon peak was not obtained. The error rate was found not to be related to accident severity or workload. This analysis also suggested that night time performance is sensitive to task differences. The final chapter seeks a synthesis of the studies presented in this research. In particular, it makes some additional comments concerning methodology and some recommendations for designing 12 -h shifts. Key limitations to these results and suggestions for future study are also made. While 12 -h shifts are clearly supported by employees, it is reasonable to suggest they are superior in comparison to poorly designed 8 -h shifts (Lowden et al. 1998). Therefore, innovative shiftwork solutions need to be developed and tested, in order to provide flexibility and a safe working environment. A key message is that 12 -h shifts may reduce chronic exposure but not the total exposure to night work. Therefore, innovative shift systems need to reduce the number of night shifts and not repackage the same number of night shifts into smaller blocks...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research into shift work, workers working under rotating shift conditions are still plagued by {{the effects of}} the desynchronisation resulting from working against their natural circadian rhythms. Additionally, modern industries are shifting towards tasks requiring greater cognitive demand with less manual labour incorporated into the tasks. Research into operator based tasks, and hence those of a sedentary cognitive base both during day and night shifts, has been focusing on the effectiveness of the standard rest/break schedule. Research indicating that the standard rest break schedule is often ineffective in eliminating operator discomfort and performance deterioration, with these affects argued to be more pronounced during a night shift schedule. Therefore current research set out to investigate alternative rest break schedules, incorporating a short bout of physical activity and stretching exercises which are proposed to enhance performance and subjective mood, while eliminating operator discomfort for sedentary based cognitive tasks. Three conditions were tested during a three day habituation <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> within a laboratory, incorporating two night shift groups (control and experimental) and a control day shift group. Twelve subjects made up each group, with the two night shift groups completing the shift schedule together. The control groups followed a typical 8 hour shift schedule while the experimental group performed a booster break (exercise and stretches) activity for 7. 5 minutes every hour during the night shift schedule. Over the course of the shift, subjects completed a battery of six tests providing data on physiological measurements (heart rate and temperature), performance criteria (reaction time responses, memory and neurobiological) and subjective measures. Responses obtained for all the different parameters measured indicated a strong circadian influence {{for the majority of the}} variables, indicating the course of natural down regulation within physiological and performance criteria over the night shift. The booster break significantly improved reaction time performance, subjective ratings and resulted in a high sustainable activity level. Day shift comparisons indicating that within subjective measures and reaction time performance, the booster break resulted in similar responses to those of the day shift workers, while the control night shift groups reported significantly lowers results. Additionally, the booster break had positive influences during the circadian nadir, significantly improving parameters of performance and subjective ratings of sleepiness. The results of this study indicating which variables are strong predictors and indicators of the oscillations in performance and subjective ratings due to the circadian changes. The booster break interventions had positive effects on subjective ratings and reaction time performance, while also being argued to decrease the burden placed on the cardiac system as a result of increased sympathetic tone during the night shift, while additionally resulting in similar responses to those of day shift workers. Further studies are required, however, to provide conclusive evidence particularly within a working situation over a longer shift schedule...|$|E

40|$|Test {{power is}} an {{important}} issue in deep submicron semiconductor testing. Too much power supply noise and too much power dissipation can result in excessive temperature rise, both leading to overkill during delay test. Scan-based test has been widely adopted {{as one of the most}} commonly used VLSI testing method. The test power during scan testing comprises shift power and capture power. The power consumed in the <b>shift</b> <b>cycle</b> dominates the total power dissipation. It is crucial for IC manufacturing companies to achieve near constant power consumption for a given timing window in order to keep the chip under test (CUT) at a near constant temperature, to make it easy to characterize the circuit behavior and prevent delay test over kill. To achieve constant test power, first, we built a fast and accurate power model, which can estimate the shift power without logic simulation of the circuit. We also proposed an efficient and low power X-bit Filling process, which could potentially reduce both the shift power and capture power. Then, we introduced an efficient test pattern reordering algorithm, which achieves near constant power between groups of patterns. The number of patterns in a group is determined by the thermal constant of the chip. Experimental results show that our proposed power model has very good correlation. Our proposed X-Fill process achieved both minimum shift power and capture power. The algorithm supports multiple scan chains and can achieve constant power within different regions of the chip. The greedy test pattern reordering algorithm can reduce the power variation from 29 - 126 percent to 8 - 10 percent or even lower if we reduce the power variance threshold. Excessive noise can significantly affect the timing performance of Deep Sub-Micron (DSM) designs and cause non-trivial additional delay. In delay test generation, test compaction and test fill techniques can produce excessive power supply noise. This can result in delay test overkill. Prior approaches to power supply noise aware delay test compaction are too costly due to many logic simulations, and are limited to static compaction. We proposed a realistic low cost delay test compaction flow that guardbands the delay using a sequence of estimation metrics to keep the circuit under test supply noise more like functional mode. This flow has been implemented in both static compaction and dynamic compaction. We analyzed the relationship between delay and voltage drop, and the relationship between effective weighted switching activity (WSA) and voltage drop. Based on these correlations, we introduce the low cost delay test pattern compaction framework considering power supply noise. Experimental results on ISCAS 89 circuits show that our low cost framework is up to ten times faster than the prior high cost framework. Simulation results also verify that the low cost model can correctly guardband every path?s extra noise-induced delay. We discussed the rules to set different constraints in the levelized framework. The veto process used in the compaction can be also applied to other constraints, such as power and temperature...|$|E
40|$|At {{the same}} time as many urban economies are {{developing}} into 24 -hour societies it is becoming increasingly popular amongst shift workers to compress their working hours. This is done by working longer shifts (> 8 h) and/or restricting free time (< 16 h) in between shifts – the main reasons are to gain longer bouts of free time and extra free weekends. However, there is a limited knowledge of the effects of such arrangements on sleep and wakefulness. Thus, the main purposes of the present thesis were to evaluate the effects of long working hours (in the form of 12 h shifts) and short recovery periods. Another aim was to evaluate possible mechanisms that could suggest why some individuals develop problems with shift work while others do not. We used a combination of methods - sleep diaries, wake diaries, blood samples and objective measures of sleep and cognitive performance - across whole or large parts of shift schedules to evaluate acute effects of particularly demanding working periods, as well as the total effects of a <b>shift</b> <b>cycle.</b> Study I evaluated the effect of changing from an 8 h- to a 12 h-shift system. Study II evaluated the effects of long shifts in a shift schedule with both 8 h- and 12 h-shifts. Study III evaluated the effects of several consecutive short recovery periods (8 - 9 h of recovery) and whether satisfaction with ones’ work hours was associated to problems with sleep and sleepiness. Study IV evaluated whether endocrinological markers of catabolic (cortisol) and anabolic (testosterone) activity changed across a shift sequence and whether satisfaction were related to them. Study V was a laboratory simulation of the effects of a short recovery period (4 h of sleep) and whether a short nap could counteract any detrimental effects. There was no convincing evidence for 12 h shifts inducing more problems with sleep and sleepiness than 8 h shifts. With regard to recovery time between shifts, the shortest recovery times (only 8 h) seriously shortened sleep duration and increased sleepiness, while 12 h of recovery (between two consecutive 12 h shifts) was judged as having no or limited effects on acute measures. The problems with the shortest recovery periods were worse in a schedule with several consecutive shifts and less pronounced in a schedule with few consecutive shifts. With regard to individual differences, it was found that subjects being dissatisfied with their working hours were vulnerable to short recovery periods, which was evident by less sufficient sleep and an accumulation of sleepiness across work periods with limited recovery time. Interestingly, these problems disappeared when they were allowed to recover after the work period. In addition, dissatisfied male shift workers had lower testosterone levels at the end of work periods, indicating disturbed anabolic activity. The simulated quick return supported that curtailed sleep affected sleepiness and performance and that a short nap could counteract these effects temporarily. It is concluded that long shifts (up to 12 h) may be acceptable, whereas short recovery time (8 h or less) is not. Most of the problems with short recovery periods were related to short sleep and sleepiness, and there is, clearly, a subgroup of workers that suffer more from this than others. It is argued that insufficient sleep and low testosterone levels (in males) might be key factors for developing shift intolerance, mainly by reducing the capacity to recover from shift work...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a {{technique}} that can efficiently reduce peak and average switching activity during test application is proposed. The proposed method does not require any specific clock tree construction, special scan cells, or scan chain reordering. Test cubes generated by any combinational ATPG can be processed by the proposed method to reduce peak and average switching activity without any capture violation. Switching activity during scan <b>shift</b> <b>cycles</b> is reduced by assigning identical values to adjacent scan inputs and switching activity during capture cycles is reduced by {{limiting the number of}} scan chains that capture responses. Hardware overhead for the proposed method is negligible. The peak transition is reduced by about 40 % and average number of transitions is reduced by about 56 - 85 %. This reduction in peak and average switching activity is achieved with no decrease in fault coverage. I...|$|R
40|$|Characteristics of {{shiftwork}} schedules {{can have}} distinct impacts on workers' sleep. This report presents {{comparisons of the}} effects of two different shiftwork schedules on duration and quality of the main sleep episodes in comparable worker populations at two different petrochemical plants. No significant differences were found for sleep duration in comparing the two plants. However, within each plant's <b>shift</b> <b>cycles,</b> morning and night shifts showed shorter sleep durations than all other workdays and days off. Quality of sleep was perceived as lowest for night shifts of both plant schedules, and of lesser quality for weekly than for fast-rotating shifts, These results support recommendations for reducing the number of consecutive nights of shiftwork. However, before recommending any optimal shift schedule, interactions of sleep duration and quality with shift schedules need much further evaluation.

40|$|A novel design-for-test (DFT) {{technique}} is presented for designing a core with a "virtual scan chain" which looks (to the system integrator) {{like it is}} shorter than the real scan chain inside the core. The I/O pins of a core with a virtual scan chain are identical to the I/O pins of a core with a normal scan chain. For the system integrator, testing a core with a virtual scan chain is identical to testing a core with a normal scan chain. The {{only difference is that}} the virtual scan chain is much shorter so the size of the scan vectors and output response is smaller resulting in less test data and fewer scan <b>shift</b> <b>cycles.</b> The process of mapping the virtual scan vectors to real scan vectors is handled inside the core and is completely transparent to the system integrator.

To date, {{there has been a}} dearth of research exploring whether these factors cause fatigue in this population. The present study aimed to provide insight into metropolitan bus driver fatigue. The study was conducted in two phases. Firstly, focus groups were held at five bus depots an Australian capital city. The findings from these focus groups were incorporated into the second phase, a questionnaire study completed by 249 drivers in the same city. On reviewing the findings of the two phases, several fatigue issues were identified, including unrealistic scheduling and the according inability of drivers to take breaks, and the effects of managerial support. There was a lesser support in the questionnaire for the themes of ticketing policing, passenger interaction, shift irregularity and road user interactions as fatigue factors. The themes of cabin ergonomics and extended <b>shift</b> <b>cycles</b> failed to emerge in the questionnaire phase. Consideration is given as to why such factors are believed by drivers to be significant in increasing their levels of fatigue, and the ramifications of these findings in the context of future transit services management are also discussed...|$|R
