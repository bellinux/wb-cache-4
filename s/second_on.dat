40|$|In this paper, we {{summarize}} {{our results}} in parallelizing the linear approximation step on current distributed memory machines. We first analyze {{the features of}} current distributed memory machines and the problem characteristics to understand the overheads in parallel solutions to the problem. Based on these, we propose an asynchronous algorithm which enhances processor utilization and overlaps communication with computation by maintaining algorithmic threads in each processing node. Our implementation shows that, given a 512 Θ 512 image, the linear approximation task can be performed in 0. 015 <b>seconds</b> <b>on</b> a SP- 2 having 64 processing nodes and in 0. 032 <b>seconds</b> <b>on</b> a T 3 D having 32 processing nodes.
