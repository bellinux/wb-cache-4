Asser gives no {{information}} about his time in Wales, but mentions various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser's account that he <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who {{is not the same}} Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E

Harrison <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of time traveling around the southern United States, endeavoring to increase southern industry. When he traveled, he used two private railroad cars, named the Carolina and the Virginia. Other railroad presidents used only one, which made Harrison's practice unique. The Carolina was a sleeping car and the Virginia was set up to serve members of the Board of Directors, with a kitchen, dining room, and observation area.|$|E
5|$|In late 1833 Etty was {{commissioned}} by Williams-Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children. Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams-Wynn's daughters Charlotte and Mary, dressing up in lavish Italian-style costume. Although their dress is generally described as Italian, Dennis Farr's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian, based on Charlotte's headdress. The Italian-style clothing likely represents {{the high level of}} interest in Italian culture in early 19th-century England. The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto, widely associated with Italy, was at its peak; likewise, the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period. Etty, who had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of time in Venice and other Italian cities, would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs, and the costumes worn by the Williams-Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty, such as 1831's Window in Venice, During a Fiesta. As art historian Leonard Robinson points out, despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball, but are fully dressed. The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence, who had been Etty's teacher in 1807â€“08, {{as well as that of}} Joshua Reynolds, of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise.|$|E

25|$|James Livingston was a 15th-century cleric from East Lothian in {{south-eastern}} Scotland. Born at {{an unknown}} {{date in the}} 15th century, he was a son of the Laird of Saltcoats. He chose {{a career in the}} church, and became rector of the churches of Forteviot and Weme, and vicar of Innerleithen. By 1474, if not earlier, he had become dean for the whole diocese of Dunkeld. After the death of Thomas Lauder, Livingston was chosen as his successor as Bishop of Dunkeld. Although Livingston's appointment was contested at Rome by Thomas Spens, Bishop of Aberdeen, who wanted to be translated to Dunkeld, Livingston was consecrated on 30 June 1476. Livingston's episcopate is relatively obscure; he <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of time in Edinburgh, where he is witness to several charters. He died at Edinburgh, on 28 August 1483.

He met in Europe with highly placed anti-Nazi Germans to broker an early peace that would allow for occupation by the Western Allies, establish a democratic Germany, and leave the Soviets out in the cold. In China, he struggled with Chiang Kai-shek and his underlings for permission to carry out espionage activities in their territory. He inspected OSS operations in Burma, met with Vyacheslav Molotov in Moscow to arrange for cooperation between the OSS and NKVD, and was present for MacArthur's successful April 1944 invasion of Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea. Overall, the OSS was most effective in the Balkans, China, Burma, and France.|$|E

Her mother was Maud Alice Burke an American heiress, who adopted the first name Emerald and became a leading London society hostess. Nancy had been brought up on the family estate at Nevill Holt, Leicestershire but when her parents separated in 1911 she moved to London with her mother. Her education was at various boarding schools, including time in France and Germany. Whilst in London she <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of her childhood with her mother's long time admirer, the novelist George Moore. Indeed, it was even rumoured that Moore was her father, and though this has been largely dismissed, {{there is no question}} that he played an important role whilst she was growing up. She would later write a memoir about her affection for 'GM'.|$|E
25|$|When Herod {{was still}} {{military}} {{governor in the}} Galilee, he <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> of time fighting bandits {{under the leadership of}} Ezekias. These bandits are best understood as a peasant group whose targets were local elites (both Hasmonean and Herodian) rather than Rome. Ventidius Cumanus (procurator 48 to 52 CE) often retaliated against brigandry by punishing peasant communities he believed to be their base of support. When a Galillean pilgrim on the way to Jerusalem was murdered by a Samaritan, the bandit chief Eliezar organized Galilleans for a counter-attack, and Cumanus moved against the Jews. A Syrian legate, Quadratus, intervened and sent several Jewish and Samaritan officials to Rome. The Emperor Claudius took the Jewish side, and had the Samaritan leaders executed and exiled, and turned one named Veler over to the Jews who beheaded him. Thus, widespread peasant unrest of this period was not exclusively directed against Rome but also expressed discontent against urban elites and other groups; Roman policy sought to contain the power of the bandits while cultivating Jewish support.|$|E

6000|$|She {{certainly}} made up with Susie directly, however, for any allowance {{she might have}} had privately to extend to tepid appreciation; since the late and long talks of these two embraced not only everything offered and suggested by the hours they <b>spent</b> apart, but <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> more besides. She might be as detached as the occasion required at four o'clock in the afternoon, but she used no such freedom to any one about anything as she habitually used about everything to Susan Shepherd at midnight. All the same, it should with much less delay than this have been mentioned, she had not yet--had not, that is, {{at the end of}} six days--produced any news for her comrade to compare with an announcement made her by the latter {{as a result of a}} drive with Mrs. Lowder, for a change, in the remarkable Battersea Park. The elder friends had sociably revolved there while the younger ones followed bolder fancies in the admirable equipage appointed to Milly at the hotel--a heavier, more emblazoned, more amusing chariot than she had ever, with [...] "stables" [...] notoriously mismanaged, known at home; whereby, in the course of the circuit, more than once repeated, it had [...] "come out," [...] as Mrs. Stringham said, that the couple at Lancaster Gate were, of all people, acquainted with Mildred's other English friend--the gentleman, the one connected with the English newspaper (Susie hung fire a little over his name) who had been with her in New York so shortly previous to present adventures. He had been named of course in Battersea Park--else he couldn't have been identified; and Susie had naturally, before she could produce her own share in the matter as a kind of confession, to make it plain that her allusion was to Mr. Merton Densher. This was because Milly had at first a little air of not knowing whom she meant; and the girl really kept, as well, a certain control of herself while she remarked that the case was surprising, the chance one in a thousand. They knew him, both Maud and Miss Croy knew him, she gathered too, rather well, though indeed it was not on any show of intimacy that he had happened to be mentioned. It had not been--Susie made the point--she herself who brought him in: he had in fact not been brought in at all, but only referred to as a young journalist known to Mrs. Lowder and who had lately gone to their wonderful country--Mrs. Lowder always said [...] "your wonderful country"--on behalf of his journal. But Mrs. Stringham had taken it up--with the tips of her fingers indeed; and that was the confession: she had, without meaning any harm, recognised Mr. Densher as an acquaintance of Milly's, though she had also pulled herself up before getting in too far. Mrs. Lowder had been struck, clearly--it wasn't too much to say; then she also, it had rather seemed, had pulled herself up; and there had been a little moment during which each might have been keeping something from the other. [...] "Only," [...] said Milly's mate, [...] "I luckily remembered in time that I had nothing whatever to keep--which was much simpler and nicer. I don't know what Maud has, but there it is. She was interested, distinctly, in your knowing him--in his having met you over there with so little loss of time. But I ventured to tell her it hadn't been so long as to make you as yet great friends. I don't know if I was right." ...|$|R

More unusually, he {{had a habit of}} giving his soldiers chocolates when he met them returning from the lines or on inspections. Such behaviour scandalised his staff officers, who were privately disapproving of Fanshawe's informality with his troops but it did not lead to the disapproval of his superiors; in September 1917, a confidential report by Ivor Maxse, his corps commander, had judged him to be [...] "a good average divisional commander and trainer".|$|E

General Eichelberger, MacArthur's Chief of Staff, wrote that [...] "In Washington I had read General MacArthurâ€™s estimates of his two infantry divisions, and these reports and our own inspections had convinced my staff and me that the American troops were in no sense ready for jungle warfare." [...] However, some veterans interviewed report they received general training with weapons and practice at terrain maneuvers, and in jungle warfare. They said this increased once the unit arrived in Brisbane.|$|E

In actual practice, very few of his women soldiers were directly involved in combat; they largely had support roles in logistics and medical care.|$|E
