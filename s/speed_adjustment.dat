The results indicate that the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> is affected by business-cycle variables: The interaction term related to term spread reveals, as expected, faster adjustment in booms than in recessions and a negative relationship between short term spread and <b>adjustment</b> <b>speed.</b> We also show that the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> becomes stationary when the increasing fractions of zero-debt firms are considered...|$|R

In particular, we employ a Wald test with a null hypothesis for which the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> above τ {{is equal to the}} <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> below τ. Our results suggest that the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> for the 3 -month deposit rate is higher when the monetary policy rate falls. Conversely, the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> for the 3 -month lending rate is higher when monetary policy rate increases. More specifically, the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> for positive deviations is 1.5 times the one for negative deviations in the case of deposit rates, suggesting that negative deviations are more persistent, whereas the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> for negative deviations is two times the one for positive deviations in the case of lending rates, suggesting that positive deviations are more persistent.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} contains three essays that {{explore the}} <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment,</b> volatility and {{noise in the}} Indonesia Stock Exchange. The first essay explores the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> in the Indonesia Stock Exchange at daily interval from 2000 to 2004. The model employed is the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> with noise. Firstly, I work on the estimation of the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment.</b> The estimated <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> coefficient concludes that the large size leads the smaller size group to adjust to new information. Secondly, I analyse the component in the noise that contributes significantly to the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> level. It is confirmed that the factor determining the noise is bid-ask fluctuations. Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} infer the component in the noise from bid-ask component. The decomposition of bid-ask spread into transaction cost and asymmetric information reveals that the latter is found to be a significant component determining the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> level. The second essay analyses the fine grain dynamics of the <b>speed</b> of price <b>adjustment</b> to new information from 2000 to 2007. The exact time of adjustment is estimated at intraday frequency instead of at daily frequency. In this work, as an alternative of first moment estimation, second moment model-free estimation using volatility signature plot to estimate of the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> is proposed. Both first and second moment estimation of the <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> provide consistent result of 30 minute adjustment period. Negative relation after 5 -minute return interval between <b>speed</b> of <b>adjustment</b> estimate and realized variance is found implying lower noise leads to smaller deviation between observed and equilibrium price. In the third essay, I concentrate the work on the second moment of continuously compounded returns from 2000 to 2007 in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The main purpose of the last essay is to estimate the noise and efficient variance in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The realized variance based estimator is employed in the third essay. During the period of the study, noise variance decreases indicating smaller deviation between the observed and equilibrium price, hence improving market quality in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The optimal frequency to estimate the efficient variance, on average, is nine minutes. The variance ratio of daily efficient variance to daily open-to-close reveals significant private information underlying price process in the Indonesia Stock Exchange...|$|R
