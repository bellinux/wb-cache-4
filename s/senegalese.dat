5|$|Although {{remaining}} {{separate from}} the local tourism network, Carabane has demonstrated its support for social solidarity and holism by joining GENSEN (Global Ecovillage Network Senegal), a network of <b>Senegalese</b> ecovillages.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the members}} of the <b>Senegalese</b> team at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Lamine Guèye and Alphonse Gomis, took part in the same skiing events; the men's downhill, Super-G, giant slalom, slalom and the {{combined}} competition.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of the {{combined}} size of the French Army of the Levant divisions that participated in the battle ranged from 9,000 to 12,000 troops. The troops were mostly made up of <b>Senegalese</b> and Algerian units, and consisted of ten infantry battalions {{and a number of}} cavalry and artillery units. Among the participating units were the 415th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Algerian Riflemen Regiment, the <b>Senegalese</b> Division, the African Riflemen Regiment and the Moroccan Sipahi Battalion. A number of Maronite volunteers from Mount Lebanon reportedly joined the French forces as well. The Army of the Levant was equipped with plain and mountain artillery batteries and 155mm guns, and backed by tanks and fighter bombers. The commander of the French forces was General Mariano Goybet.|$|E
5|$|Species {{such as the}} <b>Senegalese</b> {{grasshopper}} (Oedaleus senegalensis) and the African rice grasshopper (Hieroglyphus daganensis), {{both from}} the Sahel, often display locust-like behaviour and change morphologically on crowding.|$|E
5|$|The sole <b>Senegalese</b> athlete at the Games, Leyti Seck, {{competed in}} both the men's giant slalom and men's slalom. He {{was one of three}} African skiers at the Vancouver Olympics, {{alongside}} Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong from Ghana and Samir Azzimani of Morocco.|$|E
5|$|Following the Games, Guèye {{felt that}} his Olympic career {{was over and}} did not compete at the 1988 Winter Games. He was {{inspired}} watching the Jamaican bobsled team on television, {{and returned to the}} Winter Olympics for both the 1992 and Games. He later became a spokesman against the qualification standards imposed on the Games, with his book Skieur Senegalais Cherche Esprit Olympique (<b>Senegalese</b> Skier Seeks Olympic Spirit).|$|E
5|$|The first clashes {{took place}} at 6:30 when French tank {{divisions}} stormed the central position of the Syrian defensive line while French cavalry and infantry units assaulted the Syrians' northern and southern positions. The camel cavalry were the first Syrian units to engage the French. Syrian forces initially put up stiff resistance along the front, but lacked coordination between their different units. Early in the clashes, Syrian artillery fire inflicted casualties on a battery of French soldiers. French tanks faced heavy fire as they attempted to gain ground against the Syrians. However, French artillery took a toll on Syrian forces and by 8:30 the French had broken the Syrians' central trench. At {{one point in the}} first few hours of the clashes, Syrian forces managed to briefly pin down two <b>Senegalese</b> companies that were relatively isolated on the French right flank. The losses inflicted on the two <b>Senegalese</b> units represented roughly half of the French army's total casualties. Nonetheless, by 10:00, the battle was effectively over, having turned decisively in favor of the French.|$|E
5|$|Guèye had {{arranged}} {{for the creation of}} the <b>Senegalese</b> Ski Federation in 1979, and had initially expected to be unable to compete at the 1984 Olympics due to the qualification requirements and as he was recovering from an injury, but was informed by the International Olympic Committee several months prior that he would be allowed to represent Senegal. Guèye was the first black African to compete at the Winter Games; South Africa became the first African nation to compete at a Winter Games, in 1960, but with an all-white team under apartheid.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët entered electoral {{politics}} in August 1945, when {{elections for the}} Abidjan city council were held for the first time. The French electoral rules established a common roll: half of the elected {{would have to be}} French citizens (who were mostly Europeans) and the other half non-citizens. Houphouët reacted by creating a multi-ethnic all-African roll with both non-citizens and citizens (mostly <b>Senegalese</b> with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a {{nationwide}} uprising against French colonial rule was initiated in Moramanga, {{a town in}} Bezanozano territory neighboring the Betsimisaraka. During the conflict, Betsimisaraka nationalists fought French and <b>Senegalese</b> soldiers in an unsuccessful attempt {{to regain control of}} the port at Tamatave, the island's most important trading port. Betsimisaraka fighters and civilians suffered very heavy losses and some of the worst human rights abuses, including execution by being thrown alive from airplanes.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 1951, Aubame was reelected {{a deputy}} with 17,329 votes {{out of a}} total of 29,203 and on 2 January 1956 with 26,712 votes {{out of a total}} of 57,031, with this term lasting until the end of the Fourth French Republic. Around this time, M'ba was {{establishing}} his political career after being exiled to Oubangui-Chari. Affiliating with the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), Aubame later worked most closely with the Indépendants d'Outre-Mer, an African parliamentary group whose leaders were <b>Senegalese</b> Léopold Sédar Senghor and Cameroonian Louis-Paul Aujoulat. While a deputy he lived in Paris and toured Gabon regularly.|$|E
5|$|Positive Black Soul (also {{known as}} PBS) is a hip hop {{group based in}} Dakar, Senegal, {{one of the first}} such collectives in the country. Founded in 1989, the group is {{composed}} of Didier Sourou Awadi (alias DJ Awadi) and Amadou Barry (alias Doug E. Tee or Duggy-Tee), both of whom had previously been in other hip hop groups. They perform in the English, French, and Wolof languages and use traditional <b>Senegalese</b> instruments as part of their songs. Political and social activism have played important roles in the group since it was founded.|$|E
5|$|Senegal {{participated in}} five Winter Olympics between its debut at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, and the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. No <b>Senegalese</b> athlete had ever won a medal at a Winter Games. In {{two out of}} the three initial appearances, the country was {{represented}} by a single alpine skier, Lamine Guèye, {{with the exception of}} 1992 when Alphonse Gomis also competed. In 2006, fellow skier Leyti Seck was the national teams sole athlete.|$|E
5|$|The sandbar of Carabane {{has very}} few mammals other than pets, {{although}} the French first noted {{the presence of}} monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), <b>Senegalese</b> manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the 2011–12 season saw an {{overhaul}} in the first team, with the sale of influential first team players Kevin Nolan, Joey Barton and José Enrique {{during the summer and}} the elevation of Tim Krul as first choice goalkeeper and centre back Fabricio Coloccini as captain. Signings such as Yohan Cabaye, Italian international Davide Santon and <b>Senegalese</b> striker Demba Ba in cut-price deals saw Newcastle adopt a new transfer policy, one which would be met with success in the season. They went on to enjoy one of their strongest openings to a season, playing 11 consecutive games unbeaten. before losing away to Manchester City. Another <b>Senegalese</b> striker, Papiss Cissé, joined in the January transfer window, and Newcastle had a strong second half of the season, eventually securing a place in the 2012–13 Europa League. Newcastle finished in fifth place, their highest league position since the Bobby Robson days. Further honours were to come as Pardew won both the Premier League Manager of the Season and the LMA Manager of the Year awards, captain Coloccini was named in the PFA Team of the Year, and Cissé won the Goal of the Season award for a goal against Chelsea.|$|E
5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the <b>Senegalese</b> government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic belief systems of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment of martial law, and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French <b>Senegalese</b> troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.|$|E
5|$|Formerly an {{administrative}} district {{in its own}} right, even a regional capital, Carabane is now just one of 23villages in the rural community of Diembéring, of which Kabrousse, Cap Skirring, and Boucott-Diembéring are the largest centres. This rural community {{is located in the}} Kabrousse Arrondissement. It is part of Oussouye Department, the smallest and least central of the three departments in Ziguinchor Region. In a country which includes some 13,000 villages, the village is considered, by a 1972 decree, the elementary entity in the administrative body of the nation. Each is administered by a leader, assisted by a council. After consultation, the nomination of a leader is established by the prefect and approved by the Minister of the Interior. Under <b>Senegalese</b> law, the leader of the village has certain prerogatives, including law enforcement, tax collection, and keeping of vital records in the village.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was {{determined}} to stop the hegemony of Senegal in West Africa and a political confrontation ensued between Ivorian and <b>Senegalese</b> leaders. Houphouët-Boigny refused {{to participate in the}} Inter-African conference in Dakar on 31 December 1958, which was intended to lay the foundation for the Federation of Francophone African States. Although that federation was never realised, Senegal and Mali (known at the time as French Sudan) formed their own political union, the Mali Federation. After de Gaulle allowed the Mali Federation independence in 1959, Houphouët-Boigny tried to sabotage the federation's efforts to wield political control; in cooperation with France, he managed to convince Upper Volta, Dahomey, and Niger to withdraw from the Mali Federation, before it collapsed in August 1960.|$|E
5|$|In June 1816, the French frigate Méduse {{departed}} from Rochefort, {{bound for the}} <b>Senegalese</b> port of Saint-Louis. She headed a convoy of three other ships: the storeship Loire, the brig Argus and the corvette Écho. Viscount Hugues Duroy de Chaumereys had been appointed captain of the frigate despite having scarcely sailed in 20years. After the wreck, public outrage mistakenly attributed responsibility for his appointment to Louis XVIII, though his was a routine naval appointment made within the Ministry of the Navy and far outside {{the concerns of the}} monarch. The frigate's mission was to accept the British return of Senegal under the terms of France's acceptance of the Peace of Paris. The appointed French governor of Senegal, Colonel Julien-Désiré Schmaltz, and his wife and daughter were among the passengers.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} {{managerial}} years, Wenger recognised {{the potential of}} football in Africa, which influenced his transfer dealings at Monaco. On the recommendation of Claude Le Roy, he signed Liberian George Weah, who later became the first African to be named FIFA World Player of the Year. Weah, while receiving his award from FIFA president João Havelange and vice-president Lennart Johansson invited Wenger up to the stage, spontaneously giving his medal to the manager, as a token of his appreciation. During his final years at Monaco, Wenger worked with Roger Mendy, a <b>Senegalese</b> defender regarded in 1991 {{as one of the}} ten best African footballers by France Football, and Nigerian Victor Ikpeba, a forward who earnt the accolade of African Player of the Year. Wenger also fast-tracked young players such as Petit and Lilian Thuram, and handed debuts to Henry and David Trezeguet.|$|E
5|$|Daara J, {{formed in}} 1997, was {{originally}} a trio {{that consisted of}} Faada Freddy, N'Dongo D and Lord Alajiiman. Lord Alajiiman performed and toured throughout {{the world with the}} group until 2008 when the group split. Since then, Alajiman evolves in a solo career while contributing {{to the development of the}} music sector in Senegal. Daara J was formed when all of its members were in high school, where they were studying accounting. The rappers were influenced by American hip hop artists such as Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five and Afrika Bambaataa but also listened to their parents' music, which included artists such as Sly and the Family Stone and Aretha Franklin, and musical styles which included Cuban music. Faada Freddy cites the group's major inspiration as Das EFX. Originally, the members took instrumentals of hip hop tracks from the United States and France to rap over. Later they purchased a drum machine, but even with this equipment, a member of the group would have to imitate the other instruments in the song with his voice. Positive Black Soul, another <b>Senegalese</b> rap group, encouraged Daara J to record and perform.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the group}} {{performed}} at a music festival {{held by the}} Dakar French Cultural Center, where the French rapper MC Solaar heard their performance and invited the group to open {{for him when he}} debuted in Dakar in October of that year. The rapper was impressed with Positive Black Soul, inviting them to continue performing with him in France. Two years later the group put out its first release, a cassette entitled Boul Falé. The album was followed by more touring in France, as well as in England and Switzerland. In the same year, the <b>Senegalese</b> musician Baaba Maal offered PBS the opportunity to be on his album Firin' in Fouta. Maal was signed to Mango Records and because of this recording with him, Positive Black Soul were signed as well. They released their album debut Salaam on Mango Records. After achieving success in Senegal and some abroad, the group continued touring, including 130 performances in 1997. They also began organizing concerts in Dakar and promoting new groups including Daara J and Pee Froiss.|$|E
5|$|Malouma {{commenced}} {{her education}} at {{elementary school in}} 1965 in Mederdra. She qualified as {{an elementary school teacher}} in 1974 in Rosso. According to the traditions of her country, those of the Meidah family are required to carry on the art of their ancestors. As a result, she had to give up her aspirations to teach. Members of each caste are allowed only to marry other members of society within the same caste and the entire society is divided by castes politically, economically, and culturally. Movement outside of a particular caste is forbidden. She learned to play the traditional stringed instruments only women play, especially the ardin harp, and was taught traditional Mauritanian music by her father, who enjoyed an eclectic mix of music. As a result, she grew up listening to classical western works such as Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Vivaldi and Wagner, as well as the music of traditional Berber, Egyptian, Lebanese and <b>Senegalese</b> artists. She often accompanied her parents who sang traditional griots.|$|E
5|$|Upon the queen's {{signing of}} the treaty, the French {{government}} deposed Rainilaiarivony from his position as Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, an elderly man named Rainitsimbazafy, was jointly selected by the French and Ranavalona as his replacement. The French ordered Rainilaiarivony to be exiled to French Algeria, although he initially remained in Antananarivo for several months after the treaty was signed. On 15 October 1895 {{the former prime minister}} was placed under house arrest and put under the guard of <b>Senegalese</b> soldiers at his home in Amboditsiry. On 6 February 1896, at the age of 68, Rainilaiarivony boarded a ship bound for Algiers and left his island {{for the first time in}} his life. He was accompanied by his grandson, Ratelifera, as well as an interpreter and four servants. On 17 March 1896 the ship docked at the port of Algiers, where he would live out the few remaining months of his life.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} Moss's first {{pre-season}} as coach, he {{did little to}} change what Arnold had built at the club. The only {{major changes in the}} side were with the addition of <b>Senegalese</b> international Malick Mané and Hungarian Richárd Vernes, and Marcos Flores leaving the club, with Mile Sterjovski retiring. Mariners began the season on a high, progressing to the semi-finals of the 2014 FFA Cup and defeating local rivals Newcastle Jets 1–0 at home in the opening round of the A-League. However the season soon turned with the team failing to secure a win {{for the remainder of the}} year. After their elimination from the 2015 AFC Champions League qualifying play-off by Chinese side Guangzhou R and a continued poor league record after a short mid-season break, the club stood down Moss as head coach. The decision was made on 6 March 2015, with Mariners appointing technical director Tony Walmsley in an interim capacity and captain John Hutchinson in a dual player-coach role, until the end of the season. Portuguese player Fábio Ferreira also joined the team at the tail end of the season. On 15 April Walmsley was announced as Mariners' permanent technical director and head coach for the 2015–16 season. The announcement came despite an end to the season in which the club finished the league in eighth position.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November, Hill {{visited the}} {{commanding}} officer of the French forces guarding a vital bridge at Medjez el Bab, and warned him that any attempt by German forces to cross the bridge would be opposed by the battalion. Hill attached 'R' Company to the French forces to ensure the bridge was not captured. German forces soon arrived at the bridge, and their commanding officer demanded that they {{be allowed to take}} control of the bridge and cross it to attack the British positions. The French rejected the German demands, and in conjunction with 'R' Company repelled subsequent German attacks that lasted several hours. The battalion was reinforced by the U.S. 175th Field Artillery Battalion and elements of the Derbyshire Yeomanry, but, despite fierce resistance, the German forces proved to be too strong, and by 04:30 on 20 November the Allied forces had yielded the bridge and the surrounding area to the Germans. Two days later, Hill received information that a strong Italian force, which included a number of tanks, was stationed at Gue Hill. Hill decided to attack the force and attempt to disable the tanks, and the following night moved the battalion, less a small guard detachment that remained at Béja, to Sidi N'Sir where it linked up with a force of French <b>Senegalese</b> infantry. Hill decided that the battalion's section of 3inch mortars would cover 'R' and 'S' Companies as they advanced up Gue Hill and attacked the Italian force, while a small force of sappers would mine the road at the rear of the hill to ensure the Italian tanks could not retreat.|$|E

25|$|The {{black market}} also {{attracted}} an export drain into the Gambia. The <b>Senegalese</b> government began {{to institute a}} delayed payment system with its groundnut (peanut) farms. When farmers sold their harvest to the <b>Senegalese</b> government, they would get a voucher, known as a chit, which they could turn into cash after a three-month waiting period. Not wanting {{to wait for the}} <b>Senegalese</b> marketing system to pay them, more farmers began to smuggle their goods to Banjul, where the Gambian government paid in cash; by 1990, estimates show that 20% of the Gambian groundnut market was from smuggled <b>Senegalese</b> crops.|$|E
