Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out from January to April 2005 in a central municipality of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia and Montenegro. Noise measurements were performed at 12 measurement sites three times at daytime and twice at night. On the basis of noise measurement results, three streets with the highest and three streets with the lowest values of equivalent sound pressure level (Leq) were chosen to represent noisy (> 65 dB(A)) and quiet (< 55 dB(A)) areas, respectively. The respondents from both areas were asked {{to fill out the}} questionnaire on noise-related health problems. The final sample consisted of 310 respondents, 192 from noisy area and 118 from quiet area. Results: Respondents from noisy area reported having significantly more difficulties with falling asleep, being woken up by noise at night more often, and having more difficulties with falling back to sleep. They also complained of poorer sleep quality and tiredness after sleep and they slept by an open window in summer less often. <b>Noise</b> annoyance, <b>subjective</b> <b>noise</b> sensitivity, and neuroticism were significantly correlated with difficulties with falling asleep, time needed to fall asleep, poorer sleep quality, tiredness after sleep, and use of sleeping pills. After adjustment for potential modifying personality traits including <b>subjective</b> <b>noise</b> sensitivity, neuroticism, and extroversion, residence in noisy area was shown to be a significant predictor for difficulties with falling asleep (odds ratio [OR], 2. 71; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 27 - 5. 80), difficulties with falling back to sleep (OR, 1. 87; 1. 02 - 3. 40), waking up at night (OR, 2. 60; 1. 49 - 4. 52), sleeping by closed windows (OR, 13. 51; 5. 84 - 1. 25), having poor sleep quality (OR, 2. 99; 1. 13 - 7. 89), and feeling tired after sleep (OR, 2. 50; 1. 11 - 5. 63).

40|$|A <b>subjective</b> <b>noise</b> {{evaluation}} {{was conducted}} in which the test participants evaluated the annoyance of simulated sounds representative of future civil tiltrotor aircraft. The subjective responses were correlated with the noise metrics of A-weighted sound pressure level, overall sound pressure level, and perceived level. The results indicated that correlation between subjective response and A-weighted sound pressure level is considerably enhanced by combining it in a multiple regression with overall sound pressure level. As a single metric, perceived level correlated better than A-weighted sound pressure level due to greater emphasis on low frequency noise components. This latter finding was especially true for indoor noise where the mid and high frequency noise components are attenuated by typical building structure. Using {{the results of the}} <b>subjective</b> <b>noise</b> evaluation, the impact on tiltrotor aircraft design was also evaluated. While A-weighted sound pressure level can be reduced by reduction in tip speed, an increase in number of rotor blades is required to achieve significant reduction of low frequency noise as measured by overall sound pressure level.

The {{purpose of the current}} study was to compare diagnostic acceptability, noise, and radiation exposure of multidetector row CT (MDCT) of neck performed with z-axis AEC and with fixed current. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two study groups of 26 patients each underwent MDCT of neck using z-axis AEC with 8 noise index (NI), 150 â 440 mA, and 10 NI, 75 â 440 mA, respectively. A control group consisting of another 26 patients underwent MDCT of neck with fixed-current technique (300 mA). Objective noise and mean tube current-time products (mA s) were recorded.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty consecutive patients (25 women, mean 62. 5 years, range 28 - 87 years) underwent 192 -section dual-source CTPA with dual-energy CT (90 / 150 SnkVp) after the administration of 60 ml contrast media (300 mg iodine/ml). Conventional virtual monochromatic images at 60 keV and 17 mono-plus image datasets from 40 - 190 keV (in 10 keV steps) were reconstructed. Subjective image quality (artefacts, <b>subjective</b> <b>noise)</b> was rated. Attenuation was measured in the pulmonary trunk and in the right lower lobe pulmonary artery; noise was measured in the periscapular musculature. The signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR) were calculated for each patient and dataset. Comparisons between monochromatic images and mono-plus images were performed by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Bonferroni correction. RESULTS Interreader agreement was good to excellent for subjective image quality (ICC: 0. 616 - 0. 889). As compared to conventional 60 keV images, artefacts occurred less (p= 0. 001) and <b>subjective</b> <b>noise</b> was rated lower (p< 0. 001) in mono-plus 40 keV images.

All patients underwent clinical follow-up after three months for evaluation of adverse events. Interrater agreement for subjective image quality in both groups ranged from fair to excellent (ICC: 0. 46 - 0. 84); agreement for objective image quality was excellent (ICC: 0. 83 - 0. 93).

There is strong evidence from epidemiological studies of a correlation between chronic noise exposure and diseases of the cardiovascular system. Among environmental noise sources, road traffic noise is particularly relevant {{one of the most}} important. However, it is unclear whether the risk of noise induced diseases is dominated by the real objective sound level or the extent of <b>subjective</b> <b>noise</b> annoyance. This dissertation analyzes the relationship between <b>subjective</b> <b>noise</b> annoyance and objective noise exposure caused by road traffic by taking into account the influence of socio-demographic factors. 2122 male and female patients with cardiac and surgical diagnoses of all 32 large and medium-sized hospitals in Berlin, who participated in the epidemiological noise study Berlin in 1998 / 99, were interviewed about the extent of environmental noise during day and nighttime from different sources. The sound levels of each individual address were extracted from the official road traffic noise exposure map of Berlin. As a result, {{more than half of the}} subjects (57 %) felt annoyed to different degrees by road traffic noise in their apartment at daytime. For nighttime 28 % of the subjects declared an annoyance. 17 % of the apartments showed a continuous sound level of more than 65 dB(A) at daytime, at nighttime almost a quarter of the subjects apartments was exposed to levels in excess of 55 dB(A). The results of the correlation analysis showed a low, statistically significant correlation between the subjective annoyance and the noise exposure (day: r = 0. 28, p < 0. 001; night: r = 0. 21, p < 0. 001). The multivariate analysis showed that noise exposure levels exceeding 65 dB(A) during daytime and 50 dB(A) during nighttime lead to a significant increase of the risk of annoyance caused by road traffic noise. During the night, female participants felt much more annoyed by road traffic noise at the same sound levels as men (women of the highest level group: adjusted odds ratio 13. 4; 95 % confidence interval 5. 7 to 31. 6, and men of the highest level group: adjusted odds ratio 3. 9; 95 % confidence interval 2. 6 to 6. 0). During the day, women with high objective noise exposure were only slightly more annoyed by road noise than men. The identified thresholds of sound levels are in accordance to the findings of the epidemiological noise research and it is recommended to consider the results in the discussion of noise protection and reduction measures. Future studies on noise exposure should not only measure sound levels but also <b>subjective</b> <b>noise</b> annoyance in a standardized procedure.
