(1994, Nature, 367, 66 – 669) {{reported}} quantitative stereoscopic {{depth in}} a phantom rectangle {{which appeared to}} lack conventional matching elements. Later, Gillam, B. J.

(1997, Vision Research, 37 (5), 633 – 644) indicated that the varying depth of the phantom rectangle could be based on stereoscopic matching. To remove the contaminating effects of conventional stereopsis from the Liu et al. (1994) original example, we presented a pair of parallel vertical lines to each eye {{where there is a}} central gap in the right line for the left eye’s view and in the left line for the right eye’s view. Observers saw a phantom rectangle bounded by subjective contours whose depth increased with the thickness of the lines. We attribute the quantitative variation of depth to a purely cyclopean (binocular) process sensitive to the pattern of contour presence and absence in the two eye’s view...|$|R

It forms {{part of a}} standard weather station. The Stevenson screen holds instruments that may include thermometers (ordinary, maximum/minimum), a hygrometer, a psychrometer, a dewcell, a barometer and a thermograph. Stevenson screens may also {{be known as a}} cotton region shelter, an instrument <b>shelter,</b> a <b>thermometer</b> <b>shelter,</b> a thermoscreen or a thermometer screen.

40|$|AbstractA phantom {{surface is}} a {{stereoscopic}} illusory area {{that can be}} seen in depth although there is no conventional stereoscopic cues [Liu, L., <b>Stevenson,</b> <b>S.</b> B., & Schor, C. M. (1994). Quantitative stereoscopic depth without binocular correspondence. Nature, 367, 66 – 69; Gillam, B. & Nakayama, K. (1999). Quantitative depth for a phantom surface can be based on cyclopean occlusion cues alone. Vision Research, 39, 109 – 112]. The phenomenon has been explained as an example of half-occlusion processing in which the visual system uses information about cyclopean occlusion structure of the visual world. We created stereo capture stereograms in which phantom surfaces changed the perceived depth of conventionally defined binocular textures. Because conventional stereoscopic matching is strongly affected by half-occlusion processing, we suggest that half-occlusion processing {{is an integral part of}} the early stereoscopic processing and solving of the correspondence problem...|$|R

50|$|His {{literary}} abilities {{appear in}} the bestknown of his works, ‘The Question of Anglican Ordinations discussed,’ 1873. This controversial treatise by an erudite member of the Roman church, with a valuable appendix of original documents and facsimiles, appeared {{at a time when}} the vexed question of the validity of English orders was fiercely debated by members of the Anglican and Roman communions, and it attracted considerable attention (Academy, 26 April 1884). An anonymous reply to the work appeared, with the title 'Anglican Orders, a few remarks in the form of a conversation on the recent work by Canon Estcourt,' 8vo, London, 1873. An article, originally prepared by Estcourt for the 'Dublin Review,' was published separately instead, under the title, 'Dogmatic Teaching of the Book of Common Prayer on the subject of the Holy Eucharist,' 8vo. London, 1868. Estcourt left unpublished a work of considerable interest, 'The Memoir of Jane Dormer, Duchess of Feria,' the materials for which he slowly accumulated during a period of twenty-five years. The first nine chapters were completed, and materials made ready for nine more. The fragments were placed in the hands of the Rev.

500|$|The first {{meteorological}} {{observations of}} high and low temperature and daily precipitation began at Fort Boise's Post Hospital on February 1, 1864 about 7 months after the fort was established by Major Pinkney Lugenbeel. Doctor Adam H. Cochrane, born in Paisley, Scotland, was the first post surgeon at the Fort and is believed to have taken the first weather observation. The observations were taken 3 times a day, 7 A.M., 2 P.M., and 7 P.M., at the post hospital built in 1863. Though the <b>thermometers</b> were <b>sheltered,</b> self registering <b>thermometers</b> were not installed until January 1872. Post surgeons and hospital stewards took continuous daily weather observations through November 30, 1898. The post surgeon was required to take weather observations as it was believed there was a possible link between human disease and weather. This prompted the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army, Doctor James Tilton to order U.S. Army senior medical officers on 2 May 1814 to “keep a diary of the weather” at each military station. The Fort was later renamed the Boise Barracks.|$|R
40|$|Salmonella typhi strains {{with two}} {{deletion}} mutations, each causing an attenuating auxotrophy, {{have been constructed}} from strains Ty 2 and CDC 10 - 80 for possible use as oral-route live vaccines. An aroA(serC) ::Tn 10 transposon insertion was first transduced from a Salmonella typhimurium donor into each wild-type S. typhi strain. Transductants of the Aro- SerC- phenotype were treated with transducing phage grown on an S. typhimurium strain with an extensive deletion at aroA; selection for SerC+ yielded transductants, {{some of which were}} delta aroA. A his mutation was next inserted into a delta aroA strain in each line by two steps of transduction. Two deletions affecting de novo purine biosynthesis were used as second attenuating mutations: delta purHD 343, causing a requirement for hypoxanthine (or any other purine) and thiamine, and delta purA 155, causing an adenine requirement. The purHD 343 deletion was introduced into the delta aroA his derivatives of each strain by cotransduction with purH::Tn 10, and the purA 155 deletion was introduced into the CDC 10 - 80 delta aroA his derivative by cotransduction with an adjacent silent Tn 10 insertion by selection for tetracycline resistance. Tetracycline-sensitive mutants of each of the three delta aroA his delta pur strains were isolated by selection for resistance to fusaric acid. The tetracycline-sensitive derivative of the CDC 10 - 80 delta aroA his delta purA 155 strain, designated 541 Ty, and its Vi-negative mutant, 543 Ty, constitute the candidate oral-route live-vaccine strains used in a recent volunteer trail (M.

The next day, they moved north up the valley into winter quarters near Kernstown. In February 1865, Crook was captured by Confederate raiders. Crook's capture added to the confusion as the army was reorganized for the spring campaign, and McKinley found himself serving on the staffs of four different generals over the next fifteen days—Crook, John D. <b>Stevenson,</b> Samuel <b>S.</b> Carroll, and Winfield S.

McKinley found time to join a Freemason lodge (later renamed after him) in Winchester, Virginia, before he and Carroll were transferred to Hancock's First Veterans Corps in Washington. Just before the war's end, McKinley received his final promotion, a brevet commission as major. In July, the Veterans Corps was mustered out of service, and McKinley and Carroll were relieved of their duties. Carroll and Hancock encouraged McKinley {{to apply for a}} place in the peacetime army, but he declined and returned to Ohio the following month.|$|R
