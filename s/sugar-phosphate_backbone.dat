5|$|The two DNA strands {{are called}} polynucleotides {{since they are}} {{composed}} of simpler monomer units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases — cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A) or thymine (T) — a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group. The nucleotides are joined {{to one another in}} a chain by covalent bonds between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating <b>sugar-phosphate</b> <b>backbone.</b> The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to base pairing rules (A with T and C with G), with hydrogen bonds to make double-stranded DNA. The total amount of related DNA base pairs on Earth is estimated at 5.0 x 1037 and weighs 50 billion tonnes. In comparison, the total mass of the biosphere has been estimated to be as much as 4 trillion tons of carbon (TtC).|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These non-specific interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic <b>sugar-phosphate</b> <b>backbone</b> of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other non-specific DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E

DNA and RNA are nucleic acids; alongside proteins and complex carbohydrates, {{they are one of}} the three major types of macromolecule that are essential for all known forms of life. Most DNA molecules consist of two biopolymer strands coiled around each other to form a double helix. The two DNA strands are known as polynucleotides since they are composed of simpler units called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogen-containing nucleobase—either cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), or thymine (T)—as well as a sugar called deoxyribose and a phosphate group.

5000|$|A {{restriction}} endonucleases functions by [...] "scanning" [...] {{the length}} of a DNA molecule. Once it encounters its particular specific recognition sequence, it will bind to the DNA molecule and makes one cut in each of the two <b>sugar-phosphate</b> <b>backbones.</b> The positions of these two cuts, both in relation to each other, and to the recognition sequence itself, are determined by the identity of the restriction endonuclease. Different endonucleases yield different sets of cuts, but one endonuclease will always cut a particular base sequence the same way, no matter what DNA molecule it is acting on. Once the cuts have been made, the DNA molecule will break into fragments.|$|R

The comprehensive agreement of theoretical results with experimental observations on both torsionally relaxed and negatively supercoiled DNAs strongly indicates that, basestacking interactions, although short-ranged in nature, dominate the elasticity of DNA and hence are of vital biological significance.

We have observed the C+-G⋅C base triplet in the crystal structure of an oligonucleotide-drug complex, between the minor-groove drug netropsin and the decanucleotide d(CGCAATTGCG) 2. The complex was crystallised at pH 7. 0, but the crystal structure, at a resolution of 2. 4 Å, shows that a terminal cytosine has become protonated and participates in a parallel C+-G⋅C base triplet. The structure of this triplet and its associated <b>sugar-phosphate</b> <b>backbones</b> have been energy-refined and then used to generate a triple helix.

The <b>sugar-phosphate</b> <b>backbones</b> are taken into account by semi-rigid harmonic springs with a non-zero spring length. The competition of these two interactions and the introduction of a simple geometrical constraint leads to a stacked right-handed B-DNA-like conformation. The mapping of the presented model to the Marko-Siggia and the Stack-of-Plates model enables us to optimize the free model parameters so as to reproduce the experimentally known observables such as persistence lengths, mean and mean squared base-pair step parameters. For the optimized model parameters we measured the critical force where the transition from B- to S-DNA occurs to be approximately $ 140 {pN}$.

40|$|The RecA protein of Escherichia coli forms a {{nucleoprotein}} filament {{that promotes}} homologous recognition and subsequent strand exchange between a single strand and duplex DNA via a three-stranded intermediate. Recognition of homology within three-stranded nucleoprotein complexes, {{which is probably}} central to genetic recombination, is not well understood {{as compared with the}} mutual recognition of complementary single strands by Watson-Crick base pairing. Using oligonucleotides, we examined the determinants of homologous recognition within RecA nucleoprotein filaments. Filaments that contained a single strand of DNA recognized homology not only in a complementary oligonucleotide but also in an identical oligonucleotide, whether their respective <b>sugar-phosphate</b> <b>backbones</b> were antiparallel or parallel, and a filament that contained duplex DNA showed the same polymorphic versatility in the recognition of homology. Recognition of self by a filament that contains a single strand reveals that RecA filaments can recognize homology via non-Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds. Recognition of multiple forms of the same sequence by duplex DNA in the filament shows that it primarily senses base-sequence homology, and suggests that recognition can be accomplished prior to the establishment of new Watson-Crick base pairs in heteroduplex products. However, unlike the initial recognition of homology, strand exchange is stereospecific, requiring the proper antiparallel orientation of complementary strands...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground: Triplet repeat {{sequences}} are {{of considerable}} biological importance as {{the expansion of}} such tandem arrays {{can lead to the}} onset of a range of human diseases. Such sequences can self-pair via mismatch alignments to form higher order structures that have the potential to cause replication blocks, followed by strand slippage and sequence expansion. The all-purine d(GGA) n triplet repeat sequence is of particular interest because purines can align via G·G, A·A and G·A mismatch formation. Results: We have solved the structure of the uniformly 13 C, 15 N-labeled d(G 1 -G 2 -A 3 -G 4 -G 5 -A 6 -T 7) sequence in 10 mM Na+ solution. This sequence adopts a novel twofold-symmetric duplex fold where interlocked V-shaped arrowhead motifs are aligned solely via interstrand G 1 ·G 4, G 2 ·G 5 and A 3 ·A 6 mismatch formation. The tip of the arrowhead motif is centered about the p-A 3 -p step, and symmetry-related local parallel-stranded duplex domains are formed by the G 1 -G 2 -A 3 and G 4 -G 5 -A 6 segments of partner strands. Conclusions: The purine-rich (GGA) n triplet repeat sequence is dispersed throughout the eukaryotic genome. Several features of the arrowhead duplex motif for the (GGA) 2 triplet repeat provide a unique scaffold for molecular recognition.

The Y 41 H mutant {{crystal structure}} revealed crystal packing interactions, which suggested a plausible scheme for constructing the polymeric protein shell of the GVP-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) complex (Guan Y, et al., 1994, Biochemistry 33 : 7768 - 7778). The electrostatic potentials of the isolated and the cooperatively formed protein shell have been calculated using the program GRASP and they revealed a highly asymmetric pattern of the electrostatic charge distribution. The inner surface of the putative DNA-binding channel is positively charged, whereas the opposite outer surface is nearly neutral. The electrostatic calculation further demonstrated that {{the formation of the}} helical protein shell enhanced the asymmetry of the electrostatic distribution. A model of the GVP-ssDNA complex with the n = 4 DNA-binding mode could be built with only minor conformational perturbation to the GVP protein shell. The model is consistent with existing biochemical and biophysical data and provides clues to the properties of GVP, including the high cooperatively of the protein binding to ssDNA. The two antiparallel ssDNA strands form a helical ribbon with the <b>sugar-phosphate</b> <b>backbones</b> at the middle and the bases pointing away from each other.
