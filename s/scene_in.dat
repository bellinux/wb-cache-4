5|$|A <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> {{the episode}} shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the <b>scene.</b> <b>In</b> the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a really big laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E

Sapporo area shows mainly straight extent <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> day and night, but residential area from Susukino westward was turned as a dark scene without distinctive hierarchies in night. Otaru area was divided into two scenes, straight and flat extent <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> day and night.
