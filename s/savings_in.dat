40|$|Private <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan Africa {{declined}} {{from more than}} 11 percent of disposable income in the 1970 s to less than 8 percent in the 1980 s and only partially recovered (to less than 9 percent) in the 1990 s. This article analyzes the determinants of private <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan Africa, seeking to explain the region's dismal performance and identify poli-cies that could help to reverse the region's decline <b>in</b> <b>saving.</b> The analysis shows that in Sub-Saharan Africa causality runs from growth to investment (and perhaps to private saving), whereas a rise m the saving rate Granger-causes an increase in investment. For-eign aid Granger-causes a reduction <b>in</b> both <b>saving</b> and investment, and investment also Granger-causes an increase in foreign aid. The empirical analysis of private <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Sub-Saharan Africa and other regions over 1970 - 95 suggests that private <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Africa {{can be explained by}} standard behavioral models. According to these models private <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Africa lags behind that in other regions (most notably, the high performing Asian econo-mies) because of the region's lower per capita income, high young-age dependency ratio, and high dependence on aid. The combined effects of these factors substantially outweigh Africa's advantage from its lower public saving and higher government consumption...|$|R

5|$|In 1948, GMAW was {{developed}} by the Battelle Memorial Institute. It used a smaller diameter electrode and a constant voltage power source developed by H. E. Kennedy. It offered a high deposition rate, but the high cost of inert gases limited its use to non-ferrous materials and prevented cost <b>savings.</b> <b>In</b> 1953, the use of carbon dioxide as a welding atmosphere {{was developed}}, and it quickly gained popularity in GMAW, since it made welding steel more economical. In 1958 and 1959, the short-arc variation of GMAW was released, which increased welding versatility and made the welding of thin materials possible while relying on smaller electrode wires and more advanced power supplies. It quickly became the most popular GMAW variation.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the determinants of domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia using time series annual data form 1969 / 70 - 2010 / 11. In this study, both qualitative explanations and econometric analysis are used. The qualitative (descriptive) part of the analysis shows that average domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia was low and continuously falling. In the econometric analysis, effort has been made to identify the long run and short run determinants of domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia using Johnson Maximum Likelihood co-integration test and Vector error correction mechanism (VECM). Estimated results reveal that growth rate of GDP, government consumption and foreign aid are statistically significant long run determinants of domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia. On the other hand, deposit interest rate, dependency ratio, and financial depth are found to be insignificant determinants. However, in the short run, all the explanatory variables included in this study do not have statistically significant meaning <b>in</b> explaining domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia. The speed of adjustment has value 0. 585743 with negative sign, which shows the convergence of saving model towards long run equilibrium. By considering the significant as well as insignificant but very important variables to enhance domestic saving: Sustainable economic growth, increasing private sector participation as well as selective privatization of government owned institutions, expansion of financial intermediaries and creating competitive environment in the financial sector are suggested to improve domestic <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> Ethiopia.

5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E

5|$|A report {{commissioned}} by the Ministry of Defence in 1995 {{made a number of}} recommendations for financial <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> the armed forces' budget, one of which was the abolition of the five-star ranks. Part of the rationale was that these ranks were disproportionate {{to the size of the}} forces commanded by these officers and that none of the United Kingdom's close allies, such as the United States (which reserves the rank of general of the army for officers who have commanded large armies in major wars), used such ranks. The recommendation was not taken up in full, but the practice of promoting service chiefs to five-star ranks was stopped and the ranks are now reserved for special circumstances. Sir Peter Inge was, in 1994, the last active officer to be promoted to the rank. Inge relinquished the post of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) in 1997 and his successor, Sir Charles Guthrie, was the first officer not to be promoted upon appointment as CDS.|$|E

A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work that had previously been done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of <b>savings.</b> <b>In</b> response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate.

Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built. Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the Georgia Avenue – Petworth and Columbia Heights stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed. WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County. The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.|$|E

Gordon not only persuaded Davidson to invest his <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> a range of dubious schemes, but also got him to solicit funds from other investors. Davidson borrowed heavily to increase his investment and by 1925 was in serious financial difficulties. In February that year he failed to pay his local rates and was threatened with imprisonment.

Eventually a settlement was reached, whereby around half of his Stiffkey stipend {{was applied to the}} reduction of his debts. Somehow, however, Davidson managed to continue his London life.
