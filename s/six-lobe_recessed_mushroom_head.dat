50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from other bolts by its shallow <b>mushroom</b> <b>head</b> {{and that the}} shank cross-section of the bolt is circular {{for most of its}} length, as usual, but the portion immediately beneath the head is formed into a square section.

This allows the fastener to be installed with only a single tool, a spanner or wrench, working from one side. The head of a carriage bolt is usually a shallow dome.

40|$|Abstract: The East Carpathians Bend {{area has}} a very complex {{structure}} character-ized {{by the presence of}} nappes, their post-tectonic cover and salt diapirs. The salt forming the studied diapirs s Early Miocene (Burdigalian) in age. After its accu-mulation the salt was more or less continuously involved in alternating extensional and compressional stages that deformed it from its original tabular position to the present-day diapir. Five stages of salt deformation have been established: initial, pre-nappe mplacement, appe emplacement, post-nappe emplacement and Wal-lachian. During all of these stages the salt was configured into different shapes: it formed a truncated cone during the initial stage, a <b>mushroom</b> <b>head</b> during the pre-nappe emplacement stage, and an increasingly more tapered shape with nappe emplacement and during the post-nappe mplacement s ages. Finally, it was squeezed out and refashioned by strike-slip faulting during the Wallachian com-pressional stage of Pleistocene age. In the East Carpathians Bend area the numerous alt exposures as well as salt-water springs reveal the presence of subsurface salt bodies. Historically, the salt has been o...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{vertical}} and horizontal distances between dual fish-like foils on the propulsive characteristics of the biomimetic propulsor system is investigated by using an unsteady panel method. The present method is validated by comparing computed results with other numerical and experimental data. The mutual vortex-vortex interaction between the shed vortices from both foils {{has the effect of}} changing the pointing direction of <b>mushroom</b> <b>heads.</b> The leading foil’s propulsive characteristics do not change much with the vertical distance between the foils, whereas the following foil’s propulsive characteristics are changed significantly depending on the vertical and horizontal distances between the foils. The overall wake patterns depend mainly on the horizontal distance. The intensity of the mutual interaction between the wake vortices depends on the vertical distance. Thus, the propulsive characteristics of the dual fish-like foils are complicated functions of the vertical and horizontal distances between the foils. The present method has the limitation of potential-low assumption. If the flow separation near {{the leading edge of the}} foils is not significant, the present method can be applied to the design of biomimetic propulsors...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial blotch is {{occasionally}} causing {{damage in}} the production of common mushroom (Agaricus bisporus). The disease is found worldwide and can be caused by different fluorescent Pseudomonas species present in casing material. For identification of the causative agents of blotch in the Netherlands and Belgium, fluorescent Pseudomonas species were isolated from mushrooms with mild or severe brown blotch symptoms collected at six growers. Strains were tested for pathogenicity by streaking the <b>mushroom</b> <b>head</b> with bacterial slime using a cotton swab and incubation of mushrooms for eight days at 15 °C. In total 16 isolates were collected varying in virulence. These, together with 14 other Pseudomonas strains present in different culture collections (LMG and at WUR), including the type strains of P. gingeri, P. tolaasii, P. agaricus and P. reactans were characterized and tentatively identified by multilocus sequence analysis based on four genes (rpoD, rpoB, gyrB, glyA) and by average nucleotide identity using whole genome sequences. We found three species, P. tolaasii, P. gingeri and an unnamed species able to cause severe symptoms whereas other unnamed species were able to cause mild symptoms.

50|$|Red pushbuttons {{can also}} have large <b>heads</b> (called <b>mushroom</b> <b>heads)</b> for easy {{operation}} and to facilitate the stopping of a machine. These pushbuttons are called emergency stop buttons and for increased safety are mandated by the electrical code in many jurisdictions. This large mushroom shape {{can also be found}} in buttons for use with operators who need to wear gloves for their work and could not actuate a regular flush-mounted push button.As an aid for operators and users in industrial or commercial applications, a pilot light is commonly added to draw the attention of the user and to provide feedback if the button is pushed. Typically this light is included {{into the center of the}} pushbutton and a lens replaces the pushbutton hard center disk. The source of the energy to illuminate the light is not directly tied to the contacts on the back of the pushbutton but to the action the pushbutton controls. In this way a start button when pushed will cause the process or machine operation to be started and a secondary contact designed into the operation or process will close to turn on the pilot light and signify the action of pushing the button caused the resultant process or action to start.|$|R

40|$|Buoyant plumes, {{evolving}} free of boundary constraints, {{may develop}} well-defined <b>mushroom</b> shaped <b>heads.</b> In normal plumes, overturning {{flow in the}} head entrains less buoyant fluid from the surroundings as the head rises, robbing the plume of its driving force. We consider here {{a new type of}} plume in which the source of buoyancy is an autocatalytic chemical reaction. The reaction occurs at a sharp front which separates reactants from less dense products. In this type of plume, entrainment assists the reaction, producing new buoyancy which fuels an accelerating plume head. When the head has grown to a critical size, it detaches from the upwelling conduit, forming an accelerating, buoyant vortex ring. This vortex is analogous to a rising smoke ring. A second-generation head then develops at the point of detachment. Multiple generations of chemical vortex rings can detach from a single triggering event.
