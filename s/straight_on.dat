5|$|By 11:15 the {{division}} {{had passed the}} Zerqiye crossing, and after an hour's halt on the Burj el 'Atot to Maghaiyir line, they moved in three brigade columns in echelon. The 12th Cavalry Brigade proceeded <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> to Jelame, while the 10th and 11th Cavalry Brigades crossed {{the edge of the}} Iskanderune marches at Shellalif. By 13:00 {{the division}} was approaching El Mugheir before crossing the Iskanderune River, where they rested before advancing to Liktera.|$|E
5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep bounce {{with the}} new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Fielding in the slips, Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before the English batsman had scored. Johnston usually moved {{the ball into the}} right-handed batsmen, but on this occasion the ball went <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> and took the outside of the edge of Hutton's bat. Hutton had trouble with both Australian pacemen, and played and missed multiple times in the deteriorating light. In a fidgety display, he played loosely outside the off stump and missed four times in one Johnston over, before Lindwall dismissed him.|$|E

5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of handing over Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E

The road then travels down a hill with many shops (mainly takeaways, newsagents). It passes South Norwood Leisure Centre, a new leisure centre which includes a creche, cafe, gym, swimming pool etc. Portland Road ends with a left turn {{to stay on the}} A215 at Spring Lane or <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> to change onto the B243, Woodside Green. From June 2010, the road will be the site of a station on the new London Overground network.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese never {{spotted the}} D-21B. The first one failed {{to turn around}} and {{continued}} <b>straight</b> <b>on,</b> crashing somewhere in the Soviet Union. Another test flight was conducted on 20 February 1970 in a successful attempt to correct any problems. The second operational mission, however, was not until 16 December 1970. The D-21B reached Lop Nor and back to the recovery point, but the hatch had a partial parachute failure and was lost at sea with its photographs.|$|E

5|$|The bridge ends at a four-way {{intersection}} where US 5 turns left on Washington Avenue, Route 22 continues <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> Clintonville Road, and Route 103 begins {{on the right}} along Washington Avenue. The four-lane Washington Avenue runs through the commercial areas of North Haven still paralleling the railroad tracks, crosses under I-91 (at exit 12) and continues into Wallingford as South Colony Street. At the town line is the Wharton Brook State Park just north {{of which is a}} short expressway connector (Wharton Brook Connector) to I-91 (at exit 13).

5|$|The {{division}} {{was moved to}} the Moscow Military District in October where it was assigned to the newly-forming 26th (Reserve) Army, Under the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. Some elements of the division entered active service in a highly dramatic manner, by first marching through Red Square in the famous October Revolution anniversary parade on November 7, then <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> to the front lines just 10–15km away, being assigned to the 20th Army of the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|A {{minute later}} Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard was shown a yellow card for a foul on García. The {{resulting}} free-kick found Steven Gerrard, but {{he fell to}} the ground after a challenge from Claude Makélélé. The referee Steve Bennett ignored Liverpool claims for a penalty and Chelsea went <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> the attack, but an effort by Drogba went wide of the Liverpool goal. Chelsea continued to attack in an effort to score an equalising goal, but attempts by Duff and Joe Cole failed to find the target. Liverpool defender Djimi Traoré was the third player to be shown a yellow card for a foul on Ferreira in the 35th minute. However, minutes later he made an important tackle as Duff beat the Liverpool offside trap, but a poor touch outside of the Liverpool penalty area allowed Traoré to dispossess him. As half-time approached Liverpool were content to remain in their own half and allow Chelsea to attack them, but any attack was dealt with by the Liverpool defence.|$|E

5|$|After Australia {{ended with}} 509 {{and took a}} 334-run lead, Tallon took two {{difficult}} catches to dismiss key batsmen {{at the start of}} England's second innings. Miller removed Cyril Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot to Tallon. Bill Edrich was then caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball that went <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> and the ball took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, but they recovered. Later, he caught Godfrey Evans for 50 from Johnson as England ended at 441. Australia reached their target of 98 with two wickets down, completing an eight-wicket victory. Tallon conceded five and 12 byes in the two innings respectively.|$|E
5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen <b>straight,</b> <b>on</b> a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as it was expected that this would be the game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E
5|$|After exiting Herkimer, NY5 {{continues}} east, closely paralleling {{this time}} the canal, through the city of Little Falls as Main Street, where two more concurrencies occur, with NY167 and NY169. NY5 continues to parallel the canal, {{and in some instances}} again, the Thruway, through Amsterdam, becoming Amsterdam Road all the way to Scotia, where it crosses the canal into Schenectady as Mohawk Avenue, turning into State Street upon entering the city limits. It continues fairly <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> a southeast course into Albany as Central Avenue until it reaches Townsend Park. At this point, NY5 turns into Washington Avenue and all signage referring to NY5 ceases. The New York State Department of Transportation recognizes the route, however, as it continues down Washington Ave past the New York State Capitol building, turning south for a short distance as Eagle Street. NY5 then continues east on State Street to Broadway, where it again turns south east shortly before returning east on a small spur of Broadway, traveling underneath US9 and I-787. NY5 ends at the Hudson River.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{had less}} than 15 minutes of batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. Barnes made an unsuccessful appeal against the light after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss. Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted {{the players on the}} second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Morris was bowled by Laker's off spin. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 when Barnes cut Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went <b>straight</b> <b>on,</b> clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich.|$|E
5|$|England {{began their}} second innings {{on the third}} afternoon. Late in the day, after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind by Don Tallon after {{attempting}} a cut shot from Johnson’s bowling. Edrich did not read the arm ball, which went <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. Denis Compton came in and he ran down the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block {{the ball on the}} run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount of spin from the surface. England closed the day at 2/121.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the first}} five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount of spin from the surface.|$|E

5|$|MD235 {{receives}} Old Three Notch Road as {{it leaves}} Hollywood, then it parallels another {{of its former}} courses, Clover Hill Road, as the highway passes through Hillville. Beyond the intersection with MD472 (North Sandgates Road), MD235 passes through Oakville, where another old alignment, Oakville Road, splits to the north before the main road intersects MD247 (Loveville Road). Mt. Zion Church Road, yet another old alignment, splits to the north in the hamlet of Laurel Grove before MD235 intersects the eastern terminus of MD6 (New Market–Turner Road) and Morganza–Turner Road in Oraville. The final old alignment of MD235, Harpers Corner Road, splits to the west shortly before the state highway reaches its northern terminus at MD5 near Mechanicsville. MD5 heads southwest as two-lane Point Lookout Road toward Leonardtown. Northbound MD5 continues <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> the divided highway as Three Notch Road toward Charlotte Hall and Waldorf.|$|E
5|$|Most {{outbound}} O-Bahn bus routes {{travel through}} the Adelaide city centre along Grenfell Street, left onto East Terrace, right onto Rundle Road through the Adelaide park lands {{to the north of}} Rymill Park, then left onto Dequetteville Terrace, which changes name to Hackney Road at the next major intersection. The Adelaide Botanic Garden is then on the left, followed by Botanic Park before the road crosses a bridge over the River Torrens. Soon after here, the two carriageways of the city ring route separate and swing to the northwest past North Adelaide, and the northbound entrance to the O-Bahn busway leaves the right hand side of the surface road and dips under the southbound carriageway to join the inbound track, both heading northeast. This on-street route will change when the O-Bahn City Access Project (see below) opens at the end of 2017. That will provide a 670 metre guided busway tunnel <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> from Grenfell Street, passing under Rymill Park and Rundle Road to surface for a short distance of on-road running on Hackney Road.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day, Miller {{came in at}} 2/121—O'Reilly {{believed}} that Bradman was trying to force the pace and had promoted Miller above Lindsay Hassett, the usual number four batsman—and was dismissed for a duck; he failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went <b>straight</b> <b>on</b> instead of turning in, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich. After Australia finished at 509 {{on the third day}} to take a 344-run lead, Miller opened the bowling with Johnston—Lindwall was injured while bowling in the first innings and was unable to take to the field. Miller removed Washbrook for one, caught behind by Tallon from a top-edged hook shot. Washbrook was displeased with the decision and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating his opinion that the ball hit his clothing rather than the bat.|$|E
