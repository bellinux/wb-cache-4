40|$|BACKGROUND: The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) {{vaccine is}} {{provided}} to over 100 million neonates annually {{to protect against}} childhood tuberculosis (TB). Recent BCG manufacturing interruptions highlight global supply risks. We estimated {{the potential impact of}} BCG shortfalls on global paediatric (< 15  years) TB mortality. METHODS: A static mathematical model was employed to estimate the number of paediatric TB deaths avoided by usual levels of BCG coverage, and potential additional TB deaths in the first 15  years of life due to 1 -year BCG <b>supply</b> <b>shortfalls</b> of 6. 3  % (as occurred in 2015) to 27. 6  % (as anticipated without mitigating action in 2015) assuming no catch-up campaigns. RESULTS: BCG coverage without shortfalls, estimated at 90  % globally, was estimated to avoid 117, 132 (95  % uncertainty range (UR) : 5049 - 306, 911) TB deaths globally per birth cohort in the first 15  years of life. An estimated 11, 713 (UR: 505 - 30, 691) additional TB deaths would occur in the first 15  years of life per 10  % (26 million dose) annual <b>supply</b> <b>shortfall.</b> A 16. 5 million dose (6. 3  %) shortfall as reported at the close of 2015, reflecting 84  % global coverage, was estimated as associated with 7433 (95  % UR: 320 - 19, 477) excess TB deaths in the affected cohort in the first 15  years. A possible 24, 914 (UR: 1074 - 65, 278) additional deaths were avoided due to prompt shortfall reduction measures in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: BCG shortages could greatly increase paediatric TB mortality. Although rapid action in 2015 minimised BCG shortfalls, avoiding a large number of potential additional deaths, the possible public health impact of even relatively small shortfalls highlights the critical importance of ensuring secure future manufacturing capacity and global BCG supply continuity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on a two-country, multi-period general {{equilibrium}} {{model of}} the spot and futures markets for crude oil, we {{show that there is}} no theoretical support for the common view that oil futures prices are accurate predictors of the spot price in the mean-squared prediction error (MSPE) sense; yet under certain conditions there is support for the view that oil futures prices are unbiased predictors. Our empirical analysis documents that futures-based forecasts typically are less accurate than the no-change forecast and biased, although the bias is small. Much of the MSPE is driven by the variability of the futures price about the expected spot price, as captured by the basis. Empirically, the fluctuations in the oil futures basis are larger and more persistent than fluctuations in the basis of foreign exchange futures. Within the context of our theoretical model, this anomaly {{can be explained by the}} marginal convenience yield of oil inventories. We show that increased uncertainty about future oil <b>supply</b> <b>shortfalls</b> under plausible assumptions causes the basis to decline and precautionary demand for crude oil to increase, resulting in an immediate increase in the real spot price that is not necessarily associated with an accumulation of oil inventories. Our main result is that the negative of the basis may be viewed as an index of fluctuations in the price of crude oil driven by precautionary demand for oil. An empirical analysis of this index provides independent evidence of how shifts in market expectations about future oil <b>supply</b> <b>shortfalls</b> affect the spot price of crude oil. Such expectation shifts have been difficult to quantify, yet have been shown to play an important role in explaining oil price fluctuations. Our empirical results are consistent with related evidence in the literature obtained by alternative methodologies...|$|R
