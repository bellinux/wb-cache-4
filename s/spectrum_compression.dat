40|$|Abstract—A {{multichannel}} terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) {{synthetic aperture}} radar (SAR) system is capa-ble of imaging a wider swath with a higher azimuth resolution for improved moving target detection. For TOPS SAR, due to antenna beam steering, the azimuth bandwidth of background clutter is {{much larger than the}} instantaneous signal bandwidth. To overcome this problem, a method referred to as <b>spectrum</b> <b>compression</b> space–time adaptive processing (SC-STAP) is pro-posed in this letter. Through the SC process, both the Doppler spectrum and the spatial spectrum of the background clutter are simultaneously compressed. This key step achieves fully over-lapped clutter space–time spectrum lines and, as such, enables effective clutter suppression and target signal alias compensation by applying linearly constrained STAP. Furthermore, {{in order to avoid the}} target ambiguities arising from the spectral wrapping, an approach based on deramp processing is proposed to focus the moving targets for TOPS SAR mode. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

So the relation between the distortion in Fourier domain and the compression in spatial domain is analyzed in this letter. Based on this analysis, a novel coding scheme is proposed, which can compress data in spatial domain while reducing the distortion in Fourier domain. The bitstream of set partitioning in hierarchical trees (SPIHT) is truncated by adaptively lifting the rate-distortion slopes of zerotrees according to the priorities of optical path difference (OPD) based on rate-distortion optimization theory.

40|$|Problem statement: Spectrally Efficient Frequency Division Multiplexing (SEFDM) system {{promises}} bandwidth savings by multiplexing overlapped non-orthogonal sub-carriers. However, {{the loss}} of orthogonality results in increasing the complexity of generation and detection of the signal. In this work, we propose simple framework for the generation of the SEFDM signal based on the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT). Approach: This study further proposes {{the use of the}} Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) as the receiver front end, specifically for extracting the statistics of the signal needed for recovering the transmitted signal. The proposed transmitter designs employ similar building blocks as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) based systems, hence, would facilitate an easy migration and/or coexistence with OFDMon the transmitter side. Furthermore, the proposed framework may facilitate the IDFT design for any Frequency Division Multiplexed (FDM) signal with arbitrary sub-carriers spacing. Results and Conclusion: The equivalence of the IDFT generated signal and the modulators based signal is proved mathematically, nonetheless, numerical simulations were performed to verify that equivalence and to test for the performance of the digitally generated signal in AWGN channel.
