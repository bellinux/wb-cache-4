6000|$|... "Splendid!" [...] Netta exclaimed, {{clapping}} her hands; [...] "and {{that man}} was right, dear, in feeling uncomfortable when your glasses were fixed on his face, though he little guessed what reason he had for the feeling. Well, it is worth all the four years you spent with us to have learned to read people's words from their lips.

At last I {{had to tell}} her she was {{annoying}} me very much, and that if she did it when they came down I should be seriously angry with her. When she saw I was quite in earnest, she pretended to be very penitent, although I am sure she was only amused; however, she gave it up as much as she could for the time.|$|E

"Ay, ay," [...] muttered this {{deliberate}} and grave-looking tar, who {{was no other}} than Richard Fid [...] "the stropping you've sent with the fellow is none of the best; and, if he squeaks <b>so</b> <b>now,</b> <b>what</b> will he do {{when you come to}} reeve a rope through him!

6000|$|... "Glad to see you, Roland; {{you have}} not been up at the house with Tom for the last month. He has been talking to me about this {{business}} of your father's. I quite take the view you do. I have been puzzled over the affair ever since I first heard of it, but your father's foolish flight deceived me, as well as the rest of us. I have no doubt what you say is correct, and that he has been so badly scared that he helped the game of the rascals who are the real criminals by bolting. However, although that may be your opinion and mine, it does not advance the case a bit. Your father, by his own act, has, so to speak, pleaded guilty, and has been condemned and sentenced accordingly by public opinion, and I tell you frankly that I don't think it is likely you will ever obtain a reversal of the sentence. Still, I approve of the resolution which Tom tells me that you have taken. You could not have a nobler aim in life than to clear your father's name, and I am ready to aid you so far as to give you a seat in my office here with a salary of six dollars a week--no great thing, but enough to keep you. It is unlikely, to my mind, that you will ever get any clue which will aid you; but if you should do, I shall be most heartily glad to help you with my advice, or in any other way in my power. I had always a high respect for your father, and will be glad to assist you for his sake, but I may say frankly, I will do so especially because you are a great friend of my Tom; and although he is not particularly bright he has, I think, enough good sense to choose his friends wisely, and indeed I know now, from my own observation in this instance, he has done <b>so.</b> <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> do you say to my offer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But, secondly, If thy plea be not for mercy, but for justice, then {{to speak}} {{a little to}} that. 1. Justice has {{measures}} and rules to go by; unto which measures and rules, if thou comest not up, justice can do thee no good. Come then, O thou blind Pharisee, let us pass away a few minutes in some discourse about this. Thou demandest justice, because God hath said, that the man that doth these things shall live in and by them. And again, the doers of the law shall be justified, not in a way of mercy, {{but in a way}} of justice: [...] "He shall live by them." [...] But what hast thou done, O blind Pharisee? What hast thou done, that thou art emboldened to venture to stand and fall to the most perfect justice of God? Hast thou fulfilled the whole law, and not offended in one point? Hast thou purged thyself from the pollutions and motions of sin that dwell in thy flesh, and work in thy own members? Is the very being of sin rooted out of thy tabernacle? And art thou now as perfectly innocent as ever was Jesus Christ? hast thou, by suffering the uttermost punishment that justice could justly lay upon thee for thy sins, made fair and full satisfaction to God, according to the tenor of his law, for thy transgressions? If thou hast done all these things, then thou mayst plead something, and yet but something, for thyself, in a way of justice. Nay, in this I will assert nothing, but will rather inquire: What hast thou gained by all this thy righteousness? (We will now suppose what must not be granted:) Was not this thy state when thou wast in thy first parents? Wast thou not innocent, perfectly innocent and righteous? And if thou shouldst be <b>so</b> <b>now,</b> <b>what</b> hast thou gained thereby? Suppose that the man that had, forty years ago, forty pounds of his own, and had spent it all since, should yet be able now to shew his forty pounds again; what has he got thereby, or how much richer is he at last than he was when he first set up for himself? Nay, doth not the blot of his ill living betwixt his first and his last, lie as a blemish upon him, unless he should redeem himself also, by works of supererogation, from the scandal that justice may lay at his door for that.|$|E
5000|$|About a {{week after}} the climax of the standoff, on April 19, 2014, Bundy spoke about {{witnessing}} a civil disturbance, the 1965 Watts riots. Bundy described his views about unhappiness at that time and criticized what he saw as government interference and its influence on African Americans. He recalled later seeing a public housing project in North Las Vegas where some of the older residents and the children sat on the porch. He said: I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro. When I go to Las Vegas, north Las Vegas, and I would see these little Government houses, and in front of that Government house the door was usually open, and the older people and the kids and there was always {{at least half a dozen}} people on the porch. They didn't have nothing to do, they didn't have nothing for the kids to do, they didn't have nothing for the young girls to do. They were basically on government subsidy, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>what</b> do they do? They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton. And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.|$|E

30|$|Besides {{trying to}} work out some risky ideas for the companies, {{establishing}} trust, decreasing costs and increasing the possibilities for the business structures one of the respondents lends credence to the idea that university equipment, wherever industry has expressed an interest in it, becomes an ‘anchor’ for the researchers’ thinking within a certain area of study, and this moreover attracts those companies interested in such developments - underlining the need for an anchor: ‘human thought processes are intrinsically transient; Today a person does this and tomorrow, by common sense, {{it would be better for}} him to do something else.

For three years the team does something, no matter whether it works out or not, the project is over, the equipment has been bought, they’ve been doing something, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>what?</b> Now they are out of money. There is no chapter in research manuals to help them generate, money of their own from this development which is a whole epoch in research and development. There’s no mechanism for that.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Education, 2015 The Common Core State Standards {{have been}} adopted {{by the state of}} California and the {{majority}} of the other states, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>what?</b> This qualitative study examines the implementation process of the new standards by looking at how principals are leading their staffs through the process, what leadership strategies are the most effective during this change, what shifts in teaching practice are necessary to support the new standards, and what teachers are doing to prepare their students for the new Smarter Balanced standardized testing. Three principals from three different schools were interviewed and a six-person focus group of two teachers from each of the same three schools was conducted to identify lessons from the implementation process of the new standards. Four categories and themes within these categories emerged from the data. These categories include the necessary shifts in teaching practice (the move from lecturer to facilitator of learning, incorporating technology in the classroom, and writing across the curriculum), the leadership needs during the implementation process (providing time for teachers to plan and collaborate, providing Common Core aligned professional development opportunities, and having open communication), the successes so far in the process (increased collaboration among staff and students, increase in students??? critical thinking skills, and the trainings that have been offered), and the challenges that the educators are experiencing (lack of Common Core aligned materials, lack of time to plan and collaborate, and preparing students for the new standardized assessments ??? SBAC) ...|$|E
