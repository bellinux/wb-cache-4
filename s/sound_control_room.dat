40|$|Live {{recordings}} {{of music and}} speech in concert halls have acoustical properties, such as reverberation, definition, clarity and spaciousness. Sound engineers play back these recordings through loudspeakers in sound control rooms for audio CD or film. The acoustical properties of these rooms influence the perceived acoustics of the live recording. To find the practical impact of ‘room in room’ acoustics in general, combinations of random room acoustic impulse responses using convolution techniques have been investigated. To find the practical impact of a <b>sound</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> on the acoustical parameter values of a concert hall when played back in that control room, combinations of concert hall impulse responses and <b>sound</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> impulse responses have been investigated. It is found that to accurately reproduce a steady sound energy decay rate (related to the reverberation time), the playback room {{should have at least}} twice this decay rate, under diffuse sound field conditions. For energy modulations (related to speech intelligibility) this decay rate should be more than four times higher. Finally, initial energy ratios (related to definition and clarity) require auditive judgement in the direct sound field. ITU-recommendations used for <b>sound</b> <b>control</b> <b>room</b> design are sufficient for reverberation and speech intelligibility judgement of concert hall recordings. Clarity judgement needs a very high decay rate, while judgement of spaciousness can only be done by headphone...|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the regular}} season, while the Nationals were on their final road trip of the year between September 19 and 27, a new organ was {{installed}} at Nationals Park, fulfilling the Nationals organization's long-held goal of upgrading the stadium's organ. The Viscount Sonus 60, priced at $20,000 on European Web sites, was manufactured in Mondaino, Italy, and tuned in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It was installed in a former radio booth {{on the second floor}} of the stadium′s press box, replacing a less-capable portable Hammond organ that had been located in a corner of the stadium′s <b>sound</b> effects <b>control</b> <b>room.</b> The new location gave the organist a private room for the first time, as well as a better view of the field and crowd.|$|R
40|$|A {{submarine}} {{is routinely}} required {{to return to}} periscope depth; however, a transition from deep to shallow waters is one the most dangerous operations due to the potential to collide with surface vessels. Submarine operations are not particularly well understood outside the immediate submarine community, particularly from a sociotechnical perspective. A submarine <b>sounds</b> and <b>control</b> <b>room</b> simulator {{was used to examine}} the work of ten teams. The Event Analysis of Systematic Teamwork method was used to model the social, task and information networks in order to describe team performance. Results showed that the sonar controller and operations officer are the busiest in the command team. Communication between these operators was revealed as a potential bottleneck in the command team, particularly during higher demand scenarios. The information communicated and tasks completed centred on the processing and understanding of sonar data. Implications are discussed alongside suggestions for future work...|$|R
40|$|Helmholtz {{resonators}} {{are often}} {{applied for the}} <b>sound</b> equalisation of <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> in recording studios, through adequate levelling of the low frequency acoustic modal room responses. The number of controlled acoustic modes depends on the central frequency and damping of resonators, {{as well as on}} the modal density of the controlled system within the resonators frequency range. In a recent paper we proposed to improve the efficiency of such devices by, instead of using basic Helmholtz resonators develop shape optimized multi-modal resonators in order to cope with a larger number of intrusive room modes. In spite of the promising results thus obtained, further work is needed to demonstrate the feasibility of such approach. The present paper is a further step in that direction by analysing the acoustics of the fully coupled room/resonators system. More specifically, using a substructure computational approach we theoretically derive the coupled acoustical modes of <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> fitted with several optimized multi-mode resonators...|$|R
5000|$|Cherry Beach <b>Sound</b> has two <b>control</b> <b>rooms,</b> one {{of which}} houses a large Solid State Logic console, and the other of which uses a Digidesign D CONTROL Icon console. Both <b>control</b> <b>rooms</b> are wired to the studio's live floor, and were {{designed}} and acoustically treated by Martin Pilchner. <b>Control</b> <b>Room</b> A is a {{one of a kind}} studio as it is the only studio in Canada with soffit-mounted Genelec monitors and 5.1 surround sound capability. The website of Pilchner-Schoustal International states: [...] "A notable feature of the design is the extremely large front window which engages the <b>control</b> <b>room</b> to the studio. Four separate layers of laminated glass take up over 6 feet of depth and run over 21 feet long including two 30 degree miters per layer. The window also splays upward toward the studio space, and as such incorporated an enormous amount of glass." [...] Cherry Beach Sound utilizes the latest modern technologies such as Source-Connect, an array of Genelec monitors, a 56-channel SSL console, Neve and Manley pre-amps and compressors, a Yamaha C7 Grand piano, and a large lot of mics including the Neumann U 87, Neumann U 89, AKG C 414 EB, Sennheiser MD 421, and many more.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork (EAST) method {{as a means}} of modelling distributed cognition in systems. The method comprises three network models (i. e. task, social and information) and their combination. This method was applied to the interactions between the <b>sound</b> <b>room</b> and <b>control</b> <b>room</b> in a submarine, following the activities of returning the submarine to periscope depth. This paper demonstrates three main developments in EAST. First, building the network models directly, without reference to the intervening methods. Second, the application of analysis metrics to all three networks. Third, the combination of the aforementioned networks in different ways to gain a broader understanding of the distributed cognition. Analyses have shown that EAST can be used to gain both qualitative and quantitative insights into distributed cognition. Future research should focus on the analyses of network resilience and modelling alternative versions of a system...|$|R
500|$|In turn, Evile's guitarists {{went into}} a room where another person sat with a microphone, ready to capture the <b>sound.</b> From the <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> Rasmussen would say [...] "Right, play something". The {{respective}} guitarist would play his instrument, to which Rasmussen would respond [...] "Right, move it left". Moving the guitar left, the respective guitarist would play again, Rasmussen replying with [...] "Move it right. Alright, leave it there. Don't touch it". The respective guitarist would leave his instrument in that position, and the [...] "record" [...] button would be pressed. From there, the musician in question would play his parts. A Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier amplifier was tested alongside a Marshall [...] amplifier, but according to Drake, [...] "the Mesa (sound) was nowhere near as good". Evile chose to record Enter the Graves guitar parts using a Marshall amplifier, and spent roughly ten minutes attempting to achieve a [...] "decent" [...] sound.

As a first experience of the difference from the way you played it to the <b>sound</b> in the <b>control</b> <b>room,</b> it was overwhelming. And I knew immediately who he was - Phil Spector. - Klaus Voormann, describing his first experience of working with Spector and his Wall of Soundtechnique According to author Bruce Spizer, the line-up for the basic track, before overdubs, was Lennon (vocals, acoustic guitar), Harrison (electric guitar), Preston (organ), Voormann (bass) and White (drums). Lennon later recalled of the recording: [...] "Phil (Spector) came in and said, 'How do you want it?' And I said, '1950s' and he said 'Right' and BOOM! ... he played it back and there it was." [...] The song uses a similar amount of echo to 1950s Sun Records recordings.|$|R
