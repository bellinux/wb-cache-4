5|$|Matthias {{participated in}} the lengthy Palm Sunday {{ceremony}} in Vienna in 1490, although he had felt so ill that morning {{that he could not}} eat breakfast. Around noon, he tasted a fig that proved to be rotten and he became very agitated and <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> faint. The next day he was unable to speak. After two days of suffering, Matthias died in the morning of 6 April. According to Professor Frigyes Korányi, Matthias died of a stroke; Dr. Herwig Egert does not exclude the possibility of poisoning. Matthias's funeral was held in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna and he was buried in Székesfehérvár Cathedral on 24 or 25 April 1490.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's divisional commanders were {{immediately}} {{impressed by his}} capacity for hard work, {{from the beginning of}} Italy campaign. Subordinates could never say they would attend to something and then let it slide, and the staff who had been stationary in Nice for four years <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> pulsating effect of Napoleon's energy. In the nine month between arrival in Nice and the end of 1776 he sent more than eight hundred letters and despatches, covering everything from where drummer-boys should stand in parades to the conditions under which the 'Marseillaise' should be played. Augereu was first of his generals to be won over, followed Massena. 'That little bastard of a general actually frightened me!' Augereau would later tell Massena.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being read the story of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E

25|$|William M'Culloch (1691 – 18 December 1771) was Minister of Cambuslang {{during the}} {{extraordinary}} {{events of the}} Cambuslang Work (1742) when 30,000 people gathered in the hillsides near his church for preaching and communion. Many were there struck by their own depravity and horrified at the probable punishment after death. Trembling, wailing, great pain, nose-bleeding and other strange behaviour was followed in some cases by striking conversions when they <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> accepted by Christ. This gave rise to great rejoicing and singing. It was later calculated that about 400 people had been converted, though many had backslided. The Reverend M’Culloch was a strange person {{to be at the}} centre of this phenomenon — one that was being repeated in the American Colonies at the time. He was a poor preacher and claimed never to have experienced the strong feelings of sin or conversion that so many others had reported.|$|E
25|$|At eleven o'clock, on {{the morning}} of October 20, 1969, in St. Petersburg, Florida, Kerouac was sitting in his {{favorite}} chair drinking whiskey and malt liquor, {{working on a book about}} his father's print shop in Lowell, Massachusetts. He <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> nauseated and walked to the bathroom, where he began to vomit blood. Kerouac was taken to a nearby hospital, suffering from an abdominal hemorrhage. He received several transfusions in an attempt to make up for the loss of blood, and doctors subsequently attempted surgery, but a damaged liver prevented his blood from clotting. He died at 5:15 the following morning at St. Anthony's Hospital, never having regained consciousness after the operation. His cause of death was listed as an internal hemorrhage (bleeding esophageal varices) caused by cirrhosis, the result of longtime alcohol abuse. A possible contributing factor was an untreated hernia he suffered in a bar fight several weeks earlier. He is buried at Edson Cemetery, Lowell, Massachusetts.|$|E
500|$|When the underwire {{breaks through}} the bra fabric, {{it can cause}} {{tremendous}} discomfort. Celebrity chef, television personality, and businesswoman Clarissa Dickson Wright only wears a bra on special occasions. At her 50th birthday party, she was dancing when she <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> a [...] "terrifying pain in my chest." [...] She initially thought {{she was having a}} heart attack. [...] "The pain got more and more intense. I staggered off and discovered I'd broken my underwired bra." ...|$|E

500|$|On 22 May 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria for his [...] "services ... {{rendered}} to {{the promotion}} of the art of music" [...] in Britain. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. [...] Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> trapped. [...] In mid-December, he bade farewell to his sister-in-law Charlotte, Fred's widow, who emigrated with her young family to America. Sullivan's oldest nephew, Herbert, stayed behind in England as his uncle's ward. The next opera, Princess Ida (1884, the duo's only three-act, blank verse work), had a noticeably shorter run than its four predecessors, although Sullivan's score was praised. With box office receipts lagging in March 1884, Carte gave the six months' notice, under the partnership contract, requiring a new opera. Sullivan's close friend, the composer Frederic Clay, had suffered a serious stroke in early December 1883 that effectively ended his career at the age of 45. Sullivan, reflecting on this, on his own longstanding kidney problems, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, replied to Carte, [...] "t is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Turkish Ministry of Youth and Sports, {{during the}} Men's 1500 metres, Vahram Papazyan had a [...] "fabulous tempo" [...] and {{was leading the}} race which {{positioned}} him for first place. However, when about 20–25 meters remained in the race, Papazyan <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> dizzy and collapsed.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of January 29, 1380, {{at the time of}} Vespers, Saint Catherine of Siena, who had been contemplating the mosaic for some hours, <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> as if [...] "the ship had fallen off and landed on her shoulders" [...] with [...] "unbearable weight".

2500|$|Evans left Davis' sextet in November 1958 {{and stayed}} {{with his parents}} in Florida and his brother in Louisiana. While he was burned out, {{one of the main}} reasons for leaving was his father's illness. During this sojourn, the always self-critical Evans <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> his playing had improved. [...] "While I was staying with my brother in Baton Rouge, I {{remember}} finding that somehow I had reached a new level of expression in my playing. It had come almost automatically, and I was very anxious about it, afraid I might lose it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On her part, the Infanta did {{not enjoy}} her visit to Paris. Ill most of the time, she {{suffered}} from fever, often {{had to stay in}} bed and only reluctantly took part in the diversions on her honor. She was anxious about her husband health who depended on her for everything. One day, as Louis got out of the carriage at Château de Malmaison, where they were going to dine, he <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> to the ground in an epilepsy fit. The Duchess of Abrantes described the scene in her memoirs: ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{had written}} long-form before {{but it is}} pure story-telling in script writing and that goes {{back as far as}} I can {{remember}} for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I would tell her stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. She would say [...] "tell me a story" [...] so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> like I was just making up a big story.|$|E

2500|$|Louis {{showed his}} great affection for Marie by wearing ribbons often matched to hers. This flattery spoiled her, {{and she began}} to {{consider}} herself as the Queen. She flaunted herself before Queen Marie Thérèse, and put Athénaïs de Montespan to shame with her behavior. [...] The king gave her one hundred thousand crowns a month, twice as gifts, but he could not exhaust her extravagance, her coach was being driven by eight horses, [...] it seemed to [...] "eat her reign at a time." [...] Louis XIV <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> young again. He wore diamonds, ribbons and feathers. Every day they went out to a new party, ballets, and comedies—never had luxury been pushed so far.|$|E
2500|$|But Miller also staffed {{his team}} {{with a number of}} young who came from outside of the mines, and often unions altogether. Many of them were idealistic {{progressives}} who supported Miller's reformist cause and had filled critical roles in the presidential campaign. These appointments and others like them caused friction in the Miller administration from the start. [...] "He <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> he was not educated enough to run the Union. [...] He relied on some of the college people who were non miners and they tended to isolate Arnold from the coal miners." [...] The college-educated staffers also alienated other, less educated, more conservative, leaders such as Trbovich, who claimed the young staffers were [...] "leftwing radicals from New York and Boston..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gower was {{repeatedly}} lambasted {{by the media}} as being [...] "laid back" [...] or [...] "nonchalant" [...] with a [...] "devil-may-care" [...] approach some found infuriating, as Wisden records, [...] "the difference between an exquisite stroke and a nick {{was little more than}} an inch" [...] in his style of batting. Peter Roebuck recorded that [...] "Gower never moves, he drifts" [...] while Frances Edmonds in the Daily Express spoke of Gower in 1985: [...] "Difficult to be more laid back without being actually comatose." [...] Gower himself commented in 1995 in an interview in The Independent: [...] "I was never destined to be on the ball 100 per cent of the time. I don't have the same ability that Graham Gooch has, to produce something very close to his best every time he plays. There were Test matches where I <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt,</b> at the end of it, 'Well, I wish I'd really been at that one.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Sightings {{investigated}} the prison {{and claimed that}} they have evidence of ghostly activity caught on film at Alcatraz. A CBS news team was also reputed to have experienced strange activity in the prison hospital and in the laundry room. Psychic Daena Smoller and psychologist Larry Montz investigated the prison and found nothing in D-Block or the cellhouse but equipped with a magnetometer, they picked up a reading in the New Industries Building {{in the area where}} inmates had been employed in sewing. Smoller says that she picked up on the intense sound of buzzing of sewing machines and energy of the workplace and <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> an intense pain in her neck. Nothing happened for several minutes until the magnetometer reportedly [...] "jumped". Montz said that unless there was an electromagnetic device in the building which would cause it to have taken place, then there was [...] "definitely paranormal activity taking place". Apparently unknown to the investigators, the incident had occurred in the area that Henri Young had murdered Rufus McCain, stabbing him in the neck.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Ruffalo as Doctor. The doctor also becomes {{something}} of a leader; in an early scene, he reveals {{that he has been}} elected as his ward's official representative {{to the rest of the}} community. Meirelles originally sought to cast actor Daniel Craig as Doctor, but negotiations were not finalized. Ruffalo said that his character loses the illusion of his self-perspective and perceives his wife as being a person he could aspire to. Ruffalo said, [...] "That's a very difficult moment for anybody, to have all their perceptions completely shattered, but I think the Doctor finally comes to a peace about his inabilities and his downfall, and admits to an admiration for his wife's strengths." [...] The actor wore a layer of makeup to appear older and also wore contact lenses to be blind while having his eyes open. The actor said of the experience as a blind character, [...] "At first it's terrifying and then it's frustrating and then it gets quiet... we're tormented by our eyesight... you don't know this until you go blind... As an actor I <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> free." ...|$|E
2500|$|Increasingly viewing {{his work}} with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills and repetitious, Sullivan had {{intended}} to resign from the partnership with Gilbert and Richard D'Oyly Carte after Iolanthe, but after a recent financial loss, he concluded that his financial needs required him to continue writing Savoy operas. [...] Therefore, in February 1883, with Iolanthe still playing strongly at the Savoy Theatre, Gilbert and Sullivan signed a new five-year partnership agreement to create new operas for Carte upon six months' notice. [...] He also gave his consent to Gilbert {{to continue with the}} adaptation of The Princess as the basis for their next opera. Later that spring, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria and the honour was announced in May {{at the opening of the}} Royal College of Music. Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that Sullivan's knighthood should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera – that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan <b>suddenly</b> <b>felt</b> trapped.|$|E
