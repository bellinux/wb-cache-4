25|$|India is {{the leader}} in {{production}} of anise, badian (<b>star</b> <b>anise),</b> fennel and coriander.|$|E
25|$|The spices, often {{wrapped in}} {{cheesecloth}} or a soaking bag {{to prevent them}} from floating all over the pot, usually contain cloves, <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> coriander seed, fennel, cinnamon, black cardamom, ginger, and onion.|$|E
25|$|Fennel {{is widely}} cultivated, both in its native range and elsewhere, for its edible, {{strongly}} flavored leaves and fruits. Its aniseed flavor comes from anethole, an aromatic compound {{also found in}} anise and <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> and its taste and aroma are similar to theirs, though usually not as strong.|$|E
50|$|Akasan (sometimes Aka100) is {{a popular}} Haitian {{beverage}} made from milk, corn flour, <b>anise</b> <b>stars,</b> vanilla and cinnamon. It is drunk either warm or cold, often as a breakfast beverage. Akasan {{is known for its}} rich sweetness and thickness.|$|R
5000|$|White Châteauneuf-du-Pape is {{produced}} by excluding the red varieties and only using the six permitted white varieties. The white varieties account for 7 {{percent of the total}} plantation according to 2004 statistics, and a portion of the whites grapes are blended into red wines, which means that white wine production only accounts for around 5 percent of the total. In white Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache blanc and Roussanne provides fruitiness and fatness to the blend while Bourboulenc, Clairette and Picpoul add acidity, floral and mineral notes. The style of these wines range from lean and minerally to oily and rich with a variety of aromas and flavor notes—including almond, <b>star</b> fruit, <b>anise,</b> fennel, honeysuckle and peach. A single varietal, Roussanne, that is matured in an oak aging barrel, is also made by some estates. Most whites are made to be drunk young. Some white Châteauneuf-du-Pape are meant to age and tend to develop exotic aromas and scents of orange peels after 7-8 years. [...] Rosé wines are not allowed within the appellation.|$|R
50|$|Condrieu wine {{is often}} characterised by {{delicate}} aromatics of peaches, dried fruit and white flowers. Some examples also have notes of <b>anise,</b> <b>star</b> fruit and melons. Often the wine is full bodied and rich {{in a style}} that is texturally similarly to Chardonnay. Normally the wine is made dry but the fruitiness and perfume of the bouquet can suggest sweetness. The Viognier grape is naturally low in acidity which challenges growers and winemakers to keep the wine from becoming flabby and bleak. Some winemakers in the region use malolactic fermentation and some do not. The delicate flavors of the wine can be overwhelmed by too much oak during the winemaking process.|$|R
25|$|The broth for beef pho is {{generally}} made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones {{may still have}} beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, fennel seed, and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.|$|E
500|$|The wreck held {{three main}} types of [...] "wares" [...] {{in the form}} of bowls: [...] (produced in kilns in Tongguan), the {{majority}} of the 60,000 items, were originally packed in either straw cylinders or [...] "Dusun" [...] storage jars; White-ware, manufactured in the Ding kilns and including the earliest known intact underglaze blue and white dishes; and Yue ware from Zhejiang Province. One Changsha bowl was inscribed with a date: [...] "16th day of the seventh month of the second year of the Baoli reign", or 826 AD. This was later confirmed by radiocarbon dating of <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> found amongst the wreck. The cargo had a surprising variety of influences and markets, including Buddhist lotus symbols, motifs from Central Asia and Persia, Koranic inscriptions, and green-splashed bowls popular in Iran.|$|E
500|$|The Chinese {{engaged in}} {{large-scale}} production for overseas export {{by at least}} {{the time of the}} Tang. This was proven by the discovery of the Belitung shipwreck, a silt-preserved shipwrecked Arabian dhow in the Gaspar Strait near Belitung, which had 63,000 pieces of Tang ceramics, silver, and gold (including a Changsha bowl inscribed with a date: [...] "16th day of the seventh month of the second year of the Baoli reign", or 826, roughly confirmed by radiocarbon dating of <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> at the wreck). Beginning in 785, the Chinese began to call regularly at Sufala on the East African coast in order to cut out Arab middlemen, with various contemporary Chinese sources giving detailed descriptions of trade in Africa. The official and geographer Jia Dan (730–805) wrote of two common sea trade routes in his day: one from the coast of the Bohai Sea towards Korea and another from Guangzhou through Malacca towards the Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka and India, the eastern and northern shores of the Arabian Sea to the Euphrates River. In 863 the Chinese author Duan Chengshi (d. 863) provided {{a detailed description of the}} slave trade, ivory trade, and ambergris trade in a country called Bobali, which historians suggest was Berbera in Somalia. In Fustat (old Cairo), Egypt, the fame of Chinese ceramics there led to an enormous demand for Chinese goods; hence Chinese often traveled there (this continued into later periods such as Fatimid Egypt). From this time period, the Arab merchant Shulama once wrote of his admiration for Chinese seafaring junks, but noted that their draft was too deep for them to enter the Euphrates River, which forced them to ferry passengers and cargo in small boats. Shulama also noted that Chinese ships were often very large, with capacities up to 600–700 passengers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{patterns}} of the Rukai people's traditional dress include the sun, hundred pacer, snake, human head, human figure, string, pig, rhombus, and deer patterns, but {{the sun and the}} hundred pacer pattern are the most popular ones. [...] The rhombus pattern, which Rukai people regard as the symbol of the hundred pacer, is usually made with satin stich embroidery. [...] The <b>anise</b> <b>star</b> pattern, signifying holiness, is usually made with cross-stich embroidery. [...] Two sun patterns, considered a sign of the aristocracy, are normally embroidered on the breast area of the nobles’ dresses. [...] The snake, human head, and human figure patterns are usually made with patch embroidery.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, various vendors experimented with [...] (a {{seasoning}} made of ground cinnamon, <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> , and clove), sesame oil, tofu, and even Lethocerus indicus extract (...) [...] This [...] "" [...] failed {{to enter the}} mainstream.|$|E
2500|$|Liquorice (British English) or {{licorice}} (American English) [...] , [...] is {{the root}} of Glycyrrhiza glabra from which a sweet flavour can be extracted. The liquorice plant is a herbaceous perennial legume native to southern Europe and parts of Asia, such as India. It is not botanically related to anise, <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> or fennel, which are sources of similar flavouring compounds.|$|E
2500|$|Absinthe is {{traditionally}} prepared from a distillation of neutral alcohol, various herbs, spices and water. Traditional absinthes were redistilled {{from a white}} grape spirit (or eau de vie), while lesser absinthes were more commonly made from alcohol from grain, beets, or potatoes. The principal botanicals are grande wormwood, green anise, and florence fennel, which are often called [...] "the holy trinity." [...] Many other herbs {{may be used as}} well, such as petite wormwood (Artemisia pontica or Roman wormwood), hyssop, melissa, <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> angelica, peppermint, coriander, and veronica.|$|E
2500|$|Tambelan laksa (Indonesian: Laksa Tambelan) from Tambelan Archipelago in Riau Islands {{province}} of Indonesia, off {{the west coast}} of West Kalimantan. It uses flaked sauteed ikan tongkol asap (smoked mackerel tuna or skipjack tuna) and lump of sagoo noodles, served in spicy coconut-based stock made of kerisik (sauteed grated coconut, pounded or blended into paste). Laksa Tambelan uses quite complex spice mixture, which includes sour asam kandis (Garcinia xanthochymus [...] ), daun kesum, shallot, garlic, chilli pepper, lemongrass, turmeric, clove, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> galangal, coriander, caraway, black pepper, also anchovy and ground dried shrimp.|$|E
2500|$|Oseltamivir total {{synthesis}} {{concerns the}} total {{synthesis of the}} antiinfluenza drug oseltamivir [...] marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche under the trade name Tamiflu. Its commercial production starts from the biomolecule shikimic acid harvested from Chinese <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> [...] with a limited worldwide supply. Due to its limited supply, searches for alternative synthetic routes preferably not requiring shikimic acid are underway and to date several such routes have been published. Control of stereochemistry is important: the molecule has three stereocenters and the sought-after isomer is only 1 of 8 stereoisomers.|$|E
2500|$|In Chinese cuisine, squab {{is a part}} of celebratory banquets for {{holidays}} such as Chinese New Year, usually served deep-fried. Cantonese-style pigeon {{is typically}} braised in soy sauce, rice wine and <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> then roasted with crispy skin and tender meat. Squabs are sold live in Chinese marketplaces to assure freshness, but they can also be dressed in two styles. [...] "Chinese-style" [...] (Buddhist slaughter) birds retain their head and feet, whereas [...] "New York-dressed" [...] (Confucian slaughter) birds retain their entrails, head and feet. The greatest volume of U.S. squab is currently sold within Chinatowns.|$|E
2500|$|Ponche {{is served}} during the Christmas holiday season, {{and it is}} served warm. According to historians ponche came to Mexico from Persia, where they used to consume a very similar drink they called [...] "panch," [...] made with water, lemon, herbs, sugar and rum. This {{tradition}} migrated to Europe and acquired the name [...] "punch," [...] known in Spain as [...] "ponche." [...] Some ingredients used to make ponche are more seasonal and even exotic. Fresh tejocotes, known to the Aztecs as Texocotli (stone fruit) are de rigueur. [...] Tejocotes are {{the fruit of the}} hawthorn tree, and resembles crab apples; they have a sweet-sour flavor and an orange to golden yellow color. Other ingredients in ponche are prunes, pears, dry hibiscus, <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> and sugar cane pieces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} French preparation involves {{placing a}} sugar cube {{on top of}} a specially designed slotted spoon, and placing the spoon on a glass filled with a measure of absinthe. Iced water is poured or dripped over the sugar cube to mix the water into the absinthe. The final preparation contains 1 part absinthe and 3-5 parts water. As water dilutes the spirit, those components with poor water solubility (mainly those from anise, fennel, and <b>star</b> <b>anise)</b> come out of solution and cloud the drink. The resulting milky opalescence is called the [...] (Fr. opaque or shady, IPA [...] ). The release of these dissolved essences coincides with a perfuming of herbal aromas and flavours that [...] "blossom" [...] or [...] "bloom," [...] and brings out subtleties that are otherwise muted within the neat spirit. This reflects what is perhaps the oldest and purest method of preparation, and {{is often referred to as}} the French Method.|$|E
50|$|Illicium verum is a {{medium-sized}} evergreen tree native to northeast Vietnam and southwest China. A spice commonly called <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> staranise, <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> seed, Chinese <b>star</b> <b>anise,</b> or badiam that closely resembles anise in flavor is {{obtained from the}} star-shaped pericarp of the fruit of Illicium verum which are harvested just before ripening. <b>Star</b> <b>anise</b> oil is a highly fragrant oil used in cooking, perfumery, soaps, toothpastes, mouthwashes, and skin creams. About 90% of the world's <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> crop is used for extraction of shikimic acid, a chemical intermediate used in the synthesis of oseltamivir.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Star</b> <b>anise</b> {{contains}} anethole, {{the same}} ingredient {{that gives the}} unrelated anise its flavor. Recently, <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> has come into use in the West as a less expensive substitute for anise in baking, {{as well as in}} liquor production, most distinctively in the production of the liqueur Galliano. It is also used in the production of sambuca, pastis, and many types of absinthe. <b>Star</b> <b>anise</b> enhances the flavour of meat.|$|E
5000|$|Japanese <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> (Illicium anisatum), {{a similar}} tree, is highly toxic and inedible; in Japan, it has instead been burned as incense. Cases of illness, {{including}} [...] "serious neurological effects, such as seizures", reported after using <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> tea, {{may be a}} result of deliberate economically motivated adulteration with this species. Japanese <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> contains anisatin, which causes severe inflammation of the kidneys, urinary tract, and digestive organs. The toxicity of I. anisatum, also known as shikimi, is caused by its potent neurotoxins anisatin, neoanisatin, and pseudoanisatin, which are noncompetitive antagonists of GABA receptors.|$|E

50|$|Western cuisines {{have long}} used anise to flavor dishes, drinks, and candies. The word {{is used for}} both the species of herb and its licorice-like flavor. The most {{powerful}} flavor component of the essential oil of anise, anethole, is found in both anise and an unrelated spice indigenous to northern China called <b>star</b> <b>anise</b> (Illicium verum) widely used in South Asian, Southeast Asian, and East Asian dishes. <b>Star</b> <b>anise</b> is considerably less expensive to produce, and has gradually displaced P. anisum in Western markets. While formerly produced in larger quantities, by 1999 world production of the essential oil of anise was only 8 tons, compared to 400 tons of <b>star</b> <b>anise.</b>|$|E
