The New York Observer wrote of the video that [...] "e're not <b>sure</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> this video is promoting" [...] but [...] "the caliber of the cast's sheer ubiquity is impressive". A blogger on Yahoo Music commented that the models [...] "do a better job modeling clothes than miming Jigga", but concluded, however, that the video is [...] "without a doubt the greatest lip-dub ever committed to video".|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork writer Stuart Berman {{stated that}} [...] "The Hungry Saws {{temperate}} approach {{feels like the}} work of a band who are grateful for a new lease on life, but not <b>sure</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> to do with it," [...] noting how [...] "the record turns increasingly more restrained, as it reconciles the band's well-established soul affinities with a more pastoral presentation" [...] while praising its [...] "beautifully rendered" [...] ballads. In his review for PopMatters, Michael Keefe opined that while [...] "all of The Hungry Saw finds Tindersticks trekking through fairly familiar territory...they find new diversions along the way." [...] Writing for Record Collector, Jake Kennedy said that [...] "The Hungry Saw marks a wonderful coming of age for Tindersticks...this is the sound of pure rejuvenation." [...] In a less complementary review, Shannon Zimmerman of Spin found that [...] "the first half of Tindersticks' latest is a can't-miss proposition" [...] but that [...] "the disc's second half descends into a morass of half-finished, melancholic curios that mostly go nowhere slowly." [...] Uncut critic Sam Richards was similarly unimpressed, offering that [...] "Tindersticks have returned refreshed, but some of the old dissolute glamour is gone." [...] This opinion was not shared by Tiny Mix Tapes, whose reviewing writer said that [...] "ultimately, it’s another Tindersticks record, and they’re still good after all these years. It’s not an incredibly remarkable record, but when a band is this consistent for this long, it’s hard to fault it." ...|$|E

The stage was marred by numerous falls and punctures, which started on the descent from Mt Buffalo. Opperman’s account of the stage included that [...] "On the morning we left the Chalet the instructions to the riders were changed four times in half an hour. At first we were to be controlled down the hill, then the field were to be allowed to use their own discretion, and race down, and these instructions were cancelled and altered until no one felt <b>sure</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> was the case." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the trial}} began in July 2012, Terry entered a {{not guilty plea}} and was acquitted of the charge on 13 July 2012. The court {{established}} that neither Ferdinand nor anyone else had heard Terry's words, but Terry himself {{admitted that he had}} directed the words [...] "fucking black cunt" [...] and [...] "fucking knobhead" [...] at Ferdinand, which was affirmed by two expert lip readers from video evidence. Terry maintained that he used the words as a form of sarcasm and that he was questioning what he thought had been an allegation of racism from Ferdinand; neither lip reader was able to [...] "identify whether the statement was made as a question or in what type of voice it was said." [...] Justice Riddle concluded that while there was no doubt Terry had uttered those words in anger, [...] "it is impossible to be <b>sure</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> were the words spoken by [...] at the relevant time" [...] and that {{there was a lack of}} evidence to prove beyond a doubt that Terry had used them as an insult instead of [...] "a challenge to what he believed had been said to him." [...] The court therefore found Terry not guilty.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley Kauffmann, in The New Republic, wrote, [...] "This is {{the scariest}} film I've seen in years—the only scary film I've seen in years... If {{you want to}} be shaken—and I found out, while the picture was going, that that's what I wanted—then The Exorcist will scare the… (shit) out of you." [...] Variety noted that it was [...] "an expert telling of a supernatural horror story... The climactic {{sequences}} assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror." [...] In Castle of Frankenstein, Joe Dante called it [...] "an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic. Director Friedkin's film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see... Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a 4-out-of-4 star review, praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the convincing special effects {{but at the end of}} the review wrote, [...] "I am not <b>sure</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment won’t be one, because what we get here aren’t the delicious chills of a Vincent Price thriller, but raw and painful experience. Are people so numb they need movies of this intensity in order to feel anything at all?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Maslansky is {{the costume}} {{designer}} for Iron Fist, after serving {{the same role}} for the previous Marvel Netflix series. Maslansky noted one {{of the differences in}} the series compared to the other Marvel Netflix series was the neighborhoods it spent time in ("the wealthier neighborhoods; Midtown, Upper East Side, that sort of thing") compared to Hell's Kitchen for Daredevil and Jessica Jones and Harlem for Luke Cage. As such, Rand wears more suits than the other heroes, and given the amount of fighting he does in the season, a lot of spandex was added to increase the suits' flexibility. Rand's look evolves throughout the season, with Maslansky noting, [...] "When we first meet him he's clearly traveled a long way. I wanted people to look at Danny and not be <b>sure</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> he was. A backpacker, or a homeless man. His look needed to reflect a variety of culture... almost ... otherworldly." [...] Once Rand enters the corporate world, he settles on an [...] "Urban Cali" [...] style, which is [...] "a little looser, little more relaxed. But it’s still a suit. His tie is never tied tightly and he always wears sneakers." [...] This relaxed style for Rand also provided [...] "a strong contrast" [...] to Ward Meachum who is a [...] "far more corporate looking person." [...] The monk costumes and Rand's warrior costume was based on [...] "real Shaolin warrior monk costumes... I took that distinctive silhouette from the Shaolin warrior monk clothing, and we combined it with the traditional colors of the Iron Fist, green and gold." [...] Regarding Gao, Maslansky stated [...] "Her particular look is influenced by ancient China," [...] particularly the Terracotta Army and further progress the [...] "villainy" [...] look of the Marvel Netflix series of [...] "surround themselves with , with beautiful things." ...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common ECOs in ASIC design is the gate-level netlist ECO. In this flow, {{engineers}} manually (and often tediously) hand-edit the gate-level netlist, instead of re-running logic synthesis. The netlist files have to be searched for the logic affected by the change, the files need to be edited to implement the changes up and down the hierarchy, and the changes need to be tracked and verified to make <b>sure</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> needs to change gets changed and nothing more. This is a very time and resource-intensive process that is easily subject to errors. Therefore formal equivalence checking is normally used after ECOs to ensure the revised implementation matches the revised specification.|$|E
50|$|Although Julip {{issued a}} {{detailed}} catalogue depicting all the models in their {{range in the}} mid 1960s, from 1967 onwards this {{was replaced by a}} typewritten sheet that simply listed the models and accessories, and which was accompanied by a printed sheet of photos which did not identify which model was which.
