In 1919 the Bell System was impacted considerably by organized operator strikes and the leadership abandoned its rejection of automatic switching equipment. As a result, Automatic Electric became a long-term supplier of <b>step-by-step</b> <b>switching</b> equipment to the Bell System.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{approach for}} direct {{studies of the}} polarization reversal mechanism in thin film ferroelectric capacitors based on piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) in conjunction with pulse switching capabilities is presented. Instant domain configurations developing in a 3 x 3 mu m(2) capacitor {{at different stages of}} the polarization reversal process have been registered using <b>step-by-step</b> <b>switching</b> and subsequent PFM imaging. The developed approach allows direct comparison of experimentally measured microscopic switching behavior with parameters used by phenomenological switching models. It has been found that in the low field regime (just above the threshold value) used in the present study, the mechanism of polarization reversal changes during the switching cycle from the initial nucleation-dominated process to the lateral domain expansion at the later stages. The classical nucleation model of Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi (KAI) provides reasonable approximation for the nucleation-dominated stage of switching but is inapplicable to the slow switching stage. It has been suggested that the switching dynamics can be approximated by averaging the KAI model over a broad distribution of switching times. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

The digital PBX {{has always been the}} choice for voice communications but has lagged behind the LAN industry when it comes to data transfers. The pendulum has begun to swing with the enhanced data capabilities of third and fourth generation PBXs. The battle for the total communication market is quite fierce between the LAN and PBX vendors now. This research thesis looks at the history, evolution, and architecture of voice/data PBXs. It traces development of PBXs through the present fourth generation architectures.

25|$|Early exchanges were {{electromechanical}} systems using motors, shaft drives, rotating {{switches and}} relays. Some types of automatic exchanges were the Strowger <b>switch</b> or <b>step-by-step</b> <b>switch,</b> All Relay, X-Y, panel switch and the crossbar switch.|$|R

It {{was once}} common to reserve entire unused exchange prefixes or N11 numbers (4101 was ringback on many <b>step-by-step</b> <b>switches),</b> but these have largely moved to individual unpublished numbers within the standard 958-xxxx (local) or 959-xxxx (long-distance) plant test exchanges as numbers become scarce.|$|R
40|$|In Saskatchewan {{as well as}} in {{most other}} provinces of Canada there are vast areas with low {{population}} density. The provision of adequate health services for these areas is a difficult problem, largely due to the shortage of medical personnel, mainly with specialist training. Even in personnel were available, it would be impossible and economically unjustifiable to disperse them over the whole area. On the other hand, it is of course desirable to provide these parts of the country with a level of medical care which is comparable to that in urban areas without excessively increasing the cost for these services. Electropysiological signals such as electrocardiographs (ECG's) are becoming increasingly important to the diagnosis and treatment of various ailments. The present procedure used to handle the interpretation of the tracings of these signals is to mail them to well-staffed hospitals for manual interpretation by specially trained physicians. This is not very effective in helping to raise the quality of rural medical care to that obtainable in urban areas. The system described in this thesis shows how it is possible to adapt recent technological advances, specifically in the fields communications and integrated circuit electronics to attain this goal. Description of the design and construction of the receiving terminal used for data collection at a central location is the main content of this thesis. The ECG's are converted to digital form and then stored on a digital cassette tape deck at the remote transmitting terminal which is assumed to be located in a sparsely populated rural area. At some future time, convenient to both the remote and central terminal, the ECG's which have been stored on cassette are transmitted to the data collection terminal where they are converted to analog form for manual diagnosis {{and at the same time}} recorded on a computer compatible tape deck for computer processing. Tests were carried out on the complete system over a local telephone circuit through several levels of <b>step-by-step</b> <b>switching.</b> The results show that the use of these modern techniques to aid in the treatment and diagnosis of ECG's is technically feasible and economically acceptable. It is believed that the system will contribute to the equalization of the quality of medical care between rural and urban communities...|$|E

50|$|Markers were {{sometimes}} referred to as special purpose computers but, lacking stored program control, they were not computers according {{to the understanding of the}} middle 20th Century. After unfruitful German efforts in the 1920s, they were successfully developed at Bell Labs in the 1930s to support the then new generation of crossbar switches which were replacing the <b>Step-by-Step</b> <b>switches</b> and Panel switches of the first generation of automatic switching.|$|R
30|$|The {{different}} bipolar reset {{transitions in}} terms of an Ni/SiN/Si RRAM device were investigated in this study depending on the reset power and the resistance value of the LRS, which is determined by the forming and set processes. The sharp reset switching was observed for the high reset power (> 7  mW) and the low LRS, whereas the <b>step-by-step</b> reset <b>switching</b> was observed for the low reset power (< 7  mW) and the high LRS. Higher nonlinear I-V characteristics and a gradual reset change regarding the <b>step-by-step</b> reset <b>switching</b> would be two of the most virtuous merits of the low-power and high-density crossbar array.|$|R
25|$|The {{design and}} {{maintenance}} procedures of all systems involved methods {{to avoid that}} subscribers experienced undue changes {{in the quality of}} the service or that they noticed failures. A variety of tools referred to as make-busys were plugged into electromechanical switch elements upon failure and during repairs. A make-busy identified the part being worked on as in-use, causing the switching logic to route around it. A similar tool was called a TD tool. Delinquent subscribers had their service temporarily denied (TDed). This was effected by plugging a tool into the subscriber's office equipment on Crossbar systems or line group in <b>step-by-step</b> <b>switches.</b> The subscriber could receive calls but could not dial out.|$|R

3000|$|A {{study on}} the bipolar-resistive {{switching}} of an Ni/SiN/Si-based resistive random-access memory (RRAM) device shows that the influences of the reset power and the resistance value of the low-resistance state (LRS) on the reset-switching transitions are strong. For a low LRS with a large conducting path, the sharp reset switching, which requires a high reset power (> 7  mW), was observed, whereas for a high LRS with small multiple-conducting paths, the <b>step-by-step</b> reset <b>switching</b> with a low reset power (< 7  mW) was observed. The attainment of higher nonlinear current-voltage (I-V) characteristics {{in terms of the}} <b>step-by-step</b> reset <b>switching</b> is due to the steep current-increased region of the trap-controlled space charge-limited current (SCLC) model.

50|$|The Director {{telephone}} system was a {{development of the}} Strowger <b>step-by-step</b> (SXS) <b>switching</b> system used in London and five other large cities in the UK from the 1920s to the 1960s. A large proportion (ca. 70% to 80%) of telephone traffic in large metropolitan areas is outgoing traffic, and it is distributed over many exchanges. A non-Director SXS exchange system is not suitable for these areas.|$|R
25|$|Crossbar offices {{used more}} shared, common control circuits. For example, a digit {{receiver}} (part of an element called an Originating Register) would {{be connected to}} a call {{just long enough to}} collect the subscriber's dialed digits. Crossbar architecture was more flexible than step offices. Later crossbar systems had punch-card-based trouble reporting systems. By the 1970s, automatic number identification had been retrofitted to nearly all <b>step-by-step</b> and crossbar <b>switches</b> in the Bell System.|$|R

The sender first registered and stored the digits that the customer dialed, and then, with the help of other frames, translated the received digits into numbers appropriate for the selectors: District Brush, District Group, Office Brush, Office Group, Incoming Brush, Incoming Group, Final Brush, Final Tens, Final Units.|$|R

50|$|When {{the office}} {{classification}} system for DDD was established, the principal designs in use for Class-5 in the US were Strowger-type <b>step-by-step</b> systems, Panel <b>switches,</b> and crossbar systems. 5XB crossbar switches were installed {{in large numbers}} in the 1950s and 60s, and 1ESS switches and variants starting in the 1960s. Most of these systems were removed in the late 20th century, primarily replaced in North America by DMS-10, DMS-100 and 5ESS switches in the Bell operating territories and the GTD-5 EAX in the GTE operating areas.

40|$|The ant colony {{algorithm}} {{is a new}} technique for combinatorial optimization borrowed from swarm intelligence. This paper outlines an ant colony algorithm to compute the optimal order of restoring sections in a power distribution system. Restoration of distribution feeders after long interruptions creates cold load pickup conditions due to loss of diversity among the loads. The distribution system load {{may have to be}} restored <b>step-by-step</b> using sectionalizing <b>switches</b> under such conditions to prevent overheating of substation transformer. The restoration time is dependent on the order in which sections are restored. Results obtained using this method for two test cases are presented including a comparison with the simulated annealing algorithm...|$|R
50|$|The new {{temple of}} Thespis is {{situated}} {{on the site of}} the famous old California Theatre. It is perfectly fire-proof, and has 19 exits. The main entrance, on Bush street, is formed by a Roman arch of massive proportions and striking design. The vestibule is rectangular in shape, is finished in antique oak panelling, with pilasters and arabesques, and is lighted by thirty-two 16 candle-power lamps and an electrolier of eight 82's. In the beautiful foyer is another large electrolier.In the auditorium, behind the eight proscenium boxes, with dome-shaped canopies supported by columns, rise arches of Indian fretwork carrying pillars surmounted by 88 candle-power lamps enclosed in opalescent globes shaped like pineapples. The ceiling consists of three concave divisions extending from wall to wall parallel with the front of the stage, gradually rising upward, and separated by narrow panels or chords. It is crossed by four bands of dark color, in which, as well as in the chords and fantastic tracery of the decorations, are set numbers of lamps. From the ceiling, over the parquet and near the boxes, depend three rich electroliers similar in design to those throughout the house, formed by a centre fixture of opalescent glass held in cast metal work, with four pendants of the same shape hanging by chains attached to arms radiating from the stem of the fixture. All the electroliers were specially designed by J. M. Wood, of Chicago, the architect.Throughout the house the decorations are so designed that lamps in the midst of bands of flowers, dados and carvings, not only afford light, but add hitherto unknown features to the general ornamentation. At the back of the metal and plastic tracery of the boxes, balcony and gallery, panels of cathedral glass are inserted, which soften the radiance of 16 candle-power lamps set behind, and give to the railings the effect of carvings thrown into relief by mellow light. For producing winter and moonlight effects, and as a substitute for calcium light, six movable bunch lights, with silvered reflectors, are provided.The rheostats, which control all the lamps in the house, are of novel design. They are divided into six parts, which are in connection with six <b>step-by-step</b> <b>switches,</b> capable of being operated rapidly and positively. The handles of the switches can be locked to a shaft which runs through all; by tightening the handles of the switches to the shaft every part of the house can be dimmed at once, and by loosening any number, any portions can be regulated at the will of the switch-man. Being equally divided, one-half the lamps in the auditorium can gradually be turned down while the other half is being lighted, producing a fine blending effect. This is probably the only theatre in the country where the switches are so arranged.|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} {{in the construction of}} atomic-scale circuits and molecular machines is to design molecular rotors and switches by controlling the linear or rotational movement of a molecule while preserving its intrinsic electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate both the continuous rotational switching and the controlled <b>step-by-step</b> single <b>switching</b> of a trinaphthylene molecule adsorbed on a dangling bond dimer created on a hydrogen-passivated Ge(001) :H surface. The molecular switch is on-surface assembled when the covalent bonds between the molecule and the dangling bond dimer are controllably broken, and the molecule is attached to the dimer by long-range van der Waals interactions. In this configuration, the molecule retains its intrinsic electronic properties, as confirmed by combined scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) measurements, density functional theory calculations, and advanced STM image calculations. Continuous switching of the molecule is initiated by vibronic excitations when the electrons are tunneling through the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital state of the molecule. The switching path is a combination of a sliding and rotation motion over the dangling bond dimer pivot. By carefully selecting the STM conditions, control over discrete single switching events is also achieved. Combined with the ability to create dangling bond dimers with atomic precision, the controlled rotational molecular switch {{is expected to be a}} crucial building block for more complex surface atomic-scale devices...|$|R

The area is now served by remote equipment on Summit Road connected to the central office on Los Gatos Boulevard.|$|R
