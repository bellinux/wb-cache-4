5|$|Swimming {{behavior}} in mantas differs across habitats: when travelling over deep water, they swim {{at a constant}} rate in a straight line, while further inshore they usually bask or swim idly around. Mantas may travel alone or in groups of up to 50. They may associate with other fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals. Mantas sometimes breach, leaping partially or entirely out of the water. Individuals in a group may make aerial jumps one after the other. These leaps come in three forms: forward leaps where the fish lands head first, similar jumps with a tail first re-entry or somersaults. The reason for breaching is not known; possible explanations include mating rituals, birthing, communication, or the removal of parasites and commensal remoras (<b>suckerfish).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} Boorong {{people of}} northwestern Victoria {{saw it as}} Won, a boomerang thrown by Totyarguil (Altair). The Aranda people of Central Australia saw Corona Australis as a coolamon carrying a baby, which was accidentally dropped to earth {{by a group of}} sky-women dancing in the Milky Way. The impact of the coolamon created Gosses Bluff crater, 175km west of Alice Springs. The Torres Strait Islanders saw Corona Australis {{as part of a larger}} constellation encompassing part of Sagittarius and the tip of Scorpius's tail; the Pleiades and Orion were also associated. This constellation was Tagai's canoe, crewed by the Pleiades, called the Usiam, and Orion, called the Seg. The myth of Tagai says that he was in charge of this canoe, but his crewmen consumed all of the supplies onboard without asking permission. Enraged, Tagai bound the Usiam with a rope and tied them to the side of the boat, then threw them overboard. Scorpius's tail represents a <b>suckerfish,</b> while Eta Sagittarii and Theta Coronae Australis mark the bottom of the canoe. On the island of Futuna, the figure of Corona Australis was called Tanuma and in the Tuamotus, it was called Na Kaua-ki-Tonga.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{this lack}} of large game, the Taíno people became very skilled fishermen. One {{technique}} was to hook a remora, {{also known as a}} <b>suckerfish,</b> to a line secured to a canoe and wait for the fish to attach itself to a larger fish or even a sea turtle. Once this happened, men would jump into the water and bring in their assisted catch. Another method used by the Taínos was to take shredded stems and roots of poisonous senna shrubs and throw them into nearby streams or rivers. Upon eating the bait, the fish were stunned just long enough to allow the fishermen to gather them in. This poison did not affect the edibility of the fish. Taíno youth, mostly young boys, also collected mussels and oysters in shallow waters and within the mangroves.|$|E

50|$|With the {{smallest}} adhesive disk amongst the remoras, the slender <b>suckerfish</b> is not strongly host-dependent {{and can be}} encountered free-swimming or attached to inanimate objects. The slender <b>suckerfish</b> feeds mostly on scraps of fish and plankton, as opposed to more host-dependent remoras that feed on host parasites. Nothing is known of its reproduction.|$|E

50|$|White <b>suckerfish</b> {{are rarely}} found free-swimming; they are host-specific to manta rays, and enter their host's mouth and gill chamber {{more often than}} any other remora. They are also {{occasionally}} found attached to sharks, and in the Indo-Pacific region to black marlin. Unlike some other remora species, parasitic copepods comprise a negligible part of the diet of the white <b>suckerfish,</b> suggesting {{it may not have}} a mutualistic relationship with its host. The white <b>suckerfish</b> responds to a touch on its belly by forcefully erecting its pelvic fins, possibly an adaptation to avoid crushing by its host. Nothing is known about their reproduction. It is used in Chinese medicine.|$|E

50|$|The white <b>suckerfish</b> or mantasucker, Remora albescens, is {{a species}} of remora in the family Echeneidae, a group of {{elongated}} marine fish with adhesive discs for attaching to larger organisms. The distribution of this species is worldwide in warm open seas: it {{is found in the}} western Indian Ocean including Réunion and Mauritius, in the eastern Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to Chile (but is rare north of Baja California), and in the western and eastern central Atlantic Ocean from Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil and St. Paul's Rocks.|$|E
50|$|While <b>suckerfish</b> {{in general}} {{live in a}} variety of habitats, the {{mountain}} sucker tends to favor clear water streams with a moderate gradient, with widths of 3 - 15 m and depths of less than 2 m, and rocky or gravelly bottoms. Although not exclusive to high elevations, they often live in cool mountain streams (thus the common name), being found as high as 2,800 m, and in waters just above freezing temperatures. Within a stream, they are found in pools or eddies behind or under rocks and logs.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{traditionally}} eaten included moose, caribou, porcupine, rabbits marten, woodchuck, squirrel; Canada geese, snow geese, brants, ducks, teal, loons, spruce grouse, woodcock, snipe, passenger pigeons, ptarmigan; whitefish, lake trout, salmon, Arctic char, seal (naskapi) pike, walleye, <b>suckerfish</b> (Catostomidae), sturgeon, catfish, lamprey, and smelt. Fish were eaten roasted or smoke-dried. Moose {{meat and}} {{several types of}} fish were also smoked. Bannock made from oats, introduced by the French in the 16th century, became a staple. Meat was eaten frozen, raw or roasted, and caribou was sometimes boiled in a stew. Pemmican was made with moose or caribou.|$|E
5000|$|Kw'ikw'iyá:la in the Halkomelem {{language}} of the Stó:lō, is a place name meaning [...] "stingy container" [...] or [...] "stingy place". It refers specifically to a deep pool named Skw'éxweq or Skw'exwáq, {{near the mouth of}} what is now known as the Coquihalla River. The Stó:lō would go to this pool to spear <b>suckerfish,</b> which were plentiful there. According to Stó:lō oral history, the s'ó:lmexw (black-haired, 2-foot tall, dark-skinned underwater people) would grab the spears, preventing fish from being caught. Thus they were stingy with the fish. There were two other pools in the rivers where this was said to happen.|$|E
50|$|The remoras , {{sometimes}} called <b>suckerfish,</b> are a family (Echeneidae) of ray-finned {{fish in the}} order Perciformes. They grow to 7 - 75 cm long. Their distinctive first dorsal fins {{take the form of}} a modified oval, sucker-like organ with slat-like structures that open and close to create suction and take a firm hold against the skin of larger marine animals. The disk is made up of stout, flexible membranes that can be raised and lowered to generate suction. By sliding backward, the remora can increase the suction, or it can release itself by swimming forward. Remoras sometimes attach to small boats. They can also attach to other organisms like sharks and turtles of any sort. They swim well on their own, with a sinuous, or curved, motion.|$|E

50|$|The body of {{the slender}} <b>suckerfish</b> is elongated, with long dorsal and anal fins. The dorsal fin rays number 29-33, the anal fin rays 29-34, and the {{pectoral}} fin rays 18-21. The adhesive disk atop the head is small, length 18-28% of the standard length, with 9-11 lamellae. The caudal fin is paddle-shaped. The head and body are pale, dark brown, or blackish. Larger specimens have a distinctive dark brown stripe running {{along the side of}} the body, bordered by narrower white stripes above and below. The fins are blackish, with the outer portions of the longer dorsal and anal fin rays and the margins of the outer caudal fin rays light. It usually reaches 34 cm in total length (TL), but has been reported up to 76 cm TL. The sucker disk is fully developed in 50-mm individuals.|$|E
50|$|The greenfin darter is a benthic insectivore, feeding {{mainly on}} insect larvae in cold, high-elevation creeks and rivers. A study by Bryant et al. {{revealed}} the diet of the greenfin darter {{may be the}} most diverse in the genus, with some individuals' guts containing up to 15 different species of insects. Its predators are mainly larger freshwater fish, such as smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu) and madtoms (genus Notorus). Darters in general are important food sources for many fish. Freshwater eels commonly consume adult darters, and <b>suckerfish</b> prey on their eggs. The species is relatively abundant, and has been found to hybridize with E. camurum and E. rufilineatum, where ranges overlap. Like many other darter species, the greenfin has adapted morphologically to reduce drag and allow stationary positioning on the substrate {{even in the midst of}} fast-flowing riffles.|$|E

50|$|The white <b>suckerfish</b> {{can reach}} 30 cm in {{standard}} length. The adhesive disk {{is short and}} wide, the length 34-40% and the width 22-26% of the standard length, with 13-14 lamellae. The pelvic fins are placed far forward and narrowly attached to the abdomen; the dorsal, anal, and pectoral fins are short with reduced rays. The dorsal fin rays number 18-23, the anal fin rays 18-24, and the pectoral fin rays 18-21. The dentition is specialized, consisting of many large, stout canine teeth set in large patches in broad jaws. The head, body, and fins are colored light brown, light tan, or light grey to whitish. Three documented specimens from the Gulf of Mexico show considerable variation in color pattern, from uniform grey or pale bluish-white to light grey, darkening on the sides and belly and bearing numerous elongated spots. One living specimen immediately darkened in color when it was removed from sea water and lightened when it was returned.|$|E
