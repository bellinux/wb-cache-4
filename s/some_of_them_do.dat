Nonetheless, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> stab one another during mating, using hardened anatomical structures. For example, in the Cephalaspidean genus Siphopteron, both seaslugs attempt to stab their partner with a two-part, spined penis.|$|E
25|$|Digital PCR (dPCR): used {{to measure}} the {{quantity}} of a target DNA sequence in a DNA sample. The DNA sample is highly diluted so that after running many PCRs in parallel, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not receive a single molecule of the target DNA. The target DNA concentration is calculated using the proportion of negative outcomes. Hence the name 'digital PCR'.|$|E
25|$|As {{it comes}} to word {{formation}} processes such as derivation and compounding, the earliest derivational suffixes {{to show up in}} children's speech are those they hear adults use most frequently. (-er as the *'doer' of the action such as walker.) When {{it comes to}} compounds, children first make up names for agents and instruments that they don't know by a pattern (N-N), though <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not follow the pattern (*cutter grass for grass cutter). Then, they might have the right structure but the words are inappropriate since English already has words with the intended meaning such as car-smoke = exhaust. This process points to a preference for building words from other words, thus place less demand on memory than learning an entirely new word for each concept.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the novels}} {{focus on one}} {{particular}} romance, as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> not begin {{until well into the}} novel (Casino Royale is a good example). However, several exceptions have been made: In Goldfinger, the Masterton sisters are considered Bond girls (although Tilly is supposedly a lesbian), and after their deaths, Pussy Galore (also supposedly a lesbian) becomes the primary Bond girl. In Thunderball, Bond romances first Patricia Fearing, then later Domino Vitali. In On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Bond enters into a relationship and an eventual marriage with Teresa 'Tracy' di Vicenzo, and sleeps with Ruby Windsor, a patient he meets in Blofeld's hideout while posing as a genealogist. In You Only Live Twice, Bond mainly has a relationship with Kissy Suzuki, but also romances Mariko Ichiban, as well as another a girl who is too insignificant for Fleming to give her a name.|$|E

6000|$|François Villons America has a-plenty. An {{astonishing}} {{number of}} Americans with the literary itch do contrive {{to make a}} living out of that affliction. They write motion-picture scenarios and fiction for the magazines that still regard detective stories as the zenith of original art. They gather in woman-scented flats to discuss sex, or in hard-voiced groups to play poker. They seem to find in the creation of literature very little besides a way of evading regular office hours. Below this stratum of people so successful that one sometimes sees their names in print is the yearning band of young men who want to write. Just to write--not to write anything in particular; not to express any definite thought, but to be literary, to be Bohemian, to dance with slim young authoresses of easy morals, and be jolly dogs and free souls. Some of them are dramatists with unacted dramas; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> free verse which is just as free as the productions of regular licensed poets. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do</b> short stories--striking, rather biological, very destructive of conventions. Some of them are ever so handy at all forms; they are perennial candidates for any job as book-reviewer, dramatic critic, or manuscript-reader, since they have the naïve belief that these occupations require neither toil nor training, and enable one to [...] "write on the side." [...] Meanwhile they make their livings as sub-editors on trade journals, as charity-workers, or as assistants to illiterate literary agents.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Doge Pietro II Orseolo {{prepared}} Venetian forces {{to take control}} over Dalmatian cities {{that were part of}} the Byzantine Empire, Croatia, and Narentines.

60|$|Her copies {{were indeed}} marvellous. Accuracy {{was not the}} phrase for them; a Chinese copy is accurate. Hilda's had that {{evanescent}} and ethereal life--that flitting fragrance, as it were, of the originals--which it is as difficult to catch and retain {{as it would be}} for a sculptor to get the very movement and varying color of a living man into his marble bust. Only by watching the efforts of the most skilful copyists--men who spend a lifetime, as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>do,</b> in multiplying copies of a single picture--and observing how invariably they leave out just the indefinable charm that involves the last, inestimable value, can we understand the difficulties of the task which they undertake.|$|E
