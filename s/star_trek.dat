5|$|One {{sign of the}} series' growing {{popularity}} was the first <b>Star</b> <b>Trek</b> convention which occurred on January 21–23, 1972 in New York City.

5000|$|While NBC paid {{lip service}} to {{expanding}} <b>Star</b> <b>Trek's</b> audience, it now slashed our production budget until it was actually ten percent lower {{than it had been}} in our first season ... This is why in the third season you saw fewer outdoor location shots, for example. Top writers, top guest stars, top anything you needed was harder to come by. Thus, <b>Star</b> <b>Trek's</b> demise became a self-fulfilling prophecy. And I can assure you, that is exactly as it was meant to be.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Star</b> <b>Treks</b> first-season ratings {{would in}} earlier years likely have caused NBC {{to cancel the}} show. The network had pioneered {{research}} into viewers' demographic profiles in the early 1960s, however, and, by 1967, it and other networks increasingly considered such data when making decisions; for example, CBS temporarily cancelled Gunsmoke that year because it had too many older and too few younger viewers. Although Roddenberry later claimed that NBC was unaware of <b>Star</b> <b>Treks</b> favorable demographics, awareness of <b>Star</b> <b>Treks</b> [...] "quality" [...] audience is what likely caused the network to retain the show after {{the first and second}} seasons. NBC instead decided to order 10 more new episodes for the first season, and order a second season in March 1967. The network originally announced that the show would air at 7:30-8:30 pm Tuesday, but it was instead given an 8:30-9:30 pm Friday slot when the 1967-68 NBC schedule was released, making watching it difficult for the young viewers that the show most attracted.|$|R
