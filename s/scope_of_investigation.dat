25|$|To reiterate, Creelman and Turner, {{with equal}} vigor and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> depict very {{different}} regimes; respectively, one progressive {{and the other}} oppressive. In spite of their strong commitment to their reporting, both journalists rarely mention the científicos. Regardless, these first-hand accounts reveal two foreigners’ perceptions of how Indian policy {{was carried out in}} the whole of Mexico, even if they were unaware of {{the inner workings of the}} regime. On the one hand, Creelman stresses the necessity of the Porfiriato’s harshness with which Indians continued to be subjugated and socially marginalized, as was suggested by Limantour, Bulnes, and Cosmes. This treatment, to Creelman, was a justified measure so that Mexico could be modernized. Turner, on the other hand, sees no benefit to such dehumanizing treatment when nearly one half of Mexico’s population is not profiting from the economic progress, but rather, they are suffering from it, even more than they had suffered under previous governments. This, for Turner, was the opposite of modernization. Despite their opposing interpretations of Díaz ’s regime, Creelman and Turner ultimately expose any pretense of a fair and just government as perpetrated by the científicos and Díaz through positivist doctrine. It is this last point that serves as the link to Díaz’s own perceptions and actions—or lack thereof—towards Mexico’s Indians.|$|E

50|$|An {{appraisal}} {{can involve}} the assumption or determination {{of a wide}} range of facts or conditions. The determination of the veracity of all of the various facts and conditions on which an appraisal may be predicated is typically beyond the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> conducted by an appraiser and may exceed the appraisers expertise or competence. A distinction is made between extraordinary assumptions and general assumptions which allows an appraiser to make certain assumptions without having to personally investigate and confirm all relevant facts.|$|E
5000|$|In the article, [...] "Edward Said's Shadowy Legacy" [...] (2008), Robert Irwin {{said that}} Said ineffectively {{distinguished}} among writers of different centuries and genres of Orientalist literature. That the disparate examples, {{such as the}} German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832) who never travelled to the Orient; the French novelist Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880) who briefly toured Egypt; the French Orientalist Ernest Renan (1823-1892), whose anti-Semitism voided his work; and the British Arabist Edward William Lane (1801-1876), who compiled the Arabic-English Lexicon (1863-93)—did not constitute a comprehensive <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> or critical comparison. In that vein, in Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism (2007), Ibn Warraq earlier had said that in Orientalism (1978) Said had constructed a binary-opposite representation, a fictional European stereotype that would counter-weigh the Oriental stereotype. Being European is the only common trait among such a temporally and stylistically disparate group of literary Orientalists.|$|E

50|$|The {{determination}} {{of the scope of}} work appropriate to the needs and expectations of the users of the appraisal results and the intended use of the appraisal drive the {{determination of}} the scope of work and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> appropriate to the appraisal problem and frame {{the extent to which the}} appraiser investigates the subject of the appraisal and the market. If in the course of investigation, inspection, or research the appraiser discovers evidence which might call particular assumptions into question, he may still have a further decision to make regarding the scope of work. Depending on the needs or expectations of the client, the appraiser may choose to continue to investigate the condition to determine its veracity or he may choose to continue to assume the veracity of the assumption despite indications to the contrary, in which case the assumption would be an extraordinary assumption and have to be reported as such.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © Thomas Telford 2005 It {{is widely}} {{appreciated}} that, in civil engineering and building projects, the largest element of financial and technical risk usually {{lies in the}} ground. Almost exclusively, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> geotechnical <b>investigations</b> is governed not by {{what is needed to}} characterise the subsurface conditions appropriately but, rather, by how much the client and project manager are willing to spend. There is often little correlation between the variability of the ground and the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>investigation.</b> This paper presents the results of a Monte Carlo simulation incorporating many 3 D single-layer soil profiles with different statistical characteristics. A three-storey building founded on nine pad footings is used to assess the reliability <b>of</b> various site <b>investigation</b> <b>scopes</b> and test methods. The pad footings are designed on the basis of settlement, and are examined using 3 D finite element analysis and Schmertmann’s method. It is observed, as expected, that the likelihood of underdesigning or overdesigning a footing decreases as the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the <b>investigation</b> increases. The relationship between these likelihoods and the variability of the ground is presented. M B Jaksa, J S Goldsworthy, G A Fenton, W S Kaggwa, D V Griffiths, Y L Kuo and H G Poulo...|$|R
40|$|Transformations in CEE {{countries}} traditionally are {{studied in}} the framework of methodological indi-vidualism. As a result, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> economic analysis is reduced {{to the development of the}} private sector. Thereby, part of economic reality, namely the public sector, is excluded from economic reality. The holistic approach allows to overcome this shortcoming. Holistically perceived transforma-tions encompass the whole economy – both the private and the public sectors. Furthermore, it opens the possibility to widen the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigations</b> by introducing the negative side of transforma-tions in economy as a whole. Conceptualization of this side allows formulating the concept of anti-economy. Introduction of this concept and the extension, development of the political economy tradition give the opportunity to speak about a new direction of scientific explorations – politica...|$|R
