25|$|The first Washington-Franklin stamp issued was a two-cent red Washington-head, {{issued on}} November 16, 1908, {{to pay the}} first class postage on a {{standard}} letter. The seven separate and distinct Washington-Franklin series appeared at intervals of {{a year or two}} and included denominations that ranged from 1-cent to 1 or 5 dollars, depending on the series. The different issues can be distinguished from one another by one or more of several factors: perforation gauge, the type of stamp paper—or, in some unusual varieties, by the printing method used. Four or five basic paper-types were employed during the life of the issue. Two of these have different watermarks (consisting of single-line and double line letters: 'USPS'), while another paper-type had no watermarks (watermarks are detected by placing the stamp in a <b>special</b> <b>fluid).</b> In 1909 a much less common type of bluish paper was used, made of 35% rag stock combined with the usual wood pulp and can readily be identified by its faint bluish-gray color. (N. B., Some contend that bluish paper contained only 10% rag stock.) Later in the same year the Post Office is supposed to have experimented with China clay paper, but whether such a paper stock actually existed has become a matter of dispute.|$|E

The injected fluid produces growths throughout the victim's body that allow Gla'aki to manipulate the subject's corpse.|$|E
5000|$|ImaGem’s Clarity {{system was}} built to see the exact {{location}} of inclusions in rough and polished diamonds. In regards to rough stones, inclusions are seen without the need to add windows to evaluate prior to cutting. Stones are immersed, [...] in a <b>special</b> <b>fluid</b> and then imaged to identify inclusions. Some images of rough, polished diamonds and composite ruby illustrate the use of this technology in the gem and jewelry industry. This technology has also been used in the manufacture of other products where it is important to evaluate the product for consistency and absence of foreign matter. In the gem and jewelry industry in particular, this technology is used for Kimberley Certification, valuation of an individual of a parcel of rough, identification and for clarity grading.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we shall use a {{geometrical}} method {{to show that}} the Poiseuille flow of any simple fluid in Noll's meaning is only possible in a pipe of circular cross-section, between two coaxial pipes of circular cross-section or between two parallel planes. A similar result was obtained by Fosdick and Serrin (1) under other assumptions than classical analytical techniques. In each of these three cases this geometrical method makes it possible to solve the Poiseuille problem. Moreover, we shall show that Poiseuille flows exist in tubes of any cross-section for some <b>special</b> simple <b>fluids.</b> To illustrate this result we shall exhibit, for these <b>special</b> <b>fluids,</b> Poiseuille flows for which the curves of constant speed of the flow have constant curvature and which are not radially symmetric; a flow between two eccentric circular cylinders is considered. © 1989 Oxford University Press.

50|$|The Ultradrive was a {{significant}} technological advancement in transmission operation, {{one of the first}} electronically controlled automatics. It pioneered many now-common features such as adaptive shifting, wherein the Electronic control unit optimizes shifting based on the driving style of the operator. It earned a reputation for being unreliable. While the Ultradrive transmission had numerous issues, reportedly due to being rushed into production, a common problem was not necessarily caused by a design flaw, but by poor labelling: both owner's manuals and transmission fluid dipsticks advocated the use of Dexron transmission fluid in the event the required fluid was not available. The transmissions were designed to use a <b>special</b> <b>fluid</b> (Type 7176, also known as ATF+3, now superseded by ATF+4) and many owners reported failures from the use of Dexron, as well as temporary issues which were resolved when the proper fluid was added.|$|E
5000|$|Another solar {{project in}} Adelaide is the Adelaide Solar City Programme, which plans a 50 KW rooftop solar {{photovoltaic}} system. The installation will comprise 288 solar panels.

5000|$|After {{her mother}} was struck with a beam of {{radiation}} containing the DNA of several different types of spiders while she was in-utero, Jessica Drew developed superhuman powers patterned after several different types of spiders when she was born. Jessica is superhumanly strong {{and is able to}} lift around seven tons at her peak. She also possesses superhuman speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes. Jessica's body is more resistant to injury than an ordinary person, allowing her to take far more physical punishment compared to an ordinary human. Jessica also possesses superhuman hearing and smell, the latter of which allowed her to distinguish a life-model decoy from the real Nick Fury. Jessica's palms and soles secrete a <b>special</b> <b>fluid</b> that allows her to cling to solid objects, like a true spider. Jessica's physical makeup also makes her highly resistant to all terrestrial poisons, toxins, and completely immune to radiation. While she is typically rendered dizzy by the initial dose, she is completely immune to it after being exposed again. She also exudes a high concentration of pheromones that elicit pleasure and attraction in men and revulsion in women, although she typically uses a chemical [...] "perfume" [...] that renders these pheromones inert. Jessica's body also produces an inordinate amount of bio-energy, which she can discharge from her hands. She refers to these discharges as [...] "venom blasts" [...] although they actually {{have nothing to do with}} poison and typically cause pain and unconsciousness, and Jessica can kill a man in the same way that a lightning bolt would and can pierce solid metals like steel by using her blasts at their greatest intensity. Jessica was also able to glide through unknown means using the web-like extensions of her costume, but seems to have gained the power to fly after being replaced by the Skrull Queen Veranke. Jessica has lost her powers in numerous ways and on several occasions, but after returning to Earth at the end of the Secret Invasion, Jessica's powers were restored and are greater than ever.|$|E

40|$|Successful {{transplantation}} of donor organs from brain-dead patients requires adequate {{maintenance of}} hemodynamic parameters. Blood flow and tissue perfusion are highly dependent upon hemorrheology. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate hemorrheological parameters in potential organ donors compared to healthy volunteers. Whole blood-, plasma- and corrected blood viscosity, hematocrit, erythrocyte deformability, and erythrocyte aggregation were obtained in ten consecutive brain-dead patients and ten matched volunteers. Compared to controls, hematocrit and whole blood viscosity at high and medium shear rates and erythrocyte deformability were significantly decreased. Plasma viscosity was significantly increased in all patients. In the same group, a highly significant increase was observed at all shear rates when viscosity was corrected for hematocrit. Definite rheological abnormalities were found in the blood of brain-dead patients, something which might lead to impaired organ function after transplantation. Therefore, optimizing such parameters by <b>special</b> <b>fluid</b> management may be of importance in potential organ donor...|$|E

(a) Low-resolution simulation result; (b) High-resolution simulation with pattern regulation; (c) High-resolution simulation with partial pattern regulation on the smoke close to observer; (d) High-resolution simulation without regulation. Fluid animation practitioners face great challenges from the complexity of flow dynamics and {{the high cost of}} numerical simulation. A major hindrance is the uncertainty of fluid behavior after simulation resolution increases and extra turbulent effects are added. In this paper, we propose to regulate fluid animations with predesigned flow patterns. Animators can design their desired fluid behavior with fast, low-cost simulations. Flow patterns are then extracted from the results by the Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS) that represents major flow skeleton. Therefore, the final high-quality animation is confined towards the designed behavior by applying the patterns to drive high-resolution and turbulent simulations. The pattern regulation is easily computed and achieves controllable variance in the output. The method makes it easy to design <b>special</b> <b>fluid</b> effects, which increases the usability and scalability of various advanced fluid modeling technologies...|$|E
