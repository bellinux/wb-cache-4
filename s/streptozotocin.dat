5000|$|<b>Streptozotocin</b> was {{originally}} {{identified in the}} late 1950s as an antibiotic. [...] The drug was discovered in a strain of the soil microbe Streptomyces achromogenes by scientists at the drug company Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The soil sample in which the microbe turned up {{had been taken from}} Blue Rapids, Kansas, which can therefore be considered the birthplace of <b>streptozotocin.</b> Upjohn filed for patent protection for the drug in August 1958 and [...] was granted in March 1962.|$|E

50|$|<b>Streptozotocin</b> is {{approved}} by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating metastatic cancer of the pancreatic islet cells. Since it carries a substantial risk of toxicity and rarely cures the cancer, its use is generally limited to patients whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery. In these patients, <b>streptozotocin</b> can reduce the tumor size and reduce symptoms (especially hypoglycemia due to excessive insulin secretion by insulinomas). A typical dose is 500 mg/m2/day by intravenous injection, for 5 days, repeated every 4-6 weeks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Streptozotocin</b> is a glucosamine-{{nitrosourea}} compound. As {{with other}} alkylating {{agents in the}} nitrosourea class, it is toxic to cells by causing damage to the DNA, though other mechanisms may also contribute. DNA damage induces activation of poly ADP-ribosylation, which is likely more important for diabetes induction than DNA damage itself. [...] <b>Streptozotocin</b> is similar enough to glucose to be transported into the cell by the glucose transport protein GLUT2, but is not recognized by the other glucose transporters. This explains its relative toxicity to beta cells, since these cells have relatively high levels of GLUT2.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} <b>streptozotocin</b> {{was found to}} be {{selectively}} toxic to the beta cells of the pancreatic islets, the cells that normally regulate blood glucose levels by producing the hormone insulin. This suggested the drug's use as an animal model of diabetes, and as a medical treatment for cancers of the beta cells. [...] In the 1960s and 1970s the National Cancer Institute investigated streptozotocin's use in cancer chemotherapy. Upjohn filed for FDA approval of <b>streptozotocin</b> as a treatment for pancreatic islet cell cancer in November 1976, and approval was granted in July 1982.

50|$|The {{cause of}} Diabetes {{mellitus}} type 2 (T2D) in humans {{are far more}} complicated than the sole consumption of High Fat Diet (HFD). The mental, emotional and cultural factors along with insulin resistance and hyperphagia are known to increase the occurrence of T2D in humans. However, T2D in model organisms are introduced via surgery of partial/ whole pancreas, or using chemicals such as <b>Streptozotocin.</b> <b>Streptozotocin</b> inhibits the ability of pancreatic β cells to produce insulin, and depending on the dosage used, {{the result can be}} partial or absolute inhibition. It can also interfere with other cell signallingpathways as well as affects the content of certain isozymes in organs like liver, brain and kidneys. The lack of proper representation of the undertaking of the experiment can introduce T2D, but fails to reflect the mechanism through which these disease takes place in humans.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{research}} to date use common rodent models {{to investigate the}} role of nutrition on phenotype. Popular areas to investigate include IUGR studies, whereby rodents, and sometimes sheep, are subjected {{to a variety of}} nutritional conditions. A model for studying IUGR in rodent was developed by Simmons et al. (2010) and is used to investigate type II diabetes. [...] The maternal rats have their uterine arteries ligated, causing altered use of glucose and insulin in the fetus and can therefore {{serve as a model for}} diabetes. These growth-retarded rats were found to be highly similar to human fetuses, as they both display symptoms such as lowered glucose and insulin levels. Gestational diabetes may also be studied through chemical induction using <b>streptozotocin</b> treatment of the pregnant rats. <b>Streptozotocin</b> can cause destruction of the beta cells within the pancreas depending on the concentration given.|$|E
50|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is {{studied in}} various ways using Syrian hamsters. Hamsters which are feed fructose for 7 days get hyperinsulinemia and hyperlipidemia.

50|$|Parthanatos, as a {{cell death}} pathway, is being {{increasingly}} linked to several syndromes connected with specific tissue damage {{outside of the}} nervous system. This is highlighted in the mechanism of <b>streptozotocin</b> (STZ) induced diabetes. STZ is a chemical that is naturally produced by the human body. However, in high doses, STZ {{has been shown to}} produce diabetic symptoms by damaging pancreatic β cells, which are insulin-producing. The degradation of β cells by STZ was linked to PARP in 1980 when studies showed that a PAR synthesis inhibitor reduced STZ’s effects on insulin synthesis. Inhibition of PARP causes pancreatic tissue to sustain insulin synthesis levels, and reduce β cell degradation even with elevated STZ toxin levels.|$|E
5000|$|Insulitis is an {{inflammation}} of the islets of Langerhans, a collection of endocrine tissue located in the pancreas. [...] The islets containing the pancreatic β-cells, and in some cases, the exocrine tissues, become infiltrated by T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. This innate immune cell and lymphocyte infiltration can result in destruction of the insulin producing beta cells of the islets, and clinical diabetes. Insulitis is often studied in the multiple low dose <b>streptozotocin</b> (MLDS) mouse model or the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of type 1 diabetes. The chemokine family of proteins may {{play a key role}} in promoting leukocytic infiltration into the pancreas prior to pancreatic beta-cell destruction.|$|E
50|$|Some {{chemicals}} and drugs selectively destroy pancreatic cells.Pyrinuron (Vacor), a rodenticide {{introduced in the}} United States in 1976, selectively destroys pancreatic beta cells, resulting in type 1 diabetes after accidental poisoning. Pyrinuron was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1979 {{and it is not}} approved by the Environmental Protection Agency for use in the U.S. <b>Streptozotocin</b> (Zanosar), an antineoplastic agent, is selectively toxic to the beta cells of the pancreatic islets. It is used in research for inducing type 1 diabetes on rodents and for treating metastatic cancer of the pancreatic islet cells in patients whose cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Other pancreatic problems, including trauma, pancreatitis, or tumors (either malignant or benign) can also lead to loss of insulin production.|$|E
50|$|Epigenetics {{may play}} a role in a wide array of {{vascular}} complications and in diabetes. The epigenetic variations involved with diabetes can change chromatin structure as well as gene expression. Regardless of whether glycemic control has been achieved through treatment these epigenetic mechanisms are lasting and do not change with the alteration of diet. The most common vascular complication in patients with Type 2 Diabetes is retinopathy which causes many patients to go blind. Studies showed that retinal damage persisted even after the reversal of hyperglycemia in dogs. Studies with <b>streptozotocin</b> injected Type 1 diabetes rats showed that the re-institution of glycemic control after a short period of hyperglycemia had protective effects in the eyes, including reduction in parameters of oxidant stress and inflammation. However, specimens with prolonged diabetes failed to show similar protection. It was then seen with endothelial cells (which line blood vessels) cultured in high glucose that there was a sustained increase in the expression of key extracellular and pro-fibrotic genes and persistently increased oxidant stress, after subsequent glucose normalization. These studies show that the deleterious effects of prior hyperglycemic exposure have long-lasting effects on target organs even after subsequent glycaemic control underscoring the beneficial effects of intensive glycemic control in diabetes. The persistence of these symptoms points to epigenesis as an underlying cause.|$|E
40|$|Non-obese {{diabetic}} (NOD) mice develop autoimmunity that destroys {{their native}} beta cells causing diabetes. Their autoimmunity will also destroy syngeneic transplanted islets and transfer both autoimmunity and diabetes via spleen cells to non-diabetic mice. In this report, we studied {{the effects of}} <b>streptozotocin</b> (STZ) on the autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. We transplanted NOD. SCID islets into three groups of NOD mice: (1) spontaneously diabetic NOD mice (NOD-sp.); (2) prediabetic NOD mice made diabetic by <b>streptozotocin</b> (NOD-stz); and (3) diabetic NOD mice also treated with <b>streptozotocin</b> (NOD-sp. /stz).
