40|$|Commonwealth Edison has {{submitted}} {{a request to}} NRC to replace the snubbers in the Reactor Coolant Bypass Line of Byron <b>Station</b> <b>-Unit</b> 2 with gapped pipe supports. The specific supports intended for use are commercial units designated ''Seismic Stops'' manufactured by Robert L. Cloud Associates, Inc. (RLCA). These devices have the physical appearance of snubbers and are essentially spring supports incorporating clearance gaps sized for the Byron Station application. Although the devices have a nonlinear stiffness characteristic, their design adequacy is demonstrated {{through the use of}} a proprietary linear elastic piping analysis code ''GAPPIPE'' developed by RLCA. The code essentially has all the capabilities of a conventional piping analysis code while including an equivalent linearization technique to process the nonlinear spring elements. Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) has assisted the NRC staff in its evaluation of the RLCA implementation of the equivalent linearization technique and the GAPPIPE code. Towards this end, BNL performed a detailed review of the theoretical basis for the method, an independent evaluation of the Byron piping using the nonlinear time history capability of the ANSYS computer code and by result comparisons to the RLCA developed results, an assessment of the adequacy of the response estimates developed with GAPPIPE. Associated studies included efforts to verify the ANSYS analysis results and the development of bounding calculations for the Byron Piping using linear response spectrum methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{availability}} of bare heavy ions at much lower energy than {{required to produce}} the high charge state by stripping of a high energy beam is presently the most interesting feature of the ESR for physics experiments. The low energy is achieved by deceleration of the highly charged ions which have been accelerated in the synchrotron SIS and stripped to high charge state in a <b>stripping</b> <b>station</b> between SIS and ESR. As the tuning of the ESR for this deceleration mode is time consuming, particularly if the decelerated beam is extracted and transferred to the fixed target area, the decelerated beams were tuned and supplied to the experiments in beamtime blocks of one week or longer.

50|$|The Franklin Line, {{which was}} {{estimated}} to cost $496 million in 1977, was to extend nearly five miles from approximately Willow Street on the north (Evanston-Ravenswood Lines) to Cermak Road on the south (Englewood-Jackson Park). From north to south, the Line was to follow Clybourn Avenue (parallel to the Red Line subway) to Larrabee Street then follow Larrabee and Kingsbury Streets through a station between the Merchandise Mart and the Apparel Center under Orleans Street. It would cross the Chicago River diagonally then curve under Franklin Street in the Central Business District in a stacked arrangement with stations and two continuous platforms (similar to the Red and Blue Line subways). South of the Loop, the line was to follow an alignment along the proposed Franklin Street Connector through a median <b>strip</b> <b>station</b> at Roosevelt Road and then continue south in subway running diagonally to the South Side 'L' at 18th and State Streets and its connection near Cermak Road. There was also to be {{a connection between the}} Dan Ryan line and the portion of the Franklin Line in the median of the Franklin Street Connector between 15th Street and Cermak-Chinatown station. Five stations were proposed along the 4.65 mile subway route: at North/Clybourn, Chicago/Larrabee, Merchandise Mart, Washington/Franklin, Monroe/Franklin, Jackson/Franklin, and Roosevelt/Franklin Extension. A sixth station was planned at Division/Larrabee to provide transit access to Goose Island and the former Cabrini Green Housing project as well as other developments planned in the vicinity.|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} of hyperons {{will enable the}} CBM experiment to characterise the strangeness content of the fireball created in high-energy nucleus-nucleus reactions, {{one of the key}} observables to access the collision dynamics. CBM aims at multi-differential measurements (spectra, flow) as function of collision energy and system size, which is a challenging task in particular for the rare Ω close to its elementary production threshold. Hyperon detection is performed in the tracking system of CBM (STS, see J. Heuser et al., this report) exploiting the topology of weak decays into charged hadrons. The feasibility studies are based on transport through the field and detector geometry, simulation of the anticipated detector response and reconstruction of tracks and secondary vertices in the STS (see I. Kisel et al., this report), all inside the software framework CBMROOT (see M. Al-Turany et al., this report). Details about simulation and analysis can be found in [1]. The hyperon detection feasibility was studied for central Au+Au collisions at 25 AGeV using an improved STS layout and digitisation scheme (2 hybrid pixel stations and 6 double-sided <b>strip</b> <b>stations</b> with 50 μ m strip pitch and 5 ◦ stereo angle) and an advanced secondary track finding algorithm. In addition, the topological analysis was refined with respect to that presented in [1]. The main cut parameters to suppress the combinatorial background of uncorrelated pions and kaons are the track impact parameter in the target plane, the distance of closest approach of the track pair, the impact parameter of the reconstructed mother track, and the position of the fitted decay vertex along the beam axis. the excellent performance of the tracking system.

KXLY then picked up KREM's old ABC affiliation, although it began the transition in February 1976 when it started airing Good Morning America while airing CBS shows throughout the day. Ironically at this time, ABC jumped to number one in the ratings for the next several years. This meant KXLY ended up broadcasting the highest-rated networks (first CBS, then ABC) throughout the 1970s.

Connectivity within the business centre of Parow is enhanced by the railway lines that run parallel to Voortrekker Road {{to the north and}} south - providing multiple access to public transport. The station enables a pedestrian network that extends far beyond its reach. This network is currently a very popular informal trading area. Trade is focused within a narrow <b>strip,</b> called <b>Station</b> Arcade, a pedestrian link from Voortrekker Road to the station. The area to the north of Voortrekker Road lacks the vibrant activity, generated within the commercial zone to the south. A reason for this is the strip of parking lots behind Voortrekker Road that create a buffer zone between the commercial strip and the residential area to the north. At the moment this transitional space adjacent to Voortrekker Road is ill defined and lacks activity. At night, these spaces become vulnerable areas and unsafe zones due to the gang activity and crime within the area. Due to the many tertiary institutions within {{the central part of the}} Voortrekker Road Corridor and a lack of student residences, a campus framework was introduced which proposes the development of student residences along a recreational spine. This framework was focused around key strategies to satisfy students’ accommodation needs. The junction between Voortrekker Road and Station Arcade serves as a significant point of crossing within the campus precinct and the location of my site. By locating a central function at this point within the campus, the existing link to the station is reinforced and a gateway to the new recreational spine behind Voortrekker Road is introduced.
