2500|$|The [...] "unique" [...] {{care for}} {{precision}} and symmetry expresses French classicism and is, according to Marie-Claude Siccard, a {{paradigm of the}} care for quality in luxury products. In particular, {{a lot of attention}} is given to the regularity of stitches and the matching of patterns. On a typical striped ready-to-wear shirt and unlike most other makes, the placket is matched with the front, the face of the collar with the bottom, the collar stripes line up with the yoke stripes, the yoke stripes with the sleeve stripes, the sleeve stripes with the sleeve placket stripes, and finally the shade of yarn used for the buttonholes is matched to the stripe, the whole process creating the feeling the shirt is all one piece. [...] The yoke is one-piece and curved to follow the back. The left cuff is made one-quarter inch longer than the right to allow for the watch. The allowance is lower for made-to-order shirts. The cuff is made more or less wide, depending if the customer wants his watch to remain hidden under the cuff or to show. According to a Charvet representative, many customers have two different types of shirts: those for evening wear, intended to be worn with a flat watch, and the others for day wear, with a thicker watch. For men, shirt tails are square and vented for a clean look. For women, they are rounded, with a signature side-seam gusset. The collar is very clean-cut, made from six layers of unfused cloth for a dressy, yet not stiff, appearance. [...] Instead, a free floating <b>stiffener</b> aims to provide more comfort and a better shape. The stitching on a standard collar is four millimeters from the edge. The stitching of the top and the edges are precise and well-planned. The shirts are stitched with twin rows of single-needle tailoring, sewn one row at a time for minimum puckering and maximum fit. There are twenty stitches per inch. Buttons are made from Australian mother-of-pearl, cut {{from the surface of the}} oyster shell for added strength and greater color clarity. For formal shirts, bibs are hand pleated. Though its traditional ready-to-wear shirts are trim, the company has also introduced in 2009 a [...] "slim fit" [...] line.|$|E

30|$|From Figs.  4, 5, 6, it {{is clearly}} seen that the values of ϖ of clamped {{stiffened}} plates increase {{with the addition of}} number of <b>stiffeners.</b> This increase is considerable at the early stage with <b>stiffeners</b> of all orientations and types of <b>stiffeners.</b> However, it becomes insignificant gradually after a specific number of <b>stiffeners.</b> It is worthy to mention that further addition of <b>stiffeners</b> may also reduce the fundamental frequency of stiffened plates as observed in Figs.  4, 5, 6 for nine number of <b>stiffeners</b> along x-, y-, and both x- and y-orientations. Both stiffness and mass of the stiffened plates influence the natural frequencies in an interactive manner as expressed in Eq. (6). The addition of <b>stiffeners</b> to the plate increases both mass and stiffness. In some cases, the extra mass due to addition of <b>stiffeners</b> influences more on the natural frequencies than the additional stiffness developed so that the fundamental frequency of the stiffened plates decreases.|$|R

One of its principal members appears to be a little man, with a long and rather inflamed face, and gray hair brushed bolt upright in front; he wears a wisp of black silk round his neck, without any <b>stiffener,</b> as an apology for a neckerchief, and is addressed by his companions by the familiar appellation of ‘Fitz,’ or some such monosyllable. Near him is a stout man in a white neckerchief and buff waistcoat, with shining dark hair, cut very short in front, and a great, round, healthy-looking face, on which he studiously preserves a half sentimental simper. Next him, again, is a large-headed man, with black hair and bushy whiskers; and opposite them are two or three others, one of whom is a little round-faced person, in a dress-stock and blue under-waistcoat. There is something peculiar in their air and manner, though you could hardly describe what it is; you cannot divest yourself of the idea that they have come for some other purpose than mere eating and drinking. You have no time to debate the matter, however, for the waiters (who have been arranged in lines down the room, placing the dishes on table) retire to the lower end; the dark man in the blue coat and bright buttons, who has the direction of the music, looks up to the gallery, and calls out ‘band’ in a very loud voice; out burst the orchestra, up rise the visitors, in march fourteen stewards, each with a long wand in his hand, like the evil genius in a pantomime; then the chairman, then the titled visitors; they all make their way up the room, as fast as they can, bowing, and smiling, and smirking, and looking remarkably amiable. The applause ceases, grace is said, the clatter of plates and dishes begins; and every one appears highly gratified, either with the presence of the distinguished visitors, or the commencement of the anxiously-expected dinner.|$|E
