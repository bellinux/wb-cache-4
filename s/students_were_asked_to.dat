Just before {{the merger of}} the two high schools, high school <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> vote on a new mascot and school colors to replace the old West Snyder HS Mounties (colors: red and white) and Middleburg HS Middies (colors: blue and gold). The sports {{programs}} are through the Pennsylvania Heartland Athletic Conference and the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association. The Pennsylvania Heartland Athletic Conference is a voluntary association of 25 PIAA High Schools within the central Pennsylvania region.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{studies found}} a {{different}} prevalence {{of sexual harassment}} by teachers. For example, {{in a survey of}} 148 high school graduates in North Carolina in 1989 the graduates were given a definition of sexual harassment and asked if they had experienced sexual harassment during their high school years. 43% reported inappropriate comments, looks, or gestures by a teacher, 17.5% reported sexual touching, and 13.5% indicated that they have had sexual intercourse with a teacher. In another study college <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> recall if they or other students had experienced sexual harassment by high school teachers. 6.5% of the respondents reported having personally experienced sexually inappropriate attention from high school teachers. Furthermore, more than 33% said that they knew of a sexual relationship between a high school student and a teacher.|$|E

25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Long claimed support for Cooper, Pruitt et al. {{in the use of}} personas. In a partially controlled study, a group of <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> solve a design brief; two groups used personas while one group did not. The students who used personas were awarded higher course evaluations than the group who did not. Students who used personas were assessed as having produced designs with better usability attributes than students who did not use personas. The study also suggests that using personas may improve communication between design teams and facilitate user-focused design discussion. The study had several limitations: outcomes were assessed by a professor and students who were not blind to the hypothesis, students were assigned to groups in a non-random fashion, the findings were not replicated, and other contributing factors or expectation effects (e.g., the Hawthorne effect or Pygmalion effect) were not controlled for.|$|E
25|$|Spatial ability may be {{responsible}} in part for facilitating gender differences in math aptitude. In 1995, Casey et al. looked at the relationship of mental rotation ability and the SAT-M among four samples. The four samples were: (1) undergraduates at two liberal arts colleges in the Northeast that were tested on their mental rotation ability in groups of 10-20; (2) a group of mathematically talented preteens participating in a summer math and science training in the Midwest, which included seventh to ninth graders who were either recruited from a national talent search program or statewide teacher selection program; (3) a high-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban {{high school in the}} Northeast and elected to take the SAT; and (4) a low-ability group of college-bound students who were enrolled in a middle-income suburban high school in the Northeast and elected to take the SAT. The data used were SAT math and verbal scores and mental rotation scores. Mental rotation was assessed using the Vandenberg Test of Mental Rotation. <b>Students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> match two out of four choices to a standard figure.|$|E
500|$|Muzafer Sherif {{conducted}} an experiment, {{very similar to}} Lorge, in which he investigated how prestige affects the evaluation of literary materials. College <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> rank a set of prose passages according to their literary quality. Each passage also included {{the name of a}} well-known author. However, all of the passages were actually written by the same author. [...] Participants rated the authors earlier in terms of their literary standing. Sherif found that passages that were identified with highly acclaimed authors received higher rankings.|$|E

The website then warned students, [...] "There has been a report of a possible gunman on campus. Get to a safe area and take precautions until given the all clear. Avoid the King Commons and all buildings in that vicinity." [...] By 3:40p.m., all NIU classes were canceled {{for the remainder of the}} day and the campus was closed by NIU officials as part of a new security plan devised after the Virginia Tech shootings 10 months earlier. <b>Students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> contact their parents as soon as possible.|$|E
500|$|A Philippine {{national}} symbol will {{be considered}} official once it is declared through a law or a proclamation. [...] National symbols such as the cariñosa, carabao, bangus (milkfish), and anahaw (footstool palm) that are circulating through various sources have no official status and have not established by law. According to Nestor Castro, a Filipino cultural anthropologist, most of these unofficial symbols were passed on as tradition in schools every start {{of the school year}} when <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> buy posters containing the supposed national symbols. While official national symbols are declared through law, Castro and National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Section Chief Teodoro Atienza considered that the public must be consulted first before declaration of national symbol.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} used by the Farmington Trust (UK) for Christian {{religious}} education, to teach children about skepticism. The episode is used as a tool, to involve the students in a debate about religion and science, as well as to discuss Lisa's own skepticism, and her respect towards others. A group of The Simpsons enthusiasts at Calvin College have also analyzed the religious and philosophical aspects of the episode, including the issue of faith versus science. The episode has been compared with Gabriel García Márquez's short story [...] "A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings" [...] and utilized as a teaching tool in a Saugerties, New York grade school class. In an exam on the subject, <b>students</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> use details from both [...] "A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings" [...] and [...] "Lisa the Skeptic", in order to analyze the quotation [...] "Appearances can be deceiving".|$|E
