From 1 June 2002 to 31 December 2003 113, 000 substitution treatments have been recorded as being started of which around 56, 000 have been recorded as ongoing treatments by 1 December 2003. Scientific background: <b>Substitution</b> <b>treatment</b> (treatment of opioid-dependent persons using substitution substances) is one part of addiction treatment. Its goals are harm reduction and the stabilisation of opioid dependent persons. Integration of opioid-dependent persons in a treatment-setting, reduction of consumption of psychoactive substances, reduction of risk behaviour (primarily related to infectious diseases), decrease of mortality and improvements concerning the social, psychic and physic situation are seen as a success of <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment</b> as maintenance therapy. Research questions: The aim of this HTA report is to investigate which indicators can be used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment.</b> Based on these indicators an evaluation of the medical, social and economical benefit of <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment</b> - also in relation to abstinence oriented treatment - is carried out. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in 31 international databases which yielded 2451 articles with publication date between 1995 and February 2005. Results: After a twofold selection process 32 publications were included for assessment and 276 publications were used as background literature. Despite serious restrictions due to selection bias and dropout in most studies focusing on <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment,</b> reduction of consumption of illegal opioids, reduction of risk behaviour, criminal behaviour, mortality and incidence of HIV can be seen as an empirically proven success of <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment.</b> Concerning the improvement of life and health situation the results of the studies are contradictory. The results show that retention rate of <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment</b> is higher than retention rate of abstinence oriented treatment. Regarding economical aspects <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment</b> is efficient in avoiding secondary illnesses (infections) and decreasing criminality. From the perspective of medical ethics <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment</b> as well as medical prescription of heroin is in principle acceptable. Discussion and conclusions: Based on these results, it can be recommended that <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment</b> in principle should be made available for all opioid dependent persons. The decision whether <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment</b> or another treatment (e. g. abstinence oriented treatment) is more promising has to take into account the individual situation of the client. In addition a combination of <b>substitution</b> <b>treatment</b> and abstinence oriented treatment might be promising although there is a lack of studies about this approach.

40|$|Background: Methadone {{maintenance}} treatments (MMTs) are the commonest <b>substitution</b> <b>treatments</b> {{offered to}} opiate addiction in Switzerland, {{in order to}} reduce criminal behaviour, infectious disease transmission and overdose death. Method: To investigate the relationship between {{the increase in the number}} of methadone maintenance treatments, criminal activity of addicts and overdose‐related deaths, an ecological study was undertaken in the Canton of Geneva, from 1983 to 1999. Results: The regular and extensive increase in the number of MMTs is not significantly associated, during the 1983 - 1999 period, with a fall either in drug addict incarcerations or in overdose‐related deaths. However, a slight decrease is observed in the number of imprisoned opiate addicts since 1994, and a marked decrease is seen in overdose deaths from 1997 on. An important and stable number of these deaths is due to methadone itself. Conclusion: Public health objectives to diminish delinquency and overdose deaths cannot solely be fulfilled by extensive use of MMTs.

This study examines predictors of early drug <b>substitutions</b> and <b>treatment</b> interruptions using a cohort analysis of HIV positive adults switched to second-line ART between January 2004 and September 2013 in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods: The main outcomes were having a drug <b>substitution</b> or <b>treatment</b> interruption in the first 24  months on second-line ART. Kaplan Meiers analyses and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify predictors of drug <b>substitutions</b> and <b>treatment</b> interruptions. Results: Of 3028 patients on second-line ART, 353 (11. 7 %) had a drug substitution (8. 6 per 100 PY, 95 % CI: 7. 8 – 9. 6) and 260 (8. 6 %) had a treatment interruption (6. 3 per 100 PY, 95 % CI: 5. 6 – 7. 1). While treatment interruptions decreased from 32. 5 per 100 PY for the 2004 cohort to 2. 3 per 100 PY for the 2013 cohort, the rates of drug substitutions steadily increased, peaking at an incidence of 26. 7 per 100 PY for the 2009 cohort and then decreased to 4. 2 per 100 PY in the 2011 cohort. Compared to the 2004 to 2008 cohorts, the hazard of early drug substitutions was highest among patients switched to AZT + ddI + LPVr in 2009 to 2010 (aHR 5. 1, 95 % CI: 3. 4 – 7. 1) but remained low over time among patients switched to TDF +  3 TC/FTC + LPVr or AZT/ABC +  3 TC + LPVr. The main common predictor of both treatment interruption and drug substitution was drug toxicity. Conclusions: Our results show a rapid transition between 2004 and 2010 ART guidelines and concurrent improvements in continuity of care among second-line ART patients. Drug toxicity reporting and monitoring systems need improvements to inform timely regimen changes and ensure that patients remain in care. However, reasons for drug substitutions should be closely monitored to ensure that patients do not run out of treatment options in the future...|$|R

40|$|In {{diacetylmorphine}} prescription {{programs for}} heavily dependent addicts, diacetylmorphine is usually administered intravenously, {{but this may}} not be possible due to venosclerosis or when heroin abuse had occurred via non-intravenous routes. Since up to 25 % of patients administer diacetylmorphine orally, we characterised morphine absorption after single oral doses of immediate and extended release diacetylmorphine in 8 opioid addicts. Plasma concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Non-compartmental methods and deconvolution were applied for data analysis. Mean (+/-S. D.) immediate and extended release doses were 719 +/- 297 and 956 +/- 404 mg, with high absolute morphine bioavailabilities of 56 - 61 %, respectively. Immediate release diacetylmorphine caused rapid morphine absorption, peaking at 10 - 15 min. Morphine absorption was considerably slower and more sustained for extended release diacetylmorphine, with only approximately 30 % of maximal immediate release absorption being reached after 10 min and maintained for 3 - 4 h, with no relevant food interaction. The relative extended to immediate release bioavailability was calculated to be 86 % by non-compartmental analysis and 93 % by deconvolution analysis.
