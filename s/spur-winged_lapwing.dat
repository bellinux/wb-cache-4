500|$|Outgrowths of bone {{covered in}} a sheath of horn which are found on some birds. Spurs are most {{commonly}} found on the feet or legs, though some birds possess spurs {{on the leading edge}} of the wings. Spurs on the feet or legs are usually formed from the lower portion of the [...] bone, whereas those on the wings are an extension of the radiale—one of the avian carpal bones. Their function appears to be for fighting and defence, rather than for predation. [...] Most galliformes have hind foot spurs. [...] Birds having carpal spurs include the spur-winged goose, <b>spur-winged</b> <b>lapwing</b> and screamers.|$|E
6000|$|I wish now to {{put this}} question: What {{relation}} {{that we can see}} or imagine to the passion of love and the business of courtship, have these dancing and vocal performances in nine cases out of ten? In such cases, for instance, as that of the scissors-tail tyrant-bird, and its pyrotechnic evening displays, when a number of couples leave their nests containing eggs and young to join in a wild aerial dance: the mad exhibitions of ypecahas and ibises, and the jacanas' beautiful exhibition of grouped wings: the triplet dances of the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>lapwing,</b> to perform which two birds already mated are compelled to call in a third bird to complete the set: the harmonious duets of the oven-birds, and the duets and choruses of nearly all the wood-hewers, and the wing-slapping aerial displays of the whistling widgeons--will it be seriously contended that the female of this species makes choice of the male able to administer the most vigorous and artistic slaps? ...|$|E

50|$|Wildlife are {{classified}} under {{a number of}} schedules; all vertebrate species not included in these lists are protected by default. The schedules are periodically amended; for example the kea was granted full protection in 1984, whereas the <b>spur-winged</b> plover (masked <b>lapwing),</b> an Australian species which naturally established itself in New Zealand in the 1930s, had its protected status removed in 2012.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{large group}} {{including}} many common domestic and introduced species, {{many of which are}} regarded as pests. It includes numerous land mammals and birds, three species of Australian Litoria tree frogs, the Australian rainbow skink (Lampropholis delicata) and the North American red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans). The only species on this list that occur naturally in New Zealand are the southern black-backed gull and the <b>spur-winged</b> plover (masked <b>lapwing),</b> both of which present a significant risk of bird strike.|$|R
6000|$|In the ypecaha and jacana {{displays}} {{both sexes}} take part. A stranger performance {{is that of}} the <b>spur-winged</b> <b>lapwing</b> of the same region--a species resembling the lapwing of Europe, but a third larger, brighter coloured, and armed with spurs. The lapwing display, called by the natives its [...] "dance," [...] or [...] "serious dance"--by which they mean square dance--requires three birds for its performance, and is, so far as I know, unique in this respect. The birds are so fond of it that they indulge in it all the year round, and at frequent intervals during the day, also on moonlight nights. If a person watches any two birds for some time--for they live in pairs--he will see another lapwing, one of a neighbouring couple, rise up and fly to them, leaving his own mate to guard their chosen ground; and instead of resenting this visit as an unwarranted intrusion on their domain, as they would certainly resent the approach of almost any other bird, they welcome it with notes and signs of pleasure. Advancing to the visitor, they place themselves behind it; then all three, keeping step, begin a rapid march, uttering resonant drumming notes in time with their movements; the notes of the pair behind being emitted in a stream, like a drum-roll, while the leader utters loud single notes at regular intervals. The march ceases; the leader elevates his wings and stands erect and motionless, still uttering loud notes; while the other two, with puffed-out plumage and standing exactly abreast stoop forward and downward until the tips of their beaks touch the ground, and, sinking their rhythmical voices to a murmur, remain for some time in this posture. The performance is then over and the visitor goes back to his own ground and mate, to receive a visitor himself later on.|$|E
60|$|There is {{certainly}} a wide difference between so simple an instinctive action as this, which cannot be regarded as intelligent or conscious, and the actions of most birds {{in the presence of}} danger to their eggs or young. In species that breed on the ground in open situations the dangers to which bird and nest are exposed are of different kinds, and, leaving out the case of that anomalous creature, man, we see that as a rule the bird's judgment is not at fault. In one case it is necessary that he should guard himself while trying to save his nest; in another case the danger is to the nest only, and he then shows that he has no fear for himself. The most striking instance I have met with, bearing on this last point, relates to the action of a <b>spur-winged</b> <b>lapwing</b> observed on the Pampas. The bird's loud excited cries attracted my attention; a sheep was lying down with its nose directly over the nest, containing three eggs, and the plover was trying to make it get up and go away. It was a hot day and the sheep refused to stir; possibly the fanning of the bird's wings was grateful to her. After beating the sheep's face for some time it began pecking sharply at the nose; then the sheep raised her head, but soon grew tired of holding it up, and no sooner was it lowered than the blows and peckings began again. Again the head was raised, and lowered again with the same result, and this continued for about twelve or fourteen minutes, until the annoyance became intolerable; then the sheep raised her head and refused to lower it any more, and in that very uncomfortable position, with her nose high in the air, she appeared determined to stay. In vain the lapwing waited, and at last began to make little jumps at the face. The nose was out of reach, but by and by, in one of its jumps, it caught the sheep's ear in its beak and remained hanging with drooping wings and dangling legs. The sheep shook her head several times and at last shook the bird off; but no sooner was it down than it jumped up and caught the ear again; then at last the sheep, fairly beaten, struggled up to her feet, throwing the bird off, and lazily walked away, shaking her head repeatedly.|$|E

5000|$|The river lapwing (Vanellus duvaucelii) is a lapwing species which breeds {{from the}} Indian Subcontinent eastwards to Southeast Asia.

50|$|Elephants and hippos {{might be}} the main {{attraction}} for most visitors, but Liwonde National Park is an important site for birdwatching, with a very different species composition from most of Malawi's avian hotspots. More than 400 species have been recorded. Most notable are the water-associated birds such as the African fish eagle, the pied kingfisher, the saddle-billed stork and goliath heron. This national park {{is one of the}} best places to find a few rarer water-associated birds: among them Pel's fishing owl, red-necked falcon, palm-nut vulture, rufous-bellied heron and white-backed night heron. It is also the only site in Malawi for <b>spur-winged</b> <b>lapwing,</b> a species that had never been recorded in the country until a vagrant pair pitched up in the late 1990s, since when it has established itself along the river in substantial numbers. Away from the water, birds of prey are very well represented. The bateleur, martial eagle and all three snake eagles are quite common and also the southern ground hornbill is present. The park is home to several localised woodland species, such as brown-breasted barbet, Boehm's bee-eater, Lilian's lovebird, Livingstone's flycatcher, collared palm thrush and green twinspot, along with more sparsely distributed mopane specialists such as racket-tailed roller and pale-billed hornbill.|$|E
