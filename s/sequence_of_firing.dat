5000|$|Previously it was {{believed}} that Greek pottery, unlike today's pottery, was only fired once, but that firing had three stages. New studies instead provide material evidence that the pottery was made with two or more separate firings [...] in which the pottery is subjected to multiple firing stages. The most commonly described <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> stages is one in which the pottery is stacked inside the kiln the potter heats the kiln up to around 800 °C with all the vents on the sides open to let air in. This turns the pottery and the paint red all over. Once the kiln reaches 800 °C the vents are closed and the temperature is raised to 950 °C and then allowed to drop back to 900 °C. This turns the pottery and the paint all black. The potter then starts the third and final phase by opening the vents and allowing the kiln to cool all the way down. This last phase leaves the slip black but turns the pottery back to red. This happens because when the clay is given air it turns red, but when the black slip is heated to 950 °C it no longer allows air in. Thus, the slipped area stays black while the bare areas stay red. While the description of a single firing with three stages may seem economical and efficient, it is equally possible that each of these stages was confined to separate firings.|$|E

A key part of calculating the four-digit whole number that represents the fire return interval sequence is a simple step of multiplying each value under INTTYPE by decreasing factors of 10, and adding them together. In this case, the sequence is a four-digit number because we have a maximum <b>of</b> four <b>fire</b> return intervals in our dataset. Adjustments can be made to the calculations to allow for less or more intervals by decreasing or increasing the multiplication factors respectively.|$|R

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Katherine A Roberts, Donald J Johnson, Joseph L PetersonFirearms, Griess Test, Gunshot Residue, Plexiglas, Polycarbonate, Radial FractureThis {{research}} evaluated fracture {{patterns for}} three glass polymer substitutes that differed in mechanical strength and composition.

The results demonstrate that the OPTIX acrylic polymer fractured in accordance with the 4 Rs rule.

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} {{the analysis of}} the conditions allowing time <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> Markov correlated events give rise to a line power spectrum having a relevant physical interest. It is found that by specializing the Markov matrix in order to represent closed loop <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> events with arbitrary distribution, generated in a steady physical condition, a large set of line spectra, covering all possible frequency values, is obtained. The amplitude of the spectral lines is given by a matrix equation based on a generalized Markov matrix involving the Fourier transform of the distribution functions representing the time intervals between successive events <b>of</b> the <b>sequence.</b> The paper is a complement of a previous work where a general expression for the continuous power spectrum was given. In that case the Markov matrix was left in a more general form, thus preventing the possibility of finding line spectra of physical interest. The present extension is also suggested by the interest of explaining the emergence of a broad set of waves found in the electro and magneto-encephalograms, whose frequency ranges from 0. 5 to about 40 Hz, in terms of the effects produced by chains <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> neurons within the complex neural network of the brain.

30|$|Analysis <b>of</b> complex spatio-temporal <b>fire</b> data is an {{important}} tool to assist the management and study <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> regimes. For fire ecologists, a useful visual aid to identify contrasting fire regimes is to map temporal <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> data such as fire return intervals, seasons, and types (planned versus unplanned fire) across the landscape. However, most of the programs that map this information are costly and complex, requiring specialist training. We present a simple yet novel method for creating <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> temporal data for mapping fire regimes using basic geographic information system (GIS) techniques and logical test functions in Microsoft® Excel 2003 (Microsoft, Bellevue, Washington, USA). Using fire history data (1972 to 2005) for southwestern Australia, we assigned integer classifications to fire return intervals (short, moderate, and long) and fire types and seasons (wildfires and prescribed burns in different seasons) and joined the integer classifications {{together to form a}} <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> numbers representing the order <b>of</b> either <b>fire</b> return intervals or fire seasons in reverse time sequence. This sequence can be mapped in a GIS environment so that spatial dimensions formed by overlapping polygons are readily observed, and the temporal <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> data within each polygon can be interpreted across the landscape. We applied the technique to examine experimental design options for investigating the effects <b>of</b> contrasting <b>fire</b> regimes on biota at the landscape scale. This investigation identified several important factors: 1) patterns were evident in fire types and seasons, 2) patterns were evident for fire return interval sequences, and 3) combining fire types and seasons with fire return intervals significantly constrained options for the study design. A visual analysis of this type highlights fire regime patterns in the landscape and permits a feasibility study for the development of study design options and the spatial arrangement of potential study sites.|$|R

Previous studies have deepened {{our understanding of how}} the activity of individual neurons relates to the formation of a decision and its storage for later report. However, little is known about how decision-making and decision maintenance processes evolve in single trials. We addressed this problem by studying the activity of simultaneously recorded neurons from different somatosensory and frontal lobe cortices of monkeys performing a vibrotactile discrimination task. We used the hidden Markov model to describe the spatiotemporal pattern of activity in single trials as a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> rate states. We show that the animal's decision was reliably maintained in frontal lobe activity through a selective state sequence, initiated by an abrupt state transition, during which many neurons changed their activity in a concomitant way, and for which both latency and variability depended on task difficulty. Indeed, transitions were more delayed and more variable for difficult trials compared with easy trials. In contrast, state sequences in somatosensory cortices were weakly decision related, had less variable transitions, and were not affected by the difficulty of the task. In summary, our results suggest that the decision process and its subsequent maintenance are dynamically linked by a cascade of transient events in frontal lobe cortices...|$|E
40|$|Mammalian cold thermoreceptors encode {{steady-state}} temperatures into characteristic temporal {{patterns of}} action potentials. We propose {{a mechanism for}} the encoding process. It is based on Plant’s ionic model of slow wave bursting, to which stochastic forcing is added. The model reproduces firing patterns from cat lingual cold receptors as the param-eters most likely to underlie the thermosensitivity of these receptors varied over a 25 °C range. The <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> patterns goes from regular bursting, to simple periodic, to stochastically phase-locked fir-ing or ”skipping. ” The skipping at higher temperatures is shown to necessitate an interaction between noise and a subthreshold endoge-nous oscillation in the receptor. The basic period of all patterns is robust to noise. Further, noise extends the range of encodable stimuli. An increase in firing irregularity with temperature also results {{from the loss of}} stability accompanying the approach by the slow dynamics of a reverse Hopf bifurcation. The results are not dependent on the precise details of the Plant model, but are generic features of models where an autonomous slow wave arises through a Hopf bifurcation. The model also addresses the variability of the firing patterns across fibers. An alternate model of slow-wave bursting (Chay and Fan 1993) in which skipping can occur without noise is also analyzed here in the context of cold thermoreception. Our &udy quantifies the possible ori-gins and relative contribution of deterministic and stochastic dynamics to the coding scheme. Implications of our findings for sensory coding are discussed. ...|$|E
