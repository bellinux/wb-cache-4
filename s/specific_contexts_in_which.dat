40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{overview}} of the most relevant syntactic functions of infinitives within the sentence in English, based on the British 2006 Corpus (BE 06) designed by Paul Baker and displayed by the server of Andrew Hardie, Corpus Query Processor (CQPweb). The corpus reveals that infinitives are a very frequent non-finite form employed in English. The most relevant syntactic functions that infinitives took in the corpus were as verbal periphrasis, as verb complements, as noun complements, as adjectival complements, as nominal predicates and as verb subjects. In English there are <b>specific</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the infinitive is not preceded by the particle to, such as after an extensive number of auxiliary, perception and permission verbs. Furthermore, there are other <b>specific</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the infinitive is preceded by the particle to, such as after a large number of direct objects in transitive verbs and functioning as a verb subject and as a noun or adjective complement. The major claim of this study is that infinitives in English do not constitute a uniform group; in fact, they display a variety of syntactic functions within the sentence directly reflecting their nominal and verbal properties...|$|E

The current findings therefore prevent the generalisation of findings beyond the <b>specific</b> <b>context</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> this study was conducted. However, the findings do lend credibility to the hypothesised cause-effect relationships and provide researchers with valuable information to drive further theory development and research design in strain-perception-thinking-action coupling during prolonged endurance exercise.|$|R

One comparative advantage of artefactualism over its rivals is its conformity with our pre-theoretic {{views about the}} createdness of these entities. Artefactualism has also its own limitations: there are <b>specific</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it is apparently wrong to think that characters are created abstracta.

Professionals often use it intuitively and in <b>specific</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the meaning of a word containing the meta- prefix is well understood, at least by specialists. For example, all experts in artificial intelligence know what metarules are and where they are useful. However, the meta can imply much more than understanding some concepts in a specific domain. This paper surveys some of the most interesting cases of using the concept of meta in computing in order to help build the big picture...|$|E

This paper represents an attempt for grammar description from the perspective of Japanese pedagogical grammar with using compound functional expressions “Karaniha” and “Ijoha” as examples.

In this paper, we supply a preliminary answer by reviewing prominent accounts of cross-disciplinary integration from two literatures that are rarely brought together: cross-disciplinarity and philosophy of biology. Reflecting on similarities and differences in these accounts, we develop a framework that integrates their insights—integration as a generic combination process the details of which {{are determined by the}} <b>specific</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> particular integrations occur. One such context is cross-disciplinary research, which yields cross-disciplinary integration.

40|$|This thesis uses Relational Dialectics Theory as a {{framework}} {{to gain a better}} understanding of sibling communication after parental death. Qualitative in-depth interviewing with eight adult siblings and auto-ethnography revealed four relational dialectics: openness vs. closedness, autonomy vs. connection, asserting control vs. relinquishing control, and the meta-dialectic continuity vs. change. Siblings reported topical divisions in their communication, physical support and independence from each other, and conflict about logistical issues surrounding parental death. Findings suggest that parental death spurs unique communicative actions between siblings, but longstanding familial and sibling communication characteristics also persist. This research reveals <b>specific</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> dialectical contradictions are created. Future research can use findings from this thesis to expand the parental death literature by further examining how siblings communicatively navigate these contexts...|$|E

Accordingly, the objective is to identify the potential links between some managerial models – and particularly the difference between social enterprises and for-profit organizations - and the <b>specific</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the companies operate.
