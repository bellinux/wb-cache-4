It would not become me to promise what we can do; but [...] this I can tell you, that my friends connected with the various [...] departments most concerned in the public expenditure have, even [...] before the early moment at which I speak, directed their very [...] first attention to this subject, and that I, for one, shall be as [...] deeply disappointed as you can be, if in the estimates which it [...] will be our duty to present in February you do not already [...] perceive some results of their opening labours.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Trevelyan {{agreed to}} join, in the entirely {{defensible}} {{hope that they}} “would knock the measure about in the cabinet, as cabinets do,” and mould it into accord with what had until now been the opinion of most of its members.(183) Mr. Chamberlain, who was destined to play so singular and versatile {{a part in the}} eventful years to come, entered the cabinet with reluctance and misgiving. The Admiralty was first proposed to him and was declined, partly on the ground that the chief of the fighting and <b>spending</b> <b>departments</b> was not the post for one who had just given to domestic reforms the paramount place in his stirring addresses to (M107) the country. Mr. Chamberlain, we may be sure, was not much concerned about the particular office. Whatever its place in the hierarchy, he knew that he could trust himself to make it as important as he pleased, and that his weight in the cabinet and the House would not depend upon the accident of a department. Nobody’s position was so difficult. He was well aware how serious a thing it would be for his prospects, if he were to join a confederacy of his arch enemies, the whigs, against Mr. Gladstone, the commanding idol of his friends, the radicals. If, on the other hand, by refusing to enter the government he should either prevent its formation or should cause its speedy overthrow, he would be left planted with a comparatively ineffective group of his own, and he would incur the deep resentment of the bulk of those with whom he had hitherto been accustomed to act.|$|E

40|$|The 1964 — 70 Labour Governments were {{formally}} {{committed to}} a major expansion and reorganization of education in Britain, at both secondary and higher levels. Alongside the commitment to `comprehensivisation' of secondary schools {{and the expansion of}} universities, Labour was also committed to raising the school leaving age from 15 to 16. However, the increasingly severe economic problems that affected Britain from 1966 onwards, culminating in devaluation in November 1967, prompted an urgent search for significant cutbacks in public expenditure, with one of the casualties being the raising of the school leaving age. A case study of this decision reveals several aspects of interest to students of public policy and administration, including the extent to which short-term economic exigencies were privileged over long-term social objectives. This enabled the Treasury to exercise dominance over <b>spending</b> <b>Departments,</b> with its senior officials presenting the options for financial savings in a manner that led almost ineluctably to the raising of the school leaving age being sacrificed. The decision also revealed the existence of tensions within the Cabinet, not merely on traditional ideological and inter-Departmental grounds, important though these were, but also, to some extent, in terms of the socio-educational backgrounds of Ministers. Consequently, the Treasury and its officials were able to pursue a subtle process of `divide and rule' among Ministers and their Departments...|$|E
3000|$|First, {{we control}} for the GDP growth rate: because of {{automatic}} stabilisers, {{it is expected to}} positively influence the revenues and negatively influence the expenses. Furthermore, we can reasonably expect that the unemployment rate (as a percentage of active population) deteriorates the governments’ financial performance by simultaneously increasing operating expenses and decreasing operating revenues. The composition of the population may also influence the governments’ financial performance. Notably, it is sometimes assumed (Feld and Matsusaka 2003) that a larger share of elderly in a canton’s population (older than 65  years) should generate higher healthcare and social expenses (elderly). But, on the other hand, this category of citizens may express a more conservative view on public finance. The governments’ political leaning also deserves a particular attention (leaning). Notably, right-wing governments have been shown to spend less than those that lean to the left (Tellier 2006). This variable reflects the average political leanings of cantonal governments. 15 According to Roubini and Sachs (1989), fragmented governments are associated with higher public deficits. For that reason, the variable fragmentation captures the number of political parties represented in a government. The alignment between the executive and the legislative powers is also taken into account through the variable concordance, which is the share of seats in the parliament held by the parties represented in the government. According to Roubini and Sachs (1989), a misalignment between both powers should reduce the likelihood they reach agreements, which in turn is expected to result in excessive operating expenses. Furthermore, Valesco (2000) considers a government’s budget as a common good pulled by various interest groups. Thus, a large amount of <b>spending</b> <b>departments</b> (i.e. spending ministries, by contrast with the finance ministry) within a cantonal administration should lead to higher operating expenses. Departments should therefore be negatively associated with the level of public balances. Then, according to several authors among which Shi and Svensson (2006), the electoral cycle prompts an increase in government expenses and a reduction of revenues during election years in an attempt by incumbent politicians to raise their chances of being re-elected. Election is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 during election years and 0 otherwise. Governments also have to cope with institutional constraints. Among these constraints, popular initiatives and referendums, including a financial referendum, are typical institutions of Switzerland’s direct democratic system at the cantonal level. According to Feld and Kirchgässner 2000, financial referendums increase citizen scrutiny and prompt governments to keep expenses under the limit above which a project is sent to ballot box. The limit being more or less restrictive depending on the canton, the dampening effect varies. As for popular initiatives, they allow citizens to suggest changes in legislation. Suggestions may lead either to an increase or to a decrease of government expenses. The ease with which both tools can be used is measured with the index put forward by Stutzer and Frey (2000). Finally, previous works (Feld and Kirchgässner 2008; Luechinger and Schaltegger 2013) indicate that fiscal rules force governments to lower deficits and to show a positive structural balance over time. The variable reflecting the stringency of fiscal rules is the one proposed by Luechinger and Schaltegger (2013), where the value is 3 in case the rule of the canton is among the most stringent, 2 where the rule is fairly stringent, 1 for the least stringent, and 0 otherwise (no rule). We also {{control for the}} misestimation of tax revenue, which refers to the difference between the forecasted amount of tax revenue and the reported tax revenue. As shown by Chatagny and Soguel (2012), finance ministers in the Swiss cantons generally strategically underestimate tax revenue during the budgeting process, possibly to put public expenses under pressure. Underestimating tax revenue (misestimation <[*] 0) should therefore decrease deficits (therefore β[*]<[*] 0). With balance (− 1), we eventually control for the fact that B is not independent from its previous level. It may suffer from temporal inertia in particular because governments frequently resort to incremental budgeting. 16 [...]...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates {{programmes}} review, {{the process}} whereby government expenditure programmes are examined from a results perspective. Drawing from international experience, the paper explores {{some of the}} main issues involved in developing a system of programme review. The aim is to promote discussion on the most appropriate ways of implementing programme review in government departments, given the government decision of 25 March 1997 to introduce a programme of comprehensive expenditure reviews. This decision enacts the commitment in Delivering Better Government (1996) to introduce regular, periodic reviews of programmes. These reviews will take place {{within the context of the}} move to multi-annual budgeting, with a three-year cycle of expenditure planning and review. A number of points are highlighted in the paper: · Programme review is not new. It is currently undertaken in the civil service, but on an ad-hoc and limited basis (section 2). · Arrangements for programme review are likely to vary from department to department, depending on the size and range of programmes they have responsibility for and the size of the department. The most common options are to locate the programme review function with line managers or with a departmental corporate staff group. Programmes may also be reviewed by independent units and by sources external to the department (section 3). · The evaluation units set up to monitor and review EU structural funds are an innovative example of programme review in one specific area of activity. The wider applicability of this model is worth further study (section 3. 3). · The location of the programme review function determines the type of issues which will be addressed. The closer the review function is to the programme Committee for Public Management Research 4 under scrutiny, the less likely it is to be able to deal with issues of impact and continuing relevance of the programme (section 3. 5). · Programme review needs to focus on a number of key attributes of the programme under scrutiny. Significant attributes include: efficiency, effectiveness, equity, cost, intrusiveness and accountability (section 4. 1). · Reviewing each programme comprehensively once every three years is a challenging task. International experience indicates that in practice, priorities will have to be set (section 4. 2). · Training and development supports will be needed; both for those conducting programme review, to develop evaluation skills; and for those commissioning and using review studies, to get the most out of them (section 5). · Encouraging effective demand to ensure that programme review findings are actively used in public expenditure decisions is a central challenge. Questions addressed in programme review should lead to improvements or to the modification or termination of unsuccessful programmes. Demand can be encouraged by effective use of the three main policy instruments: ‘sticks’, ‘carrots’ and ‘sermons’ (section 6). · Resourcing the review process and the right to ask and address the key questions are particularly important if the demand for review is to be encouraged. Specific ‘ear-marking’ of funds for review is one means of enabling review to compete with other activities for resources. Questions must include a focus on the outcomes and results of programmes if reviews are to address more than relatively minor issues (section 6). · Programme review findings do not automatically feed into budgetary and planning decisions. These links need to be developed. Formal mechanisms and processes are needed to ensure that review findings are influential (section 7). Committee for Public Management Research 1. Background Programme review refers to the process whereby government programme expenditure is examined from a results perspective. The aim is to determine whether there is a public need for the programme, and if so, can it be improved. Questions generally focus on the efficiency and effectiveness of programme expenditure, and determining whether spending is focused on the highest priorities. There are various means of reviewing programmes, of which the most common are usually manager-led reviews, audit, and evaluation (Annual Report to Parliament by the President of the Treasury Board, 1995 : 10 - 11). Programme review is specifically referred to in Delivering Better Government (1996 : 59 - 60) : The group recognise that there is a need for a systematic analysis of what is actually being achieved by the £ 12 billion in government resources spent annually. To this end, the group recommend [...] . agreements between the Department of Finance and individual departments on delegated authority for programme expenditures to provide for a schedule of reviews of expenditure to be carried out during the currency of the agreement, with the aim of ensuring that each programme of expenditure is subject to a thorough review at least once every three years. A government decision of 25 March 1997 enacted this recommendation, by specifying arrangements for carrying out comprehensive programme expenditure reviews. A steering committee for programme evaluation is to oversee the process. This committee will be chaired by the Secretary General, Department of Finance, and include two secretaries general of <b>spending</b> <b>departments</b> and an independent consultant. Reviews, which will be specified each year by departments, are to be carried out under joint Finance and spending department steering groups. The review programme will aim to examine all spending programmes over a three year period. Committee for Public Management Research Reports will be submitted to the steering committee, who will then report to the Minister for Finance and the minister responsible for the programme reviewed. The need for such a system of programme review is highlighted by the National Economic and Social Council report Strategy into the 21 st Century, where weaknesses in the current public expenditure control system are identified: ‘Even when new priorities and programmes emerge, expenditure on existing programmes has a strong tendency to grow. This tendency for expenditure to grow undermines the ability of policy to reflect priorities’ (NESC, 1996 : 21). These weaknesses need to be tackled if the council’s recommended approach to fiscal policy is to be pursued(NESC, 1996 : 23) : That approach must recognise that action to deliver greater employment, social inclusion and action to reduce taxation, especially personal taxes, are fundamental priorities. These priorities must be achieved in the first instance, and not as residuals when existing or ‘no policy change’ expenditure bills are met. The council wishes to stress the need to limit the growth in current public expenditure to no more than 2 per cent per annum in real terms. The council appreciates that it will be necessary to make significant savings on existing activities both to observe that limit and to find room for the costs of the council’s social action programme. The council believes that there is scope for greater efficiency and effectiveness in many areas of public expenditure. The council thus identifies as a key requirement for successful public finance management the review and development of the systems of public expenditure management and control, within the context of the council’s strategy and the Strategic Management Initiative (SMI) (NESC, 1996 : 22). This paper aims to explore {{some of the main}} issues involved in developing a system of programme review. A number of key questions arise from plans to develop programme review: how comprehensive can coverage be; what skills and resources Committee for Public Management Research are needed to undertake reviews; how can review be linked to budgetary decisionmaking;what should the respective roles of the Department of Finance and line departments be? These questions are addressed, using lessons learnt from international experience with programme review. In capturing this experience, this paper draws heavily on the emerging findings of a study into evaluation capacity building being undertaken by an International Institute of Administrative Sciences (IIAS) working group on policy and programme evaluation (Boyle and Lemaire (eds), forthcoming). Section 2 of this paper outlines current practice with regard to programme review inthe Irish civil service. In section 3, possible alternative locations for the programme review function are discussed. Section 4 looks at what should be covered by programme review. Section 5 outlines the skills and competencies needed for conducting and using programme review. Section 6 explores the incentives and sanctions available to help institutionalise programme review. Section 7 investigates the linking of programme review and budgeting. Finally in Section 8, some conclusions and issues for consideration are outlined...|$|E
