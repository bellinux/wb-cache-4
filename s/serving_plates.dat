The rim of most pieces is decorated with textured gold. Inside the rim is a band in [...] "Kailua Blue," [...] a bright blue color inspired by the hue of the sea in President Barack Obama's home state of Hawaii. A delicate inner line of gold completes the decoration. Dinner and <b>serving</b> <b>plates</b> are simpler in design. Each dinner plate has a simple, narrow band of gold on the edge and a broad, undecorated bas-relief pinwheels and fronds on the rim. The bas-relief design was taken from an Empire style china service purchased by then-Secretary of State James Madison in 1806. The bas-relief element, Andrew Pickard Morgan of Pickard China says, is unique to White House china. The service plates feature a broad, textured rim of gold, and the presidential coat of arms in gold in the center.|$|E

40|$|The brief was {{to produce}} a range of {{affordable}} and functional products for everyday use. Research undertaken {{in response to the}} brief significantly addressed the needs of the consumer. The range was designed so that it could be manufactured across a number of factories: Greece, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Vietnam and China, thus, allowing the volumes to be achieved without completely overrunning one factory with one range. The designing of each article considered the most effective production method. Also stacking of each product was a necessary part of the design brief, this facilitates ease of storage and transportation. Stacking of objects is particularly challenging but necessary for economic and environmental policies. The range also offers the same design in a number of materials: stoneware, earthenware, and glass and a number of glaze and/or glass colours and patterns. This provides different price points and also a variety of aesthetics and consumer choice. The overall aesthetic is clean-cut, which provides simplicity and easy accessibility for the consumer but also a plain surface for the addition of pattern. A workshop with Kevin Gould, the chef, food critic and food trend analyst, enabled design teams to assess current food trends helpful to designing products appropriate to the food customers are buying. Research showed that although traditional and cultural dishes remained a mainstay in consumers’ eating habits, there was a predominant demand for pasta, pizza, rice and noodle dishes particularly Indian and Thai curry. Consumers were also seeking tableware to reflect the trans-cultural character of these dishes: large 30 cm flat pizza plates, generous pasta bowls, deep bowls for noodles, and square and rectangular dishes to mimic Oriental styles. Further research into market and product availability at major international trade fairs allowed us to assess the gaps in the current market.

50|$|Meanwhile, two Palestinian terrorists of the Islamic Jihad, {{disguised}} as Israeli soldiers and equipped with battle vests, M16 rifles and hand grenades, {{made their way}} to the settlement through the valley located between Othniel and the town of Dahariya, and managed to infiltrate into the settlement. The terrorists cut the rickety fence which was erected around the building of the Yeshiva and afterwards, around 19:45 pm, they snuck into the building through the back door of the kitchen. The students on kitchen duty had just finished preparing the main dishes on <b>serving</b> <b>plates</b> and were about to bring them into the dining room when the terrorists entered the kitchen and opened fire at them. In the last moments of his life, Staff Sergeant Noam Apter, upon immediately realizing what was happening, managed to lock the sliding door separating the kitchen and the dining room, before he was killed by the terrorists. In doing so, Noam prevented the terrorists from entering the dining room and carrying out a far deadlier attack. Nevertheless, after killing the students on kitchen duty, the terrorists smashed the window of the sliding door and began shooting through it into the dining room, wounding four yeshiva students, one of them critically. The majority of the students in the dining room managed to hide underneath the tables while some of them, who were carrying weapons with them, returned fire at the terrorists.|$|E
