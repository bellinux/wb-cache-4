40|$|Allocentric spatial memory, {{the memory}} for {{locations}} coded {{in relation to}} objects comprising our environment, is a fundamental component of episodic memory and {{is dependent on the}} integrity of the hippocampal formation in adulthood. Previous research from different laboratories reported that basic allocentric spatial memory abilities are reliably observed in children after 2 years of age. Based on work performed in monkeys and rats, we had proposed that the functional maturation of direct entorhinal cortex projections to the CA 1 field of the hippocampus might underlie the emergence of basic allocentric spatial memory. We also proposed that the protracted development of the dentate gyrus and its projections to the CA 3 field of the hippocampus might underlie the development of high-resolution allocentric spatial memory capacities, based on the essential contribution of these structures to the process known as pattern separation. Here, we present an experiment designed to assess the development of spatial pattern <b>separation</b> <b>capacities</b> and its impact on allocentric spatial memory performance in children from 18 to 48 months of age. We found that: (1) allocentric spatial memory performance improved with age, (2) as compared to younger children, a greater number of children older than 36 months advanced to the final stage requiring the highest degree of spatial resolution, and (3) children that failed at different stages exhibited difficulties in discriminating locations that required higher spatial resolution abilities.

50|$|A popular form of ITP is {{transient}} ITP (tITP). It alleviates {{the limitation}} of conventional ITP that it has limited <b>separation</b> <b>capacity</b> because of analyte zone overlap. In transient ITP, analytes are first concentrated by ITP, and then can be baseline separated by zone electrophoresis. Transient ITP is usually accomplished by dissolving the sample in the TE and sandwiching the sample/TE plug between LE zones - or vice versa: a sample/LE plug can also be sandwiched between TE zones. In the first case, analytes are focused at the front TE/LE interface. Meanwhile, {{the back of the}} TE plug becomes dissolved in the LE because the faster LE ions overcome the TE ions. When all of the TE ions are dissolved, the focusing process ceases and the analytes are separated according to the principles of zone electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} carbon capture and {{sequestration}} {{has been proposed}} {{as a method of}} mitigating the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. If implemented, the cost of electricity generated by a fossil fuel-burning power plant would rise substantially, owing to the expense of removing CO 2 from the effluent stream. There is therefore an urgent need for more efficient gas separation technologies, such as those potentially offered by advanced solid adsorbents. Here we show that diamine-appended metal-organic frameworks can behave as ‘phase-change’ adsorbents, with unusual step-shaped CO 2 adsorption isotherms that shift markedly with temperature. Results from spectroscopic, diffraction and computational studies show that the origin of the sharp adsorption step is an unprecedented cooperative process in which, above a metal-dependent threshold pressure, CO 2 molecules insert into metal-amine bonds, inducing a reorganization of the amines into well-ordered chains of ammonium carbamate. As a consequence, large CO 2 <b>separation</b> <b>capacities</b> can be achieved with small temperature swings, and regeneration energies appreciably lower than achievable with state-of-the-art aqueous amine solutions become feasible. The results provide a mechanistic framework for designing highly efficient adsorbents for removing CO 2 from various gas mixtures, and yield insights into the conservation of Mg 2 + within the ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase family of enzymes...|$|R

In the first technique we utilize ali-phatic ion pairing agents to improve retention of phos-phopeptides at high pH in the first dimension of a two-dimensional RP-RP.

40|$|Background: Physicochemical {{properties}} are frequently analyzed to characterize protein-sequences of known and unknown function. Especially the hydrophobicity of amino acids {{is often used}} for structural prediction or {{for the detection of}} membrane associated or embedded β-sheets and α-helices. For this purpose many scales classifying amino acids according to their physicochemical properties have been defined over the past decades. In parallel, several hydrophobicity parameters have been defined for calculation of peptide properties. We analyzed the performance of separating sequence pools using 98 hydrophobicity scales and five different hydrophobicity parameters, namely the overall hydrophobicity, the hydrophobic moment for detection of the α-helical and β-sheet membrane segments, the alternating hydrophobicity and the exact ß-strand score. Results: Most of the scales are capable of discriminating between transmembrane α-helices and transmembrane β-sheets, but assignment of peptides to pools of soluble peptides of different secondary structures is not achieved at the same quality. The <b>separation</b> <b>capacity</b> as measure of the discrimination between different structural elements is best by using the five different hydrophobicity parameters, but addition of the alternating hydrophobicity does not provide a large benefit. An in silico evolutionary approach shows that scales have limitation in <b>separation</b> <b>capacity</b> with a maximal threshold of 0. 6 in general. We observed that scales derived from the evolutionary approach performed best in separating the different peptide pools when values for arginine and tyrosine were largely distinct from the value of glutamate. Finally, the separation of secondary structure pools via hydrophobicity can be supported by specific detectable patterns of four amino acids. Conclusion: It could be assumed that the quality of <b>separation</b> <b>capacity</b> of a certain scale depends on the spacing of the hydrophobicity value of certain amino acids. Irrespective of the wealth of hydrophobicity scales a scale separating all different kinds of secondary structures or between soluble and transmembrane peptides does not exist reflecting that properties other than hydrophobicity affect secondary structure formation as well. Nevertheless, application of hydrophobicity scales allows distinguishing between peptides with transmembrane α-helices and β-sheets. Furthermore, the overall <b>separation</b> <b>capacity</b> score of 0. 6 using different hydrophobicity parameters could be assisted by pattern search on the protein sequence level for specific peptides with a length of four amino acids...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{progress}} in the manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals has been made by increasing the overall titers in the USP (upstream processing) titers without raising {{the cost of the}} USP. In addition, the development of platform processes led to a higher process robustness. Despite or even due to those achievements, novel challenges are in sight. The higher upstream titers created more complex impurity profiles, both in mass and composition, demanding higher <b>separation</b> <b>capacities</b> and selectivity in downstream processing (DSP). This creates a major shift of costs from USP to DSP. In order to solve this issue, USP and DSP integration approaches can be developed and used for overall process optimization. This study focuses on the characterization and classification of host cell proteins (HCPs) in each unit operation of the DSP (i. e., aqueous two-phase extraction, integrated countercurrent chromatography). The results create a data-driven feedback to the USP, which will serve for media and process optimizations in order to reduce, or even eliminate nascent critical HCPs. This will improve separation efficiency and may lead to a quantitative process understanding. Different HCP species were classified by stringent criteria with regard to DSP separation parameters into “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” in terms of pI and MW using 2 D-PAGE analysis depending on their positions on the gels. Those spots were identified using LC-MS/MS analysis. HCPs, which are especially difficult to remove and persistent throughout the DSP (i. e., “Bad” or “Ugly”), have to be evaluated by their ability to be separated. In this approach, HCPs, considered “Ugly,” represent proteins with a MW larger than 15 kDa and a pI between 7. 30 and 9. 30. “Bad” HCPs can likewise be classified using MW (> 15 kDa) and pI (4. 75 – 7. 30 and 9. 30 – 10. 00). HCPs with a MW smaller than 15 kDa and a pI lower than 4. 75 and higher than 10. 00 are classified as “Good” since their physicochemical properties differ significantly from the product.
