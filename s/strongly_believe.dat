5|$|The Dalits <b>strongly</b> <b>believe</b> in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root}} cause of all the misery of the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the Dalit {{narrative}} that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'. The sashes round Nataraja's waist are interpreted as the legs of the saint, who merged into the god.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who <b>strongly</b> <b>believe</b> in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

There is a deep sense in both the security officials in Pakistan and China that India {{over the years have}} used such terrorist networks to disrupt Chinese development efforts in the region. Both China and Pakistan believe that India could also use such terrorist networks to sabotage the CPEC project between China and Pakistan. As these militants are labeled as terrorists from the Chinese province of Xinjiang, Pakistan and China <b>strongly</b> <b>believe</b> that India's intelligence services are behind such notorious {{terrorist organization}}s based in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|Stella Browne was {{a leading}} birth control campaigner, who {{increasingly}} began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s. Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced {{by the work of}} Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and other sexologists. She came to <b>strongly</b> <b>believe</b> that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy. In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, O'Neill succeeded Viscount Brookeborough as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. He {{introduced}} {{new policies}} {{that would have}} been unthinkable with Brookeborough as Prime Minister. He aimed to end sectarianism and to bring Catholics and Protestants into working relationships. A visit to a convent proved controversial among many Protestants. He also had aspirations in the industrial sector, seeking improved relations with the trade union movement and attracting new investment from abroad to replace failing industry in Northern Ireland. O'Neill seemed to <b>strongly</b> <b>believe</b> in industrialisation and modernisation. However it is clear that he was in some ways trying to prevent the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) from gaining ground. Northern Ireland was influenced by British politics so the arrival of Harold Wilson in Downing Street meant the NILP had a significant ally there. Wilson was not a committed UUP supporter, so that O'Neill was the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who could not rely on the support of the UK Government.|$|E

500|$|Minton was {{described}} by William Radcliff as a [...] "faithful disciple of judicial restraint," [...] an unexpected development when compared to his overtly partisan political career. Radcliff attributed Minton's conservative position to the distaste he developed for the courts when they overturned legislation passed {{while he was in}} the Senate. The courts actions led him to <b>strongly</b> <b>believe</b> in the limited exercise of judicial power when evaluating the constitutionality of governmental conduct. Much of the recently passed New Deal legislation was being tried in the courts for constitutionality and enforcement, putting Minton in the uncommon position of adjudicating cases depending on legislation he had helped write.|$|E

Affleck engaged in {{a discussion about the}} relationship between liberal principles and Islam during a 2014 appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher.

500|$|... "Talking to the Moon" [...] {{was first}} {{recorded}} by Mars for his debut EP, It's Better If You Don't Understand, which {{was released on}} May 11, 2010 under Elektra Records. When asked about the lyrical content of the record, Mars stated that [...] " [...] just [...] songs that [...] <b>strongly</b> <b>believe</b> in and that are coming from inside. There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And [...] singing the s*** out of them." [...] During an interview, Mars explained that after writing and producing songs for other artists, he thought that he could write a song for himself. He started writing the lyrics of [...] "Talking To The Moon" [...] while playing the piano. The track was included five months later on his debut studio album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, released on October 4, 2010 under the Elektra and Atlantic labels. Mars also recorded an acoustic piano version included on the deluxe edition of the album. Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons stated that [...] "Talking To The Moon" [...] {{was one of his}} favorite songs on the album and described how the song was conceived in an interview for Sound on Sound: ...|$|E
500|$|It's Better If You Don't Understand is {{composed}} of four songs employing pop, pop rock, and hip hop genres. Mars explained that the EP is hard to classify since: [...] "I just write songs that I <b>strongly</b> <b>believe</b> in and that are coming from inside. There's no tricks. It's honesty with big melodies. And I'm singing the s*** out of them". Labeled as a [...] "romantic croon", the opening track, [...] "Somewhere in Brooklyn", was composed by The Smeezingtons. It features [...] "an emo-pop backing" [...] beat, a piano and synthesizers. Lyrically, the tune is about Mars chasing the [...] "perfect woman" [...] who got away, and wishing to find her again. The second release, [...] "The Other Side", features a vocal collaboration with Cee Lo Green and B.o.B., and is considered the best on the EP by some critics. The track {{has been described as}} incorporating 60's and 70's soulful feeling. Its instrumentation uses guitar, organ and a: [...] "drum and bass pace that slowly builds through the verse and into the chorus". It is reminiscent of compositions by Daniel Merriweather and Chris Isaak’s [...] "Wicked Game". [...] "The Other Side" [...] shows Mars' darker side has a [...] "soaring pop" [...] hook.|$|E

500|$|The team {{colors are}} red, black and white, {{and they can}} be seen on both the home and road jerseys. The home jersey, which was the team's road jersey until the NHL swapped home and road colors in 2003, is dominantly red in color. There are three black and white stripes, one across each arm and one across the waist. The road jersey (the team's former home jersey) is white in color with a similar design, except that the three stripes are black and red. The {{shoulders}} are draped with black on both uniforms. Before the 1992–93 season, the uniforms were green and red with slightly different striping, leading some fans to affectionately refer to them as [...] "Christmas colors." [...] The Devils have yet to introduce a third jersey and are one of only two NHL teams (Detroit is the other) never to have worn one. Lamoriello had stated that he did not ever intend to introduce a third jersey for the Devils, saying, [...] "I don't believe in it", Lamoriello said. [...] "I <b>strongly</b> <b>believe</b> {{that you have to have}} one identity as a team. We want to create a feeling that our home and away jerseys are special and that it means something special to wear one."
