40|$|The {{construction}} of a sequence of water reservoirs along the lower São Francisco river basin has caused a severe change in the supply of water and sediments to the coastal zone. We present in this paper a first attempt to use Landsat data to estimate de Suspended Sediment Content (SSC) of the coastal plume. A simple log model proposed by Tassan (1987) was used to convert the reflectance Landsat images (after proper atmospheric correction using the radiative transfer model 6 S) into SSC maps. A comparison of Landsat derived and in situ measured SSC values indicate a good potential of using such methodology to support sediment dynamic studies being carried out by other groups in that region. An analysis of the SSC maps clearly shows that the coastal turbidity plume is being sustained by wind, wave and tidal current induced material resuspension originating from <b>relict</b> <b>sedimentary</b> deposits off the river mouth, rather than from river supply itself.

40|$|The geomorphological {{evolution}} of the marginal areas of the Tibetan Plateau may provide valuable information for reconstructing the tectonic movements of the region. This study reports on a morpho-tectonic analysis of the Huang Shui catchment (tributary of the Yellow River), in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau using a digital elevation model and field observations. One prominent bevelled surface, preliminarily interpreted as a peneplain surface, is recognized at around 2750. m altitude.

40|$|The Balkan-Carpathian {{ophiolite}} (BCO), which outcrops in Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania, is a Late Precambrian (563 Ma) mafic/ultramafic complex {{unique in}} {{that it has not}} been strongly deformed or metamorphosed, as have most other basement sequences in Alpine Europe. Samples collected for study from the Tcherni Vrah and Deli Jovan segments of BCO include cumulate dunites, troctolites, wehrlites and plagioclase wehrlites; olivine and amphibole-bearing gabbros; anorthosites; diabases and microgabbros; and basalts representing massive flows, dikes, and pillow lavas, as well as hyaloclastites and umbers (preserved <b>sedimentary</b> cover). <b>Relict</b> Ol, Cpx and Hbl in cumulate peridotites indicate original orthocumulate textures. Plagioclase in troctolites and anorthosites range from An 60 to An 70. Cumulate gabbro textures range from ophitic to poikilitic, with an inferred crystallization order of Ol-(Plag+Cpx) -Hbl. The extrusive rocks exhibit poikilitic, ophitic and intersertal textures, with Cpx and/or Plag (Oligoclase-Andesine) phenocrysts. The major opaques are Ti-Magnetite and Ilmenite. The metamorphic paragenesis in the mafic samples is Chl-Trem-Ep, whereas the ultramafic rocks show variable degrees of serpentinization, with lizardite and antigorite as dominant phases. Our samples are compositionally and geochemically similar to modern oceanic crust. Major element, trace element and rare earth element (REE) signatures in BCO basalts are comparable to those of MORB. In terms of basalt and dike composition, the BCO is a ‘high-Ti’ or ‘oceanic’ ophiolite, based on the classification scheme of Serri [Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 52 (1981) 203]. Our petrologic and geochemical results, combined with the tectonic position of the BCO massifs (overlain by and in contact with Late Cambrian island arc and back-arc sequences), suggest that the BCO may have formed in a mid-ocean ridge setting. If the BCO records the existence of a Precambrian ocean basin, then there may be a relationship between the BCO and the Pan-African ophiolites from the Arabian–Nubian Shield. We suggest that the BCO is the missing link between the Pan-African and the Avalonian–Cadomian peripheral orogens of Murphy and Nance [Geology 19 (1995) 469]...|$|R

The Vishnu Schist {{consists of}} quartz-mica schist, pelitic schist, and meta-arenites. They exhibit <b>relict</b> <b>sedimentary</b> structures and textures that demonstrate that they are metamorphosed submarine sedimentary rocks. The Brahma Schist consists of amphibolite, hornblende-biotite-plagioclase schist, biotite-plagioclase schist, orthoamphibole-bearing schist and gneiss, and metamorphosed sulfide deposits. As inferred from relict structures and textures, the Brahma Schist is composed of mafic to felsic-composition metavolcanic rocks. The Rama Schist consists of massive, fine-grained quartzofeldspathic schist and gneiss that likely are probable felsic metavolcanic rocks. On {{the basis of the}} presence of relict pillow structures, interlayering of metavolcanic strata, and the large volumes of metavolcanic rocks, the Brahma and Rama schists are interpreted to consist of metamorphosed, volcanic island-arc and associated submarine volcanic rocks. These metavolcanic rocks are locally overlain by the metamorphosed submarine sedimentary rocks of the Vishnu Schist that are interpreted to have accumulated in oceanic trenches. These metasedimentary rocks were originally composed of particles of quartz, clay, and volcanic rock fragments that have become metamorphosed into various schists. The Vishnu Schist exhibits relict graded bedding and structures indicative of turbidite deposits that accumulated in oceanic trenches and other relatively deep-marine settings. The Brahma Schist has been dated to about 1.75 Ga, (1,750 Mya). The felsic metavolcanic rocks that comprise the Rama Schist have yielded an age of 1.742 Ga.|$|R

The presented preliminary results {{are part of the}} French-Indonesian TSUNAMIRISQUE programme with the aim to improve existing flood models and to propose accurate risk maps along coastal areas. The volume offers an excellent overview to {{the state of the art}} in tsunami- and paleotsunami research. The papers present many impressive details about investigation methods, the differentiation of storm- and tsunami-wave generated deposits, about patterns, timing and extent of extreme paleo-tsunami impacts, which are illustrated at a wide variety of coastal sites. All in all this volume will be a great help for an ongoing research on ancient tsunami and storm impacts along coastal sites, and for a more accurate determination of extreme wave risk areas. Therefore, the volume should have a wide readership not only within the geomorphological and geological community. The study of modern and ancient tsunami impacts on coastal areas is becoming increasingly important, not only since the December 24, 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami has devasted many coastal communities in SE Asia, but also since human societies have settled there and coastal population density has increased. Obviously, a prediction of future tsunami impacts and their run up heights along all coastlines of the world makes it necessary to understand the processes and also the frequency and extension of tsunami events happened in the past. Learning from the past is one of the most important aspects in recent tsunami- and paleo-tsunami research. In the first paper A. Scheffers presents a compressed review of sedimentary impacts, ages and run-up extensions of Holocene tsunami events from several islands of the Intra-Americas Seas (Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Barbados, Guadeloupe, Anguilla, St. Martin/St. Maarten, Bahamas) and from Southern Europe coasts (Cyprus, Turkey, Crete, Mallorca, Spain, Portugal). E. Robinson, D. -A. C. Rowe 2 ̆ 6 S. A. Khan focus on wave-emplaced boulders on Jamaica’s rocky shores and made some comparisons with similar deposits in Grand Cayman. They discuss e. g. the effects of submarine landslides for local tsunami events as well as the extent of hurricane-generated movement of boulders weighing up to 33 tons. S. Scheffers, A. Scheffers, U. Radtke, D. Kelletat, K. Staben 2 ̆ 6 R. Bak describe dramatic tsunami–impacts with long-lasting phase-shift on coral reef ecosystems at Bonaire (southern Caribbean) during the Holocene. They hypothize that gaps in the spatial distribution of coral reefs around the globe, where obviously the environmental conditions for coral reef growth are good, may be due to tsunami impacts. Megablocks of Middle and Younger Holocene age were identified and dated along the shorelines around the Tripoli islands and Byblos, northern Lebanon, by Ch. Morhange, N. Marriner 2 ̆ 6 P. A. Pirazzoli. The authors assume a tsunami origin for most of the megablocks, and emphasize that they have been displaced by high-energetic waves from tsunami events generated in outer tsunamigenic areas, and not by vertival movements of the Lebanese coast. A. Scheffers gives a detailed description of the coastal transformation during and after the sudden neotectonic uplift in Western Crete (Greece), that happened on July 365 AD and has been documented in a great variety of uplifted littoral forms. A fault-Model for the AD 365 destructive earthquake and tsunami in the Eastern Mediterranean is presented by S. C. Stiros 2 ̆ 6 A. Drakos. Their preferred model indicates that the up to 9 m coastal uplift of Western Crete and the large scale destructions at many coastal sites in the Eastern Mediterranean were associated with a single giant submarine earthquake from the Hellenic (Aegean) Arc SW of Crete. They assume an unusual magnitude of at least 8. 5. A. Vött, M. May, H. Brückner 2 ̆ 6 S. Brockmüller give a detailed description of Late Holocene tsunami impacts along the northern coast of Lefkada Island (NW Greece). They used geomorphological mapping and vibracoring in deposits near the modern coast to find different types of <b>sedimentary</b> <b>relicts</b> of paleo-tsunamis like e. g. washover and breakthrough fan sediments (crevasse splay) deposited into lagoonal environments and dislocated mega-blocks, blocks and stones. Absolute age estimations are based on 14 C-AMS dating of plant remains or marine organism. The authors postulate at least two mega-tsunami impacts at 1, 000 cal BC and 1, 000 – 1, 400 cal AD, and two smaller events at 300 cal BC and 430 cal AD. G. Mastronuzzi, C. Pignatelli 2 ̆ 6 P. Sansò discuss the value of boulder fields as a morphological indicator of paleo-tsunamis in the Mediterranean Sea focusing on the differentiation between storm- and tsunami-accumulated boulders. The authors emphasize that the geomorphological feature as well as local topography, transporting wave character, size, weight and lithological properties of boulder assemblages have to consider before using them as indicators of a tsunami impact. The presence of a single large boulder, of which the weight is below local limits, as well as imbrication, arrangement in groups or rows could also result from deposition by extreme storm waves. F. J. Gracia, C. Alonso, J. Benavente, G. Anfuso 2 ̆ 6 L. Del-Río summarize different coastal records of the 1755 Tsunami waves along the south SW Spanish Atlantic coast. The authors describe in detail different erosional and depositional tsunami and storm records preserved at different locations from the Guadalquivir river in the North up to Los Lances Bay inthe South. A. Scheffers discusses the origin of Mega-ripples or “dunes” in coarse clastic tsunami deposits along the coastlines of the Caribbean islands Curaçao and Bonaire (Netherlands Antilles). The author states that the mega-ripples are caused by water flow predominantly with onshore direction and assumes a tsunamigenic origin of these features. The last two papers deal with the December 26, 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. B. M. Richmond, B. E. Jaffe, G. Gelfenbaum 2 ̆ 6 R. A. Morton give an excellent description of the geological impacts of this tsunami on Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. The analysis of the observed morphological changes and of the sediment depositions as well as the water level measurements have been used to reconstruct locally variable tsunamigenic processes. Using field oberservations and remote sensing data from the Indian Ocean Tsunami 2004 impact at Banda Aceh and Lhok Nga districts (Indonesia) F. Lavigne, R. Paris, P. Wassmer, Ch. Gomez, D. Brunstein and 11 other Co-authors present a field data-based methodology to calibrate simulation codes for tsunami inundation models.

40|$|I. An area {{of about}} 100 square miles located 20 miles {{southeast}} of Riverside, California, has been geologically mapped. The oldest rocks of the area are phyllites and quartzites correlated with the Bedford Canyon formation (Triassic). Conformably overlying these rocks is a 13, 000 foot thick section of quartzite, schist and rare amphibolite, here named the French Valley formation. The metasedimentary rocks were formed {{from a series of}} shales, shale-clast conglomerates, poorly sorted feldspathic, calcareous and arkosic sandstones and rare basalt flows or tuffs. <b>Relict</b> <b>sedimentary</b> structures and textures are locally well preserved. The sedimentary rocks were intruded with a series of basic and ultrabasic magmas and were tightly folded prior to late Cretaceous time. Late in the period of folding they were metamorphosed to the hornblende-hornfels facies (200 °- 600 °C, 3 - 5 kilobars), producing andalusite, cordierite, sillimanite and garnet in the schists and hornblende-plagioclase (-diopside, -garnet) assemblages in the amphibolites. Zones of progressive metamorphism are mapped trending N-S and cutting the NW-SE structural trend of the folded rocks. In the late Cretaceous these rocks were intruded by basic to intermediate plutonic igneous rocks of the southern California batholith, with no appreciable contact metamorphism. II: A series of seven samples of arkosic quartzite from a single homogeneous member of the French Valley formation has been collected along a profile of increasing metamorphic rank. The component minerals and aliquots of the total rocks have been analysed by X-ray fluorescence, emission spectrographic and wet chemical procedures. For most elements studied, concentrations in the total rock, biotite and ilmenite appear to be constant through the series. These elements either did not vary beyond the experimental uncertainty or they varied without apparent trend over a small range slightly exceeding the uncertainty. With increasing degree of metamorphism the following changes were suggested but fell within or only slightly exceeded the assigned limits of error: a) the total rock gained CaO, Mn, Sr, Co, La, Y, and Ti(?) and lost K 2 O, Na 2 O, and V; b) the biotite gained Mn, Ti, Ba, and possibly Co, Cr, V, and La and lost CaO; c) ilmenite gained Mn and Ni and lost Cr, Ba, Zr(?), Y, and Pb. Other changes observed with increasing metamorphic rank were: a) coarsening and homogenization of the rock texture; b) decrease in the ratio Fe+++/Fe++ in both rock and biotite; c) decrease in 2 V and basal spacing of the biotite; and d) variations in albite content of plagioclase and potash feldspar that suggest loss of Na 2 O from rock. For most elements fractionations between biotite and rock appear to vary directly with the concentration in biotite. Fractionations between ilmenite and biotite are shown to be related to ionic size and charge. The composition of the rock is such that partial fusion would yield a liquid with a composition close to that of the total rock. This may be the cause of the small variations in major element composition with metamorphic grade...|$|R

Geological SciencesScale of {{accompanying}} map: 1 : 12000 Plate 1, {{folded in}} pocket, titled: Geologic {{map of the}} Metal Mountain District In-Ko-Pah Mountains, San Diego County, CaliforniaOriginal map upon which accompanying map was based: Polyconic projection. North American Datum 1927 (NAD 27). California Coordinate System, zone 6. Universal Transverse Mercator, zone 11 (UTM 11). Contour Interval 40 feet. 1959 Bibliography: leaves 185 - 198 The Metal Mountain District is located 11 km north-northwest of Live Oak Springs in the Peninsular Ranges batholith. The district consists of a northward-tapering screen of metasedimentary rocks which has been intruded by the Cibbets Flat pluton {{to the west and}} by the La Posta pluton to the south and east. Tungsten-bearing quartz veins are present. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate and determine the relationship between the screen, the Marginal Facies of the La Posta pluton, and the mineralization. Metasedimentary lithologies in the screen include sillimanite-bearing pelitic schists and paragneisses, calc-silicate-bearing feldspathic quartzites, and rare skarn. Minor amphibolite of calcareous metasedimentary and metavolcanic derivation is also present. The rocks are highly foliated. Isoclinal folding is generally well developed but is obliterated to the north in the paragneisses adjacent to the La Posta pluton. A second generation of folds is present along the southern margin and was generated in response to the intrusion of the La Posta pluton. Mineral assemblage and textural relationships indicate an increase in the conditions of metamorphism to the north. These range between approximately 630 and 700 ??C and 2. 3 to 4. 3 kb. <b>Relict</b> <b>sedimentary</b> structures indicate deep-water sedimentation, perhaps in a distal turbidite depositional environment. Chemical analysis by X-ray fluorescence of the metasedimentary rocks and a comparison with sedimentary chemistries indicate fine-grained arkosic and greywacke protoliths for the quartzites and shales for the mica-schists. These were deposited along an active continental margin. Along the eastern contact of the screen, a newly recognized facies of the La Posta pluton has been delineated. The peraluminous Marginal Facies contains mineralogic and chemical similarities to the La Posta pluton and argues for a genetic relationship. The foliated facies contains a non-garnetiferous unit adjacent to the interior facies of the pluton and a garnet-muscovite unit closely associated with the metasedimentary screen and irregular segregations of biotite. These units are more peraluminous and thus have higher normative corundum than any portion of the La Posta pluton. The data suggest that the Marginal Facies may be the result of modification of the La Posta melt by reaction with the metasedimentary screen. A peraluminous two-mica, La Posta-like granitic unit was also delineated. This unit contains mineralogic similarities to the Marginal Facies and the La Posta pluton. Its strongly peraluminous character suggests a peraluminous source region. A relationship between partial melting, and contamination of the pluton may explain the presence of the tungsten mineralization in the district through remobilization of the metals from the metasedimentary rocks. A K-Ar age determination on biotite from a metasedimentary xenolith in the mineralized quartz stockwork places the timing of the mineralization at 79. 6 -+ 2. 4 m. y. The mineralization hydrothermal system preferentially mineralized along preexisting structures including joints and faults. The joints cross-cut all lithologies. Development of the joints and the hydrothermal system occurred contemporaneously with cooling and solidification of the La Posta. Development of the north-northeast trending fault zones appears to have occurred previously, between 104 and 98 m. y...|$|R
40|$|The Precambrian Sierra Ancha sill complex, 700 to 800 feet thick, was intruded into flat-lying {{sedimentary}} rocks of the Apache Group in central Arizona. The {{bulk of the}} complex consists of a central layer of feldspathic olivine-rich diabase and upper and lower layers of olivine diabase. Diabasic rocks present in relatively minor quantity in {{the upper part of}} the complex include diabase pegmatite, albite diabase, and quartz diabase. Potassic granophyres locally form lenses up to two hundred feet thick near and at the roof of the complex. The intrusion was studied in the field and in the laboratory to determine the origins of the rock types and the conditions under which they formed. Extensive electron microprobe studies of mineral compositions and zoning are presented together with nineteen new whole rock chemical analyses. The Sierra Ancha olivine diabase has a high-alumina olivine basalt composition. Olivine diabase and olivine-rich diabase display a differentiation pattern characterized by moderate iron enrichment. Diabase pegmatite is relatively enriched in alkalis. The principle primary minerals in feldspathic olivine-rich diabase and olivine diabase include: plagioclase (An_(72) -An_(16)); augite (Wo_(43) En_(44) Fs_(13) to Wo_(40) En_(38) Fs_(22)); olivine (Fo_(74) -Fo_(54)); orthopyroxene (En_(77) -En_(44)); magnetite_ss (Mgt_(66) Usp_(34) -Mgt_(89) Usp_(11)); and ilmenite_(ss) (Ilm_(86) Hem_(14) -Ilm_(96) Hem_ 4). All of the orthopyroxene is primary. Fe- Mg fractionations between mafic mineral pairs increase with iron enrichment and declining crystallization temperatures. Ilmenite which formed by reaction-exsolution from magnetite was found to be consistently different in composition from primary ilmenite. The late-crystallizing diabase pegmatites contain an assem 5 lage including iron-rich chlorite together with calcic pyroxene; from textural evidence the two phses appear primary. The calcic pyroxene has a compositional range from Wo_(49) En_(28) Fs_(23) to Wo_(49) En_(14) Fs_(37); its compositions define an iron-enriched trend in the pyroxene quadrilateral more calcic (i. e., closer to the diopsidehedenburgite join) than other iron-enriched igneous pyroxene trends described in the literature. Most diabasic rocks in the sill display some deuteric alteration. The mineral assemblage seemingly stable in the most-altered rocks includes albite (An_(2 - 0)), prehnite, calcic pyroxene (saute), chlorite, sphene, and apatite. Albite diabase contains this assemblage and apparently formed by recrystallization of normal diabase under deuteric conditions. The alteration assemblages are similar to those found in spilites. They provide an important example of the development of a spilitic assemblage by autometamorphism. The massive granophyres at and near the top of the sill appear to be igneous. The larger lenses occur at local high points in the roof of the complex near discordant contacts. The granophyres consist primarily of alkali feldspar with subordinate calcic pyroxene, iron-rich hornblende, biotite, and quartz and minor plagioclase and other phases. They have no <b>relict</b> <b>sedimentary</b> textural features, and they contain miarolitic cavities and rotated and displaced sedimentary rock inclusions. Locally, they occur as masses truncating overlying strata and as dikes in the overlying {{sedimentary rocks}}. Some of the dikes have apparent chilled contacts against the sedimentary rocks, suggesting that they were emplaced largely as melts. The granophyres formed as a result of the interaction of diabase magma with stratified rocks of the overlying Dripping Spring Quartzite. The massive granophyres are generally similar in composition to the overlying sedimentary rocks; both rock types have very unusual and distinctive high potassium contents. Contact metamorphism by the diabase has produced layered metasedimentary rocks with granophyric textures and mineral assemblages comparable to those in some massive granophyres. Consistent compositional differences between granophyres and sedimentary rocks may have been caused by metasomatic processes or by mixing of diabase magma with the sedimentary rock material which constitutes most of the granophyres. The interaction of diabase and sedimentary rocks may have occurred because magma in {{the upper part of the}} intrusion absorbed water from the overlying sedimentary rocks and solidified after magma in the central part of the intrusive. If this happened, the sedimentary rocks over the sill might have been melted to form the granophyres. No chilled facies of diabase occurs at the sill roof where granophyres are present. Compositional trends in mineral series indicate that the diabase magma in the upper part of the sill solidified towards the roof in at least one locality. Normal processes of magmatic differentiation produced feldspathic olivine-rich diabase, olivine diabase, and diabase pegmatite in the Sierra Ancha complex. The processes which produced the granophyres include recrystallization and fusion of rocks overlying the intrusion. The Sierra Ancha granophyres offer a superb opportunity to study these processes and others which may have produced many of the granitic rocks in the crust of the earth. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{a part of}} {{multidisciplinary}} research studies aimed at {{the reconstruction of the}} modalities and mechanisms of Mediterranean sea level rise in the past 20, 000 years, we believe it is useful to concentrate our attention on the contribution that may derive from the study of beach-rocks. This work represents a critical re-examination of the existing information framework, both publi­shed and unpublished, having the objective of contributing to integrate the curve of post-glacial sea level rise, as regard the centre­ western Mediterranean Sea. The complicated issue of the use of beack-rocks as marine palaeo-levels has reduced their role, in the past years, in reconstructing the curves of eustatic rise; despite the wide scientific production on submerged beack-rocks in the Mediterranean. Numerous studies and surveys on beack-rock in the Sardinian continental shelf have found several evidences of statio­nary levels of the Holocene sea, both in the deposition facies, beach rocks and relict littoral sediments, and in the erosion facies, abra­sion surfaces and ledges cutting the substrate. From the recent bibliography it can be deduced that during the Holocene the whole Island reached remarkable tectonic stability; the marine deposits related to the Middle and Upper Pleistocene lie at consistent and cor­relable levels except for a few rare sites where mild vertical blocks are observed. On one hand, this may justify the particularly conser­vative characters of the Sardinian continental shelf compared to the shorelines, whilst on the other one it qualifies Sardinia as a key area in redrawing the post-glacial sea rise in the western Mediterranean. In the Italian seas, the first shorelines related to the Versilian transgression and, among these, the relict submerged sandbanks at- 40 m in the Golfo di Palmas (south-western Sardinia) were found by Segre in 1969. Subsequently, after surveying the beach-rock at- 70 min the Straits of Bonifacio a complex system of perfectly pre­served submerged shorelines along the Sardinian north-eastern continental shelf (between- 55 and - 145 m) was observed. This evi­dence of the variation of the deglacial sea level therefore enables the bypass between Sardinia and Corsica up to the present level (- 75 m) to be recognised. The economic significance of the relict littoral sediments as heavy minerals-bearing sediments has increased the interest of researchers (involved in the "Oceanografia e Fondi Marini- Risorse Minerarie -Placers" Project of C. N. R.) on submerged shorelines. The geophysical prospecting techniques were refined, the first cartographic experiences were accomplished for the south­ western Sardinia and the first underwater samplings of a beach-rock was collected at - 33 m offshore Cala Liberotto. The wide geophy­sical prospecting and sampling on the entire continental shelf have completed the present knowledge on the geographical and bathy­metric distribution of the beack-rocks, and have suggested {{the eastern part of the}} shelf as more conserving than the western one. The set of data was represented in the first geomorphological-cartographic synthesis of the entire Sardinian continental shelf. The early results obtained with in the mining Project stimulated a specific research activity along the submerged shorelines. The detailed carto­graphy methods, the underwater prospecting techniques and the procedures of sedimentological and mineralogical analysis were deve­loped on the perfectly preserved beach-rock in the sample area of Fontanamare in south-western coast. The contribution of the underwater survey in supplementing the geophysical data was of a great impulse to geomorphologic cartography of the sea bottoms. Consequently, a detailed mapping of beack-rocks in the south-eastern continental shelf at - 40 and - 55 m, in the Ria of Arzachena (north-eastern sector) at - 2 and - 10, in the Gulf of Asinara at - 45 m, and in the Straits of Bonifacio at - 30 m was performed. Littoral-tran­sitional depositional complexes characterised by beack-rocks in different arrangements have been observed: the Gulf of Cagliari at - 25, - 40, - 55 m; the northern sector of the Gulf of Orosei at- 35, - 40 e - 55 m; and the Canale di San Pietro at - 5 m. At the same time, on the western Sardinian continental platform, <b>relict</b> <b>sedimentary</b> bodies related to the Versilian transgression have been studied and their geometries and sedimentological aspects analysed. The lack of information on the occurrence of beack-rocks on the - 10 to 30 m bathy­metric range in the Sardinian seas seems to depend on the masking of the outcrops by Posidonia oceanica. A part of the surveys aimed at establishing Marine Reserves; detailed mapping of the marine phanerogam meadows shows beack-rocks discontinuously out­ cropping out of vegetable bioconstructions in the Bay of Tavolara at - 5, - 25,- 28 m, in the area of Capo Carbonara and in Sinis - Gulf of Oristano. This paper shows the methodological evolution of the geophysical surveys by Side Scan Sonar and Sub-bottom profiler; the scuba diving and remote operate vehicle survey; the analysis of sediments and cements: mineralogical and geochemical - S. E. M. Both classic and accelerator mass spectrometry A. M. S. isotopic Ci 4 methodology was particular emphasised. The research proceeded uninterruptedly increasing the detail on both geomorphological s. s and geochemical-sedimentological aspects. Further geochronologi­cal studies have shown the comparison between radiometric data globally obtained on the beack-rocks. From a palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental point of view, it has been possible to read the isotopic ratios of both Oxygen and Carbon in the beach-rock cements of north-eastern Sardinia and southern Corsica. By these data results, it has been possible to draw the first curve of the Holocenic rise based on the beach-rock data only. From the analysis of the cements, supported by the new elements from the A. M. S. radiometric age of the beack-rock of Cala Liberotto (- 33 m), it has been possible to justify the curve of rise of the post Late Glacial Maximum sea. Moreover, the depositional characters and the facies of cement precipitation were better define. In particular, the importance of the bacterial activity in the initial percipitation of Mg-calcite was recognised. The notable scientific interest of these outcrops in reconstructing the Holocene eustatic curve is related to the possibility of correlating the data obtained in these studies with those from the south-eastern basin of the Mediterranean. The regional scale view of the problem would thus lead to a reliable reconstruction of the palaeogeography of the Holocene sea of the central-western area of the Mediterranean Sea. The most significant limiting factors in using the beach rock. data in the sea-level rise curve have proved to be the discontinuity of the outcrops, the often bad condition of con­ servation, genetic characteristics (that are not always clear), the distribution in continental shelves of different origin and often characte­ rised by significant depositional processes or their location in neotectonically active areas, and the difficulty in dating palaeo-beach sediments apart from a few particular cases). These factors require: - A detailed analysis of the coastal and shelf geomorphological context; - Great care in dating both the cements, which can bear different mineralogical, genetical, chronological and diagenetic features, and the bioclasts, which could be subjected to a policyclical elaboration. However, to date, the data belonging to beack-rocks do not allow us to determine the paleo sea level with a detail grater than 5 m...|$|R
