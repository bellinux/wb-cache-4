40|$|The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) uses precast {{prestressed}} concrete slab beam bridges in a side-by-side configuration for short span bridges in low clearance areas. A new bridge type called a <b>spread</b> slab <b>beam</b> bridge was recently developed {{using the same}} concept as <b>spread</b> box <b>beam</b> bridges in which the beams are spaced apart with precast panel stay-in-place forms between beams and a cast-in-place concrete deck. This research presents an evaluation of <b>spread</b> slab <b>beam</b> bridges in terms of design, constructability and performance. The main objective of this project is to develop appropriate design guidelines for this alternative <b>spread</b> slab <b>beam</b> bridge system. Forty-four bridge geometries are designed using standard TxDOT slab beam types to determine the feasible design space. One of the most aggressive geometries with widely spaced slab beams is constructed as a full-scale test bridge and tested under static and dynamic vehicular loads to evaluate constructability and structural performance. Load distribution behavior is investigated during field testing and the measured data is utilized to validate modeling techniques including orthotropic plate analysis, grillage analysis and finite element method based on research findings. It is concluded that <b>spread</b> slab <b>beam</b> bridges that utilize precast concrete panels with a cast-in-place concrete deck provide a viable construction method for short-span bridges. For the tested bridge, the desired performance is achieved for in-service loading. Field testing shows that beam live load deflections are within the design limits, with no significant cracking or reduction in the overall stiffness of the bridge observed. Experimental load distribution factors (LDFs) are evaluated using alignments that provided the most adverse loading cases. Bridge responses under dynamic loads are larger compared to the static counterparts. The American Association of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Load and Resistance Factor Design (2012) LDF equations for <b>spread</b> box <b>beams</b> are reviewed for applicability to <b>spread</b> slab <b>beams</b> and shown to range from being unconservative to very conservative when applied to <b>spread</b> slab <b>beam</b> bridges.

The reduction in relative energy <b>spread</b> (<b>beam</b> cooling) at the expense of mean beam energy predicted by classical theories of radiation reaction has been shown to occur equally in the longitudinal and transverse directions, whereas this symmetry is broken when the theory is extended to approximate certain quantum effects. The reduction in longitudinal cooling suggests that the effects of radiation reaction could be better observed in measurements of the transverse distribution, which for real-world laser pulses motivates the investigation of the angular dependence of the interaction.

40|$|A free-electron laser (FEL) {{based on}} self-amplified {{spontaneous}} emission (SASE) is currently under commission at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The APS SASE FEL [1] requires a high-brightness, low-emittance, and low-energy <b>spread</b> <b>beam.</b> A photocathode rf gun coupled to the APS linac {{is the source}} of the beam. Transverse wakefields generated by misalignments of the accelerating structures can degrade the beam emittance and result in large transverse trajectory errors. Effects due to random consecutive-cell misalignments, alignment errors of the accelerator components, and long-wavelength distortions on a given structure are studied by simulation. The highest emittance dilution comes from alignment errors (steps) between the rf structures. Also, the large centroid excursions cause large beam losses. It is shown that trajectory corrections help reduce emittance growth and mitigate particle losses. The linac rf-structure misalignment tolerance has been set at 350 µm rms [2]. The emittance dilution of a 5 -mm-rad beam due to step errors of the order of 500 µm rms can be reduced to less than 1 % by trajectory correction alone. Various means to reduce emittance dilution by closed bumps are also investigated. ...|$|E

The resulting reduction in relative energy <b>spread</b> (<b>beam</b> cooling) at the expense of mean beam energy predicted by classical theories of radiation reaction depends only on the energy of the laser pulse. Quantum effects suppress this cooling, with the dynamics additionally sensitive to the distribution of energy within the pulse. Since chirps occur in both the production of high-intensity pulses (CPA) and the propagation of pulses in media, the effect of using chirps to modify the pulse shape has been investigated using a semi-classical extension to the Landau [...] Lifshitz theory. Results indicate that even large chirps introduce a significantly smaller change to final state predictions than going from a classical to quantum model for radiation reaction, the nature of which can be intuitively understood.
