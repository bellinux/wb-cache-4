40|$|AbstractA new {{operational}} semantics for “pure” CCS is proposed that considers the parallel operator {{as a first}} class one, and permits {{a description of the}} calculus in terms of partial orderings. The new semantics (also for unguarded agents) is given in the SOS style via the partial ordering derivation relation. CCS agents are decomposed into sets of sequential <b>subagents.</b> The new derivations relate sets of <b>subagents,</b> and describe their actions and the casual dependencies among them. The computations obtained by composing partial ordering derivations are “observed” either as interleaving or partial orderings of events. Interleavings coincide with Milner's many step derivations, and “linearizations” of partial orderings are all and only interleavings. Abstract semantics are obtained by introducing two relations of observational equivalence and congruence that preserve concurrency. These relations are finer than Milner's in that they distinguish interleaving of sequential nondeterministic agents from their concurrent execution...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a great deal of {{interest}} in "modular reinforcement learning" (MRL). Typically, problems are decomposed into concurrent subgoals, allowing increased scalability and state abstraction. An arbitrator combines the subagents' preferences to select an action. In this work, we contrast treating an MRL agent as a set of <b>subagents</b> with the same goal with treating an MRL agent as a set of <b>subagents</b> who may have different, possibly conflicting goals. We argue that the latter is a more realistic description of real-world problems, especially when building partial programs. We address a range of algorithms for single-goal MRL, and leveraging social choice theory, we present an impossibility result for applications of such algorithms to multigoal MRL. We suggest an alternative formulation of arbitration as scheduling that avoids the assumptions of comparability of preference that are implicit in single-goal MRL. A notable feature of this formulation is the explicit codification of the tradeoffs between the subproblems. Finally, we introduce A BL, a language that encapsulates many of these ideas...|$|R

40|$|The paper explores a {{very simple}} agent design method called Q-decomposition, wherein a complex agent is built from simpler subagents.

It supplies to a central arbitrator the Q-values (according to its own reward function) for each possible action. The arbitrator selects an action maximizing the sum of Q-values from all the subagents. This approach has advantages over designs in which subagents recommend actions. It also has the property that if each <b>subagent</b> runs the Sarsa reinforcement learning algorithm to learn its local Q-function, then a globally optimal policy is achieved. (On the other hand, local Q-learning leads to globally suboptimal behavior.) In some cases, this form of agent decomposition allows the local Q-functions to be expressed by muchreduced state and action spaces. These results are illustrated in two domains that require effective coordination of behaviors. 1...|$|E

Drawing from ethnographic and field-based observations in large GCC migrant destinations 2 ̆ 013 including Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) 2 ̆ 013 we investigate the information flows and market uncertainties between five key stakeholders: labor-receiving governments, labor-sending governments, recruitment agencies (<b>subagents),</b> sponsors (employers), and social networks. Several factors contribute to asymmetric information: the lack of bilateral labor agreements and government policy coordination, programs between and among government entities, the absence of labor law for domestic workers, and the laissez faire approach of the labor-receiving government. These sources of asymmetric information create serious market vulnerabilities for the domestic worker population, often resulting in loss of employment and early deportation.

40|$|Although {{substantial}} research {{effort has}} been directed to the examination of optimal search and pricing behavior under traditional brokerage arrangements, market outcomes under conditions of undisclosed subagency and buyer representation have not been fully explored. This study applies the legal and economic theory of agency to real estate markets with cooperating brokers. The existence of cooperating brokers acting as <b>subagents</b> of the seller with the buyer’s full knowledge {{does not change the}} buyer’s and seller’s net payoffs relative to the single-agent case. However, when the buyer mistakenly believes that the cooperating broker/subagent is acting as his agent in negotiations, there may be informational gains that result in a higher selling price and a higher payoff to the seller {{at the expense of the}} buyer. The analysis indicates that buyer brokers may be a potential solution to this agency problem. When both parties to a real estate transaction have separate representation, their net payoffs are shown to be higher and the sales price lower than under traditional brokerage arrangements. The result is dependent on several factors, including: market conditions, relative bargaining power of the parties, method of broker compensation, and disclosure of the status of the buyer broker. ...|$|R
