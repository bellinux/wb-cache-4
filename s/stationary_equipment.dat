25|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and {{were made by}} lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the vacuum pumps required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used Heinrich Geissler's mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial vacuum. The development of the diffusion pump in 1915 and improvement by Irving Langmuir {{led to the development}} of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament operating temperature to a dull red heat (around 700°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to <b>stationary</b> <b>equipment</b> where impact and vibration is not present.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Adhering to an {{exercise}} program is a challenge for everybody who {{wants to build a}} healthier body and lifestyle through physical exercise. We have developed an Virtual Exercise Environment (VEE) that augments <b>stationary</b> exercise <b>equipment</b> with multimedia to make exercising more enjoyable. Compared to the usual fitness club distractions such as audio/video programs (e. g. TV shows) played while you work out, our system makes use of virtual reality techniques to bring the user an immersive experience of real recorded outdoor trails while the s/he is exercising. Our prototype Virtual Exercise Environment consists of a recording system to capture video, distance and incline data about real trails, and a playback system which “displays ” both video and terrain data in the form of video speed and resistance. Trails are played back according to the speed the user generates on the <b>stationary</b> exercise <b>equipment.</b> The system uses commodity capture and display devices and supports standard interfaces for existing exercise equipment. User studies have shown that users enjoy the ability to guage their progress and performance via their progress through trail playback in the VEE. ...|$|R
