The compound must be kept in a tightly closed steel container, in a cool, dry room where temperatures and pressures do not vary frequently, when the compound is not in use. [...] This compound is typically manipulated under a fume hood, and, for more protection, wearing a respirator when the container is open. Direct physical contact is avoided by wearing <b>protective</b> <b>gloves,</b> eyewear, and <b>clothing.</b> In case of a spill of diethylaluminum chloride, the documented procedure is to first get rid of all ignition sources and prevent water from coming in contact with the spill.

40|$|Abstract – Titanium dioxide {{nanoparticles}} (nTiO 2) {{are found}} in numerous manufactured products such as sunscreens and paints. Nevertheless, some studies have expressed concern about their likely harmful effects on health. Application of the precautionary principle {{has led to the}} recommendation for the use of <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> by numerous Health & Safety agencies. However, recent work has shown that solutions of nTiO 2 can penetrate the <b>protective</b> materials of <b>gloves</b> under conditions simulating occupational use. This study has been designed to identify some of the physical phenomena that may facilitate the penetration of nTiO 2 through elastomer membranes subjected to mechanical deformations (such as those produced by flexing the hand). Nitrile rubber and latex gloves were brought into contact with two solutions of nTiO 2. Mechanical deformations were applied to samples of <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> during their exposure to nanoparticles. Repetitive mechanical deformations affected both the physical and mechanical properties of protective materials. Moreover, the elastomers used in <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> were also shown {{to be sensitive to the}} action of the nTiO 2 solutions.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to measure {{permeation}} of the herbicide dichlobenil in Casoron 4 G through disposable and chemically <b>protective</b> nitrile <b>gloves</b> using an American Society for Testing and Materials-type permeation cell and a closed-loop system employing two different solvents (hexane and water) and two different challenge situations (aqueous emulsion and solid formulation). Capillary gas chromatography–mass spectrometry was used for quantification purposes. The chemically <b>protective</b> <b>glove</b> did not allow any permeation up to 8 h for the solid-formulation and water-collection challenges, but permeation was detected in all other challenges. The disposable glove allowed the most permeation, and the solidformulation challenge with water collection necessitated that a dichlobenil equivalent be calculated because of the presence of its hydrolysis degradation product 2, 6 -dichlorobenzamide. Permeation from the solid formulation was detectable by hexane collection for both the disposable and chemically <b>protective</b> <b>gloves</b> and by water collection for the disposable glove. It was concluded that hexane-solvent collection was not valid for the disposable glove at 4 and 8 h of permeation in the solid Casoron challenge or for the aqueous emulsion challenge at 8 h relative to the watercollection solvent data.

40|$|Nicole C DeMartinis, Walter E Finkbeiner Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA Purpose: Traditionally, {{medical school}} {{pathology}} educators have used formalin-fixed specimens to demonstrate effects of diseases on target organs, despite {{the handling of}} these "wet" tissues having distinct disadvantages, such {{as the need for}} <b>gloves,</b> <b>protective</b> <b>clothing,</b> and appropriate facilities to limit potential fixative moisture and fumes. Paper-mounted sections of solid organs have significant potential as an aid for teaching gross pathology and eliminate the disadvantages of handling formalin-fixed specimens. However, published techniques for preparing giant organ sections include the use of the highly toxic ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGEE; 2 -ethoxyethanol). We investigated whether replacing EGEE with a less toxic dehydrating and clearing agent, Histo-Clear™, would allow production of high-quality sections. Materials and methods: Whimster&# 39;s procedure for preparing rapid paper sections of lungs and other organs was modified to incorporate the xylene substitute Histo-Clear in place of EGEE. Results: Giant paper sections of various organs were prepared. In addition to lungs, excellent pathology teaching specimens were prepared from other organs, including the brain, heart, kidney, liver, and colon. Side-by-side comparisons of paper-mounted organ sections prepared using EGEE and Histo-Clear were indistinguishable. The sections prepared using Histo-Clear showed fine anatomical and pathological details. Conclusion: The Gough–Wentworth technique of preparing rapid giant paper sections of organs was made less toxic without sacrificing quality by using Histo-Clear as an alternative to EGEE. Paper-mounted sections offer a safe and portable way for studying macroscopic pathology, and have great potential for use in the anatomy and pathology classroom, as well as in postgraduate pathology training.
