60|$|In {{the hold}} of each vessel a solid {{flooring}} of brick and mortar a foot thick was first laid down. Upon this was built a chamber of masonry forty feet long, {{three and a half}} feet wide, and as many high, and with side walls five feet thick. This chamber was covered with a roof six feet thick of tombstones placed edgeways, and was filled with a powder of Gianobelli's own invention. Above was piled a pyramid of millstones, cannonballs, chain <b>shot,</b> <b>iron</b> hooks, and heavy missiles of all kinds, and again over these were laid heavy marble slabs.

Then, when all was over, and all hands would be piped to take down the hammocks from the exposed nettings (where they play the part of the cotton bales at New Orleans), we might find bits of broken <b>shot,</b> <b>iron</b> bolts and bullets in our blankets. And, while smeared with blood like butchers, the surgeon and his mates would be amputating arms and legs on the berth-deck, an underling of the carpenter's gang would be new-legging and arming the broken chairs and tables in the Commodore's cabin; while the rest of his squad would be splicing and fishing the shattered masts and yards. The scupper-holes having discharged the last rivulet of blood, the decks would be washed down; and the galley-cooks would be going fore and aft, sprinkling them with hot vinegar, to take out the shambles' smell from the planks; which, unless some such means are employed, often create a highly offensive effluvia for weeks after a fight.|$|E

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of impact by clusters of projectiles are experimentally studied by launching grouped projectiles of aluminum shot, steel <b>shot,</b> <b>iron</b> filings, and sand. Cratering efficiency is {{considered as a}} function of a dimensionless parameter related to projectile size and impact velocity. The effects of different target and projectile densities on cratering efficiency are examined. Crater morphology is addressed by considering a typical example, reviewing the systematics between cluster dispersion and crater morphology for vertical impacts, and examining oblique angle impacts which have relevance for planetary secondary cratering processes. These results are compared with impacts by single bodies with different strengths. The evolution of the ejecta plume for clustered impacts is compared to that for single-body impacts for vertical and oblique impacts from 1. 3 to 1. 8 km/s. The experimental results are discussed in the context of planetary surface processes, emphasizing processes in an atmosphere-free environment and secondary impact cratering...|$|E
50|$|From {{about the}} middle of the 17th century until {{the middle of the}} 19th century, {{measurement}} of the bore of large gunpowder weapons was usually expressed as the weight of its <b>iron</b> <b>shot</b> in pounds. <b>Iron</b> <b>shot</b> was used as the standard reference because iron was the most common material used for artillery ammunition during that period, and solid spherical shot the most common form encountered. Artillery was classified thereby into standard categories, with 3 pounders (pdr.), 4 pdr., 6 pdr., 8 pdr., 9 pdr., 12 pdr., 18 pdr., 24 pdr., and 32 pdr. being the most common sizes encountered, although larger, smaller and intermediate sizes existed.|$|R

5000|$|To descend, a bathyscaphe floods {{air tanks}} with sea water, but unlike a {{submarine}} {{the water in}} the flooded tanks cannot be displaced with compressed air to ascend, because the water pressures at the depths for which the craft was designed to operate are too great. For example, the pressure {{at the bottom of the}} Challenger Deep is more than seven times that in a standard [...] "H-type" [...] compressed gas cylinder. Instead, ballast in the form of <b>iron</b> <b>shot</b> is released to ascend, the shot being lost to the ocean floor. The <b>iron</b> <b>shot</b> containers are in the form of one or more hoppers which are open at the bottom throughout the dive, the <b>iron</b> <b>shot</b> being held in place by an electromagnet at the neck. This is a fail-safe device as it requires no power to ascend; in fact, in the event of a power failure, shot runs out by gravity and ascent is automatic.|$|R
