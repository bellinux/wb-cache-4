30|$|The {{current work}} with the {{objective}} of comparing the features of crystalline structures for semiconductive rigid and dielectric coily polymers was divided into three distinct sections. First, the fibrillar P 3 HT semiconductive <b>single</b> <b>crystals</b> were developed from three different solvents, i.e., toluene, xylene, and anisole using the self-seeding method. Second, the dielectric rectangular poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) <b>single</b> <b>crystals</b> were grown by the same methodology but from amyl acetate.

5|$|Multiple {{data sets}} may be {{necessary}} for certain phasing methods. For example, MAD phasing requires that the scattering be recorded at least three (and usually four, for redundancy) wavelengths of the incoming X-ray radiation.

5|$|Photonic {{crystals}} can {{be formed}} in different ways. In Parides sesostris, the emerald-patched cattleheart butterfly, photonic crystals are formed of arrays of nano-sized {{holes in the}} chitin of the wing scales. The holes have a diameter of about 150 nanometres and {{are about the same}} distance apart. The holes are arranged regularly in small patches; neighbouring patches contain arrays with differing orientations. The result is that these emerald-patched cattleheart scales reflect green light evenly at different angles instead of being iridescent. In Lamprocyphus augustus, a weevil from Brazil, the chitin exoskeleton is covered in iridescent green oval scales. These contain diamond-based crystal lattices oriented in all directions to give a brilliant green coloration that hardly varies with angle. The scales are effectively divided into pixels about a micrometre wide. Each such pixel is a <b>single</b> <b>crystal</b> and reflects light in a direction different from its neighbours.|$|E

5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a <b>single</b> <b>crystal,</b> producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E

The creep {{deformations}} of γ-single phase Ni- 20 mass%Cr <b>single</b> <b>crystals</b> {{with stress}} axes within standard stereographic triangle {{and at the}} three pole positions have been investigated. The most of the creep life is occupied by the transient stage, which consists of Stage I and Stage II. In Stage I, the creep rate just after loading remains constant.
