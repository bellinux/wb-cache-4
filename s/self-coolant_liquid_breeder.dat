Nowadays, only ceramic breeder materials have been suggested to be tested in the Tritium Release Module located in the Medium Flux Test Module of IFMIF. <b>Liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> blankets are very promising and for that reason, several concepts will be tested in ITER.

Both self-cooled and dual coolant molten salt options were evaluated. We have also included the dual coolant lead-eutectic Pb- 17 Li design in our assessment.

Refractory metals exhibit high operating temperature and can offer good capability for withstanding high power density operation that {{is the focus of}} the APEX study. In this paper, we assess the impact of using various refractory metal on the nuclear heating profiles across the blanket and power multiplication, PM, and on the tritium breeding profiles and tritium breeding ratio, TBR. The refractory metals considered with <b>liquid</b> lithium <b>breeder</b> are W, TZM, and Nb- 1 Zr. The impact of Li- 6 enrichment on these profiles and on TBR and PM is also assessed. Comparison of these nuclear characteristics is also made to other <b>liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> (Flibe and Li-Sn). Because the moderation power of these breeders to neutron energy varies among them, the damage to the structure is different with various structure/breeder combinations.

40|$|The {{advanced}} power extraction (APEX) study aims {{at exploring}} new and innovative blanket concepts that can efficiently extract power from fusion devices with high neutron wall load.

The liquid FW:B are contained inside the vacuum vessel (VV) with a shielding zone (S) located either behind the VV and outside the vacuum boundary (case A) or placed after the FW:B and inside the VV (case B). In this paper we investigate the nuclear characteristics of this concept in terms of: (1) attenuation capability of the liquid FW:B:S and protection of the VV and magnet against radiation damage; (2) profiles of tritium production rate and tritium breeding ratio (TBR) for several liquid candidates; and (3) profiles of heat deposition rate and power multiplication.

40|$|In HCLL (Helium Cooled Lithium Lead) blanket for ITER fusion reactor, an {{efficient}} management operation of tritium is necessary, {{in order to}} minimize the release of tritium to the environment and to improve the economy of the overall balance of the reactor tritium inventory. In this context, optimization techniques for the measurement of tritium in the various stages of the fuel cycle of the reactor must be carried out in parallel with the research and development of processing systems for tritium. For example, the TES, Tritium Extraction System, is a critical system and the determination of the concentration of hydrogen isotopes is required for its correct design [1]. Therefore, the need of a fast and reliable sensor for the measurement of the tritium concentration in the <b>liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> is well established. For this application, a sensor based on the principle of tritium permeation in a capsule of suitable material seems to be, at least in principle, the easiest and most reliable one. Furthermore, many data on tritium permeability through different materials and their compatibility in an environment of liquid metal are available, thanks to the experimental studies performed for the selection of structural materials for blanket module...|$|R
40|$|The Water Cooled Lithium Lead (WCLL) blanket {{is based}} on the {{eutectic}} liquid alloy Pb 16 Li as breeder material and neutron multiplier, and pressurised water as coolant. The <b>liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> flows at few mm/s in the blanket module while the pressurised water is circulated inside double-wall tubes. In spite of the adoption of double-wall tubes for the coolant, the probability of a water large leak because of a tube rupture accident cannot be considered negligible. As a consequence, the Pb 16 Li/water interaction due to a large break in one or more cooling tubes still remains one of the biggest concerns for this blanket concept. This paper reports the results of three experimental tests on Pb 16 Li/water interaction carried out at ENEA-Brasimone operating the LIFUS 5 facility. Water was injected into the reaction tank, containing Pb 16 Li at 330 C, at a pressure of 155 bar with different values of sub-cooling and with different free volumes in the reaction system.

The important steps {{in the development of}} MHD codes starting from the 1970 s are outlined first and then basic MHD codes, which are currently in use by designers of <b>liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> blankets, are reviewed. A benchmark database of five problems has been proposed to cover a wide range of MHD flows from laminar fully developed to turbulent flows, which are of interest for fusion applications: (A) 2 D fully developed laminar steady MHD flow, (B) 3 D laminar, steady developing MHD flow in a non-uniform magnetic field, (C) quasi-two-dimensional MHD turbulent flow, (D) 3 D turbulent MHD flow, and (E) MHD flow with heat transfer (buoyant convection).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a description of}} the most promising <b>liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> blankets currently proposed for testing in ITER. The critical MHD issues for self-cooled and dual coolant LM systems are the MHD pressure drop and flow distribution with ideal and imperfect insulator barriers/coatings, ideal and imperfect flow channel inserts, and complex geometry flow elements like expansions, contraction, manifolds, etc. Separately cooled LM systems still must circulate the LM for tritium removal, and similar MHD issues may limit flow velocity and influence tritium permeation due to creation of stagnant regions and other non-ideal flow distribution effects. Molten salt breeder/coolants have significantly reduced electrical conductivity as compared to LMs, and MHD pressure drop is not considered a serious issue. However, MS also has much lower thermal conductivity, and the heat transfer to/from the structure depends on turbulent convection. The degradation of convective heat transfer by MHD turbulence modification/suppression is of great interest for both self-cooled MS systems where first wall cooling may need to be enhanced, and dual coolant MS systems where heat transfer from the hot breeder to the cooler wall needs to be suppressed. These issues are discussed in detail and development plans specifically for the dual-coolant PbLi concept, up to and including integrated testing in ITER, are presented. I...|$|R

Blanket test modules will be inserted in ITER from Day 1 of its operation and will provide the first experimental data on the feasibility of the D-T cycle for fusion.

40|$|Low {{activation}} ferritic-martensitic steels (RAFM-steels) are foreseen as {{structural materials}} in different blanket designs (HCLL, DCLL, WCLL) with Pb- 15. 7 Li as breeding and partly also as cooling medium. In HCLL and WCLL designs the structural material {{will be in}} direct contact with the flowing <b>liquid</b> <b>breeder</b> at operating temperatures up to 550 °C. In the past, investigations concerning the corrosion behavior of RAFM-steels like F 82 H-mod. and Eurofer showed that these alloys are attacked by the flowing breeder. These corrosion tests pointed out, that the corrosion attack depends mainly on flow velocity and temperature. All these alloys were ‘single’ phase ferritic-martensitic steels without any additions. However, structural materials with better strength and creep resistance like ODS-Eurofer or ferritic steels are gathering interest in blanket development and will be required at least for DCLL application due to higher operation temperatures. Nevertheless, reliable data concerning compatibility with Pb- 15. 7 Li are missing until now. In this paper results from long-term corrosion testing of ODS-Eurofer will be reported for exposure times up to 1. 5 years at a flow velocity of 0. 1 m/s.
