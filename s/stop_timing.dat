The purpose of the investigation here into the functional characteristics of fling-step-like motions was to see their contributions to the velocity seismograms in Fig.  11 and hence identify the cause of the DCA in Mashiki.

40|$|Twenty-four-month-old and 4 -month-old rats {{were trained}} on a peak-interval procedure, where {{the time of}} {{reinforcement}} was varied twice between 20 and 40 sec. Peak times from the old rats were consistently longer than the reinforcement time, whereas those from younger animals tracked the 20 - and 40 -sec durations more closely. Different measures of performance suggested that the old rats were either (1) systematically misremembering the time of reinforcement or (2) using an internal clock with a substantially greater latency to start and <b>stop</b> <b>timing</b> than the younger animals. Old rats also adjusted more slowly to the first transition from 20 to 40 sec than did the younger ones, but not to later transitions. Correlations between measures derived from within-trial patterns of responding conformed in general to detailed predictions derived from scalar expectancy theory. However, some correlation values more closely resembled those derived from a study of peak-interval performance in humans and a theoretical model developed by Cheng and Westwood (1993), than those obtained in previous work with animals, {{for reasons that are}} at present unclear...|$|E
40|$|A novel de-noising {{method for}} {{improving}} the performance of full-waveform {{light detection and ranging}} (LiDAR) based on differential optical path is proposed, and the mathematical models of this method are developed and verified. Backscattered full-waveform signal (BFWS) is detected by two avalanche photodiodes placed before and after the focus of the focusing lens. On the basis of the proposed method, some simulations are carried out and conclusions are achieved. (1) Background noise can be suppressed effectively and peak points of the BFWS are transformed into negative-going zero-crossing points as <b>stop</b> <b>timing</b> moments. (2) The relative increment percentage of the signal-to-noise ratio based on the proposed method first dramatically increases with the increase of the distance, and then the improvement gets smaller by increasing the distance. (3) The differential Gaussian fitting with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is applied, and the results show that it can decompose the BFWS with high accuracy. (4) The differential distance should not be larger than c/ 2 × τrmin, and two variable gain amplifiers can eliminate the inconsistency of two differential beams.

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that when a fixed interval is interrupted (known as the gap procedure), pigeons tend to reset memory and start timing from 0 after the gap. However, because the ambient conditions of the gap typically {{have been the same}} as during the intertrial interval (ITI), ambiguity may have resulted. In the present experiment, the authors found that when ambient conditions during the gap were similar to the ITI, pigeons tended to reset memory, but when ambient conditions during the gap were different from the ITI, pigeons tended to <b>stop</b> <b>timing,</b> retain the duration of the stimulus in memory, and add to that time when the stimulus reappeared. Thus, when the gap was unambiguous, pigeons timed accurately. The peak procedure, used to examine the ability of animals to time the duration of a stimulus (Catania, 1970), involves the use of a fixed interval (FI) schedule of reinforcement in which reinforce-ment is provided for the first response that occurs after the interval has elapsed. It is possible to use an animal’s response rate through-out the interval to assess its timing ability. Typically, an upwardly sloping response scallop is found (Church, 1978; Gibbon, 1977; S...|$|E
30|$|However, in the {{transponder}} mode, a link start command configures {{the instrument}} {{to wait for}} a maximum of 1  s for a laser pulse from the ground. If a signal over the threshold level is detected by the receiving telescope, the signal triggers laser emission of 15  mJ. Up to two laser pulses can be detected during the 1 -s waiting period, and these pulses are flagged as the first and second pulse detection (the names of these telemetry data are STOP 1 and STOP 2). The interval between the first pulse and the laser diode trigger time (<b>STOP</b> 1 <b>TIMING),</b> the interval between the laser diode trigger time to the laser emission (START TIMING), and the interval between two received pulses (<b>STOP</b> 2 <b>TIMING)</b> are also recorded as telemetry data.

30|$|We {{should note}} that the time shift of the fling-step-like motions can be {{observed}} in Fig.  10. It may not be totally appropriate to call the determined smoothed rump functions as fling-step functions, but what we determined here was the best matching smooth function for the observed displacement time history of each component. Because the observed displacement time history in the EW direction at both IIS Mashiki and KiK-net KMMH 16 have about 1 -s delayed start-up and <b>stopping</b> <b>timings</b> in comparison with the NS and UD components (with almost the same rise time), the timing in the velocity functions in Fig.  11 is also delayed.

The tests of the new positron digital-life time setup have been carried out. Detectors with BaF 2 scintillators and fast-dynode outputs were chosen for such studies. As the digitiser unit, the card Acqiris DP 240 was fully tested. Originally, start and <b>stop</b> <b>timing</b> signals were sampled to digital waveforms separately {{at a rate of}} 1 GS/s in 8 bit resolution. However, due to limited quality of collected waveforms which significantly affected post-processing of data, the joined delayed channel mode with 2 GS/s sampling rate was applied for further studies. The full setup was benchmarked by a series of calibration measurements of two high purity materials, specifically Si and Ni. The inter-comparison of conventional analogue- and digitalbased processing are discussed in detail. Further, the optimisation of main parameters for waveform-processing are analysed too. Such a new approach in the digital life-time spectroscopy will help to improve the resolution of existing methodology which might enhance the capabilities of this technique for further applications, especially in materials science.

40|$|When a DVD {{title is}} {{announced}} prior to actual distribution, consumers can often preorder {{the title and}} receive {{it as soon as}} it is released. Alternatively, once a title becomes available (i. e., formally released), consumers can obtain it upon purchase with minimal delay. We propose an individual-level behavioral model that captures the aggregate preorder/postrelease sales of motion picture DVDs. Our model is based on an optimal stopping framework. Starting with the utility function of a forward-looking consumer, and allowing for consumer heterogeneity, we derive the aggregate preorder/postrelease sales distribution. Even under a parsimonious specification for the heterogeneity distribution, our model recovers the typically observed temporal pattern of DVD preorder and sales, a pattern which exhibits an exponentially increasing number of preorder units before the release, peaks at release, and drops exponentially afterward. Using data provided by a major Internet DVD retailer, we demonstrate a number of important managerial implications stemming from our model. We investigate the role of preorder timing through a policy experiment, estimate residual sales, and forecast post-release sales based only on preorder information. We show that our model has substantially better predictive validity than benchmark models. optimal <b>stopping,</b> <b>timing</b> model, online retailing, motion picture...|$|R

Here, we used a constant value of 26 counts because the spacecraft was far from the Earth and the observation time was short, and the change in spacecraft velocity was negligible. The counter values were then converted to time using the LIDAR counter clock frequency, and adjusted by 1.874  kHz so that the LIDAR histogram could be overlain on the ground histogram.|$|R
40|$|Anonymous {{communications}} protocols {{have been}} designed to resist attacks that work {{in a short period of}} time. However, people typically use the Internet in regular, consistent ways over long periods of time, and consequently they are vulnerable to losing their privacy over the lifetime of those communications. Our work has focused on long-term attacks against anonymous communications systems. The predecessor attack is an example of this kind of attack; the attacker logs the connections of a user over time, eventually linking the connections to the user 2 ̆ 7 s machine. ^ In this thesis, we give a proof that shows that the users of all existing anonymous communications systems are vulnerable to the predecessor attack. Then we analyze specific instances of the attack against several protocols to show how long the attack takes in each case. Attacks take an order of magnitude more time to be successful against Onion Routing[37] over Crowds[57]. When timing attacks can be stopped, the attack cost becomes exponential in the length of the user 2 ̆ 7 s path. We use simulation to back up our analytical results and to show how quickly the attack works in practice. We also describe approaches to defending against these attacks and discuss the tradeoffs between security and usability. ^ The next section of this thesis focuses on timing attacks and defenses against them. We began by simulating attack scenarios and show that using a constant rate of traffic for each user makes timing attacks more difficult. We also present defensive dropping, a modification of this defense that more effectively <b>stops</b> <b>timing</b> attacks. Experiments with Tor[55], a developmental Onion Routing system, demonstrate that these attacks work in practice on the Internet. ^ Finally, we use analysis and simulation to understand the combined effects of timing analysis and the predecessor attack. We show how long the predecessor attack requires given varying levels of attackers 2 ̆ 7 timing analysis success. We find that increasing the error rates of timing analysis significantly increases the amount of time required for the attacker to succeed. ...|$|R

The low energy antideuteron provides a clean dark matter signature, since the antideuteron production by cosmic ray interactions is suppressed at low energy, while the WIMP-WIMP annihilation can produce low energy an- tideuterons.

During the winter and summer, macroinvertebrates and biofilm were collected from brick substrates from four or three sites in the streams on a geometric time schedule (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 days of exposure).

A total of 6, 081 vehicles were observed entering and exiting three public rest areas and two private truck stops during continuous 25 -hour periods. Analyses revealed that truck drivers took longer breaks during nighttime (1800 – 0559) hours compared to daytime (0600 – 1759) hours and at private truck stops compared to public rest areas. In addition, public rest areas were more crowded than private truck stops and all truck parking lots observed were most crowded at night. ^ These findings provide support for a circadian pattern of breaks among truck drivers at public rest areas and private truck stops in Connecticut.

In anticipation of a future balloon experiment, an accelerator test was conducted in 2004 and 2005 at KEK, Japan, in order to prove the concept and to precisely measure the X-ray yields of antiprotonic exotic atoms formed with different target materials [1]. The X-ray yields of the exotic atoms with Al and S targets were obtained as ~ 75 %, which are higher than were previously assumed in [2]. A simple, but comprehensive cascade model has been developed not only to evaluate the measurement results but also to predict the X-ray yields of the exotic atoms formed with any materials in the GAPS instrument. The cascade model is extendable to any kind of exotic atom (any negatively charged cascading particles with any target materials), and it was compared and validated with other experimental data and cascade models for muonic and antiprotonic exotic atoms. The X-ray yields of the antideuteronic exotic atoms are predicted with a simple cascade model and the sensitivity for the GAPS antideuteron search was estimated for the proposed long duration balloon program [3], which suggests that GAPS has a strong potential to detect antideuterons as a dark matter signature.
