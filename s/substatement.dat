40|$|The {{first point}} of the study purpose is {{taken into account in}} the second and third chapter of this work. It helps to create the ground of the {{successive}} argument and it also shows the main problem that could generate a delays or a disruptions in the airline industry. We know that the structure of airlines is divided into various phase and they are strategic, tactical and operational phases. part of the strategic phase are Routes, Type of aircraft (size), Price / policy, Out-source and Planners. The tactical phase is composed by Normal week plan, Supports, Aircraft flights maintenance, Cycle Time and frequency of flight, Crew scheduling. Finally, the operational phase is unrolled in Delay maintenance, Scheduling, Roll the plan, Disruption management. In all these phases can be possible to experience delays, but the phase most subject to variations is the operational one. Moreover, in the third chapter we investigate more precisely the planning operation for the crew and also the airplanes, so the background is complete to develop the main topic of the thesis. To reply at the second statement point, one complete chapter in this work is dedicated to this and it is the chapter six. The disruption situation originates in a local event such as an aircraft maintenance problem, a flight delay, or an airport closure or large traffic in the airport, but also for problems of crew and/or plane scheduling or bad weather condition. The plans for aircraft assignments, crew assignments and maintenance of the flight schedule is handed over from the planning department to the operations control centre (OCC) a few days days ahead of the day of operation. The deadlines are different for different resources. Short-haul plans are usually handed over one day ahead of the operation date, while long-haul information is handed over three to five days before. When one disruption comes, operations personnel in the airlines must find realtime solutions so that it is able to replace the airline to its original schedule as soon as possible. An operations control center is required to make important operational decisions with significant operational and commercial ramifications and often under extreme time pressure and sometimes without complete information. Manual methods often mean that only one or two possible solution options can be considered with the prospect that a solution far from optimal across all the key areas may be implemented. As a result of the sequential nature of manual processes, implemented for one resource might very well have a profound impact on other areas. In the chapter seven, it is address the problem of analysis of some datas from the Avinor company and this is indicated as point three in the study purpose. It is showed the more common charts and analysis to begin the dissertation about the punctuality in the airlines. The company unfortunately didn t provide enough material and informations for an accurate analysis. For the sub-statements number four and five are fundamental the central chapters, especially the number five and six, so in conclusion it is possible to affirm that this section seeks to determine the difference between the approach of the previous authors. Considering the high number of work related presented, it is not possible to present a detailed comparison of their approach with each of the works mentioned. However, it is possible to present the main differences. In their opinion, their work is different from previous ones regarding the following key features: the scope; technology; integration; quality costs. In the field of restoration of operations, there are three dimensions: aircraft, crew and passengers. The authors classified its work according to the size that consider an integrated approach when you are able to address two of these dimensions. The authors work differs from the previous ones and in that it considers the three dimensions of the domain. In this sense and to the best of their knowledge, their approach is fully integrated. Both aircraft recovery and crew recovery problems have been considered. Both the aircraft recovery and crew recovery problems have been modelled as multicommodity network flow problems where the underlying network is connection network. The paper has also considered the correlation and dependency of two problems. A new algorithm has been presented which solves aircraft recovery and crew recovery problems sequentially and in interactive manner, in the paper [62] and this could be the optimal solution. The subject algorithm takes into account the dependency of two problems, represents the correlation between them without integrating the two recovery problems. Moreover, to reply at the <b>substatement</b> four, one complete section is dedicated for that, in the chapter six. The MAS architecture, the multi-agent system is really interesting and taken into account in this field of investigation. The agent and service model were the outputs of this process and the base for this architecture. Moreover, it could be iterated for all the agents with the exception of the Supervisor agent. It is important to capture the costs of delaying or cancelling a flight, from the point of view of the passenger and not only from the point of view of the airline company. The connected works that consider the cost of delaying a flight, assign a cost to each minute of delay. In the authors opinion, this only captures the cost from the point of view of the airline company because that cost is defined by the airline and it is valid for all flights, without considering the profiles of the passengers in the specific flight being affected by a disruption. The authors approach uses quality costs that considers the opinion of the passengers on the specific flights and that is one of the biggest differences regarding the related work published so far. To reply at the <b>substatement</b> six, there is all the chapter five that briefly says that the Air Transport Association has estimated that there were a total of 116. 5 million delay minutes in 2006, resulting in a $ 7. 7 billion increase in direct operating costs to the U. S. airline industry. Nonetheless, also in the United States, the introduction in 2006 of airspace flow program (APPs) enabled the FAA to target more precisely, en route, flights affected by weather. Because unaffected flights could easily be excluded from ANSP interventions, this capability is estimated to have reduced delay costs by $ 190 million over the first 2 years of implementation. Determining more specifically which flights should be subject to, and which exempt from, a ground-holding action triggered by reduced airport capacity remains an open research question. Moreover, with the increase in air traffic is not impossible to run into the resulting delays also due to the crowding airports. The total direct operation costs in 2006 amounted $ 7, 663 per minute ($ millions) and it is composed from fuel, crew, maintenance, aircraft ownership and others. The cost scenarios are derived from independently concurring sources on total passenger costs during 2003. Two airline sources have also been used to rationalise the equal split between hard and soft costs and we show that in total are 0. 16, 0. 36, 0. 42 respectively for low base and high cost in percentage. Overall, the total base cost scenario for 2008 is 20 % higher than the value of 2003. Finally, the discussion about the last sub-statement, the number seven, is developed in the chapter eight. In it is underlined the influence of the new trends in the overall airline industry, and in what way they should be changed also the disruptions management and the manage of the delays. There are three main changes to adopt to ATM. The first one is to utilize a new 4 D principal trajectoryb. The second is a system wide information management and the latest is the automation. In that way it will be possible to enable EU skies to handle 3 times more traffic than nowadays, at the same time improving safety by a factor of 10, reducing the environmental impactper flight by 10 % and also cutting ATM costsby 50 %...|$|E

40|$|Temporal Distortions is 18 - 20 {{minutes in}} length and is written for an {{orchestra}} including 2 flutes (2 nd flute doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 Bb clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, 2 trombones, timpani, 3 percussionists playing tri-toms, vibraphone, snare/tenor drum, medium suspended cymbal, Glockenspiel, bass drum, and large tam-tam; and multiple string parts for violin I a & b, violin II a & b, viola a & b, cello and double bass. Temporal Distortions {{was inspired by the}} theoretical concept of "wormholes" in space, where matter is warped through distorted passages connecting distant and diverse parts of the universe. The work is in three sections, connected without break. The first section, Space, emerges as a wide, expansive musical area where themes and gestures are freely presented. Gradually, these materials come into phase with one another, building to a climax. A transition follows, leading into the middle section, Wormholes, where the materials are frequently and suddenly transformed into other temporal elements. The third section, Comets, was inspired by the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with the planet Jupiter in July of 1993. Driving, underlying rhythms propel the thematic material through a series of statements which split into more and more <b>substatements.</b> This leads into a turbulent, explosive section and a final wormhole which returns to the opening material. Five basic temporal elements [...] sustaining, aligned/non-repeating, aligned/repeating, non-aligned/repeating, and non-aligned/non-repeating [...] are derived and demonstrated. Relationships between these elements are examined, and basic transformations are discussed. These elements {{serve as the basis for}} a theory of temporal analysis applicable to both metered and non-metered music. Chapter I presents this theory, and Chapter II discusses its application as a compositional method in Temporal Distortions...|$|R

The major purpose of this ethnographic case study was to offer contextualized insights into the commonalties and unique leadership experiences of African-American women. This study examined the subjective interpretations of leadership experiences among two groups of African-American women in six entry level and six executive level management positions, in the corporate arena; described common themes that would help to define leadership experiences; and investigated differences found among leadership positions, workplace context, age, and education. The methodology used for the study was an ethnoscience approach. This approach focuses upon eliciting and classifying emic data, information obtained from the actual words of informants that represent their thinking, language use, and experiences. Common themes for each group were identified and used to establish a taxonomy that included domains of inquiry, segregates (low level abstractions that describe the domains), and <b>substatements</b> (additional informant's actual words that further describe the segregates). Using descriptive information that emerged from the taxonomy, high-level segregate abstractions, called correlates, were identified to provide rich descriptions of the essence, characteristics, and leadership experiences of African-American women. These correlates offer descriptive statements for the domains of inquiry, marginality, education, job responsibilities, mentorship, and other relationships. It was concluded that both entry level and executive level groups have adverse leadership experiences attributed to their gender and ethnicity. Some difficulties that African-American women encounter in entry-level positions are attributed to their lack of involvement in mentoring activities. Implications for human resource development included the formation of supportive socio-cultural networks and career development and training programs that incorporate the social context of the employees. The lack of university courses that emphasize the social context of employees for training the human resource development student was discussed. Some contextual implications for research in human resource development included: (1) replicating this study, using a larger participant group composed of other marginalized persons; (2) examining organizational culture and management philosophy of the workplace and the effects that they have on gender and ethnicity; and (3) designing strategic plans for employee and executive career development based upon the assessed socio-cultural context of the individual...|$|R
