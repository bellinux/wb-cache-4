(2017) investigated the integration <b>of</b> crowdsourced data (<b>CSD)</b> into hydrological models {{to improve the}} accuracy of real-time flood forecasts. The authors used synthetic CSD (i. e. not actually measured), because real CSD were not {{available at the time}} of the study. In their work, which is a proof-of-concept study, Mazzoleni et al. (2017) showed that assimilation <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> improves the overall model performance; the impact of irregular frequency <b>of</b> available <b>CSD,</b> and that <b>of</b> data uncertainty, were also deeply assessed. However, the use <b>of</b> synthetic <b>CSD</b> in conjunction with (semi-) distributed hydrological models deserves further discussion. As a result of equifinality, poor model identifiability, and deficiencies in model structure, internal states of (semi-) distributed models can hardly mimic the actual states of complex systems away from calibration points. Accordingly, the use <b>of</b> synthetic <b>CSD</b> that are drawn from model internal states under best-fit conditions can lead to overestimation of the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> assimilation in improving flood prediction. Operational flood forecasting, which results in decisions of high societal value, requires robust knowledge of the model behaviour and an in-depth assessment of both model structure and forcing data. Additional guidelines are given that are useful for the a priori evaluation <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> for real-time flood forecasting and, hopefully, for planning apt design strategies for both model calibration and collection <b>of</b> <b>CSD...</b>|$|R
40|$|Cortical {{spreading}} depression (CSD) is a pathophysiological phenomenon, which underlies some neurological disorders, such as migraine and stroke, but its {{mechanisms are}} still not completely understood. One of the striking facts is that the spatiotemporal evolution <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> wave is varying. Observations in experiments reveal that a CSD wave may propagate through the entire cortex, or just bypass {{some areas of the}} cortex. In this paper, we have applied a 2 D reaction-diffusion equation with recovery term to study the spatiotemporal evolution <b>of</b> <b>CSD.</b> By modulating the recovery rate from CSD in the modeled cortex, CSD waves with different spatiotemporal evolutions, either bypassing some areas or propagating slowly in these areas, were present. Moreover, spiral CSD waves could also be induced in case of the transiently altered recovery rate, i. e. block release from the absolute refractory period. These results suggest that the refractory period contributes to the different propagation patterns <b>of</b> <b>CSD,</b> which may help to interpret the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> propagation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presented}} a framework to explain {{corporate social responsibility}} disclosure (<b>CSD)</b> in terms <b>of</b> determinants and consequences. The study is dealing with quantity and quality <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> in both annual and stand alone reports. The framework is based on legitimacy theory as appropriate theoretical background for CSD, and the main idea in this theoretical framework is that CSD {{is a function of}} social pressure on companies concerning their social responsibility. The framework has started with explain the level of social pressure at the country level to explain the differences of the level <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> among countries. It is argued that the interaction between economic level, culture and the level of corporate governance determine the level of social pressure in a given country. The level <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> at the company level is determined according to two dimensions; the degree of social pressure that face each company and how each company responses to this pressure. It is argued that, on one hand, the interaction between corporate characteristics and media coverage of the company determine the degree of social pressure that face a company {{and on the other hand}} corporate governance mechanisms determine how each company responses to pressure. The last point in framework explains that the direct consequence for CSD is improving corporate social reputation. The empirical results support, to large extent, the framework. At a country level, both cultural values and economic level determine the level of social responsibility disclosure in the country. Concerning determinants <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> at a company level, it appears that quantity <b>of</b> <b>CSD,</b> and to lesser extent quality <b>of</b> <b>CSD,</b> can be determined according to the following variables: corporate size, type of activity, media pressure, board size, the presence of corporate responsibility committee as a board committee, and ownership diffusion. With regard to the consequences <b>of</b> <b>CSD,</b> the empirical evidence indicates that CSD significantly influences corporate social reputation, while it has no impact on corporate market value. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that cortical spreading depression (CSD) decreases the vulnerability of neurons to cerebral ischemia. The phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> is characterized as a transient propagating wave of depolarization, accompanied by alterations in metabolism, cerebral blood flow and gene expression. The endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms evoked after CSD are not well understood. The objective of the present dissertation was to examine the effect <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> on the expression of factors associated with neuroprotection and to define the number <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> episodes necessary for the induction <b>of</b> tolerance. <b>CSD</b> was evoked in Wistar rats and animals were permitted to recover for various times. Levels of mRNA encoding selected proteins were analyzed using Northern blots and semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions. In a separate group, animals were preconditioned with a single episode <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> and subjected to forebrain ischemia 24 hrs later. Neuroprotection was assessed by cell counts of injured neurons. The present study provides evidence that CSD may confer neuroprotection by altering the mRNA level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and heat-shock protein 72 in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, a novel method using local heating to evoke CSD was developed and found to induce tolerance in the ipsilateral CAI region of the hippocampus. Lastly, the results demonstrate that <b>CSD</b> triggers expression <b>of</b> transforming growth factor-beta and members of the serpin/plasminogen family. The present results offer new insight into the role of the plasmin system in induced tolerance, in addition to characterizing the relationship between the number <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> episodes and expression of putative neuroprotective factors. The discovery of a novel method <b>of</b> evoking <b>CSD</b> will enable further identification of potential candidates and mechanisms mediating induced tolerance. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} corporate social disclosure (CSD) assurance from a stakeholder perspective within a study which encompasses both stakeholder preferences and demand drivers <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> assurance. Design/methodology/approach – Stakeholder perceptions of and their demand for CSD assurance are examined through a questionnaire survey. The analysis is based on responses in an empirical study from 147 organisations which are investing, procuring and third-sector stakeholders. Findings – Overall, stakeholder comments suggest an emphasis on the importance of specialist environmental assurors and the role of trust. The demand for assurance is positively related to stakeholders’ assessment of the value <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> and the use of information from information intermediaries such as responsible investment indices, and negatively related to stakeholder perceptions <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> representational faithfulness. Research limitations/implications – This paper only draws on data from the UK. Similar research can be explored in a context outside the UK. Practical implications – Better understanding of stakeholder defined determinants of the demand for CSD assurance as well as their perceptions <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> assurance will inform regulators and enable companies to better discharge accountability towards stakeholders.

CSD can continuously mine and transport the slop with good quality while CSD can tackle many types of soil. However, even a component failure, which is connected with parts and components <b>of</b> <b>CSD,</b> can result in no working. Thus, it affects the production capacity and efficiency of dredgers seriously. It is necessary to analyze the failure probability <b>of</b> <b>CSD.</b> The method <b>of</b> Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is applied to analyze the failure probability <b>of</b> <b>CSD.</b> The method uses logical reasoning and builds a fault tree model by analyzing the relationship between the basic, intermediate and top events. Based on fault tree model of a variety of events " and " " or " relationship, we can obtain minimal cut sets of that cause the event to failure. Then, get the basic probability of the event. Finally, we can calculate the probability of the top events. Under experiments, the FTA method can accurately calculate the failure probability <b>of</b> <b>CSD,</b> and deduce in reverse order the key events that cause the top event. The study on the key events can reduce the failure probability <b>of</b> <b>CSD,</b> enhance its reliability and safety, and improve the efficiency and productivity indirectly.

40|$|Migraine is a {{prevalent}} {{and potentially}} debilitating neurological disorder with complex pathophysiology. Previous studies have provided compelling {{evidence for a}} role of Cortical Spreading Depression (CSD) in the symptomatology of migraine, most importantly the auras experienced by a subset of migraineurs. However, the precise role <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> {{in the development of}} other symptoms of migraine, most notably pain, is less certain. Limitations of previous animal models <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> have proven problematic in our ability to elucidate the role of these events in the development of migraine pain. In the newly developed animal model described here, electrical activity was recorded from multiple sites on the cerebral cortex in freely-moving animals. This model allows for recording bioelectrical changes in the cortex while concurrent behavioral changes are being measured. In contrast to other studies that employ invasive measures to evoke CSD, recordings described here are from animals that have not undergone any cortical insult, but alternatively received prolonged treatment with sumatriptan, an agent demonstrated to {{contribute to the development of}} medication-overuse headache when administered chronically. The studies described here show that animals pretreated with sustained sumatriptan have a significant increase in frequency <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>CSDs.</b> Moreover, this increase in frequency is augmented following exposure of animals to a bright light stress. These findings demonstrate a lowered threshold of cerebral cortex for development of spreading depression. These findings also suggest a dissociation between development <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> and activation <b>of</b> nociceptive pathways responsible for migraine headache. Additionally, these findings show that this is a viable platform for further study <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> in freely-moving animals and their function in the development of migraine headache.

To demonstrate the applicability of our model, we have carried out extensive numerical simulations under different initial conditions and inclusion of various mechanisms. Our results show that CSD waves can be instigated by injecting cross-membrane ionic currents or by applying KCl in the extracellular space.

This study examines the extent <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> in Indonesian listed companies by applying the content analysis method to company annual reports for the years 2003 to 2006. Prior studies have focused on exploring the theoretical framework, seeking the motivation for disclosures and obtaining certain stakeholder 2 ̆ 7 s opinions regarding CSD. However, those studies were limited to developed countries and to select stakeholder groups for their perceptions. For these reasons, the current study proposes to enrich research into CSD, particularly by providing evidence from a large developing country in Asia, with an expanded research corpus. First, the practice <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> in Indonesian listed companies was examined, including the trend and discussion about the nature of disclosures from the content analysis. Second, the importance <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> information for stakeholders was investigated through the examination of a broader range of stakeholders (shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, communities, and investors). Third, top management representatives of the listed companies were questioned to elicit company motivations and identify the most influential party to practise CSD. Finally, some variables including the company 2 ̆ 7 s type and size, financial performance, percentage of ownership, creditors 2 ̆ 7 and auditors’ influences, and corporate age were examined to establish their relationships to the extent <b>of</b> <b>CSD.</b> A pilot study was undertaken prior to the main study as this research area is considered relatively new for Indonesia. The samples, including the issues of data collection questionnaires, and hypotheses were initially tested and the results were then used to redesign the main study. The main study findings indicate that the majority of hypotheses can be accepted and suggest that: (I) Every stakeholder group has significantly different perceptions of the importance <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> information. but ‘product’ was identified as the most important information. (2) community 2 ̆ 7 was considered as the most influential party and creating a positive image· was the greatest motivation for companies to practise CSD; (3) There were significant positive trends in CSD quantity and quality from 2003 to 2006; (4) there were also significant differences between 2 ̆ 7 state 2 ̆ 7 and non-state 2 ̆ 7 companies in the extent of CSD: and (5) company size. Financial performance, age and auditor 2 ̆ 7 influences were found to have a significant positive effect on the extent <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> quantity and quality, ‘Company type 2 ̆ 7, however did not influence CSD significantly, and owners influence correlated positively rather than negatively to CSD, contradiction prior expectation.

The overall correlations between predictor a 11 d criterion variables are considered to be low, moderate, varied from 0. 463 to 0. 607 for correlation coefficients (R) and 0. 215 to 0. 368 for determination coefficients (R 2) in the regression model. One of the major implications of this study underlines the significant and consistent influence on the extent <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> by 2 ̆ 7 state owned 2 ̆ 7 companies in Indonesia when compared with that of ‘non-state owned 2 ̆ 7 companies. This appears to be an important variable and should be studied further. In addition, both stakeholder and legitimacy theories have been used to explain certain areas <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> practices in Indonesia. The role of these theories may be sharpened or combined with other theories to build a clearer picture of the practices, especially to explain the gap that exists between stakeholder 2 ̆ 7 s and company 2 ̆ 7 s perspectives 2 ̆ 7. The findings on the items <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> that were perceived as important by the Indonesian stakeholders can also be helpful in developing a CSD list for evaluating social reporting. The content analysis results provide valuable insights into the extent and nature <b>of</b> <b>CSD</b> and thus, this study motivates further research to re-assess the factors that influence CSD, the theoretical foundation, and the current issues affecting CSD practices in Indonesia...|$|R
