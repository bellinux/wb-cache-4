Ellington's indifference towards vocalists changed with the hiring of Anderson, who was generally considered the best regular vocalist he ever employed.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} a thorough study of sources of randomness/disorder in multi-filament yarns {{that are relevant}} for their performance in textile reinforced concrete. For the analysis of bundles with infinite number of fibers we use a continuous analytical model with refined kinematic hypothesis. In parallel, we apply a more general discrete numerical bundle model covering the cases of finite number of fibers and spatial variations of material properties. The considered distributions of material properties include variations of parameters (local stiffness and strength) both from filament to filament and over the length of each filament. In the present paper, we study the influence of variations in filament properties across the bundle. In the companion paper (Vořechovský, M., Chudoba, R., 2006. Stochastic modeling of multi-filament yarns. II. Random properties over the length and size effect. International Journal of Solids and Structures), the variations of material properties over the length are considered. Both papers {{provide the basis for}} correct interpretation of the data obtained from the tensile test on multi-filament yarn with varied specimen length. As the actual goal of the present work is to derive yarn characteristics relevant for crack bridges in cementitious composites we systematically assess the significance of the studied sources of disorder in the context of extremely <b>short</b> <b>bundle</b> lengths...|$|E
40|$|We {{observed}} the arrays of molecular bundle strands in ribbon shape and their perpendicular arrangement between the bundle strands from the molecules that consist of symmetrical structure of poly(oxyethylene) segmented bisamido acid (POE-amido acid). The molecules enabled to self-assemble into bundle strands of 5 - 10 nm width, 1 - 7 nm height, and 5 - 120 nm length, which further self-arranged into secondary bundle clusters. By varying {{the conditions of}} spin-coating or dip-coating (immersion) on polyethersulfone film surface and drying temperature (26 or 19 degrees C), the morphologies of the bundle clusters were controllable. Lengthy rattan-like strands with multiple "side-armed" <b>short</b> <b>bundle</b> strands were observed from tapping-mode atomic force microscopy. Different arrays of parallel bundle strands in cluster (by spin-coating method) and rattan-like strands with side arms (by dip-coating method) were observed, with the same bundle units of 5 - 10 nm in width but varying in height from 0. 5 to 7 rim. The bundle height of 0. 5 nm obtained by carefully controlled dip-coating into film implies a "self-assembled monolayer (SAM) " formation. The perpendicular bundle side arm arrangement is attributed to the complementary noncovalent bonding forces of POE and -COOH interaction. The presence of a POE crystalline segment (T(m) = 22. 6 degrees C, Delta H = 85. 6 J/g) in the molecules contributed predominately {{to the formation of}} bundles and hierarchical parallel clusters or perpendicular "side arms"...|$|E

40|$|The actin bundles in Drosophila {{bristles}} run {{the length}} of the bristle cell and are accordingly 65 microns (microchaetes) or 400 microns (macrochaetes) in length, depending on the bristle type. Shortly after completion of bristle elongation in pupae, the actin bundles break down as the bristle surface becomes chitinized. The bundles break down in a bizarre way; it is as if each bundle is sawed transversely into pieces that average 3 microns in length. Disassembly of the actin filaments proceeds at the "sawed" surfaces. In all cases, the cuts in adjacent bundles appear in transverse register. From these images, we suspected that each actin bundle is made up of a series of <b>shorter</b> <b>bundles</b> or modules that are attached end-to-end. With fluorescent phalloidin staining and serial thin sections, we show that the modular design is present in nondegenerating bundles. Decoration of the actin filaments in adjacent bundles in the same bristle with subfragment 1 of myosin reveals that the actin filaments in every module have the same polarity. To study how modules form developmentally, we sectioned newly formed and elongating bristles. At the bristle tip are numerous tiny clusters of 6 - 10 filaments. These clusters become connected together more basally to form filament bundles that are poorly organized, initially, but with time become maximally cross-linked. Additional filaments are then added to the periphery of these organized bundle modules. All these observations make us aware of a new mechanism for the formation and elongation of actin filament bundles, one in which <b>short</b> <b>bundles</b> are assembled and attached end-to-end to other <b>short</b> <b>bundles,</b> as are the vertical girders between the floors of a skyscraper...|$|R

40|$|Annular {{bundles of}} microtubules {{supporting}} the discoid shape of blood platelets are temperature-labile. Chilling causes loss of platelet form and complete disappearance of microtubules. In a previous report the author {{demonstrated that the}} microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol caused reassembly of microtubules in chilled platelets. However, the microtubules were dispersed singly or in <b>short</b> <b>bundles</b> throughout the cytoplasm. In the present study the author has used this unusual feature of taxol treatment to prepare platelets with randomly dispersed microtubules and compare their physiology with control platelets containing circumferential bands. Platelets with randomly dispersed tubules responded {{in the same manner}} as control platelets to identical concentrations of aggregating agents. Secretion measured simultaneously with aggregation was also unaffected by dispersal of the coiled tubule making up the annular band into many single elements or <b>short</b> <b>bundles.</b> Examination in the electron microscope revealed that platelets with randomly dispersed tubules developed shape change and internal transformation comparable to those of control cells following stimulation by aggregating agents. However, centrally clustered organelles in cells with dispersed tubular elements were not encircled by a tight ring of microtubules. Instead, the tubular elements were concentrated in masses or bundles between centrally clustered organelles. The results of this study suggest that it does not matter whether microtubules are organized as a single structure, coiled on itself to produce a circumferential band, or as many single tubules or bundles of tubular elements spread throughout the cell. As long as microtubules are present, internal transformation will develop and platelet function, including shape change, internal contraction, secretion and irreversible aggregation, will not be significantly impaired...|$|R

The performance of eight low-Reynolds number two-equation models, including k-ε, k-ω and k-τ formulations, has been assessed against recently published experimental data on upward and downward flow in vertical circular pipes.

In the present study, we exploited known correlations between morphology and physiology in the avian inner ear and brainstem to predict the frequency range of best hearing in the North Island brown kiwi. The mechanosensitive hair bundles of the sensory hair cells in the basilar papilla showed the typical change from tall bundles with few stereovilli to <b>short</b> <b>bundles</b> with many stereovilli along the apical-to-basal tonotopic axis. In contrast to most birds, however, the change was considerably less in the basal half of the epithelium. Dendritic lengths in the brainstem nucleus laminaris also showed the typical change along the tonotopic axis. However, as in the basilar papilla, the change was much less pronounced in the presumed high-frequency regions. Together, these morphological data suggest a fovea-like overrepresentation of a narrow high-frequency band in kiwi. Based on known correlations of hair-cell microanatomy and physiological responses in other birds, a specific prediction for the frequency representation along the basilar papilla of the kiwi was derived. The predicted overrepresentation of approximately 4 - 6 kHz matches potentially salient frequency bands of kiwi vocalisations and may thus be an adaptation to a nocturnal lifestyle in which auditory communication plays a dominant role...|$|R

This analysis has revealed the involvement of both ruffles and microspikes, as well as microtubules in the initiation of focal contact formation. Nascent vinculin sites within the leading edge or at its base, taken as primordial cell-substrate contacts, were invariably colocalized with sites that showed a history of transient, prolonged, or cyclic ruffling activity. Extended microspike structures, often preceded the formation of ruffles. Immunofluorescent labeling indicated that some of these primordial contacts were in close apposition to the ends of microtubules that penetrated into the leading edge. By fluorescence and electron microscopy <b>short</b> <b>bundles</b> of actin filaments found at the base {{of the leading}} edge were identified as presumptive, primordial contacts. It is concluded that ruffles and microspikes, either independently or in combination, initiate and mark the sites for future contact.

We propose that all primordial contacts support traction for leading edge protrusion but that only some persist long enough to nucleate stress fiber assembly.

Here, we show that struc-tural abnormalities in resting 1 -tubu-lin/ platelets include frequent kinks and breaks in the marginal band. Platelets derived from mice lacking the transcrip-tion factor GATA 1 show similar defects, probably as {{a direct consequence of}} ab-sent 1 -tubulin. 1 -tubulin/ platelets have normal ratios of -tubulin isotypes but the marginal band is half the normal thickness, which is sufficient to maintain elliptical cell shape. Thus, a threshold 50 % or less of the normal amount of 1 -tubulin is required to preserve mar-ginal band integrity and cell shape. 1 -tubulin/ platelets have normal size and contents and show no defects in seroto-nin release or aggregation. Accordingly, the apparently isolated spherocytosis al-lows investigation of the role of discoid platelet shape in hemostasis. On agonist stimulation, the disorganized MTs in 1 -tubulin/ platelets fail to condense into central rings and instead are dispersed in <b>short</b> <b>bundles</b> and linear arrays. Neverthe-less, intravital microscopy and flow cham-ber studies demonstrate full functionality of these spherocytic platelets under physiologic shear conditions. Together, these findings highlight the essential re-quirements of the MK/platelet-restricted 1 -tubulin isoform in platelet structure and suggest that spherocytosis does not impair many aspects of platelet function...|$|R
