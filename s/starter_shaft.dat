50|$|The Honda XL175 {{commonly}} {{suffers from}} {{the problem of the}} kick <b>starter</b> <b>shaft</b> breaking. It usually breaks on the shaft protruding from the crankcase on the spline (it is still possible to clutch start them though).|$|E
50|$|Veith {{suffered}} {{bruises and}} abrasions in a practice crash at Daytona International Speedway on March 29, 1959. He was {{saved by the}} roll bar when sliding upside down. The accident {{was caused by the}} <b>starter</b> <b>shaft,</b> which had been left in the car.|$|E
50|$|The {{second day}} of {{qualifying}} was scheduled for Sunday March 29, which was Easter Sunday. Rain prompted officials to cancel qualifying for the day, but the track dried sufficiently in the afternoon to allow for practice runs. Going down the backstretch, Bob Veith lost control from what he {{believed to be a}} wind gust. The car spun and skidded for about 300 yards, then hit and ran up the outside guardrail. The car flipped over, slid 200 yards upside-down, then spun to the grassy infield where it righted itself. Veith suffered shoulder abrasions, and head lacerations, and his helmet was worn from where it scraped along the asphalt pavement. Though not critically injured, Veith would spend the night in the hospital, and his wrecked car was withdrawn. Veith credited the roll bar with saving his life, a new safety requirement introduced by USAC for 1959. It was later determined that a mechanic neglected to remove the <b>starter</b> <b>shaft</b> from the nose of the car. The shaft went against the steering linkage, and made the car uncontrollable, resulting in the crash.|$|E
5000|$|... at 2700 rpm, {{dry weight}} 402 lb. Similar to the TSIO-520-NB {{but with a}} new {{cylinder}} design that uses liquid cooling. The coolant manifold {{is on top of}} the cylinder head, with a coolant pump fitted to the starter adapter, driven by the <b>starter</b> adapter <b>shaft</b> and the oil cooler is mounted on the airframe, not the engine. The engine has an AiResearch TA81 turbocharger.|$|R
25|$|A two-speed, {{two-stage}} supercharger and intercooler {{were used}} to compress then cool the air-fuel mixture, following Griffon and Merlin practice. Starting was by Coffman <b>starter.</b> An auxiliary <b>shaft</b> driven by the lower crankshaft operated the main coolant pump, intercooler coolant pump, pressure and scavenge oil pumps and a fuel injection pump. Piston ring failures and cylinder head sealing problems were experienced during early flight testing.|$|R
40|$|A {{fractured}} Air Turbine <b>Starter</b> (ATS) quill <b>shaft</b> was {{forwarded to}} the laboratory for analysis. The ATS quill shaft was found fractured by torsional overload. It {{appears that the}} rotation of the quill shaft at the driven end was restricted resulting in overload on the shaft. The ATS system may be examined to establish the cause for such restriction. Chemical analysis by EDX showed that the shaft was made of Cr-Mo-V steel and had a hardness of about RC 54...|$|R
40|$|A kick <b>starter</b> <b>shaft</b> {{fabricated}} from SAE 8620 steel reportedly showed rusting on {{the shaft}} face due to exposure to atmosphere. The shaft {{was sent to the}} laboratory for examining the possibility of application of zinc plating on the splines and the face of the shaft to overcome the rust problem. It is suggested to carry out zinc plating followed by a chromate conversion treatment to prevent oxidation of the shaft surface...|$|E
40|$|Emotron is {{a company}} {{specialised}} in developing, producing and marketing equipment to con-trol, monitor and protect processes and machinery driven by electric motors, with an applica-tion focus. Examples of uses for their products are fans, pumps, lifts and cranes. The project {{is to look at}} Emotrons end of line test. The company has seen that at the final test-ing there is a bottleneck that restricts the outflow and prevents {{an increase in the number}} of tested products. The purpose of this project is to review how Emotrons end-of-line test works today and if there is a possibility to make the test more efficient in such a way that the quality is not at risk, while increasing the outflow of tested products. The projects first step is to look at and analyse what is causing the bottleneck at the end-of-line. When the analysis is complete, the next step is to review whether there is a possibility to solve the bottleneck and if so in what way can this be done. Emotrons most overall objective of the project is to increase the outflow of the number of tested products without jeopardizing the quality. An analysis has been made on frequency inverters, soft <b>starters</b> and <b>shaft</b> power monitors. Fail reports for the year 2007 have been reviewed. Faults that have been detected have been sub-mitted by type and size. The testing has been divided into various phases of error. A time pre-cision has been established to show the time of the test stages. The distinction has been made to provide a picture of where and when errors occur during the testing. A logging test has been carried out on the largest frequency inverter types to determine the characteristics of frequency inverters when tested with load by today's test method. It has also carried out a logging test with an artificial load. An analysis is made on a test machine that is under construction, which today is called PEBB test. The conclusions to be drawn from the analyses and tests carried out, in order to meet the company's objectives, and answer the project's problem is that it is possible to make the end of line test more efficient. The end of line test can be more efficient by combining the strength of the PEBB test, which is its measurement equipment, with the artificial load method where the frequency inverter is tested as it is expected to serve at the final customer. This can in-crease the outflow of tested products and maintain Emotrons requirements for quality...|$|R
