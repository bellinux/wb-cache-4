It was a decision a second. It was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> so unwieldy and everybody had a problem all the time, every day, and I was under so much pressure. It was unbelievable. ... I put too many fine details into something {{that was going to}} be seen (indicates tiny figure with his finger and thumb) this big." ...|$|E
500|$|Ironsword: Wizards & Warriors II was {{initially}} reviewed and received positive ratings in the June1989 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly. Steve Harris {{said that the}} game was very large and expansive, noting that it [...] "is <b>so</b> <b>big,</b> <b>and</b> has so much to offer, most of the competition pales by comparison". Ed Semrad called the game [...] "a worthy sequel that fortunately {{is better than the}} original", similarly noting the game's size as well as difficulty. Donn Nauert appreciated the game's good graphics which complement the adventure theme, but he noted that some of the precise movements that are required in various areas may cause some frustration in gameplay. Jim Allee praised all the aspects of the game, saying [...] "if you liked Wizards & Warriors, you'll love Ironsword". All four reviewers lauded the game's involving gameplay and graphics.|$|E
500|$|For the Daenerys {{scene at}} the {{beginning}} of the episode where the three dragons burn part of the Masters' fleet, Sapochnik credited VFX supervisor Joe Bauer and producer Steve Kullback for post-production work: [...] "For this sequence David and Dan said that what they wanted to see was a 'demonstration' of what's to come. So I tried to approach it in the most elegant, epic, big-movie way I could." [...] The director tried to design the shots with relative realism, inspired by footage of World War II Supermarine Spitfires in action. He based the dragon shots on wildlife footage, allowing them to break the frame: [...] "These things should be <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> fast it's hard to keep up with them." [...] To insert Emilia Clarke (as Daenerys Targaryen) into the scene, she rode a [...] "multi-directional, computer-controlled hydraulic gimbal device shaped like the upper shoulders of the dragon"; Clarke was filmed separately in Belfast, Northern Ireland.|$|E

500|$|When first deployed, the AJ-1 was {{too large}} and heavy {{to be used}} by any American {{aircraft}} carrier except for the [...] The modernized [...] carriers with reinforced decks and the very large [...] could also handle the Savage. The aircraft was not popular aboard ship as [...] "it was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> cumbersome that it complicated any other flight operations the ship was required to conduct." [...] One problem was that the wings had to be folded one at a time by a crewman on top of the fuselage with a portable hydraulic pump, a time-consuming process, so that the bomber could be moved out of the way to allow other aircraft to land or take off. One pilot reported that the AJ-1 was [...] "a dream to fly and handled like a fighter", when everything was working properly. The aircraft, however, was not very reliable, possibly because it was rushed into production before all the problems could be ironed out.|$|E
500|$|The team {{hired an}} Indian film crew, {{and spent the}} entire budget in India. Stratum Films in Mumbai helped find {{locations}} and cast extras. Choreographer Devang Desai assembled Indian dancers, and worked with Azalea on a Bollywood dance routine unique to [...] "Bounce" [...] and Azalea's style. With {{the exception of the}} video's celebration scenes, BRTHR filmed in guerilla [...] "run and gun" [...] style, and occasionally paid local police to facilitate a setup. According to Azalea, the Indian elephant in the clip took a month to find, and [...] "the Indian mafia" [...] were needed to shut down a street in Mumbai for the filming of her scene with it. Avinash Shankar was later hired to consult to the filming's cultural and visual issues. BRTHR stated that [...] "Bounce" [...] was the most difficult music video they had ever directed because of the persistent difficulties they encountered with its on-location production and final version-editing. A narrative with a speech introducing Azalea at the wedding was cut from the final version. In an interview for Rap-Up, Azalea stated, [...] "It's just so crazy to dream something <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> actually see it happen".|$|E
500|$|Duncan {{initially}} had difficulties {{adapting to}} the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. Nancy Pomroy, the athletic director of the St. Croix Country Day School was quoted: [...] " [...] was so huge. <b>So</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time." [...] He overcame this to become a standout for the St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play {{attracted the attention of}} several universities, despite having only picked up the game in ninth grade. Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom in particular grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game. Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket. Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation. However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention, and discovered that he was not only athletically talented, but also a quick learner. Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.|$|E

Porter asked Chet Atkins {{to accompany him}} to the ceremony, but Atkins could not attend because of a prior engagement at Carnegie Hall. However, before the honor was conferred at the ceremony, a video was played of Atkins congratulating Porter, saying [...] "you improved the echo sound tremendously and made things sound <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> so full." ...|$|E
2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.|$|E

He said that he had told them: [...] "If you look at the map of South-east Asia, you [...] are <b>so</b> <b>big,</b> <b>and</b> Singapore is just a dot.

[...] He also claimed that [...] "I have corrected [...] many times, but they have never put it [...] And I could not prove it in writing because I was talking freely." ...|$|E

2500|$|Each {{year since}} its founding, the event has grown. [...] During {{the first four}} years, 392 alebrijes were created for the event, with 3,600 people {{participating}} in their creation. The first year saw the participation of over forty alebrijes, with sizes ranging from thirty centimeters to four meters in height. This grew to over eighty in 2008, over 200 in 2010 about that many in 2011.

During its first four years, the parade has over seven million spectators watching live or on television with six million watching in 2011.

2500|$|Complexity. Doubts were {{expressed}} as to workability of FATCA {{due to its}} complexity, and the legislative timetable for implementation was pushed back multiple times. According to U.S. national taxpayer advocate Nina Olsen in regards to FATCA: [...] "This {{is a piece of}} legislation that is <b>so</b> <b>big</b> <b>and</b> so far-reaching, and [...] so many different moving pieces, and is rolling out in an incremental fashion (...) that you really won’t be able to know what its consequences are, intended or otherwise,’ Olson said. [...] "I don’t think we’ll know that for years. And by that point we’ll actually be a little too late to go, [...] "Oops, my bad, we shouldn’t have done this,’ and then try to unwind it." [...] Bloomberg reported in 2015 that the IRS help center is not able to provide adequate taxpayer customer service. In 2016, the Taxpayer Advocate reported that [...] "FATCA implementation has created significant compliance burdens and risk exposures" [...] for overseas Americans, and its [...] "heavy-handed approach, especially when combined with the complexity surrounding IRS requirements, has negative consequences, both for FFIs and the IRS".|$|E
