5|$|The {{reticulate}} whipray preys on {{a variety}} of benthic and neritic organisms, including crabs, <b>shrimps,</b> mantis <b>shrimps,</b> bivalves, gastropods, worms, jellyfish, and bony fishes. In the western Indian Ocean, about two-thirds of its diet consists of fishes, in particular ponyfish and anchovies, with <b>shrimps</b> and other crustaceans making up most of the remainder. By contrast, rays in Australian waters are apparently not piscivorous, and are known to consume penaeid prawns. Known parasites of this species include Anthrobothrium loculatum, Dendromonocotyle colorni, Halysiorhynchus macrocephalus, Monocotyle helicophallus, M. multiparous, and M. spiremae, Thaumatocotyle australensis, and Tylocephalum chiralensis.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} crossback stingaree {{is usually}} {{inactive}} {{and can be found}} partially or completely buried in sand on the sea floor. It is a carnivore and adults forage for crustaceans, polychaete worms and other small invertebrates on the seafloor. Juveniles feed on smaller crustaceans such as isopods, amphipods and <b>shrimps.</b>|$|E
5|$|Malacostracans {{live in a}} {{wide range}} of marine and {{freshwater}} habitats, and three orders have terrestrial members: Amphipoda (Talitridae), Isopoda (Oniscidea, the woodlice) and Decapoda (terrestrial hermit crabs, crabs of the families Ocypodidae, Gecarcinidae, and Grapsidae, and terrestrial crayfish). They are abundant in all marine ecosystems, and most species are scavengers, although some, such as the porcelain crabs, are filter feeders, and some, such as mantis <b>shrimps,</b> are carnivores.|$|E

2500|$|A {{wide variety}} of non-decapod {{crustaceans}} are also {{commonly referred to as}} <b>shrimp.</b> This includes the brine <b>shrimp,</b> clam <b>shrimp,</b> fairy <b>shrimp</b> and tadpole <b>shrimp</b> belonging to the branchiopods, the lophogastridan <b>shrimp,</b> opossum <b>shrimp</b> and skeleton <b>shrimp</b> belonging the Malacostraca; and seed <b>shrimp</b> which are ostracods. Many of these species look quite unlike like the commercial decapod <b>shrimp</b> that are eaten as seafood. For example, skeleton <b>shrimp</b> have short legs and a slender tail like a scorpion tail, fairy <b>shrimp</b> swim upside down with swimming appendages that look like leaves, and the tiny seed <b>shrimp</b> have bivalved carapaces which they can open or close. Krill resemble miniature <b>shrimp,</b> and are sometimes called [...] "krill shrimp".|$|R
5|$|Pigments are {{coloured}} chemicals (such as melanin) {{in animal}} tissues. For example, the Arctic fox has a white coat in winter (containing little pigment), and a brown coat in summer (containing more pigment), {{an example of}} seasonal camouflage (a polyphenism). Many animals, including mammals, birds, and amphibians, are unable to synthesize most of the pigments that colour their fur or feathers, other than the brown or black melanins that give many mammals their earth tones. For example, the bright yellow of an American goldfinch, the startling orange of a juvenile red-spotted newt, the deep red of a cardinal and the pink of a flamingo are all produced by carotenoid pigments synthesized by plants. In {{the case of the}} flamingo, the bird eats pink <b>shrimps,</b> which are themselves unable to synthesize carotenoids. The <b>shrimps</b> derive their body colour from microscopic red algae, which like most plants are able to create their own pigments, including both carotenoids and (green) chlorophyll. Animals that eat green plants do not become green, however, as chlorophyll does not survive digestion.|$|E
5|$|The Eumalocostraca {{contains}} {{the vast majority}} of the approximately 40,000 living species of malacostracans and consists of three superorders, Syncarida, Peracarida and Eucarida. Syncaridans are mostly small and found in freshwater and subterranean habitats. Peracaridans are characterised by having a marsupium in which they brood their young. They are found in marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats and include Amphipoda, Cumacea, Isopoda and Mysida. Eucarida includes lobsters, crabs, <b>shrimps,</b> prawns and krill.|$|E
5|$|The Mysida {{belong to}} the {{superorder}} Peracarida, which means “near to shrimps”. Although in many respects mysids appear similar to some <b>shrimps,</b> the main characteristic separating them from the superorder Eucarida is their lack of free-swimming larvae. The order Mysida is extensive and currently includes approximately 160 genera, containing more than 1000 species.|$|E
50|$|Farfantepenaeus duorarum {{was first}} {{described}} by Martin Burkenroad in 1939, {{under the name}} Penaeus duorarum. It was transferred to Farfantepenaeus when that new genus was erected by Rudolf N. Burukovsky in 1997. The FAO's preferred name for the species is northern pink shrimp; other common names, used in the USA, are pink <b>shrimp,</b> spotted <b>shrimp,</b> pink-spotted <b>shrimp,</b> brown-spotted <b>shrimp,</b> grooved <b>shrimp,</b> green <b>shrimp,</b> pink night <b>shrimp,</b> red <b>shrimp,</b> hopper, skipper, pushed <b>shrimp</b> and bait <b>shrimp.</b>|$|R
50|$|Atya gabonensis is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} <b>shrimp</b> from West Africa and South America.

2500|$|Several {{types of}} <b>shrimp</b> {{are kept in}} home aquaria. Some are purely ornamental, while others are useful in {{controlling}} algae and removing debris. Freshwater <b>shrimp</b> commonly available for aquaria include the Bamboo <b>shrimp,</b> Japanese marsh <b>shrimp</b> (Caridina multidentata, also called [...] "Amano shrimp," [...] as their use in aquaria was pioneered by Takashi Amano), cherry <b>shrimp</b> (Neocaridina heteropoda), and ghost or glass <b>shrimp</b> (Palaemonetes spp.). Popular saltwater <b>shrimp</b> include the cleaner <b>shrimp</b> Lysmata amboinensis, the fire <b>shrimp</b> (Lysmata debelius) and the harlequin <b>shrimp</b> (Hymenocera picta).|$|R
5|$|The diet of {{the nervous}} shark {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes (including silversides, smelt-whitings, wrasses, and grunters). Crustaceans (including prawns, crabs, and mantis <b>shrimps)</b> and molluscs (predominantly cephalopods but also bivalves and gastropods) constitute secondary food sources. This shark is also known to occasionally prey on the semiaquatic snakes Cerberus rynchops and Fordonia leucobalia. A known parasite {{of the nervous}} shark is the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} sea anemone species are {{commensal}} with other organisms. Certain crabs and hermit crabs seek out sea anemones {{and place them}} on their shells for protection, and fish, <b>shrimps</b> and crabs live among the anemone's tentacles, gaining protection by being {{in close proximity to}} the stinging cells. Some amphipods live inside the coelenteron of the sea anemone. Despite their venomous cells, sea anemones are eaten by fish, starfish, worms, sea spiders and molluscs. The sea slug Aeolidia papillosa feeds on the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), accumulating the nematocysts for its own protection.|$|E
5|$|Cleaning {{symbiosis}} {{is known}} from several groups of animals {{both in the}} sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, <b>shrimps</b> and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals. Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning the teeth of American crocodiles (Crocodylus acutus), geckos eating mosquitoes on Aldabra giant tortoises (Geochelone gigantea) and scarlet crabs (Grapsus grapsus), and three species of Galapagos finches removing ticks from marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus).|$|E

5|$|S. ciliata is a benthic {{carnivore}} {{that feeds}} predominantly on polychaetes and various crustaceans. Like {{other species of}} Sillago, the diet of the species {{is related to the}} size and age of the individual, with three distinct size classes identified in a study conducted in Botany Bay, NSW. The smallest fish of 0–10cm take large amount of amphipods and few polychaetes, while fish between 11 and 20cm consume mostly neried polychaetes and few amphipods. The largest fish over 21cm take large amounts of bivalve molluscs and <b>shrimps</b> of the genus Callianassa.|$|E
5|$|The first Burgess Shale fossils {{were found}} on Mount Stephen in Canada's Rocky Mountains by a {{construction}} worker, whose reports of them reached Richard McConnell of the Geological Survey of Canada. McConnell found trilobite beds there in 1886, and some unusual fossils that he reported to his superior. These were misdiagnosed as headless <b>shrimps</b> with unjointed appendages, and were named Anomalocaris because of their unusual appendages– but {{turned out to be}} pieces of a puzzle that took 90years to solve.|$|E
5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, <b>shrimps,</b> squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E

50|$|Crangon franciscorum is {{a species}} of <b>shrimp</b> in the Crangonidae family which is endemic to the {{brackish}} estuaries of California, and found from Puget Sound in the north to San Diego, California in the south. The species is especially abundant in San Francisco Bay, despite population fluctuations due to environmental stresses. Its common names include bay <b>shrimp,</b> sand <b>shrimp,</b> common <b>shrimp,</b> grass <b>shrimp,</b> black <b>shrimp,</b> California <b>shrimp</b> and black tailed <b>shrimp.</b> The species has been commercially fished from 1869 to the present.|$|R
2500|$|They play {{important}} roles in the food chain and are an important food source for larger animals ranging from fish to whales.

5|$|Arnold's Marsh and {{the other}} lagoons nearest the beach are salty due to the {{percolation}} of seawater through the shingle bank. These saline lagoons may cover mud, firm sand or submerged vegetation, and hold some rare and threatened invertebrates including starlet sea anemone, lagoon sand shrimp, Atlantic ditch shrimp, the mysid <b>shrimps</b> Paramysis nouveli and Neomysis integer, lagoon cockle, the bug Orthotylus rubidus and spire snail. Little whirlpool ramshorn snail {{has been found in}} a freshwater channel. Rare beetles associated with these coastal environments include yellow pogonus, Bembidion ephippium and Tachys scutellaris. These marshes are the only reliable UK site for the Pogonus species, and even here it is localised and hard to find.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval {{and juvenile}} fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When large enough these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include <b>shrimps,</b> prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E
5|$|Fishing is the {{principal}} industry in Sisimiut, with harvested stocks of <b>shrimps,</b> salmon, halibut and cod. The Royal Greenland fish processing plant at the port is the largest within Greenland and is amongst the most modern shrimp-shelling factories in the world. In 2008, supplied by 8 boats and the factory trawlers, the plant processed an annual amount of 20,180 tons of shrimp, around 1,680 tons per month. This was roughly constant throughout the year, although when fish catches were larger the fish was frozen. The plant eventually sold around 6,019 tonnes of shrimp. Hunting {{is also important to}} some of the local livelihoods, mainly seals, walrus, beluga whale, narwhale, reindeer and muskoxen.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Shrimp</b> is a {{frequent}} cause of food allergy. Tropomyosin is the major allergen in <b>shrimp,</b> and it shares homology to tropomyosins from other crustaceans, dust mites, cockroach, and parasites. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the value of detection of IgE to <b>shrimp</b> tropomyosin in the diagnosis of <b>shrimp</b> allergy. Methods: We have studied 35 patients with asthma, rhinitis, or both who were sensitized to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. All subjects underwent skin prick testing in addition to double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFC); oral open challenges; or both with <b>shrimp.</b> Measurements of IgE to <b>shrimp</b> and <b>shrimp</b> tropomyosin were carried out by means of CAP and chimeric ELISA, respectively. Results: Oral challenges confirmed the diagnosis of <b>shrimp</b> allergy in 7 patients. IgE measurement to <b>shrimp</b> tropomyosin was positive in 71. 4 % of the patients with <b>shrimp</b> allergy. Of the 28 patients without <b>shrimp</b> allergy, only 7. 1 % (2 / 28) had IgE to <b>shrimp</b> tropomyosin compared with 25 % (7 / 28) who had IgE to <b>shrimp</b> and 35. 7 % (10 / 28) who had positive skin prick test responses to <b>shrimp.</b> Sensitivity was similar for all 3 methods (71. 4 %); in contrast, specificity of IgE to <b>shrimp</b> tropomyosin (92. 8 %) was greater than that of IgE to <b>shrimp</b> (75 %) and skin prick testing (64. 2 %). With regard to diagnostic efficiency, measurement of IgE to <b>shrimp</b> tropomyosin was superior to measurement of IgE to <b>shrimp</b> and skin prick testing (88. 5 %, 74. 2 %, and 65. 7 %, respectively).

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} stingrays inhabiting Indo-Pacific reefs, the bluespotted ribbontail ray generally spends the day hidden alone inside caves or under coral ledges or other debris (including from shipwrecks), often with only its tail showing. At night, small groups assemble and swim onto shallow sandy flats with the rising tide to feed. Unlike many other stingrays, this species seldom buries itself in sand. The bluespotted ribbontail ray excavates sand pits in search of molluscs, polychaete worms, <b>shrimps,</b> crabs, and small benthic bony fishes; when prey is located, it is trapped by {{the body of the}} ray and maneuvered into the mouth with the disc. Other fishes, such as goatfish, frequently follow foraging rays, seeking food missed by the ray.|$|E
5|$|Parasitic {{species are}} mostly {{external}} parasites of fish or crustaceans and feed on blood. The larvae of the Gnathiidae family and adult cymothoidids have {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts and clawed limbs adapted for clinging onto their hosts. In general, isopod parasites have diverse lifestyles and include Cancricepon elegans, found in the gill chambers of crabs; Athelges tenuicaudis, attached to the abdomen of hermit crabs; Crinoniscus equitans living inside the barnacle Balanus perforatus; cyproniscids, living inside ostracods and free-living isopods; bopyrids, living in the gill chambers or on the carapace of <b>shrimps</b> and crabs and causing a characteristic bulge which is even recognisable in some fossil crustaceans; and entoniscidae living inside some species of crab and shrimp. Cymothoa exigua is a parasite of the spotted rose snapper Lutjanus guttatus in the Gulf of California; it causes the tongue of the fish to atrophy and takes its place in what {{is believed to be}} the first instance discovered of a parasite functionally replacing a host structure in animals.|$|E
5|$|The blackmouth {{catshark}} is an active, generalist predator that feeds on both bottom-dwelling and free-swimming organisms. Its diet {{is dominated by}} decapods, krill, bony fishes (including lanternfishes, bristlemouths, dragonfishes, and moras), and cephalopods. The most significant prey species generally reflect what is most available in the environment, for example the <b>shrimps</b> Calocaris macandreae and Pasiphaea multidentata off southern France and the prawns Sergestes arcticus and Sergia robusta off the Iberian Peninsula. Juveniles consume a greater amount and variety of crustaceans than adults, including smaller types such as mysids and hyperiid amphipods. Adults favor relatively large fish prey and {{have been known to}} take other sharks and rays and smaller members of the same species. The importance of cephalopod prey across ages differs between regions. The stomachs of some {{blackmouth catshark}}s have found to contain pieces of animals too large for a single shark to overwhelm, suggesting that it may sometimes attack in groups. Scavenging has been infrequently documented, including of human refuse.|$|E
