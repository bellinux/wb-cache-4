25|$|Sugar cane tolerates hot climates better, but the {{production}} of sugar cane needs approximately {{four times as much}} water as {{the production}} of sugar beet. As a result, some countries that traditionally produced cane sugar (such as Egypt) have built new beet sugar factories since about 2008. <b>Some</b> <b>sugar</b> factories process both sugar cane and sugar beets and extend their processing period in that way.|$|E

25|$|Until the 18th century {{most of the}} {{territory}} {{of what is now}} Santiago de Cali was occupied by haciendas (cattle farms and plantations of food, with <b>some</b> <b>sugar</b> cane), and the city was only a small town near the Cali River. In 1793, Santiago de Cali had 6,548 inhabitants, 1,106 of whom were (African) slaves. The haciendas were the property of the dominant noble class with many slaves dedicated mostly to stockbreeding and raising sugar cane crops. Many of these haciendas became zone of the present city like Cañaveralejo, Chipichape, Pasoancho, Arroyohondo, Cañasgordas, Limonar and Meléndez. Santiago de Cali was strategically positioned for trade, centrally located in relation to the mining regions of Antioquia, Chocó, and Popayán. In the colonial period, the first trail for mules and horses between Santiago de Cali and the port of Buenaventura was completed.|$|E

Reports say that 24,728 homes were destroyed and 192,444 were partially destroyed. [...] Most of the sugarcane fields were flooded, ruining the year's crops. Half of the coffee plants and half of the shade trees that covered these were destroyed; almost all of the coffee harvest was lost. The coffee industry would take years to recover since coffee needs shade trees to grow. The tobacco farms also had great losses. After this hurricane, Puerto Rico never regained its position as a major coffee exporter.|$|E
500|$|There {{were many}} {{instances}} of parties to a case attempting to bribe Hale. When a Duke approached him before a case [...] "to help the judge understand {{a case that}} was to come before him", Hale {{said that he would}} only hear about cases in court. In another case, he was sent venison by a party. After noticing the man's name and verifying that he had indeed sent Hale some venison, Hale refused to let the case proceed until he had paid the man for the food. When Sir John Croke, suspected in engaging in a conspiracy, sent him <b>some</b> <b>sugar</b> loaves to excuse his absence from a case, Hale remarked that [...] "I cannot think that Sir John believes that the King's Justices come into the country to take bribes. Some other person, having a design to put a trick upon him, sent them in his name". Hale returned the loaves, and refused to continue until Croke appeared before him. Hale was noted during this period for giving latitude to those accused of religious impropriety, and through doing so [...] "secured the confidence and affection of all classes of his countrymen". His knowledge of equity was considered as great as his knowledge of the law, and Lord Nottingham, considered the [...] "father of equity", [...] "worshipped Hale as a great master".|$|E

Noteworthy as well is that a secondary structure will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the alpha helix, beta sheet and random coil regions of proteins and the double helix of nucleic acids have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.|$|R

500|$|Producer Jan Harlan {{stated that}} Kubrick [...] "would have applauded" [...] the final film, while Kubrick's widow Christiane also enjoyed A.I. Brian Aldiss admired {{the film as}} well: [...] "I thought what an inventive, intriguing, ingenious, {{involving}} film this was. There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." [...] Of the film's ending, he wondered how {{it might have been}} had Kubrick directed the film: [...] "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding <b>some</b> <b>sugar</b> to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers." [...] Richard Corliss heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, saying that it was [...] "wonderful and maddening." [...] Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his Movie Guide, writing: [...] " [...] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'; [...] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities." [...] However, he calls John Williams' music score [...] "striking". Jonathan Rosenbaum compared A.I. to Solaris (1972), and praised both [...] "Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work." [...] Film critic Armond White, of the New York Press, praised the film noting that [...] "each part of David’s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema’s most thoughtful, speculative artists– Borzage, Ozu, Demy, Tarkovsky." [...] Filmmaker Billy Wilder hailed A.I. as [...] "the most underrated film of the past few years." [...] When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film, he wept during the ending.|$|E
500|$|The {{title is}} a pun on Steven Spielberg's hit war film Saving Private Ryan. Several {{scenes from the}} Army {{training}} contained real-life references; when the recruits are marching, they begin to sing and dance; this is a reference to West Side Story. Additionally, the song playing during the recruitment video bears a close resemblance to the Def Leppard song [...] "Pour <b>Some</b> <b>Sugar</b> On Me". When Peter visits a psychiatrist, the psychiatrist is Dr. Katz. The training {{is similar to that}} in the film Full Metal Jacket, also spoofing the scene when the Sergeant found contraband food. The Sergeant punishes Brian by informing him that he will have to listen to singles from Chris Gaines' album: this entire scene was based on a sketch from Saturday Night Live approximately 10 years ago. Peter references actor Gregory Peck and his [...] "kids" [...] with a cutaway gag featuring four Pecks in a car. Brian shown performing numerous different tasks to complete his army training is a reference to An Officer and a Gentleman, with the music playing in the background from Stripes. The lyrics Lois reads from the Wu-Tang Clan album is from the song [...] "Bring Da Ruckus", the first track from their album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). The scene where Marilyn Manson tells Chris about nutrition is a reference to an episode of Clone High, where Manson leads a musical scene {{about the importance of the}} food pyramid. The sign outside of the building where the Grammys are being held says [...] "Welcome to the Grammys (Not You, Fred Durst)", a reference to the lead singer of Limp Bizkit. Stewie misunderstands the location of their deployment to be [...] "Fraggle Ir-Rock", rather than Iraq, referring to the TV show Fraggle Rock. The scene where Zinedine Zidane headbutts an old lady while delivering her a birthday cake is based on the incident that happened in the 2006 FIFA World Cup final, when Zidane headbutted Marco Materazzi. [...] When Brian is frustrated with the recruits recommending Chris to join the Army, Stewie says that 10% of his high school class is off to fight another battle. After hearing Stewie, Brian says that he was plagiarizing from The Onion, since Brian read about the war in Iraq in The Onion. During the obstacle course, Brian rides a unicycle, solves a Rubik's Cube, plays Perfection, finds Waldo, offers a couple eating a salad at a dinner table some fresh pepper, and consoles a woman who was just dumped by her boyfriend.|$|E
