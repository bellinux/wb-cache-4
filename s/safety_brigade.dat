5000|$|The {{program was}} {{developed}} by Sgt. Don Hanson [...] and Corporal Bill Chisholm of the Calgary Police Department. The pair had organized ‘school patrol’ traffic <b>safety</b> <b>brigades</b> at local schools to help protect children from the increasing vehicle traffic. As a reward for these volunteers they organized a regular Saturday morning musical variety show and movie at Calgary’s Palace Theater. The initial cast of the variety show consisted of pre-teens Sharleen Gibson, Patty Johnson, Cameron Whyte and Will and Charles Wilkinson. [...] In 1960, a local radio station - CFCN (now CKMX) - began broadcasting these morning concerts.|$|R

40|$|A {{working group}} {{was set up}} to define the LHC safety alarm system, also known as Alarm-of-Level- 3 -System (AL 3 S). The mandate asked for {{recommendations}} to be elaborated on four items: the overall concept of the AL 3 S for machine and experiments, the transmission and display of safety alarms, the AL 3 S during civil engineering construction, and the transition from the present LEP to the final LHC safety alarm system. The members of the working group represented a wide range of interest and experience including the CERN Fire <b>Brigade,</b> <b>safety</b> officers from experiments and machines, and specialists for safety and control systems. The recommendations highlight the need for a clear definition of responsibilities and procedures, well-engineered homogeneous systems across CERN, and they point to several important issues outside the mandate of the working group. These recommendations were presented, discussed and accepted by several CERN and LHC committees...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of the speech quality to be {{expected}} from the new digital mobile communication system based upon the Terrestrial Trunked RAdio (TETRA) standard that is currently designed and implemented in the Netherlands for public order and <b>safety</b> (police, fire <b>brigades</b> and ambulances). TETRA is the new digital transmission standard for private mobile radio from the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI). Besides voice transmission TETRA supports also data services and security by encryption of voice, data signaling and user identities. The TETRA standard is based upon a cellular network. The Netherlands is divided in a number of cells based upon received field strength considerations. TETRA contains an Algebraic CodeExcited Linear Prediction (ACELP) algorithm for speech compression and decompression. Of interest is the behavior of this ACELP algorithm together with the forward error protection in case the Bit-Error Rate (BER) is nonzero. The goal of our researc [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} operate the CERN accelerators complex safely, the acquisition, {{transport}} and management of safety alarms is of crucial importance. The French regulatory authority [Direction de Sûreté des Installations Nucléaires de Base (INB) ] defines them as Level 3 alarms; they represent as such a danger for the life and require an immediate intervention of the Fire <b>Brigade.</b> <b>Safety</b> alarms are generated by fire and flammable gas detection systems, electrical emergency stops, and other safety related systems. Level 3 alarms are transmitted for reliability reasons to their operation centre: the CERN Safety Control Room (SCR) using two different media: the hard-wired network and a computer based system. The hard-wired networks are connected to local panels summarizing in 34 security areas the overall CERN geography. The computer based system offers data management facilities such as alarm acquisition, distribution, archiving and information correlation. The Level 3 alarms system is in constant evolution {{in order to achieve}} better reliability and to integrate new safety turn-key systems provided by industry...|$|R
5000|$|The 1st Florida Cavalry troopers {{soon found}} {{themselves}} trading shots with Wilder’s pickets. While Lt. Col. Stockton explained {{to his wife}} that his soldiers [...] "had things pretty much our way," [...] Colonel Troup Maxwell described a different situation in his official report, confessing [...] "after the deployment was effected we became hotly engaged with the enemy’s sharpshooters (under very great disadvantage, as my regiment was armed chiefly with short-range guns of inferior quality.)" [...] Indeed, Wilder’s mounted infantry were armed with the potent seven-shot Spencer Rifle, allowing them to make life uncomfortable for the 1st Florida Cavalry’s skirmishers. This uneven contest continued, according to Colonel Maxwell for nearly two hours, even after one of General Jefferson C. Davis’s artillery batteries unlimbered and began firing at the Floridians. Stockton wrote [...] "a battery opened on us at about 300 yards in a corn field & hurt us badly." [...] The 1st Florida’s troopers fortunately avoided taking many casualties during this sharp engagement, and only when General William Carlin’s brigade of Davis’s division formed and moved across the field toward Trigg’s Brigade, did they break for the <b>safety</b> of their <b>brigade.</b>|$|R
40|$|Firefighters face a {{major threat}} when {{intervening}} in a building during a fire: the possibility of structural collapse during the cooling phase of the fire, or soon thereafter. At present, this threat is amplified {{by the fact that}} the behaviour of structures after the time of peak gas temperature is not well understood, and is not taken into account in the design. This work presents an analysis of the behaviour of different structural members under natural fires, and develops a method for characterizing their sensitivity to fire decay phases. Thermo-mechanical numerical simulations based on the non-linear finite element method are conducted using the parametric fire model of the Eurocode to represent natural fires. The results show that, for all the members (a column, a beam) and materials (reinforced concrete, steel and timber) that are studied here, structural failure during or after the cooling phase of a fire is a possible event. The major factors that promote delayed structural failure are thermal inertia and the constituting material of the member. A method, based on a new indicator, is proposed for quantifying the propensity to delayed failure for structural members under natural fire. This work enhances the understanding of the behaviour of structures under natural fires, and has important implications for the <b>safety</b> of fire <b>brigades</b> and of people responsible for making a building inspection after a fire...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{illness and}} its {{treatment}} remains {{a significant problem}} for the ADF, both in operational and exercise environments. A combined study by James Cook University Defence Science and Technology Organisation and the Army (Army <b>Safety</b> and 3 <b>Brigade)</b> was conducted recently in Townsville to address this. Whilst immersion in an ice/water bath is considered the gold standard, this is prohibitively difficult in the environments above. Cold IV saline is used post cardiac arrest for brain protection but has not been validated for cooling those with heat induced injury. We studied three methods of cooling fit soldiers, exercised in a controlled environment to a core temperature of 40 degrees centigrade. Each soldier was cooled on three separate occasions by (1) infusion of 2 L of Normal Saline over 20 minutes, (2) application of icepacks to groin, armpits and back of neck or (3) skin wetting with a high speed fan. Core temperature was monitored using an ingested radio pill, and vital signs were monitored throughout. All methods were efficacious and safe. Skin wetting with a high speed fan {{appeared to be the}} fastest but was limited by a plateau effect. Ice and IV saline were similar in temperature reduction, but ice was the least preferred technique. This study will aid development of doctrine to treat heat illness in the operational environment...|$|R
40|$|The purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the work of}} passenger locomotive protective devices in the test scenarios of collisions adopted in the Russian requirements to the passive safety system. Methodology. Minimization {{of the effects of}} incident collisions is done by inclusion of the passive safety devices designed to absorb the kinetic energy of collision in the car bodies bearing constructions. To estimate the maximum accelerations of the train, as well as the compressing longitudinal forces arising in the intercar connection during collisions the discrete mass model of the train is used. Interaction of the train cars was simulated by introducing intercar connections. Findings. At collision of a locomotive at 20 km/h speed (both in separate and in standard train), which does not have a passive safety system, with a vehicle of 10 tones weight the plastic deformations in the locomotive structural elements are observed. At collision of a locomotive with a vehicle, which a mass is comparable to the mass of the loaded car, the plastic deformations in the locomotive structural elements occur at the 10 km/h speed of collision. Originality. It is shown that to decrease the maximum longitudinal force occurring between the locomotive and an obstacle like a freight car of 80 tons mass to the standard value it is necessary to equip the end parts of locomotive with safety devices, which deformation is about 1. 5 m. Practical value. To preserve the car structures integrity and passengers, staff and locomotive <b>brigade</b> <b>safety</b> at the incident collisions, a new generation passenger locomotives have to be equipped with the passive safety system devices. On this basis, it is necessary to conduct further researches in the field of passive safety systems for carriages...|$|R
