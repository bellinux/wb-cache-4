40|$|Swi 6 {{associates}} with Swi 4 to activate HO {{and many other}} late G 1 -specific transcripts in budding yeast. Genetic screens for suppressors of SWI 6 mutants have been carried out. A total of 112 of these mutants have been identified and most fall into seven complementation groups. Six of these genes have been cloned and identified and they all encode subunits of the mediator complex. These mutants restore transcription to the HO-lacZ reporter {{in the absence of}} Swi 6 and have variable effects on other Swi 6 target genes. Deletions of other nonessential mediator components have been tested directly for suppression of, or genetic interaction with, <b>swi</b> 6. <b>Mutations</b> in half of the known subunits of mediator show suppression and/or growth defects in combination with swi 6. These phenotypes are highly variable and do not correlate with a specific module of the mediator. Mutations in tail module components sin 4 and pgd 1 showed both growth defects and suppression when combined with swi 6, but a third tail component, gal 11, showed neither. A truncated form of the essential Srb 7 mediator subunit also suppresses <b>swi</b> 6 <b>mutations</b> and shows a defect in recruitment of the tail module components Sin 4, Pgd 1, and Gal 11 to the mediator complex...|$|R
40|$|Transcriptional {{regulation}} in yeast involves {{a number of}} general trans-acting factors affecting chromatin structure. The Swi-Snf complex is required for expression {{of a large number}} of genes and has the ability to remodel chromatin in vitro. The Ssn 6 p-Tup 1 p repressor complex may be involved in chromatin organization through the interaction with pathway-specific DNA-binding proteins. To study the interplay of these factors and their effect on chromatin we have analyzed SUC 2 chromatin structure in wild-type cells and in strains bearing combinations of ssn 6 /tup 1 and <b>swi</b> 1 <b>mutations.</b> We have mapped nucleosome positioning of the repressed gene in wild-type cells using primer extension methodology, allowing base pair resolution, and have analyzed details of chromatin remodeling in the derepressed state. In ssn 6 or tup 1 mutants under repressing conditions the observed changes in SUC 2 chromatin structure may be suppressed by the <b>swi</b> 1 <b>mutation,</b> suggesting that Ssn 6 p-Tup 1 p is not required for the establishment of nucleosome positioning at the SUC 2 promoter. Our data indicate the involvement of chromatin remodeling factors distinct from the Swi-Snf complex in SUC 2 transcriptional regulation and suggest that Swi-Snf may antagonize Ssn 6 p-Tup 1 p by controlling remodeling activity. We also show that a relatively high level of SUC 2 transcription can coexist with positioned nucleosomes...|$|R
40|$|The Swi 5 {{zinc finger}} and the Pho 2 {{homeodomain}} DNA-binding proteins bind cooperatively to the HO promoter. Pho 2 (also known as Bas 2 or Grf 10) activates transcription of diverse genes, acting with multiple distinct DNA-binding proteins. We have performed a genetic screen to identify amino acid residues in Swi 5 {{that are required}} for synergistic transcriptional activation of a reporter construct in vivo. Nine unique amino acid substitutions within a 24 -amino-acid region of Swi 5, upstream of the DNA-binding domain, reduce expression of promoters that require both Swi 5 and Pho 2 for activation. In vitro DNA binding experiments show that the mutant Swi 5 proteins bind DNA normally, but some mutant Swi 5 proteins (resulting from <b>SWI</b> 5 * <b>mutations)</b> show reduced cooperative DNA binding with Pho 2. In vivo experiments show that these <b>SWI</b> 5 * <b>mutations</b> sharply reduce expression of promoters that require both SWI 5 and PHO 2, while expression of promoters that require SWI 5 but are PHO 2 independent is largely unaffected. This suggests that these <b>SWI</b> 5 * <b>mutations</b> do not affect the ability of Swi 5 to bind DNA or activate transcription but specifically affect the region of Swi 5 required for interaction with Pho 2. Two-hybrid experiments show that amino acids 471 to 513 of Swi 5 are necessary and sufficient for interaction with Pho 2 and that the SWI 5 * point mutations cause a severe reduction in this two-hybrid interaction. Analysis of promoter activation by these mutants suggests that this small region of Swi 5 has at least two distinct functions, conferring specificity for activation of the HO promoter and for interaction with Pho 2...|$|R
40|$|The fission yeast pericentromere {{comprises}} repetitive sequence elements packaged into heterchromatin {{marked by}} histone H 3 K 9 methylation and Swi 6 binding. Transient disruption of Swi 6 during S phase allows {{a period of}} RNA synthesis which programs the RNAi machinery to maintain histone methylation. However, Swi 6 is also required for early replication timing. We show that not only Swi 6 but also the chromodomain protein Chp 1 are delocalized during S phase. Different from loss of <b>swi</b> 6, <b>mutations</b> that disrupt histone methylation in the centromere, chp 1 D and clr 4 D, undergo early DNA replication. However, timing is modestly delayed in RNAi mutants dcr 1 D or rdp 1 D, while hrr 1 D mutants resemble swi 6 D in their replication delay. Finally, we show that recruitment of RNA polymerase II in the centromere occurs independently of replication. These different effects indicate that replication timing is not simply linked to histone methylation...|$|R
40|$|Mating-type {{switching}} in fission yeast {{depends on}} an imprint at the mat 1 locus. Previous {{data showed that}} the imprint {{is made in the}} DNA strand replicated as lagging. We now identify this imprint as an RNase-sensitive modification and suggest that it consists of one or two RNA residues incorporated into the mat 1 DNA. Formation of the imprint requires swi 1 - and swi 3 -dependent pausing of the replication fork. Interestingly, swi 1 and <b>swi</b> 3 <b>mutations</b> that abolish pausing do not affect the use of lagging-strand priming site during replication. We show that the pausing of replication and subsequent formation of the imprint occur after the leading-strand replication complex has passed the site of the imprint and after lagging-strand synthesis has initiated at this proximal priming site. We propose a model in which a swi 1 - and swi 3 -dependent signal during lagging-strand synthesis leads to pausing of leading-strand replication and the introduction of the imprint...|$|R
40|$|Heterochromatin in S. pombe is {{associated}} with gene silencing at telomeres, the mating locus and centromeres. The compact heterochromatin structure raises the question how it unpacks and reforms during DNA replication. We show that the essential DNA replication factor Cdc 18 (CDC 6) associates with heterochromatin protein 1 (Swi 6) in vivo and in vitro. Biochemical mapping and mutational analysis of the association domains show that the N-terminus of Cdc 18 interacts with the chromoshadow domain of <b>Swi</b> 6. <b>Mutations</b> in <b>Swi</b> 6 that disrupt this interaction disrupt silencing and delay replication in the centromere. A mutation cdc 18 -I 43 A that reduces Cdc 18 association with Swi 6 has no silencing defect at the centromere, but changes Swi 6 distribution and accelerates the timing of centromere replication. We suggest that fine tuning of Swi 6 association at replication origins is important for negative as well as positive control of replication initiation...|$|R
40|$|The yeast SWI 2 /SNF 2 {{polypeptide}} is a subunit of the SWI/SNF protein {{complex that}} is required for many transcriptional activators to function in a chromatin context. SWI 2 {{is believed to be}} the founding member of a new subfamily of DNA-stimulated ATPases/DNA helicases that includes proteins that function in DNA repair (RAD 5, RAD 16, ERCC 6), recombination (RAD 54), transcription (MOT 1, ISWI, brm, BRG 1, hBRM) and cell cycle control (STH 1). We have created a set of 16 <b>mutations</b> within the <b>SWI</b> 2 ATPase domain and have analyzed the functional consequences of these mutations in vivo. We have identified residues within each of the seven ATPase motifs that are required for SWI 2 function. We have also identified crucial residues that are interspersed between the known ATPase motifs. In contrast, we identify other highly conserved residues that appear to be dispensable for SWI 2 function. We also find that single amino acid changes in ATPase motifs IV and VI lead to a dominant negative phenotype. None of the 12 <b>SWI</b> 2 <b>mutations</b> that disrupt <b>SWI</b> 2 activity in vivo alter the assembly of the SWI/SNF complex. These studies provide an invaluable framework for biochemical analysis of the SWI 2 ATPase and for functional analysis of other SWI 2 family members...|$|R
40|$|The Swi 1 and Swi 3 {{proteins}} {{are required}} for mat 1 imprinting and mating-type switching in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, where they mediate a pause of leading-strand replication {{in response to a}} lagging-strand signal. In addition, Swi 1 has been demonstrated {{to be involved in the}} checkpoint response to stalled replication forks, as was described for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue Tof 1. This study addresses the roles of Swi 1 and Swi 3 during a replication process perturbed by the presence of template bases alkylated by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Both the swi 1 and <b>swi</b> 3 <b>mutations</b> have additive effects on MMS sensitivity and on the MMS-induced damage checkpoint response when combined with chk 1 and cds 1, but they are nonadditive with hsk 1. Cells with swi 1, swi 3, or hsk 1 mutations are also defective in slowing progression through S phase in response to MMS damage. Moreover, swi 1 and swi 3 strains show increased levels of genomic instability even in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. Chromosome fragmentation, increased levels of single-stranded DNA, increased recombination, and instability of replication forks stalled in the presence of hydroxyurea are observed, consistent with the possibility that the replication process is affected in these mutants. In conclusion, Swi 1, Swi 3, and Hsk 1 act in a novel S-phase checkpoint pathway that contributes to replication fork maintenance and to survival of alkylation damage...|$|R
40|$|Replication forks {{are arrested}} at {{specific}} sequences {{to facilitate a}} variety of DNA transactions. Forks also stall at sites of DNA damage, and the regression of stalled forks without rescue can cause genetic instability. Therefore, unraveling the mechanisms of fork arrest and of rescue of stalled forks is of considerable general interest. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, products of two mating-type switching genes, swi 1 and swi 3, participate in fork arrest at the mating-type switch locus. Here, we show that these proteins also act at three termini (Ter) also called replication fork barriers in the spacer regions of rDNA but not at a fourth site, RFP 4, which is nonfunctional when present in a plasmid. Two of the Swi 1 p- and Swi 3 p-dependent sites were also dependent on the transcription terminator Reb 1 p. Furthermore, hydroxyurea-induced replication stress mimicked the effect of swi 1 or <b>swi</b> 3 <b>mutations</b> at these sites. A swi 1 mutant that failed to arrest forks at the mating-type fork barrier RTS 1 was functional at the rDNA Ter sites, suggesting some specificity of action. Both WT and mutant forms of Swi 1 p were physically localized at the Ter sites in vivo. The results {{support the notion that}} Swi 1 p and Swi 3 p act at several different protein–DNA complexes in the rDNA spacer regions to arrest replication but that not all fork barriers required their activity to arrest forks...|$|R
40|$|Expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae CLN 1 and CLN 2 genes is {{cell cycle}} regulated, and the genes may be {{controlled}} by positive feedback. It has been proposed that positive feedback operates via Cln/Cdc 28 activation of the Swi 4 /Swi 6 transcription factor, leading to CLN 1 and CLN 2 transcription due to Swi 4 binding to specific sites (SCBs) in the CLN 1 and CLN 2 promoters. To test this proposal, we have {{examined the effects of}} deletion either of the potential SCBs in the CLN 2 promoter or of the SWI 4 gene on CLN 2 transcriptional control. Deletion of a restriction fragment containing the identified SCBs from the promoter does not prevent cell cycle regulation of CLN 2 expression, although expression is lowered at all cell cycle positions. A promoter containing a 5. 5 -kb plasmid insertion or an independent 2. 5 -kb insertion at the point of deletion of the SCB-containing restriction fragment also exhibits cell cycle regulation, so involvement of unidentified upstream SCBs is unlikely. Neither Swi 4 nor the related Mbp 1 transcription factor is required for cell cycle regulation of the intact CLN 2 promoter. In contrast, Swi 4 (but not Mbp 1) is required for correct cell cycle regulation of the insertion/deletion promoter lacking SCB sites. We have extended previous genetic evidence for involvement of Swi 4 in some aspect of CLN 2 function: a mutant hunt for CLN 2 positive regulatory factors yielded only <b>swi</b> 4 <b>mutations</b> at saturation. <b>Swi</b> 4 may bind to nonconsensus sequences in the CLN 2 promoter (possibly in addition to consensus sites), or it may act indirectly to regulate CLN 2 expression...|$|R
40|$|Evidence has {{recently}} been mounting suggesting {{that a number of}} chromatin components previously thought to primarily or exclusively have structural function, also have a regulatory role in eukaryotic transcription. Notably, in yeast, histone H 4 N-terminal sequence {{has been shown to be}} required for promoter activation of certain genes in vivo, and mutations in histone H 3 (SIN 2) or in SIN 1 (which has some sequence similarity to HMG 1) are able to suppress swi 1, swi 2, and <b>swi</b> 3 <b>mutations,</b> restoring transcription to HO as well as a number of other genes. In this paper we report the identification of a novel protein or protein complex that specifically binds a short sequence in the HO regulatory region on the one hand, and on the other somehow appears to contact the SIN 1 protein. We have shown that the DNA binding activity itself does not contain SIN 1, since extracts from sin 1 delta strains retain the activity. Interestingly, extracts made from cells carrying the dominant sin 1 - 2 point mutation lack the binding activity. Furthermore, bacterially produced sin 1 - 2 protein can dissociate a DNA/protein complex while a similarly produced SIN 1 protein has no effect on the complex at similar concentrations. When the DNA sequence to which the protein complex binds is placed in a CYC 1 promoter lacking a UAS (upstream activating sequence), it can serve as a weak UAS in a SIN 1 dependent way. Our data imply that a sequence specific DNA binding protein(s) may mediate between the SIN 1 protein and the basal transcription apparatus transcribing HO...|$|R
40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf/Swi complex {{has been}} {{previously}} demonstrated to control transcription and chromatin structure of particular genes in vivo and to remodel nucleosomes in vitro. We have performed whole-genome expression analysis, using DNA microarrays, to study mutants deleted for a gene encoding one conserved (Snf 2) or one unconserved (Swi 1) Snf/Swi component. This analysis was performed on cells grown in both rich and minimal media. The microarray results, combined with Northern blot, computational, and genetic analyses, show that snf 2 Δ and <b>swi</b> 1 Δ <b>mutations</b> cause similar effects on mRNA levels, that Snf/Swi controls some genes differently in rich and minimal media, and that Snf/Swi control is exerted {{at the level of}} individual genes rather than over larger chromosomal domains. In addition, this work shows that Snf/Swi controls mRNA levels of MATα-specific genes, likely via controlling transcription of the regulators MATα 1 and MCM 1. Finally, we provide evidence that Snf/Swi acts both as an activator and as a repressor of transcription, and that neither mode of control is an indirect effect of the other...|$|R
40|$|Swi 4 and Swi 6 form {{a complex}} which is {{required}} for Start-dependent activation of HO and for high-level expression of G 1 cyclin genes CLN 1 and CLN 2. To identify other regulators of this pathway, we screened for dominant, recessive, conditional, and allele-specific suppressors of swi 4 mutants. We isolated 16 recessive suppressors that define three genes, SSF 1, SSF 5, and SSF 9 (suppressor of <b>swi</b> four). <b>Mutations</b> in all three genes bypass the requirement for both Swi 4 and Swi 6 for HO transcription and activate transcription from reporter genes lacking upstream activating sequences (UASs). SSF 5 is allelic with SIN 4 (TSF 3), a gene implicated in global repression of transcription and chromatin structure, and SSF 9 {{is likely to be}} a new global repressor of transcription. SSF 1 is allelic with CDC 68 (SPT 16). cdc 68 mutations have been shown to increase expression from defective promoters, while preventing transcription from other intact promoters, including CLN 1 and CLN 2. We find that CDC 68 is a required activator of both SWI 4 and SWI 6, suggesting that CDC 68 's role at the CLN promoters may be indirect. The target of CDC 68 within the SWI 4 promoter is complex in that known activating elements (MluI cell cycle boxes) in the SWI 4 promoter are required for CDC 68 dependence but only within the context of the full-length promoter. This result suggests that there may be both a chromatin structure and a UAS-specific component to Cdc 68 function at SWI 4. We suggest that Cdc 68 functions both in the assembly of repressive complexes that form on many intact promoters in vivo and in the relief of this repression during gene activation...|$|R
40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SWI 4 gene encodes an {{essential}} transcription factor which controls gene expression at the G 1 /S transition {{of the cell}} cycle. SWI 4 transcription itself is cell cycle regulated, and this periodicity is crucial for the normal cell cycle regulation of HO {{and at least two}} of the G 1 cyclins. Since the regulation of SWI 4 is required for normal cell cycle progression, we have characterized cis- and trans-acting regulators of SWI 4 transcription. Deletion analysis of the SWI 4 promoter has defined a 140 -bp region which is absolutely required for transcription and can function as a cell cycle-regulated upstream activating sequence (UAS). The SWI 4 UAS contains three potential MluI cell cycle boxes (MCBs), which are known cell cycle-regulated promoter elements. Deletion of all three MCBs in the SWI 4 UAS decreases the level of SWI 4 mRNA 10 -fold in asynchronous cultures but does not abolish periodicity. These data suggest that MCBs are involved in SWI 4 UAS activity, but at least one other periodically regulated element must be present. Since SWI 6 is known to bind to MCBs and regulate their activity, the role of SWI 6 in SWI 4 expression was analyzed. Although the MCBs cannot account for the full cell cycle regulation of <b>SWI</b> 4, <b>mutations</b> in <b>SWI</b> 6 eliminate the normal periodicity of SWI 4 transcription. This suggests that the novel cell cycle-regulated element within the SWI 4 promoter is also SWI 6 dependent. The constitutive transcription of SWI 4 in SWI 6 mutant cells occurs at an intermediate level, which indicates that SWI 6 is required for the full activation and repression of SWI 4 transcription through the cell cycle. It also suggests that there is another pathway which can activate SWI 4 transcription in the absence of SWI 6. The second activator may also target MCB elements, since SWI 4 transcription drops dramatically when they are deleted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Hormones {{frequently}} guide animal development via {{the induction}} of cascades of gene activities, whose products further amplify an initial hormonal stimulus. In Drosophila {{the transformation of}} the larva into the pupa and the subsequent metamorphosis to the adult stage is triggered by changes in the titer of the steroid hormone 20 -hydroxyecdysone. singed wings (swi) is the only gene known in Drosophila melanogaster for which mutations specifically interrupt the transmission of the regulatory signal from early to late ecdysone inducible genes. Results We have characterized singed wings locus, showing it to correspond to EG: 171 E 4. 2 (CG 3095). swi encodes a predicted 68. 5 -kDa protein that contains N-terminal histidine-rich and threonine-rich domains, a cysteine-rich C-terminal region and two leucine-rich repeats. The SWI protein has a close homolog in D. melanogaster, defining a new family of SWI -like proteins, and is conserved in D. pseudoobscura. A lethal <b>mutation,</b> <b>swi</b> t 476, shows a severe disruption of the ecdysone pathway and is a C>Y substitution in one of the two conserved CysXCys motifs that are common to SWI and the Drosophila Toll- 4 protein. Conclusions It is not entirely clear from the present molecular analysis how the SWI protein may function in the ecdysone induced cascade. Currently all predictions agree in that SWI is very unlikely to be a nuclear protein. Thus it probably exercises its control of "late" ecdysone genes indirectly. Apparently the genetic regulation of ecdysone signaling is much more complex then was previously anticipated. </p...|$|R
40|$|Fission yeast genes {{identified}} in genetic screens are usually cloned by transformation of mutants with plasmid libraries. However, for some genes {{this can be}} difficult, and positional cloning approaches are required. The <b>mutation</b> <b>swi</b> 5 - 39 reduces recombination frequency in homozygous crosses and {{has been used as}} a tool in mapping gene position (Schmidt, 1993). However, strain construction in swi 5 - 39 -based mapping is significantly more laborious than is desirable. Here we describe a set of strains designed to make swi 5 -based mapping more efficient and more powerful. The first improvement is the use of a swi 5 Δ strain marked with kanamycin (G 418) resistance, which greatly facilitates identification of swi 5 mutants. The second improvement, which follows directly from the first, is the introduction of a large number of auxotrophic markers into mapping strains, increasing the likelihood of finding close linkage between a marker and the mutation of interest. We combine these new mapping strains with a rec 12 Δ-based approach for initial mapping of a mutation to an individual chromosome. Together, the two methods allow an approximate determination of map position in only a small number of crosses. We used these to determine that mod 22 - 1, a modifier of microtubule nucleation phenotypes, encodes a truncation allele of Swr 1, a chromatin-remodelling factor involved in nucleosomal deposition of H 2 A. Z histone variant Pht 1. Expression microarray analysis of mod 22 - 1, swr 1 Δ and pht 1 Δ cells suggests that the modifier phenotype of mod 22 - 1 mutants may be due to small changes in expression of one or more genes involved in tubulin function.

The requirement for Spt 10 and Spt 21 for transcription of particular histone genes {{suggested that they}} may interact with two factors previously shown to be present at histone loci, SBF (Swi 4 and Swi 6) and MBF (Mbp 1 and Swi 6). Therefore, we have studied swi 4 Δ, mbp 1 Δ, and swi 6 Δ mutants with respect to histone gene transcription and for interactions with spt 10 Δ and spt 21 Δ. Our results suggest that MBF and SBF play only modest roles in activation of histone gene transcription. In addition, we were {{surprised to find that}} swi 4 Δ, mbp 1 Δ, and <b>swi</b> 6 Δ <b>mutations</b> suppress the spt 21 Δ Spt− phenotype, but not the spt 21 Δ defect in histone gene transcription. In contrast, both swi 4 Δ and mbp 1 Δ cause lethality when combined with spt 10 Δ. To learn more about mutations that can suppress the spt 21 Δ Spt− phenotype, we performed a genetic screen and identified spt 21 Δ suppressors in seven additional genes. Three of these spt 21 Δ suppressors also cause lethality when combined with spt 10 Δ. Analysis of one spt 21 Δ suppressor, reg 1, led to the finding that hyperactivation of Snf 1 kinase, as caused by reg 1 Δ, suppresses the Spt− phenotype of spt 21 Δ. Taken together, these genetic interactions suggest distinct roles for Spt 21 and Spt 10 in vivo that are sensitive to multiple perturbations in transcription networks...|$|R
40|$|Switch (SWI) /Sucrose Nonfermenting (SNF) -type chromatin-remodeling {{complexes}} (CRCs) {{are involved}} in regulation of transcription, DNA replication and repair, and cell cycle. Mutations of conserved subunits of plant CRCs severely impair growth and development; however, {{the underlying causes of}} these phenotypes are largely unknown. Here, we show that inactivation of SWI 3 C, the core component of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) SWI/SNF CRCs, interferes with normal functioning of several plant hormone pathways and alters transcriptional regulation of key genes of gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis. The resulting reduction of GA(4) causes severe inhibition of hypocotyl and root elongation, which can be rescued by exogenous GA treatment. In addition, the <b>swi</b> 3 c <b>mutation</b> inhibits DELLA-dependent transcriptional activation of GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF 1 (GID 1) GA receptor genes. Down-regulation of GID 1 a in parallel with the DELLA repressor gene REPRESSOR OF GA 1 - 3 1 in swi 3 c indicates that lack of SWI 3 C also leads to defects in GA signaling. Together with the recent demonstration of function of SWI/SNF ATPase BRAHMA in the GA pathway, these results reveal a critical role of SWI/SNF CRC in the regulation of GA biosynthesis and signaling. Moreover, we demonstrate that SWI 3 C is capable of in vitro binding to, and shows in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation interaction in cell nuclei with, the DELLA proteins RGA-LIKE 2 and RGA-LIKE 3, which affect transcriptional activation of GID 1 and GA 3 ox (GIBBERELLIN 3 -OXIDASE) genes controlling GA perception and biosynthesis, respectively. Furthermore, we show that SWI 3 C also interacts with the O-GlcNAc (O-linked N-acetylglucosamine) transferase SPINDLY required for proper functioning of DELLAs and acts hypostatically to (SPINDLY) in the GA response pathway. These findings suggest that DELLA-mediated effects in GA signaling as well as their role as a hub in hormonal cross talk may be, at least in part, dependent on their direct physical interaction with complexes responsible for modulation of chromatin structure...|$|R
