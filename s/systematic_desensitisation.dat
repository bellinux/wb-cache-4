40|$|Whole-cell glycine-activated {{currents}} {{were recorded}} from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing wild-type and mutant recombinant homomeric glycine receptors (GlyRs) {{to locate the}} inhibitory binding site for Zn 2 + ions on the human α 1 subunit. Glycine-activated currents were potentiated by low concentrations of Zn 2 + (100 μm) on wild-type α 1 subunit GlyRs. Lowering the external pH from 7. 4 to 5. 4 inhibited the glycine responses in a competitive manner. The inhibition caused by Zn 2 + was abolished leaving an overt potentiating effect at 10 μm Zn 2 + that was exacerbated at 100 μm Zn 2 +. The identification of residues involved {{in the formation of}} the inhibitory binding site was also assessed using diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), which modifies histidines. DEPC (1 mm) abolished Zn 2 +-induced inhibition and also the potentiation of glycine-activated currents by Zn 2 +. The reduction in glycine-induced whole-cell currents in the presence of high (100 μm) concentrations of Zn 2 + did not increase the rate of glycine receptor <b>desensitisation.</b> <b>Systematic</b> mutation of extracellular histidine residues in the GlyR α 1 subunit revealed that mutations H 107 A or H 109 A completely abolished inhibition of glycine-gated currents by Zn 2 +. However, mutation of other external histidines, H 210, H 215 and H 419, failed to prevent inhibition by Zn 2 + of glycine-gated currents. Thus, H 107 and H 109 in the extracellular domain of the human GlyR α 1 subunit are major determinants of the inhibitory Zn 2 + binding site. An examination of Zn 2 + co-ordination in metalloenzymes revealed that the histidine- hydrophobic residue-histidine motif found to be responsible for binding Zn 2 + in the human GlyR α 1 subunit is also shared by some of these enzymes. Further comparison of the structure and location of this motif with a generic model of the GlyR α 1 subunit suggests that H 107 and H 109 participate {{in the formation of the}} inhibitory Zn 2 + binding site at the apex of a β sheet in the N-terminal extracellular domain...|$|R

50|$|The {{behavioural}} {{model to}} abnormality assumes that all maladaptive behaviour is essentially acquired through one's environment. Therefore, psychiatrists practising {{the beliefs of}} this model would be to prioritise changing the behaviour over identifying {{the cause of the}} dysfunctional behaviour. The main solution to psychological illness under this model is aversion therapy, where the stimulus that provokes the dysfunctional behaviour is coupled with a second stimulus, with aims to produce a new reaction to the first stimulus based on the experiences of the second. Also, <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitisation</b> can be used, especially where phobias are involved by using the phobia that currently causes the dysfunctional behaviour and coupling it with a phobia that produces a more intense reaction.

40|$|Introduction: Test anxiety {{has been}} {{regarded}} as a main school problem. The present research compared {{the effect of the}} cognitive therapy (CT) with <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitisation</b> (SD) on reducing test anxiety in high school students. The two main questions of the study were as follows: 1) do the CT and SD reduce test anxiety?, and 2) do these techniques have similar effects on reducing test anxiety or do they reveal significant differences? Material and methods: Sixty students who had higher mean scores on an anxiety questionnaire and without any marked psychological or physical problems were selected from a girls high school as subjects and were divided into three similar groups. The subjects were divided into three matched groups, including two case groups and a control group. The first case group received the cognitive therapy for a period of 12 weeks, while the second one received <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitisation.</b> Results: The results revealed that for both case groups test anxiety mean scores were significantly lower than those for the control group. However, {{no significant differences were found}} between the cognitive and desensitisation techniques. Moreover, the effects of both techniques were stable in the three month follow-up period.

40|$|In 1982, it was {{reported}} that one in every three students who fail at South African universities, do not pass because of experiences of excessive anxiety resulting from university examinations. A survey conducted amongst student counsellors and counselling services on all South African university campuses, revealed a deficiency of group and individual therapy for this phenomenon of examination anxiety. The cause of this deficiency, was found to be the already excessive demands made on the time of student counsellors. Noting a similar situation at Rhodes University, the present investigation was initiated, with the aim of developing an economical group counselling programme for test anxious students on Rhodes campus. Sixty-four Rhodes students (who identified themselves as test anxious) volunteered for this investigation. These Subjects were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four treatment programmes (each divided into two groups, where Group A, N= 6 and Group B, N= 7) and a wait-list control group (N= 12). Three of the treatments featured multicomponent programmes, each offering a cluster of behavioural interventions centred around: Study Skills Training/Counselling; <b>Systematic</b> <b>Desensitisation</b> (Using individually-constructed anxiety hierarchies); <b>Systematic</b> <b>Desensitisation</b> (Using group-constructed anxiety hierarchies). Included in addition, was a single-component treatment, featuring cognitive modification: a component much favoured by local test anxiety counsellors. Given adverse reports concerning the efficacy of single component programmes, when contrasted with multi component treatments, the cognitive modification package was included as a placebo. A battery of measures was used to assess test anxiety and progress made by Subjects to assuage its debilitative effects. The measures included: (a) Six Self-report measures (including a treatment evaluation schedule and the maintenance of a diary of experience by each Subject); (b) Two measures of physiological reactivity, viz. pulse rate and finger sweat print; and (c) One 'observable' measure, that of academic performance. Using these measures, an assessment of the performance gains or losses by each of the Subjects, was made on three occasions: at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 6 -month follow-up. In support of the a priori hypotheses, the <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitisation</b> and study skills multicomponent programmes, realised significant gains on all measures over both the placebo and control groups (with exception of the higher score achieved by placebo subjects over that of the study skills group, on the treatment evaluation schedule). This finding confirmed the superiority of multicomponent programmes over those with only a single component. The <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitisation</b> programmes proved to be the most effective, as measured on self-report and physiological measures. The superiority of group-constructed anxiety hierarchies over those individually-constructed was established. Study skills training helped Subjects to realise and maintain gains on the academic performance measure, although it took many of these subjects six months, before they had fully incorporated the study techniques taught, in with their own study habits. In discussion of the findings, the evident need to match test anxious students to programmes which "best suit" their characteristics, is presented, and solutions proposed. Weaknesses evident in the measuring instruments and research design, are also highlighted for discussion. As part of this experimental investigation, a discussion on the nature of test anxiety and its links with anxiety theory is introduced, together with a review of problems in measuring test anxiety; popular behavioural treatments used to relieve test anxiety; and a survey of test anxiety counselling on South African campuses. Advice for the therapist/counsellor, the academic, and the researcher, are posited in conclusion...|$|E

40|$|Distraction {{techniques}} {{are widely used}} {{in the management of}} children’s pain and hold considerable intuitive appeal. It is important, however, that health professionals do not rely on intuition alone and that clinical practice be guided by research. This paper reviews the evidence from both the experimental and clinical literature evaluating the efficacy of distraction techniques for children’s acute pain management. Consideration is given to why certain distractors or techniques may be more or less beneficial. Areas for further research, as well as clinical considerations are identified. Key words: attention, child, distraction, distress, pain In paediatric healthcare, the primary goal of pain management is to minimise the suffering of the child while facilitating the success of the medical intervention(1). There are many different approaches in the treatment of acute pain from medical procedures in children, including pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods.

40|$|A strong fear of spiders is {{classified}} as a Specific Phobia, Animal Type (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). A number of theories have been suggested as to how this fear develops {{and how it is}} expressed in the physiological realm.

This review outlines a current theory that explores the physiology of RSA and why it does not always respond in concert with heart rate.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 169 - 183. The present {{investigation}} was initiated {{with the aim}} of assessing the efficacy of multicomponent treatment programmes for test-anxiety in student nurses, in order to develop a programme that could be included in the nursing curricula. The subjects were 103 student nurses currently in their first year of the four-year Diploma in Nursing (General, Community and Psychiatry) and Midwifery at Carinus Nursing College CCNC). They had been randomly allocated to four classes at the College. The study compared high-test-anxious, low-test-anxious and mid-test-anxious subjects within these four groups, three of which received multicomponent treatment programmes, while the fourth was the control· group. Programmes comprised <b>Systematic</b> <b>Desensitisation</b> (SD), Progressive Muscle Relaxation Training and Guided Imagery (PMRT & Gl) and Study Skills Training (SST), each of which included a core component of cognitive restructuring. Treatment spanned six weeks. The following self-report questionnaires were used at pre- and post-intervention: The Anxiety Achievement Test <AATl, the Anticipated Anxiety Rating Scale (AARS) and the Subjective Units of Disturbance (SUD). Academic achievement was also measured at both pre- and post-intervention by means of examination scores. Differences between pre and post scores were analysed by means of One- and Two-Way Multivariate Analysis of Variance. The only group to differ significantly from the Control group at post-test was the SD group, showing reductions on the Debilitative scale of the AAT (p < 0. 01), the SUD (p < 0. 01) and the AARS (p < 0. 05). However, this group expressed less satisfaction with the programme than the PMRT & GI group on the Treatment Evaluation Questionnaire. A subsidiary study compared the CNC student nurses (n = 103) with first-year paramedical students from the following disciplines: logopaedics (n = 12); physiotherapy (n = 24); occupational therapy (n = 18); BSc nursing (n = 12); radiography (n = 27), on the Profile of Mood States (POMS), Health Behaviour Assessment Scale (HBAS) and Matric scores. CNC nurses obtained significantly lower Matric scores than the other. students (p < 0. 0001), and showed significant differences on other variables, indicating higher negative mood states and less healthy lifestyles. At one-year follow-up; 33 of the original 103 subjects had failed or resigned: sixteen of whom were high-test-anxious, nine low-test-anxious, eight mid-test-anxious. The drop-out rate was consistent across groups, i. e. treatment had had no long-term effect. Reasons for this are discussed, and the conclusion reached that high levels of test anxiety were realistically felt by student nurses with comparatively low Matric scores when faced with the demands of the four-~ear Diploma course. Such anxiety which at present tends to be dealt with by somewhat self-destructive behaviours could not be easily alleviated by short-term anxiety management programmes. Recommendations are made regarding possible alternative nurse training programmes. There would appear to be good reason to offer a programme with emphasis on clinical skills in addition to the heavily academic four-year Diploma course. A prophylactic stress management programme emphasising healthy lifestyles, and commencing at the start of training, was recommended...|$|E
40|$|LITERATURE REVIEW Specific phobias are {{persistent}} {{fears of}} circumscribed situations {{which lead to}} avoidance of those situations, impairing daily functioning, even though the fears are recognised as unreasonable (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). This literature review looks at the aetiological theories for specific phobias and the corresponding behavioural treatments that arise from these theories. Where possible research conducted into spider phobias will be highlighted. The literature suggests that the behavioural 'exposure' techniques such as <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitisation</b> and flooding, which require participants to remain in fearful situations until distress subsides, provide the most effective treatment outcomes. Exposure treatments can be administered {{in a number of}} different modalities, from invivo to imaginal to virtual reality. Exposure may also be modelled by another to further facilitate treatment efficacy. All of these modalities are based on the same principles, such as conditioning experiences and habituation/ extinction of anxiety responses, which arise from the aetiological theories. A recent trend has been to allow participants to direct their own exposure therapy as an effective, cost saving alternative (Marks, 1985). One method of self-directed exposure has been to follow instructions on self-help style manuals (Marks, 1980). Another modality for self-directed treatment delivery is computers. Initial research into computer-delivered treatments have shown statistically significant treatment efficacy. However this area of research is still relatively new, with interest only being generated from the late 1980 s (Mruk, 1987). One example of computer-delivered treatment currently being validated is the Fearmaster program. This software has been based on the empirically validated techniques of modelling and teaches the principles of exposure therapy. While findings are preliminary, treatment outcomes have been positive enough to encourage future research. EMPIRICAL STUDY This study investigates the treatment efficacy of an interactive computer program, called 'Fearmaster', for the treatment of spider phobia, when administered at two different dosages (three treatment sessions versus six treatment sessions). The Fearinaster (Kirkby, Watson, & Daniels, 1991) is designed to teach the principles of self exposure via symbolic modelling technique by allowing participants to practise treating an 'on-screen' computer person. Thirty participants with spider phobia, meeting DSM-IV criteria for spider phobia and achieving a CIDI-A diagnosis of Specific phobia, were randomly allocated to receive either three or six treatment sessions within three weeks (n= 15 per treatment condition). Phobic symptom severity was measured at pre-treatment, post-treatment (on the same day as the final treatment session) and at one month follow-up assessment by Spider Questionnaire, Fear Questionnaire, Phobic Targets and Work Adjustment Rating Scales, and a live Behavioural Approach Test. The results showed significant symptom reduction for both groups across treatment, where participants were able to engage in approach behaviours with less anxiety. Statistically significant reductions occurred in self ratings of spider phobia symptoms, fear levels, anxiety levels and depression levels. Clinically significant improvements were obtained in depression levels and ability to perform approach behaviours towards the phobic stimulus. Results on the Behavioural Approach Test showed that additional sessions produced a greater treatment effect. A similar trend was observed on self ratings of spider phobia symptoms but did not reach significance. Thus six treatment sessions produced better treatment outcomes than three treatment sessions on behavioural measures. Results indicate further investigation into dosage effects, employing greater participant numbers is warranted...|$|E
40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of cognitive behavioural therapy on people who meet the international diagnostic criteria for CFS, by specifically looking at symptoms and health behaviour. Whereas CFS was originally only studied from a medical perspective, recent years have seen an increased interest from psychologists. Initially the debate centered around whether CFS was a medical or psychiatric illness, but with the development of health psychology as a recognised field of its own, the focus shifted to the investigation of how medical and psychological factors work together to create the symptomatology of CFS. The approach adopted by the research team was that CFS was a biopsychosocial illness and that biological factors such as genetic predisposition, psychological factors such as cognitions and emotions and social factors such as the pressures of families and society work together to establish the health of a person. The study thus set out to gather information regarding all of these aspects in order to add to the current body of knowledge. As previous research efforts had been critisised regarding the validity of the diagnosis of the CFS patients included in their samples, an important challenge that was faced by the researcher was to establish that all the research group participants did meet with the diagnostic criteria. It also had to be ensured that their symptoms could not be accounted for by any other medical illness that was listed as an exclusion criteria for CFS. In order to achieve this patients who had not already had the necessary medical tests done, were requested to do so. The therapeutic intervention was based on cognitive behavioural principles which had been proven to be effective in the treatment of other illnesses that had a biological as well as psychological, aspect to it, for example anxiety, fibromyalgia and chronic pain. The aspects that were addressed had been found by previous researchers to be of great importance in a therapeutic intervention for CFS. These aspects included illness beliefs, information regarding CFS, locus of control and coping mechanisms, avoidance, activity levels, negative and dysfunctional thoughts, social support, lifestyle changes, stress management, sleep, exercise and personality factors. The specific techniques that were included in the intervention were self monitoring, monitoring and modifying of dysfunctional thoughts, goal setting, relaxation and <b>systematic</b> <b>desensitisation.</b> The research group consisted of 37 patients who met the internationally accepted diagnostic criteria for CFS. The control group was a contrast group of comparable size, which included only people who were free from psychological disorders and medical illnesses. The research group participated in a cognitive behavioural intervention, which was designed around the needs of each individual. They therapy was conducted at a community clinic at Rand Afrikaans University between February 1995 and October 1995. Pretests were completed upon commencement of the therapy and the posttests upon termination of the therapy. The control group completed their pre- and posttests at the average interval of the research group pre- and posttests. In order to make a multi-dimensional assessment of the impact of the cognitive behavioural intervention on CFS, various instruments were ulitised. The first instrument was a biographical questionnaire, which recorded the name, sex, age, income group, highest formal qualification, type of work, etcetera. The second questionnaire was an adapted version of the Support and Service Utilisation Schedule, which was employed to control for the other medical and therapeutic interventions that patients participated in, for example the medication taken, alternative medical practitioners visited and sources of support. The participants were asked to maintain their use of these services that they had been using for a long period and to not embark on any new therapies and treatments while they were partaking in the cognitive behavioural intervention...|$|E
