Spotnitz was particularly impressed with Miles's autopsy scene, calling it [...] "something new to do [...] late stage of the game". Since human bodies which have decomposed in water become grotesquely deformed, Miles's body was [...] "a toned-down version of what the reality would be." [...] To create the scene, plaster bandages were {{used to create a}} cast of the front and back of Ansley's body; these, in turn, were used to create a fiberglass cast. This was sculpted over with water clay to create the appearance of a bloated body. Afterwards, a mold of the clay was made and a body suit created with latex. As the project proceeded, Mungle sent photos to Carter, who gave final approval. In Miles's shower scene, a mix of [...] "red goo", which included <b>strawberry</b> <b>jam,</b> was placed on Ansley's skin.

Mungle later noted that after being told what the scene would entail he asked, [...] "if we can figure something out, could we show it on TV?"

40|$|Seven cultivars of {{strawberry}} (Diamante, Elsanta, Honeoye, Madeleine, Marmolada, Miranda and Miss) {{were analyzed}} for total phenols (TP), total flavonoids (TF), total nonfl avonoids (TN), total anthocyanins (TA) and antioxidant capacity (AC) {{before and after}} low sugar jam production to evaluate their changes after thermal processing. The content of TP, TF and TN were determined according to the Folin-Ciocalteu assay. Anthocyanins were determined by spectral method based on the bisulfite bleaching of monomeric anthocyanins. The antioxidant capacity was evaluated by, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazil radical (DPPH). Fresh fruits had total phenolics ranging from 251. 97 to 713. 06 mg gallic acid equivalent GAE/g of dry weight. In all investigated samples, fresh <b>strawberries</b> and <b>jams,</b> nonflavonoids were predominant phenols. Cultivar Honeoye had the highest amounts, while cultivar Miss had the lowest amounts of TP and TN. Cultivar Miranda had TF in the highest concentrations, while the lowest concentrations were found in cultivar Marmolada. TA for investigated cultivars was 63. 55 - 177. 71 mg Cy- 3 -G/ 100 d. w. with strong differences among cultivars. On the basis of dry weight the processing and heating during jam making generally decreased the contents of TP for 37 - 70 %. During processing, cultivar Madeleine showed the greatest stability of TP, TN and TF, while cultivar Elsanta showed the greatest anthocyanins stability. In comparison with fresh strawberry fruit, whose antioxidant capacity were {{in the range of}} 0. 23 mmol TE/kg f. w. to 0. 67 mmol TE/kg f. w., the jams also represent a noticeable source of antioxidant compounds, even considering the lower content of phenolic compounds, with the antioxidant capacity of 0. 20 mmol TE/kg f. w. to 0. 62 mmol TE/kg f. w. Hence, the obtained results showed that besides fresh strawberry fruit, the <b>strawberry</b> <b>jams</b> also possess noticeable content of important bioactive compounds with considerable antioxidant capacity...|$|R

40|$|Bernard, John C. Organic {{food has}} {{witnessed}} rapid growth {{for more than}} two decades, while local food has gained popularity in recent years. This thesis was dedicated to investigate the motivations behind the intention and purchasing behavior of organic and local foods consumers employing an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model. Additionally, a Food Fashion Involvement (FFI) scale was developed to assist in explaining intention and WTP for trendy food. Eleven experimental sessions were conducted in Newark, Delaware using a sample of 128 subjects recruited from the surrounding region. Each session included several rounds of experimental auctions and questionnaires. Sweet corn and <b>strawberry</b> <b>jams</b> were chosen as experimental products respectively representing fresh and processed categories. Generally, participants exhibited the highest WTP for organic, followed by local food. For the analysis, two methods were adapted, factor analysis and tobit regression. Factor analysis was conducted on outcome beliefs and evaluation items. Latent factors were identified for consumers’ perception of organic and local. Tobit regression models were constructed using intention and WTP as the dependent variables and social demographics, the FFI scale and the TPB items as independent variables. Results of the tobit regression suggested FFI scale to be a constructive predictor of intention and WTP, especially for fresh produce. Variables of the TPB demonstrated different significance across eight models, and General Attitude and Perceived Availability were found to have the most explanation power. In order to add more dimension to the study, models were compared from three angles, including intention versus WTP, organic versus local and fresh versus processed. Results implied that a high intention did not necessarily lead to a high WTP, vice versa. Additionally, the TPB model could predict organic purchasing intentions better than the local version. Models for fresh products also demonstrated more significance than the processed ones. University of Delaware, Department of Agricultural and Resource EconomicsM. S...|$|R

40|$|Different {{chemical}} {{components and}} their locations in strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) achenes, vascular bundles and cortical cell walls were studied {{by means of}} bright-field microscopy using different staining systems and by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microscopy. The structural changes in pretreated strawberry tissues during freezing and thawing were studied by means of physical and chemical analyses {{as well as by}} bright-field and FT-IR microscopy, and by confocal laser scanning (CLS) microscopy. In addition, traditional jams made from pretreated frozen strawberries were investigated by means of physical and chemical analyses and by sensory evaluation. Basic microstructural studies showed that all the cell walls were complex and consisted of several components. Lignin was an important component of achenes and vascular tissues, whereas the cortical cell walls contained mainly cellulose, pectin and some protein. Cellulose and pectin were also detectable in the intercellular spaces of cortex, in the vascular tissue and pith. Protein was deposited inside the cortical cells, {{as well as in the}} vascular tissue and pith. The microscopical methods used gave comparable results. According to microscopical studies both the pretreatments with calcium chloride (CaCl 2) and crystallised sucrose as well with CaCl 2 and pectin methyesterase (PME) in a vacuum affected the microstructure of strawberry tissues. These pretreatments especially affected pectin, protein, lignin and structural carbohydrates in the vascular tissue and cortex compared to the untreated reference samples. The use of a vacuum appeared to make the pretreatment solutions absorb more efficiently to the cortex and pith, thus improving the stabilisation particularly of pectin and structural carbohydrates. Firmness of thawed and particularly of <b>jam</b> <b>strawberries</b> pretreated with CaCl 2 and PME in a vacuum was higher than that of other pretreated or untreated berries. In all the prefreezing treatments studied, dipping of strawberries into a CaCl 2 solution with PME in a vacuum resulted in a significantly different sensory profile than was found in the other jams. The sensory attributes wholeness of the berries (p< 0. 001), firmness, clarity and evenness of the jam medium (p< 0. 001), softness of the berries (p< 0. 001) and faultlessness of odour and flavour (p< 0. 001) in particular were statistically significantly different among the <b>strawberry</b> <b>jams.</b> Sensory quality was perceived to decrease during 4  months of storage, even though the shapes of the sensory profiles of the studied jams did not change significantly from those evaluated after 2  weeks storage. For achieving high quality jams the pretreatment time should be short (about 5 - 15  min), the temperature low (below 20  °C), the vacuum level high (pressure less than 10  kPa), the CaCl 2 concentration moderate (about 1 %) and the dosage of PME comparatively low (about 50 - 100  μkat/kg strawberries). reviewe...|$|R
