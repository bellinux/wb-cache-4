25|$|Multiple {{mechanical}} problems appeared {{during the}} sea trials. Many of the problems encountered in Collins were quickly repaired, and did not occur again or in the other five submarines. Recurring issues were usually associated with diesel engines, propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>seals,</b> periscopes and masts, hydraulic couplings, and the combat system. At the same time, many of the systems worked with few or no problems, with the submarine meeting or exceeding design specifications for maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and submerged endurance, particularly at low speeds. The ship control system, which had been a major concern during development of the class, functioned beyond positive expectation. The submarine's autopilot (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') {{was found to be}} better at depth keeping during snorting than many of the operators.|$|E
500|$|Propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>seals</b> were a {{significant}} problem on Collins and Farncomb. Although designed {{to allow for a}} leak of [...] per hour, during trials {{it was found that the}} seals would regularly misalign and allow hundreds of litres per hour into the boat—during one deep diving test the flow rate was measured at approximately [...] a minute. ASC claimed that solving these problems could be done by manually adjusting the seals as the submarine dived and rose, but this would have required a sailor dedicated solely to that task, affecting efforts to minimise the required number of personnel. It was found that the problem could be temporarily alleviated by running the propeller in reverse for 100revolutions, pulling the seal back into alignment, although a permanent solution could initially not be found, as ASC refused to accept responsibility for the problem, and the original manufacturer of the seals had closed down. New suppliers were found, with modified seals fitted to the first two submarines in late 1996, before completely re-designed seals were fitted to the boats in late 1997, solving the problem.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{capture and}} storage is an {{innovator}} approach to fight climate changes through {{the reduction of}} greenhouse gas emissions. Abandoned coal mines are currently less studied than other reservoirs but {{could also be used}} for the storage of carbon dioxide. However the problem of <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> appears to be central as far as the safety, economic, ecologic and health stakes of geological storage are concerned. The purpose of the present work is the study of <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> in the framework of CO 2 storage projects. More precisely the problem consists in the numerical study, with the LAGAMINE finite elements code, of gas transfers around a <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> system. A coupled hydro-mechanical model of unsaturated geomaterials is presented. The response of the flow model is first studied through a simple synthetic problem simulating the injection of gas in a concrete-made column. It stands out of this first modeling that the advection of the gas phase represents the main transfer mechanism of CO 2 in highly unsaturated materials. Furthermore the setting of a bentonite barrier seal allows limiting considerably gas influx to the biosphere. A 2 D axisymetric hydromechanical modeling of the Anderlues natural gas storage site is then performed. The design of the <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> system appears to be a determinant element to evaluate the risks of CO 2 leakage...|$|R
40|$|The fleet is {{plagued with}} leaking lube oil pumps due to {{mechanical}} <b>shaft</b> <b>seal</b> failures. Correction programs {{have resulted in}} improved <b>shaft</b> <b>sealing</b> techniques however, there {{continues to be a}} leakage problem on most classes of ships. The ultimate solution is to eliminate the mechanical <b>shaft</b> <b>seal.</b> This has been proven to be a very successful solution and has additional benefits of eliminating the motor to pump coupling, which further reduces maintenance. The newly developed Canned Lube Oil Pump is the solution. It combines the proven screw pump design with the proven Oil-Through motor design. The resulting compact pumping unit is substantially smaller and lighter than the legacy unit. The motor is cooled by a portion of the oil, that is being pumped to the system. This eliminates the motor cooling fan and eliminates grease packed motor bearings, further reducing maintenance. A comprehensive factory and shipboard testing program has demonstrated that this new unit will eliminate oil leaking from lube oil pumps, thus will reduce shipboard maintenance substantially...|$|R
