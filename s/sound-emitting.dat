Ultrasonic scarers are not harmful to birds, however, there is debate around birds' ability to hear these frequencies at loud enough decibels.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{efficient}} video coding method which utilizes audio-visual information, {{based on the}} observation that <b>sound-emitting</b> regions in a video sequence attract observer’s attention. The regions responsible for the sound are identified by an audio-visual source localization algorithm. Then, the result is used for encoding different regions in the scene with different quality {{in such a way}} that a region far from the sound source is coded with a lesser quality than the <b>sound-emitting</b> regions. This is implemented by assigning different quantization parameter values for different regions in H. 264 /AVC. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. I...|$|E

Copper nanoparticles were grown by photo-assisted electroless deposition on crystalline silicon and nanostructured porous silicon (nanoPS).

The experimental results show a remarkable {{increase in the}} photo-acoustic intensity when copper nanoparticles are incorporated to the porous structure. The results thus suggest that the Cu/nanoPS hybrid systems are suitable candidates for several applications {{in the field of}} thermoplasmonics, including the development of <b>sound-emitting</b> devices of great efficiency.|$|E

40|$|From birth, infants detect {{associations}} between {{the locations of}} static visual objects and sounds they emit, but there is limited evidence regarding their sensitivity to the dynamic equivalent when a <b>sound-emitting</b> object moves. In 4 experiments involving thirty-six 2 -month-olds, forty-eight 5 -month-olds, and forty-eight 8 -month-olds, we investigated infants' ability to process this form of spatial colocation. Whereas {{there was no evidence}} of spontaneous sensitivity, all age groups detected a dynamic colocation during habituation and looked longer at test trials in which sound and sight were dislocated. Only 2 -month-olds showed clear sensitivity to the dislocation relation, although 8 -month-olds did so following additional habituation. These results are discussed relative to the intersensory redundancy hypothesis and work suggesting increasing specificity in processing with age...|$|E
30|$|In the {{particular}} case of <b>sound-emitting</b> devices, nanoPS {{has been demonstrated}} as a versatile material to fabricate efficient devices [5]. Since its optical and thermal properties can be easily tuned by changing its porosity, nanoPS offers great versatility aiming at adjusting its photo-acoustic response [6]. In addition, devices based on this material have been proposed as sound transmitters [7] or even to obtain three-dimensional images [8]. Furthermore, the photo-acoustic emission from noble metal nanoparticles is a property which can be exploited for different applications in several fields such as biomedicine [9], energy [10], microfluids [11], sound emitters [12], etc., since {{they are able to}} act as localized heat sources. This effect is based on the plasmon resonance of noble metal nanoparticles and can be optimized by adjusting their size and shape or by combining them with dielectric materials [13].|$|E
40|$|When human {{subjects}} assess {{the quality of}} multimedia data, high level perceptual processes such as Focus of Attention (FoA) and eye movements are believed {{to play an important}} role in such tasks. While prior art reports incorporation of visual FoA into objective quality metrics, audio-visual FoA has been rarely addressed and utilized in spite of the importance and presence of both audio and video information in many multimedia systems. This paper explores the influence of audio-visual FoA in the perceived quality of standard definition audio-visual sequences. Results of a subjective quality assessment study are reported, where it is shown that the sound source attracts visual attention and thereby the visual degradation in the regions far from the source is less perceived when compared to <b>sound-emitting</b> regions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of neonatal screening in lowering age at {{diagnosis and treatment}} in congenital hearing loss should not mask the limitations {{due to the fact}} that hearing loss often appears or is detected after birth. Early diagnosis of secondary or progressive postnatal hearing loss is nevertheless necessary and justifies systematic screening of hearing disorder in all children seen in consultation, for whatever reason. Screening bilateral hearing loss in under- 2 year-olds in a community context is feasible, using simple means: parent interview, clinical observation, and acoumetry using the voice and <b>sound-emitting</b> toys. In case of abnormality detected or suspected on screening, children of whatever age should be referred to an ENT specialist for complete audiometric assessment. Behavioural audiometry is feasible in very young children, and indispensable to diagnosis. The parents will only be reassured after specialized hearing examinations have been performed...|$|E
40|$|In {{interaction}} and interface design, {{the representation of}} continuous processes often uses liquid metaphors, such as dripping or streaming. When an auditory display of such processes is required, an approach to sound-synthesis based on the physics of liquids in motion {{would be the most}} convincing, especially when real-time interaction is into play. In order to bridge the complexity of fluid-dynamic simulations with the needs of interactive sonification, we propose a multi-rate sound synthesis of liquid phenomena. Low-rate smoothed-particle hydrodynamics is used to model liquids in motion and to trigger <b>sound-emitting</b> events. Such events, such as solid-liquid collision, or bubble formation, are synthesized at audio rate. The proposed method is applied to the two important cases of liquid falling into a vessel, and of solid object falling into a liquid. Some example applications in interaction design are presented. © 2011 OpenInterface Association...|$|E
40|$|Cervids readily {{adapt to}} {{suitable}} human-altered landscapes {{and can cause}} several types of damage, including economic loss associated with landscape and agricultural plantings, human health and safety concerns, and adverse impacts on natural habitats. The need for effective, practical, and nonlethal tools to manage damage caused by elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) has been heightened by the growing prevalence of locally overabundant populations and public demand for nonlethal wildlife management methods. Various frightening devices are available commercially, but most have not been subjectively evaluated. We used consumption measurements to evaluate the efficacy of a specific motion-activated light- and <b>sound-emitting</b> frightening device for urban mule deer and elk. The devices proved ineffective; deer and elk ignored them. As the demand for frightening devices to reduce deer and elk damage increases, {{it is important that}} research be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of new devices so that users know what level of efficacy to expect...|$|E
40|$|In the oceanic context, {{the aim of}} Target Motion Analysis (TMA) is to {{estimate}} the state, i. e. location, bearing and velocity, of a <b>sound-emitting</b> object. These estimates {{are based on a}} series of passive measures of both the angle and the distance between an observer and the source of sound, which is called the target. These measurements are corrupted by noise and false readings, which are perceived as outliers. Usually, sequences of measurements are taken and statistical methods, like the Least Squares method or the Annealing M-Estimator, are applied {{to estimate}} the target's state by minimising the residual in range and bearing for a series of measurements. In this project, an ACO-Estimator, a novel hybrid optimisation algorithm based on Computational Intelligence, has been developed and applied to the TMA problem and its effectiveness was compared with standard estimators. It was shown that the new algorithm outperforms conventional estimators by successfully removing outliers from the measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of animal endangered species requires {{detailed information on}} their distribution and abundance, which is often hard to obtain. When ani-mals communicate using sounds, one option is to use automatic sound recor-ders to gather information on the species {{for long periods of}} time with low effort. One drawback of this method is that processing all the information man-ually requires large amounts of time and effort. Our objective was to create a relatively “user-friendly ” (i. e., that does not require big programming skills) automatic detection algorithm to improve our ability to get basic data from <b>sound-emitting</b> animal species. We illustrate our algorithm by showing two possible applications with the Hawai’i ‘Amakihi, Hemignathus virens virens, a forest bird from the island of Hawai’i. We first characterized the ‘Amakihi song using recordings from areas where the species is present in high densities. We used this information to train a classification algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), in order to identify ‘Amakihi songs from a series of potentia...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, the Doppler {{effect for}} sound is {{introduced}} {{in high school}} and college physics courses. Students calculate the per-ceived frequency for several scenarios relating a stationary or moving observer and a stationary or moving sound source. These calculations assume a constant velocity of the observer and/or source. Although seldom discussed in this context, general-ization of the Doppler effect for accelerated sound sources is relatively straightforward and can be used as an enriching tool in the classroom. The purpose of this paper is to describe a simple experiment to deter-mine the acceleration of gravity (g) from an acoustic source in free fall. The Doppler effect is usually applied to scenarios where the relative velocity between a sound-emit-ting object and an observer is nonzero or when the perceived and real sound frequencies are known and a specific speed is unknown. 1 Sometimes a combined equation can be used in which the user changes posi-tive and negative signs depending on the relative mo-tions of the <b>sound-emitting</b> object and the observer.

40|$|Toothed whales use intense {{ultrasonic}} clicks to echolocate prey and it {{has been}} hypothesized that they also acoustically debilitate their prey with these intense sound pulses to facilitate capture. Cephalopods are an important food source for toothed whales, and there has probably been an evolutionary selection pressure on cephalopods to develop a mechanism for detecting and evading <b>sound-emitting</b> toothed whale predators. Ultrasonic detection has evolved in some insects to avoid echolocating bats, and it can be hypothesized that cephalopods might have evolved similar ultrasound detection as an anti-predation measure. We test this hypothesis in the squid Loligo pealeii in a playback experiment using intense echolocation clicks from two squid-eating toothed whale species. Twelve squid were exposed to clicks at two repetition rates (16 and 125 clicks per second) with received sound pressure levels of 199 – 226  dB re  1  μPa (pp) mimicking the sound exposure from an echolocating toothed whale as it approaches and captures prey. We demonstrate that intense ultrasonic clicks do not elicit any detectable anti-predator behaviour in L. pealeii and that clicks with received levels up to 226  dB re  1  μPa (pp) do not acoustically debilitate this cephalopod species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a foveated coding method using audio-visual {{focus of attention}} and its evaluation through extensive subjective experiments on both standard-definition and high-definition sequences. Regarding a <b>sound-emitting</b> region as the location drawing the human attention, the method applies varying quality levels in an image frame according to the distance of a pixel to the identified sound source. Two experiments are presented to prove {{the efficiency of the}} method. Experiment 1 examines the validity and effectiveness of the method in comparison to the constant quality coding for high-quality conditions. In Experiment 2, the method is compared to the fixed bit rate coding for low quality conditions where coding artifacts are noticeable. The results demonstrate that the foveated coding method provides considerable coding gain without significant quality degradation, but uneven distributions of the coding artifacts (blockiness) by the method are often less preferred than the uniform distribution of the artifacts. Additional interesting findings are also discussed, such as content dependence of the performance of the method, the memory effect in multiple viewings, and the difference in the quality perception for frame size variations.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that human {{listeners}} can echolocate a sound-reflecting sur-face as they walk toward it. There is also evidence that stationary listeners can deter-mine the location, shape, and material of nearby surfaces from reflected sound. This research tested whether there is an advantage of listener movement for echolocating as has been found for localization of emitted sounds. Blindfolded participants were asked to echolocate a 3 × 6 ft wall while either moving or remaining stationary. After echolocating, the wall was removed, and participants were asked to walk to where the wall had been. Results showed that participants were somewhat more accurate with moving than stationary echolocation for some distances. A follow-up experiment confirmed that this moving advantage was not a function of a specific type of training or the multiple stationary positions available during moving echolocation. This subtle moving advantage might be a function of echoic time-to-arrival information. Auditory information supports a blind individual’s ability to navigate through the world. Information is provided by <b>sound-emitting</b> objects and events as well as from environmental surfaces that reflect sound. It {{has long been}} known that blind indi-viduals can use reflected sound to avoid upcoming obstacles. This echolocation abil-ity is similar to that performed by bats, dolphins, and birds (e. g., McFarland, 1987; Simmons, 1993). In a series of classic experiments, Cotzin, Dallenbach, and their colleagues (Cotzin & Dallenbach, 1950; Supa, Cotzin, & Dallenbach, 1944) dem-onstrated that both blind and (sighted) blindfolded human listeners can walk down a hallway and stop just before contacting a large board. These researchers deter-mined that this ability to control approach was based on the reflected sound mad...|$|E
40|$|Low-pressure gas {{measurements}} are of increasing {{interest in the}} process industry for both control purposes and emission measurements. Industrial measurement environments include some very challenging components, such as:- Dust, particles, vapor, water droplets, etc. - Temperatures up to 1200 °C- Pipe diameters of 1 to 10 mUltrasound flow measurement techniques have many advantages for such industrial measurement problems. Currently, a major problem {{is the lack of}} transducer technology that is sufficiently robust to operate {{in the presence of the}} above given industrial components. For the purpose of producing more robust technology, a gap discharge sound transmitter has been developed [1, 2]. Theoretical and experimental studies of the gap discharge transmitter indicate that flow measurement performances in the range of 1 - 2 % of the actual flow is achievable [3]. Based on this gap discharge transmitter, an experimental ultrasound gas flowmeter was designed. The design features a gap discharge transmitter and piezo-based receivers. The design was tested in a real industrial environment. The test environment included heavy dust and water vapor in an exhaust pipe at a pelletization plant at LKAB, Kiruna, Sweden. The pipe diameter is 3 m, the pressure is ambient, and the gas flow speed is in the range of 5 - 20 m/s. The flow conditions were highly turbulent, using a straight pipe length ten times the pipe diameter in front of the experimental flowmeter. This paper presents the experimental gap discharge ultrasonic flowmeter design, the experimental setup and some measurement data. These data indicate that the gap discharge transmitter is feasible for operation in an industrial environment. Further preliminary flow measurement data demonstrate the feasibility of using a gap discharge transmitter as the <b>sound-emitting</b> source in an ultrasonic gas flowmeter.
