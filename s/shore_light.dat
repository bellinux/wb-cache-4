The rail line was built, owned, and {{operated}} by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which used the line for passenger service until March 31, 1953. It then became a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad freight line until the 1980s, when freight service was stopped. There have been proposals to revive the abandoned North Shore Branch of the Staten Island Railway for passenger service as a rail line or for use as Bus Rapid Transit. There is also a proposal to build a West <b>Shore</b> <b>Light</b> Rail {{in the center of the}} Dr. Martin Luther King Expressway, Staten Island Expressway, and West Shore Expressway, continuing to Richmond Valley, Staten Island to connect with the main line of the Staten Island Railway. The South Beach Branch, which transported summer vacationers to South Beach, Staten Island, also ceased service on March 31, 1953.|$|E

The US Army Corps of Engineers made various arrangements of shore lighting {{in the vicinity of}} Jacksonville Beach, Florida. These lights varied in intensity and were measured aboard the cutter from seaward by civilian experts using photometers to determine the amount of light constituting a hazard to a merchant vessel passing between a submarine and a <b>shore</b> <b>light.</b> On one occasion the visibility of various navigational aids was tested. Proceeding to Jacksonville after three tests, the cutter underwent repairs until 28 February 1943, when she returned to her anti-submarine patrols in the 6th Naval District until the fall of 1945, when she was sent to Curtis Bay, Maryland, for decommissioning.|$|E

You wave an airy adieu to the boys on <b>shore,</b> <b>light</b> your biggest pipe, and swagger about the deck as if you were Captain Cook, Sir Francis Drake, and Christopher Columbus all rolled into one. On Tuesday, you wish you hadnâ€™t come. On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, you wish you were dead. On Saturday, you are able to swallow a little beef tea, and to sit up on deck, and answer with a wan, sweet smile when kind-hearted people ask you how you feel now. On Sunday, you begin to walk about again, and take solid food. And on Monday morning, as, with your bag and umbrella in your hand, you stand by the gunwale, waiting to step ashore, you begin to thoroughly like it.|$|E

The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck. We hustled {{it on to the}} raft in a pile, and I told Jim to float along down, and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile, and keep it burning till I come; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light. As I got down towards it three or four more showed--up on a hillside. It was a village. I closed in above the <b>shore</b> <b>light,</b> and laid on my oars and floated. As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat.

50|$|The West <b>Shore</b> <b>Light</b> Rail {{is another}} {{proposed}} light rail project, which is 13.1 mi long, {{and is being}} championed by the Staten Island Economic Development Corporation (SIEDC). Many Staten Island residents endure very long commutes into Manhattan, and the West <b>Shore</b> <b>Light</b> Rail project would lessen this for many commuters. Beginning at the South Shore, probably near a park-and-ride in Pleasant Plains, the proposed line would run along the western shore of Staten Island. It would cross into Bayonne, New Jersey, and go over the Bayonne Bridge to connect to Hudson-Bergen Light Rail.|$|E

For the rear light a grid of nine stone piers was laid out, and a {{pyramidal}} iron tower was erected. A central shaft of wood timbers sheathed in iron plates held the staircase to the lantern, and a wooden house surrounded this {{at the base of the}} light.|$|R

5000|$|The North <b>Shore</b> <b>Light</b> Rail {{line is a}} {{proposed}} rail line (since turned into a bus rapid transit line) serving the northern portion of Staten Island along the abandoned right of way of the former Staten Island Railway's North Shore Branch. According to PlanNYC.org, which is affiliated with the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, [...] "the proposed five mile route, which would connect Arlington and the St. George Ferry Terminal, would cost $360 million, with funding coming from federal, state and local agencies. In order to move forward, the project will require a $4 million allocation from Congress for a feasibility study which is currently awaiting approval from the House Transportation Committee. A projection of 11,000-15,000 daily passengers would ride on the North <b>Shore</b> <b>Light</b> Rail if {{and when it is}} complete. This line would serve the North Shore, and would be connected with new developments such as the New York Wheel.|$|E
5000|$|West <b>Shore</b> <b>Light</b> Rail - SIEDC's [...] "signature {{project and}} highest priority", SIEDC {{plans to build}} a 13.1 mile public transit system with stops from Richmond Valley to Elm Park costing around $1 billion. It is envisioned by the SIEDC that there will be nine {{stations}} in places such as Richmond Valley, Staten Island. This would bring commuters over the Bayonne Bridge connecting with New Jersey Transit's Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, which leads PATH trains into Manhattan. A 2009 study conducted by SYSTRA Consulting found an estimated daily ridership of 13,000 (26,000 trips) and travel time of 55 minutes from the South Shore of Staten Island to lower Manhattan. Benefits of the West <b>Shore</b> <b>Light</b> Rail to SIEDC are trips diverted from congested roadways, travel time savings, improved reliability, increased property values near stations, minimize impacts to both the preexisting natural and human-made environment, minimize community impacts, and lastly, support community economic development goals and provide economic benefits to the locations to be served by the light rail. However, SIEDC is facing many conflicts in creating this rail. Some of these conflicts include reluctance by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, competition for capital project dollars in New York State, and fiscal constraints.|$|E

The crew supported <b>shore</b> <b>lights,</b> unwatched lights, lighted buoys, unlighted buoys and beacons, and radio beacons on both the Panama Canals Atlantic and Pacific sides, the western Caribbean, Morro Puercas and the Jicarita Island Lights. In addition, Acacia rendered numerous salvage services involving vessels and persons in distress. The most notable was the rescue of the Brazilian training ship Almirante Saldanha. The vessel and its crew were given up for lost after the ship had run aground off San Juan Harbor Entrance 25 July 1938. Acacia rescued her crew, and the rescue created a celebration in Brazil and gained the attention of international officials.|$|R

5000|$|Sodus Point Light is a {{lighthouse}} {{that was built}} on Sodus Point on Lake Ontario, New York. The lighthouse {{has been replaced by}} a modern skeleton tower. The lighthouse tower is a square, pyramidal cast iron tower on a concrete and stone pier. It is white with red trim. There is a 2 story limestone keepers quarters that was built in 1871, which is currently used as a museum. The lighthouse is owned by the Town of Sodus Point, New York. There is a long term lease with the Sodus Bay Historical Society to manage the lighthouse. [...] The lighthouse is on the National Register of Historic Places, with reference #76001288, as Sodus Point Lighthouse. The pier and <b>shore</b> <b>light</b> served simultaneously from 1834 until 1901. The dwelling was used by the Coast Guard as housing until 1984. There is a 3 order Fresnel lens on display.|$|E

50|$|The Racine Reef is a {{major hazard}} to {{navigation}} not only for shipping {{in and out of}} Racine harbor, but also for traffic between Milwaukee and Chicago. It has been marked with a succession of aids, starting with a can buoy placed in 1869 after a study of erecting a lighthouse on the reef itself found the expense to be too great. Various <b>shore</b> <b>lights</b> were also added including ranges based on the Racine breakwaters and a red beacon mounted on the Wind Point Light. These measures were found to be ineffective, and in 1898 construction began on a beacon set {{in the center of the}} reef. This acetylene-powered lamp was placed on a masonry platform resting on a wood crib; the light was first lit on August 31, 1899. This arrangement proved quickly to be quite problematic; the light was difficult to service and ever-increasing piles of rip-rap were laid about the platform in attempts to curb erosion and storm damage. In 1901 the beacon's iron tower was also made taller, but the problems continued.|$|R

50|$|The {{light was}} damaged {{in the first}} month of {{operation}} when a vessel struck the pier. In 1907-1909 a dwelling and oil house were constructed {{on the site of the}} former <b>shore</b> <b>light.</b> At the same time a fog bell was added to the light, its mechanism powered by a generator which was housed in a shed at the other end of the pier. This arrangement was found unsatisfactory, and a diaphone was added sometime between 1926 and 1931. During repairs in 1928 to fix storm damage, the light was rebuilt to run off electrical power. It continued in operation until 1969, when it was replaced with a steel tower. The older building was saved, however, and in 1975 the house portion was donated to the Rogers Street Fishing Village, a museum encompassing the old coast guard lifesaving station. The old building now stands on a platform similar to its original foundation, though it is now surrounded by a raised walkway. Unfortunately during the move the lens was broken, but a 2006 grant provided funds for its repair and restoration, and it was returned to display in 2009.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review {{expressed}} {{its opposition}} to the North Shore project, noting that there were already four bridges capable of transporting people from the Downtown area to the city's North Shore and North Side. The Tribune-Review further stated that PNC Park is already accessible to Pittsburgh Pirates fans via the Roberto Clemente Bridge, while the Pittsburgh Steelers have sold out Heinz Field for years without the project's help. These critiques do {{not take into account}} the fact that any northward expansion of Pittsburgh's light rail network would require that the Allegheny river be crossed in some fashion, and the light rail cars could not pass over the existing bridges. The engineers who planned the project concluded that a tunnel, rather than a new or retrofitted bridge, would be the most cost-effective solution to this issue. In addition, in December 2010, the Steelers began examining the possibility of increasing the capacity of Heinz Field by [...] "several thousand" [...] seats. The president of Alco Parking, Merrill Stabile, noted that the North Shore lacks the parking capacity to serve additional fans, and that the North Shore Connector could help alleviate the congestion by [...] "making it easier for fans to park Downtown". Supporters have argued that the North Shore Connector will not only ease weekend congestion on the North Shore, but will also ease weekday congestion in the Central Business district. On weekdays, commuters will be able to ride the light rail from the North Shore to the central business district by parking in one of the underutilized parking lots or garages of the North Shore. Buses serving the region north of Pittsburgh could make terminal stops at the North <b>Shore</b> <b>light</b> rail stations rather than driving into the central business district, further decreasing congestion on the city streets - [...] "a gift to all rush-hour commuters". Better enhancing the North Shore Connector's ability to attract commuters was a three-year deal sponsored by the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Rivers Casino, Alco Parking, and the Pittsburgh Stadium Authority to make rides between the North Shore and the Central Business District completely free.|$|E

Jagged rocky hill and ridge lines, all faintly pencilled, fall away from the left to the centre of the picture to reveal a more distant horizon of hills whose faint shading suggests vertical upper faces. The lower but still steep slopes show indications of vegetation. The slopes descend into the centre left to centre of the midground, down to the water's edge in the harbour. Here one sailing boat is visible, its sails not raised, facing diagonally leftwards in calm water. The land in front of the harbour rises steadily from the foreground into the midground from the left centre of the picture rightwards, reaching horizon-level in the centre right, thereafter flattening off; a single narrowly conical rocky peak protrudes from further away near the right-hand edge of the picture. There are palm trees near the water's edge in front of the inlet, and on the lower slopes in the centre foreground, the latter appearing to rise out of other shrubby undergrowth. There are other indications of scanty vegetation on the ridge lines and in a cleft which descends diagonally into the right-hand corner.

5|$|In August, she steamed to New York for repairs, {{arriving}} at Base 10 on 19 August and entering the New York Navy Yard soon thereafter. She completed repairs on 26 September and got underway for Port Jefferson that same day. During the mid-watch on 27 September, she ran hard aground on Block Island. Captain Victor Blue and his navigator, confused about <b>shore</b> <b>lights</b> and {{more concerned about}} the minefield at the opening of Long Island Sound, made the turn at the wrong time and ran the ship aground on the island from the bow all the way aft beyond midships. For three days, her crew lightened ship to no avail. On 30 September, tugs came to her assistance, and she finally backed clear. Hull damage dictated a return to the yard, and extensive repairs precluded her departure with Battleship Division 9 (BatDiv 9) for the British Isles in November. The secondary battery was reduced to eighteen 5-inch guns in October 1917. Captain Blue, a protege of Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, was never court-martialed and remained in command of Texas. The Navy Department held his navigator entirely responsible for the accident.|$|R
