40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} characteristics of research evaluations for <b>social</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> humanity researchers. A successful research evaluation should include all the publication media used by their researchers. In <b>social</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> humanity studies, articles and books {{are the two most}} commonly used scientific publication media, but several other publication media {{play an important role in}} some disciplines too. In additions, books always receive high citation rate. Also, <b>social</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> humanity researches deal with local and regional problems more often and cite earlier articles than are in sciences. Thus, any evaluation that covered only articles or books would probably be incomplete to varying degrees. A window of longer years for evaluation would be more appropriate for <b>social</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> humanity researchers. [Article Content in Chinese...|$|R
5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> <b>and</b> humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
5|$|Its {{academic}} program {{is based on}} a core curriculum of sixteen required courses in the humanities, <b>social</b> <b>sciences</b> <b>and</b> natural sciences. All courses are small seminars with no more than twelve students, and are based on original sources from a list of about 200 core texts broadly based on the Great Books canon. Classroom instruction is Socratic discussion. Considerable writing is required, including two comprehensive examinations and a senior thesis. Students are admitted primarily on the basis of essays and interviews; no minimum grades or test scores are required. Shimer {{has one of the highest}} alumni doctorate rates in the country.|$|E

Spatial analysis is entirely absent from most <b>social</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> public policy research methods courses. But space matters in the issues political scientists, economists, urban planners, public administrators and other social scientists and public policy professionals study. Spatially integrated <b>social</b> <b>science</b> seeks to correct this shortcoming by integrating spatial concepts and GIS operations into <b>social</b> <b>science</b> courses. This paper describes current efforts to help <b>social</b> <b>science</b> faculty integrate spatial analysis into their teaching and an instructional module the author has developed to teach upper division undergraduate <b>social</b> <b>science</b> students to think spatially, visualize data, and use GIS operations to solve <b>social</b> <b>science</b> <b>and</b> public policy problems.

5|$|Following the {{reorganization}} of legal education in Ontario in the mid-1950s, Queen's Faculty of Law opened in 1957 in the newly built John A. Macdonald Hall.

By {{the end of the}} 1960s, like many other universities in Canada, Queen's tripled its enrolment and greatly expanded its faculty, staff, and facilities, {{as a result of the}} baby boom and generous support from the public sector. By the mid-1970s, the number of full-time students had reached 10,000.
