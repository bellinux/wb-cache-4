The quantum mechanical tunneling probability is calculated within the WKB approximation. Microscopic proton-nucleus interaction potentials are obtained by <b>single</b> <b>folding</b> the densities of the daughter nuclei with M 3 Y effective interaction supplemented by a zero-range pseudo-potential for exchange along with the density dependence. Strengths of the M 3 Y interaction are extracted by fitting its matrix elements in an oscillator basis to those elements of the G-matrix obtained with the Reid-Elliott soft-core nucleon-nucleon interaction. Parameters of the density dependence are obtained from the nuclear matter calculations. Spherical charge distributions are used for calculating the Coulomb interaction potentials.

MALT 1 is thought to function as a scaffold and protease to promote signaling; however, the biochemical and structural basis of paracaspase action remains largely unknown. Here we report the 1. 75 -Å resolution crystal structure of the MALT 1 paracaspase region, which contains the paracaspase domain and an ensuing Ig-like domain. The paracaspase and the Ig domains appear as a <b>single</b> <b>folding</b> unit and interact with each other through extensive van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds. The paracaspase domain adopts a fold that is nearly identical to that of classic caspases and homodimerizes similarly to form an active protease. Unlike caspases, the active and mature form of the paracaspase domain remains a single uncleaved polypeptide and specifically recognizes the bound peptide inhibitor Val-Arg-Pro-Arg. In particular, the carboxyl-terminal amino acid Arg of the inhibitor is coordinated by three highly conserved acidic residues.

40|$|This paper gives a {{synthesis}} of three algorithms to detect the presence of tropopause folds from vertical ozone/radio-sounding profiles and from meteorological analysis. Also an algorithm to identify injection of stratospheric air into the lower troposphere from ozone/ 7 beryllium time series is presented. Differences in the results obtained from the algorithms are observed and discussed {{with respect to the}} criteria for fold detection and input data used. Spatial gradients in the obtained folding frequencies are made evident on a global scale from the algorithm based on meteorological analysis (Q-vector/potential vorticity) and probably also on a regional European scale from algorithms both based meteorological analyses and on ozone/PTU soundings. The observed seasonal variation of folding occurrence is rather flat except during summer when also some differences appear between the algorithms. By combining the folding frequencies with literature estimates of the cross-tropopause ozone tr ansfer in <b>single</b> <b>folding</b> events, an average stratospheric ozone influx into the troposphere of 5. 7 ¤ 1. 3 x 10 (exp 10) mol. cm(- 2) s(- 1) is obtained for the Northern hemisphere and 12 ¤ 2. 7 x 10 (exp 10) mol. cm(- 2) s(- 1) for Western Europe.

40|$|ClpB is {{a member}} of a multichaperone system in Escherichia coli (with DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE) that reactivates {{aggregated}} proteins. The sequence of ClpB contains two ATP-binding regions that are enclosed between the N- and C-terminal extensions. Whereas it has been found that the N-terminal region of ClpB is essential for the chaperone activity, the structure of this region is not known, and its biochemical properties have not been studied. We expressed and purified the N-terminal fragment of ClpB (residues 1 – 147). Circular dichroism of the isolated N-terminal region showed a high content of α-helical structure. Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the N-terminal region of ClpB is thermodynamically stable and contains a <b>single</b> <b>folding</b> domain. The N-terminal domain is monomeric, as determined by gel-filtration chromatography, and the elution profile of the N-terminal domain does not change {{in the presence of the}} N-terminally truncated ClpB (ClpBΔN). This indicates that the N-terminal domain does not form strong contacts with ClpBΔN. Consistently, addition of the separated N-terminal domain does not reverse an inhibition of ATPase activity of ClpBΔN in the presence of casein. As shown by ELISA measurements, full-length ClpB and ClpBΔN bind protein substrates (casein, inactivated luciferase) with similar affinity. We also found that the isolated N-terminal domain of ClpB interacts with heat-inactivated luciferase. Taken together, our results indicate that the N-terminal fragment of ClpB forms a distinct domain that is not strongly associated with the ClpB core and is not required for ClpB interactions with other proteins, but may be involved in recognition of protein substrates...|$|E

Differential cross sections for the 6, 7 Li + p scattering were measured over the proton laboratory–energy range from 400 to 1050 keV. The elastic scattering of 6, 7 Li+p data at different proton incident energies have been analyzed using singlefolding model. In each case the real potential obtained from the folding model was supplemented by a phenomenological imaginary potential, and during the fitting process the real potential was normalized and the imaginary potential optimized. Normalization factor NR is calculated in the range between 0. 70 and 0. 84.

The basic inputs for a single-folding calculation of the nucleon-nucleus potential are the nuclear densities of the target and the effective nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction.

We test mean packing, mean pairwise {{energy and the}} new index gVSL 2 on a dataset of 743 folded proteins and 81 natively unfolded proteins. These predictors have an individual performance comparable or even better than other proposed methods. We introduce here a strictly unanimous score S_{SU} that combines them but leaves undecided those sequences differently classified by two single predictors. The {{performance of}} the single predictors on a dataset purged from the proteins left unclassified by S_{SU}, significantly increases, indicating that unclassified proteins are mainly false predictions. Amino acid composition is the main determinant considered by these predictors, therefore unclassified proteins have a composition compatible with both folded and unfolded status. This is why purging a dataset from these ambiguous proteins increases the performance of single predictors. The percentage of proteins predicted as natively unfolded by S_{SU} in the three kingdoms are: 4. 1 % for Bacteria, 1. 0 % for Archaea and 20. 0 % for Eukarya; compatible with previous determinations.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{of this work}} is to explore the spin dependent effects of projectile structure in nuclear heavy ion induced reactions. The projectiles are considered to consist of two clusters which remain inert, the intercluster wavefunctions are obtained {{by the use of}} the orthogonality condition model. Excitation to the low lying projectile states is included by the use of coupled channels calculations. The projectile excited states are included by allowing excitation in the inter cluster wavefunctions. Coupling to the excited states is performed by multipole terms arising from a <b>single</b> <b>folding</b> model, which is used consistently throughout the work. The effects of projectile excitation are considered in two areas, elastic and inelastic scattering, and transfer reactions. It is found that the inclusion of the projectile excited states has a very strong effect on the spin dependent elastic observables, in particular the vector analysing powers. In contrast to earlier analysis it is found that projectile excitation plays a dominant role in reproducing the experimentally observed vector analysing powers for the elastic scattering of 6 Li from 16 O and 28 Si at 22. 8 MeV. Projectile excitation is also seen to produce strong spin dependent effects in the elastic scattering of Li from 120 Sn at 44 MeV and of 19 Ffrom 28 Si at 60 MeV. The inclusion of projectile excitation via CCBA calculations produces changes in the transfer cross section for the 28 Si (19 F, 16 O) 31 P(1 / 2 +,g. s.) reaction. The observed changes can be understood in terms of the effects of spin dependence in the reaction path.

40|$|Microscopic optical {{potentials}} {{have been}} successful in describing nucleon-nucleus and nucleus-nucleus scattering. Some essential ingredients of the framework, however, have not been examined in detail. Applicability of the microscopic folding model is systematically investigated. Effect of an antisymmetrization factor (ASF) appearing in multiple scattering theory, theoretical uncertainty regarding the local density approximation (LDA), and the validity of a prescription for nonlocality, the Brieva-Rook (BR) localization, of the microscopic potential, are quantitatively estimated for nucleon-nucleus scattering; investigation on the ASF is carried out for also deuteron-nucleus scattering. A <b>single</b> <b>folding</b> model with the Melbourne g-matrix interaction and the SLy 4 Skyrme-type Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubiv (SLy 4 -HFB) density is employed for evaluating a nucleon-nucleus microscopic optical potential. Deuteron-nucleus scattering is described by the continuum-discretized coupled-channels method incorporating the microscopic proton-nucleus and neutron-nucleus potentials. The ASF is found to affect proton total reaction cross sections for a 12 C target below 200 MeV by about 10 %. Effect of the ASF on total reaction cross sections is negligibly small if a target nucleus is heavy or scattering energy is above 200 MeV; elastic cross sections are hardly affected by the ASF for all the reaction systems considered. Below 65 MeV, still the BR localization works quite well. However, at energies below about 50 MeV, the LDA becomes less accurate for evaluating elastic cross sections at backward angles. This is the case also for the total reaction cross sections of p- 12 C below about 200 MeV. The microscopic model is applicable to nucleon-nucleus scattering above 25 MeV for target nuclei {{in a wide range of}} mass numbers. Deviation of calculated results from experimental data is less than about 10 %. Comment: 13 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
