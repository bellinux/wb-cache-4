50|$|E. aureum {{can become}} a highly {{invasive}} species when introduced into tropical countries where it is not native. In Sri Lanka it overgrows several hectares of the Udawatta Kele Sanctuary in Kandy.

40|$|Human induced {{disruption}} of the environment is prevalent in every culture. In Brazil, the effects of massive deforestation have become apparent since the nineteen eighties. However, along with deforestation, and a coinciding loss in an economic resource for the country, is a significant loss of natural habitat and species extinction. The Amazon in Brazil contains {{a large proportion of}} the world’s species diversity that is threatened by the socio-economic activities of modern Brazilian culture. Historically and presently, indigenous groups have contributed to insignificant levels of <b>ecological</b> <b>disruption</b> and are themselves threatened by the activities of modern Brazilians. The effects of <b>ecological</b> <b>disruption</b> range from shifting climate patterns, degradation of soils, loss of floral and faunal species, displacement of indigenous cultures, and the loss of many unknown resources. The preservation of this unique environment is vital to the continued viability of the region...|$|R

50|$|The {{scientific}} {{consensus is}} that the potential for large-scale effects, either through pathogenesis or <b>ecological</b> <b>disruption,</b> is extremely small. Nevertheless, returned samples from Mars will be treated as potentially biohazardous until scientists can determine that the returned samples are safe.

50|$|Resource {{degradation}} {{has reduced}} output from forestry. In 2004 roundwood removals came to 22,162,000 cubic meters. Fisheries are of local importance around Lake Victoria and have potential on Lake Turkana. Kenya's total catch reported in 2004 was 128,000 metric tons. However, output from fishing {{has been declining}} because of <b>ecological</b> <b>disruption.</b> Pollution, overfishing, {{and the use of}} unauthorised fishing equipment have led to falling catches and have endangered local fish species.|$|R

50|$|An {{example is}} the past impact event record of Earth: if large impacts cause mass extinctions and <b>ecological</b> <b>disruptions</b> precluding the {{evolution}} of intelligent observers for long periods, no one will observe any evidence of large impacts {{in the recent past}} (since they would have prevented intelligent observers from evolving). Hence there is a potential bias in the impact record of Earth. Astronomical existential risks might similarly be underestimated due to selection bias, and an anthropic correction has to be introduced.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{packaging}} {{films have}} led to <b>serious</b> <b>ecological</b> problems due to their non-biodegradability, being biopolymers an alternative source for packaging development.

50|$|While Diamond {{does not}} reject the {{approach}} of traditional historians, his book, according to Gladwell, vividly illustrates the limitations of that approach. Gladwell demonstrates this with his own example of a recent ballot initiative in Oregon, where questions of property rights and other freedoms were subject to a free and healthy debate, but <b>serious</b> <b>ecological</b> questions were given scant attention.|$|R
40|$|Human {{beings are}} both the slaves and {{the masters of}} the {{ecosystems}} in which they live. This paper examines the interrelationship between economic decision-making hierarchies and ecological hierarchies. Conditions under which discontinuous changes can occur are presented both for top-down and bottom-up causes. Appropriate institutional arrangements for minimizing <b>ecological</b> <b>disruption</b> are analyzed and depend {{on the nature of}} the relationship between the economic and ecological hierarchies. In some cases this will involve self-managed economic units operating at the appropriate level of the ecological hierarchy. ...|$|R
50|$|During its operations, the Sillamäe plant {{dumped the}} {{processing}} wastes into a tailing pond at the north-western part of Sillamäe near the Baltic Sea shoreline. By the 1990s, the pond presented a <b>serious</b> <b>ecological</b> hazard due to leaching of radioactive and other harmful particulates and dissolved materials into Baltic Sea. In the 2000s, measures were undertaken {{to secure the}} containment of the wastes at Sillamäe.|$|R
50|$|Due to its hydrographic conditions, the Pascua River has a {{hydroelectric}} {{potential of}} great importance. There exists a controversial Endesa project to construct two massive power dams {{on the course}} of the river, but the proposal has generated immediate opposition from a great part of the population and in the government authorities, due to the <b>serious</b> <b>ecological</b> damage that would cause in the zone.|$|R
50|$|Forestry output {{has also}} {{declined}} because of resource degradation. Overexploitation {{over the past}} three decades has reduced the country's timber resources by one-half. At present only 2% of the land remains forested, and an estimated 50 square kilometres of forest are lost each year. This loss of forest aggravates erosion, the silting of dams and flooding, and the loss of biodiversity. Among the endangered forests are Kakamega Forest, Mau Forest and Karura Forest. In response to <b>ecological</b> <b>disruption,</b> activists have pressed with some success for policies that encourage sustainable resource use.|$|R
50|$|Delta Amacuro {{consists}} {{almost entirely}} of the swampy Orinoco River Delta. The hot and humid Tucupita lies well into the delta on the Caño Manamo river (one {{of the two major}} branches of the Orinoco river delta). It is approached by a road which runs along the top of a gigantic barrier constructed in the 1960s to create dry land. The project is {{considered by many to be}} a failure since little dry land was created and massive <b>ecological</b> <b>disruption</b> was caused by salt water penetration of the delta.|$|R
40|$|There {{are very}} {{positive}} and strong connections between animals and humans, but also reasons for concern because about 61 % {{of all human}} pathogens are zoonotic. The increase in new diseases, is due to increases in world trade, animal translocation, <b>ecological</b> <b>disruptions,</b> climate change, adaptation of pathogens, {{and changes in the}} way we raise animals. Animal health and human health are intertwined, and we should be cognizant of the global consequences of international trade in animals and animal products and the impacts of human population growth on the environmen...|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{increased}} sediments loads on aquatic ecosystems can be catastrophic. Silt can smother the spawning beds of fish, by {{filling in the}} space between gravel on the stream bed. It also reduces their food supply, and causes major respiratory issues for them as sediment enters their gills. The biodiversity of aquatic plant and algal life is reduced, and invertebrates are also unable to survive and reproduce. While the sedimentation event itself might be relatively short-lived, the <b>ecological</b> <b>disruption</b> caused by the mass die off often persists long into the future.|$|R
5000|$|Christianity is also criticised {{as being}} anthropocentric, and thus {{responsible}} for <b>ecological</b> <b>disruption.</b> In Russia, Rodnovers often criticise Christianity for {{its claim to}} {{have a monopoly on}} truth; in identifying it as a [...] "mono-ideology", they compare it to Soviet Marxism. Even capitalism is considered a product of Abrahamic religions; Russian Rodnover leader Dobroslav declared that [...] "nature-swallowing capitalism is an ugly child of the Judeo-Christian civilisation", and that [...] "the only way out is to go back ... from the cult of profit to the cult of life", back to indigenous religions.|$|R
30|$|The {{effluent}} {{discharged from}} textile dyeing mill {{is a highly}} concentrated coloured wastewater and consists of a mixture of various dyes. Most dyestuffs are complex aromatic structures which are difficult to be disposed. Moreover, the colour in water resources poses aesthetic problem. They also cause <b>serious</b> <b>ecological</b> problems like significantly affecting photosynthetic activity of aquatic plants due to reduced light penetration and may be toxic to some aquatic organism (Zollinger, 1987).|$|R
30|$|Heavy metal ions are toxic, non-biodegradable and can {{accumulate}} through food chain.
