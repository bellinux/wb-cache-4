25|$|A special Army decoration, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Guard Identification Badge is {{authorized}} for wear after passing a detailed test of 100 questions (from {{a pool of}} more than 300), a uniform test with two gigs (errors) or fewer (measured to the 1/64"), and a test on the guard changing sequence.

Since the first award on February 7, 1958, fewer than 650 soldiers have completed training and been awarded this Badge, including four women. A small number of Tomb Guard Identification Badges have also been retroactively awarded to soldiers who served as Guards before 1959. Those numbers make the Badge the second rarest award currently issued in the United States Army; only the Army Astronaut Badge is rarer.|$|E
500|$|Shells {{from both}} marine and land organisms consist {{almost entirely of}} calcium carbonate, either as {{aragonite}} or as calcite, or some mixture of the two. Calcium carbonate is very susceptible to dissolving and recrystallizing; the recrystallized material will contain carbon from the sample's environment, which may be of geological origin.

2500|$|The sodium {{carbonate}} test (not {{to be confused}} with {{sodium carbonate}} extract test) is used to distinguish between some common metal ions, which are precipitated as their respective carbonates. The test can distinguish between copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn) or lead (Pb). Sodium carbonate solution is added to the salt of the metal. A blue precipitate indicates Cu2+ ion. A dirty green precipitate indicates Fe2+ ion. A yellow-brown precipitate indicates Fe3+ ion. A white precipitate indicates Ca2+, Zn2+, or Pb2+ ion. [...] The compounds formed are, respectively, copper(II) carbonate, iron(II) carbonate, iron(III) oxide, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, and lead(II) carbonate. This test is used to precipitate the ion present as almost all carbonates are insoluble. While this test is useful for telling these cations apart, it fails if other ions are present, because most metal carbonates are insoluble and will precipitate. In addition, calcium, zinc, and lead ions all produce white precipitates with carbonate, making it difficult to distinguish between them. Instead of sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide may be added, this gives nearly the same colours, except that lead and zinc hydroxides are soluble in excess alkali, and can hence be distinguished from calcium. For the complete <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> used for qualitative cation analysis, see qualitative inorganic analysis.|$|E

40|$|Test data {{preparation}} phase for testing database applications deals with instantiating program variables, {{as well as}} generating database instance(s) to run application queries on these instances. We first propose a method that takes a database schema, a test case representing a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> simple queries on a path within a transaction in a given database application, and corresponding properties associated with these queries; forms a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) by considering the interactions among the queries and the integrity constraints given by the schema; and generates, by solving this CSP, an initial database instance which satisfies the property associated with each query and is consistent {{with respect to the}} integrity constraints given in the schema. Then, we extend this method by taking a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases containing nested queries, and generate one or more consistent database instances that satisfy the properties of queries in each test case in the given <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases.

50|$|A Lean {{laboratory}} will {{normally have}} a defined <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> and associated analyst roles that make {{good use of}} people and equipment. A key principle is to flow work through the laboratory so that once testing begins on a sample, it is kept moving and not allowed to queue between tests. This creates a focus and drive to reduce ‘through-put’ time which can be converted into a lead-time reduction or used to allow samples to wait in an incoming queue to facilitate level loading and /or grouping for efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Test {{dependence}} {{arises when}} executing a test in different environments causes it to return different results. In this paper, we show through {{a set of}} substantive real-world examples that test dependence arises in practice. We also show that test dependence can have potentially costly repercussions such as masking program faults, and can be hard to identify unless explicitly searched for: We found a dependence that only manifests when a <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> three <b>tests</b> are run in a specified, non-default order. We formally define test dependence in terms <b>of</b> <b>test</b> suites as ordered <b>sequences</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> along with explicit environments in which these tests are executed. We use this formalization to formulate the concrete problem of detecting dependence in test suites, prove that a useful special case is NP-complete, and propose an initial algorithm that approximates solutions to this problem...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} detection/localization problems in which the detector offers multiple operating modes. The modes differ in their detection performance and geographical coverage: "focused" modes offer higher detection performance but less coverage area than "broad search" modes.

The goal is to determine a strategy for mode selection in the <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> that will yield optimal payoff {{in terms of a}} pre-established criterion.
