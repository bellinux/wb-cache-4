5|$|Published by Joseph Johnson, Mary {{itself was}} {{moderately}} successful, and sections {{of it were}} included in several collections of sentimental extracts that were popular at the time, such as The Young Gentleman and Lady's Instructor (1809).

Norman had at that time written a number of songs for Johnny Nash, whose record label had just signed Marley, and Marley wanted {{to learn more about}} rhythm and blues. Along with Al Pyfrom, Norman's co-writer, and Marley's wife Rita, the pair spent several days in a jam session that {{ultimately}} resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. According to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, the tape—which was lost among Norman's possessions for decades—is rare for Marley in that it was influenced by pop music rather than reggae, highlighting a point in Marley's career when he was <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find his path. Some of the songs from this early jam session were released on the Marley album Chances Are.|$|E

Andy (Chris Pratt), who is <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> win back April's affections, gives Chris an obviously forged letter from the FBI claiming April must immediately return to the parks department.

5|$|In {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} BAA/NBA, the league was <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> gain the support of fans who lived {{in or near the}} teams' home markets. To achieve this, the league {{introduced}} the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges in their area who would presumably have strong local support. Before the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena. Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft, these picks were not factored into the overall selection count of the draft; therefore, the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick.|$|E

She is also not pleased with the sheriff hiring Emma, and also reminds Archie that she can have him fired and out on the streets if he fails to succeed in dissuading Henry of the veracity of the fairy tale stories.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before noon}} on 19 February, he used around fifty tanks, their crew and {{a mixture of}} {{infantry}} battalions to seize {{control of the military}} headquarters, the post office and the radio station of Saigon. He surrounded the home of General Khánh and Gia Long Palace, the residence of head of state Phan Khắc Sửu. The tanks were led by Colonel Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, a Catholic member of the Đại Việt.

5|$|The NK 6th Division and NK 7th Division {{closed on}} Masan, attacking the US 25th Infantry Division on {{multiple}} fronts, {{with the main}} efforts aimed at the 24th and 35th Infantry regiments.

When the division issued orders to its subordinate units to take up defensive positions west of Masan, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry was <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> seize Obong-san, the mountain ridge just west of Battle Mountain and P'il-bong, and across a gorge-like valley from them.

The 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry now came to the Haman area to help in the regimental defense of the sector.|$|E

Representatives of Egypt, Rhodes, Byzantium, Chios, Mytilene and perhaps Athens also met again with the Aetolians that spring. The war was going Philip's way, but the Aetolians, {{although}} now abandoned by both Pergamon and Rome, were not yet ready to make peace on Philip's terms. However, after another season's fighting, they finally relented. In 206 BC, the Aetolians, without Rome's consent, sued for a separate peace on conditions imposed by Philip.|$|E
