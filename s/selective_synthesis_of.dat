In retinal pathologies, both mechanisms {{are involved in the}} transformation of all-trans-retinal (AtR, reactive aldehyde) into bis-retinoid A 2 E.

Additionally, these phenolic structures are linked to a polyunsaturated fatty acid such as docosahexaenoic acid (C 22 : 6 n- 3; DHA) or to a lysophosphatidylcholine-DHA conjugate, in order to specifically increase their bioavailability, and thus, to target the retina. <b>Selective</b> <b>syntheses</b> <b>of</b> phloroglucinol-DHA, resveratrol-DHA, and phloroglucinol-DHA-PC (PC = phosphatidylcholine) conjugates using silyl protecting group strategies are presented, along with results of testing that demonstrate their ability to lower AtR toxicity in ARPE- 19 cell lines...|$|R

The recovery of the products by coupling photocatalysis with pervaporation membrane technology seems to be a solution for future industrial applications. As far as photoelectrocatalysis is concerned, a decrease in recombination of the photogenerated pairs occurs, enhancing the rate of the oxidation reactions and the quantum yield.

40|$|Gold {{catalysis}} {{has become}} an important tool to achieve highly chemoselective p-acid activation. Exceptional reactivity and selectivity are often encountered under mild reaction conditions. These properties have made gold(I) complexes suitable catalysts for tremendous applications in the total <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> natural products. The first chapter will highlight a number <b>of</b> total <b>syntheses</b> using gold catalysis as a key step. The second chapter will cover our application of the gold(I) -catalyzed 6 -endo-dig carbocyclization for the <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> bridgehead-substituted scaffolds and its use toward the <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> PPAP natural products. This research has opened our eyes to the utility of biphenylphosphine ligands, particularly JohnPhos, in gold(I) -catalysis. The reactivity and selectivity exhibited by gold(I) complexes is modulated {{by the nature of}} the ancillary ligand. Recent research rationalizes the impact of these ligands on the divergent reactivity observed between cationic and carbenoid intermediates. Our desire to favor the 6 -endo-dig pathway has led us toward the discovery of another example of the diagonal reactivity that NHC carbene and biphenylphosphine ligands can bring to gold(I) -catalysis. Chapter three will explain the development <b>of</b> a <b>selective</b> gold-catalyzed <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> fused carbocycles. Our <b>selective</b> divergent <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> fused carbocycles, combined with the Diels–Alder reaction, has brought new synthetic opportunities. Chapter four will describe our approach toward the <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> various polycyclic diterpene-related frameworks. Starting with a unique linear precursor, we have developed a new “one-pot” process for the <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> three different polycyclic compounds related to the terpenoid family. The facile modulation of the linear precursor and the use of different dienophiles during the Diels–Alder reaction could enable the <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> diverse polycyclic analogues based on three principal frameworks. The gold(I) -catalyzed <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> fused carbocycles reached some limitations during our study. Regioselective control was found to be substantially more challenging, with terminal alkynes or alkynes bearing a sterically and electronically neutral methyl substituent. In chapter five, we will discuss how the complementarity of silver(I) catalysis to gold(I) catalysis enabled the <b>selective</b> divergent <b>synthesis</b> <b>of</b> three different fused carbocycles from a unique precursor. Moreover, copper(I) catalysis has given access to the 6 -endo-dig pathway on terminal alkynes without the formation of a vinylidene intermediate. ...|$|R

For R = n-Bu, thermally stable products resulting from selective alkyl transfer to the pyridine nitrogen (N 1) atom are obtained. However, NMR studies showed that the reaction of [Mg(Bn) 2 THF 2] with iPrBIP at − 65 °C leads to a thermally unstable product arising from benzyl migration to position C 2 in the pyridine ring. Above + 5 °C, this compound rearranges, cleanly yielding a mixture of two isomeric complexes, in which the benzyl group has migrated to positions C 3 or C 4 of the central ring, respectively. Similar isomeric mixtures were obtained when [Mg(Bn) 2 THF 2] was reacted with iPrBIP or MesBIP at room temperature.
