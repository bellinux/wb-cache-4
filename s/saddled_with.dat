5|$|The common {{soldiers}} fought bravely at first, {{but they}} were <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> low pay (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to follow their husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.|$|E
5|$|Morehead was {{nominated}} for lieutenant governor at his party's nominating convention in Baltimore, Maryland in 1831, and was elected on a split ticket with Democratic governor John Breathitt. He ascended to the governorship upon Breathitt's death in 1834. <b>Saddled</b> <b>with</b> a shortened term, Morehead {{was not able to}} formulate a significant legislative agenda, and stuck to the politically safe issue of internal improvements during his term. When his party changed its name to the Whig Party and wrested control of the General Assembly from the Democrats in the summer of 1834, Morehead hosted the new party's first nominating convention in Frankfort.|$|E

5|$|Sánchez {{attended}} Blanca Malaret High School in Sabana Grande, Puerto Rico. After {{graduating in}} 2000, Sánchez pitched for four seasons at Ohio Dominican University in Columbus, Ohio. While at the university, Sánchez threw four no-hitters and set school records for most strikeouts {{in a single}} game (sixteen), most strikeouts in a single season (105), most strikeouts in a career (311), and most shutouts in a career (ten). However, his final collegiate appearance was arguably his worst, as he was <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> the loss in the Panthers' NAIA regional playoff defeat to Saint Vincent College, going five innings and allowing six runs on six hits.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the National Football League in 1920 featured early franchises haphazardly formed and often <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> financial difficulties, poor player talent and attendance rates. As the league expanded through the years, players were provided with no formal representation and received few, if any, benefits. In 1943, Roy Zimmerman's refusal to play an exhibition game without compensation resulted in his trade from the Washington Redskins to the Philadelphia Eagles. With {{the formation of the}} competing All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946, NFL owners instituted a rule which banned a player for five years from NFL-associated employment if he left the league to join the AAFC.|$|E
5|$|The post-millennium {{period has}} seen {{changes to the}} way the club is run as a {{business}}. When a new business management team was appointed {{at the start of the}} 2009–10 season, it inherited a business <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> debt. The subsequent turnaround has resulted in operational profitability based on the disposal of non-core property assets, a new equity investment and a financial restructuring agreement with lenders for all debt to be repaid within five years. In 2016, the club reported that it was debt-free.|$|E

He does not let this setback deter him and puts the opportunity to good use by beginning many reforms, and enacting several measures to uplift the poor. These steps are supported by the people while causing a political upheaval among the elite. However, he is troubled {{by the fact that}} he is deceiving Manohari who believes him to be Marthandan. Unable to keep it a secret from her, he tells her the truth. Perceiving his noble character, Manohari accepts him as her brother.|$|E
5|$|While Miller toured Europe {{and lived}} out their mutual dream of visiting Lord Byron's tomb, Coolbrith was <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> {{custody of her}} daughter, and the care of members of her own family, so she set up house a in Oakland and {{accepted}} the position of city librarian. Her poetry suffered {{as a result of}} her long work hours, but she mentored a generation of young readers including Jack London and Isadora Duncan. After she served for 19 years, Oakland's library patrons called for reorganization, and Coolbrith was fired. She moved back to San Francisco and was invited by members of the Bohemian Club to be their librarian.|$|E
5|$|A horse tramway {{was built}} in 1880 by Wigan Corporation and leased to a {{succession}} of private companies to operate services to Pemberton, Aspull and towards Standish. Steam tram operation was introduced quickly, but the network always struggled to pay its way and just {{after the start of}} the 20th century Wigan Corporation gradually bought the operating leases and converted the network to electric tramcar operation. However, the network was <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> a mix of 'standard' gauge and 'narrow' gauge lines, reducing efficiency and increasing costs, and the last of the Wigan Corporation Tramways were closed in 1931 to be replaced by buses which had begun as 'feeder' services to the trams but which had shown themselves to be faster and more flexible. Trolleybuses were operated on a single route from Wigan to Martland Mill from 1925 to 1931.|$|E

5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved {{in the fifteenth century}} and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that just prior to the dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
