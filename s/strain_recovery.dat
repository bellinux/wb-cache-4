40|$|In this study, it is {{proposed}} that coarsening austenitic grains {{is a key}} criterion for achieving giant <b>recovery</b> <b>strains</b> in polycrystalline Fe-Mn-Si based shape memory alloys. In order to verify the hypothesis, the relationship between <b>recovery</b> <b>strains</b> and austenitic grain-sizes in cast and processed Fe-Mn-Si based shape memory alloys was investigated. The <b>recovery</b> <b>strain</b> of cast Fe- 19 Mn- 5. 5 Si- 9 Cr- 4. 5 Ni alloy with the coarse austenitic grains of 652 µm reached 7. 7 % while the <b>recovery</b> <b>strain</b> of one with the relatively small austenitic grains of 382 µm was only 5. 4 %. Moreover, a <b>recovery</b> <b>strain</b> of 5. 9 %, which is the highest previously published value for solution-treated processed Fe-Mn-Si based shape memory alloys, was obtained by coarsening the austenitic grains through only solution treatment at 1483 K for 360 min in a processed Fe- 17 Mn- 5. 5 Si- 9 Cr- 5. 5 Ni- 0. 12 C alloy. However, its <b>recovery</b> <b>strain</b> was still 5. 9 % after thermo-mechanical treatment consisting of 10 % tensile strain at room temperature and annealing at 1073 K for 30 min. This happens because annealing twins play a negative role, refining the austenitic grains, limiting the <b>recovery</b> <b>strains</b> to below 6 %. In summary, coarse austenitic grains enable the achievement large <b>recovery</b> <b>strains</b> by two mechanisms. Firstly, the grains are bigger, and consequently there are fewer grain boundaries, and thus their suppressive effects of grain boundaries on stress-induced ε martensitic transformation is reduced. Secondly, coarse austenitic grains are advantageous to introduce ε martensite with single orientation and reduce the collisions of different martensite colonies, especially when the deformation strain is large. As such, the ceiling of <b>recovery</b> <b>strains</b> {{is dependent on the}} austenitic grain-sizes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The nonelastic {{behavior}} at high strains of three semicrystalline polymers [i. e., nylon- 6, poly(ethylene terephthalate), and poly(ethylene 2, 6 -naphthalenedicar-boxylate] was investigated. For all materials, room temperature tensile <b>strain</b> <b>recovery</b> tests revealed {{the existence of}} two components of nonelastic deformation: a fast-relaxing component (called anelastic) and a slow-relaxing component (usually called plastic). A <b>strain</b> <b>recovery</b> master curve could be constructed for each material from the <b>strain</b> <b>recovery</b> data obtained at various temperatures. The shift factors versus tem-perature relationship for the <b>strain</b> <b>recovery</b> master curves allowed us to evaluate an activation energy for the nonelastic <b>strain</b> <b>recovery</b> process.

For the three sensors tested, the room temperature full-scale output (FSO) at 200 psig ranged between 29 and 36 mV. Although the FSO at 400 C dropped by about 60 %, full recovery was achieved at 750 C.

40|$|Effective {{prediction}} of springback during {{sheet metal forming}} is critically important for automotive and aerospace industries, especially when forming metals with high strength to weight ratio such as Titanium. This requires materials mechanical data during plastic deformation and their dependencies on parameters like strain, strain rate and sample orientation. In this study, springback is quantified experimentally as elastic <b>strain</b> <b>recovery,</b> degradation in Young’s modulus and inelastic <b>strain</b> <b>recovery</b> on unloading in a commercially pure titanium type 50 A (CP-Ti- 50 A). The results show strain rate dependent anisotropic mechanical behaviours and a degradation in Young’s modulus with increased level of plastic deformation. The level of degradation in Young’s modules increases gradually from 13 % for samples parallel to the rolling direction (RD) to 20 % for those perpendicular to the RD.
