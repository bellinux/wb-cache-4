5|$|His career {{stalled in}} the 1970s because {{he refused to}} swear {{allegiance}} to the Romanian Communist Party and was forced out of academia for his sympathies towards Israel. When Librescu requested permission to emigrate to Israel, the Academy of <b>Science</b> <b>of</b> Romania fired him. In 1976, a smuggled research manuscript that he had published in the Netherlands drew him international attention in the growing field of material dynamics.|$|E
5|$|In Glasgow, he {{was trained}} in the {{emerging}} <b>science</b> <b>of</b> statistics. He published numerous articles applying his statistical training.

To do this, he drew up statistical tables of data from the census.|$|E
