40|$|America’s alliances in Europe and East Asia all {{involve some}} {{institutional}} cooperation on U.

The varied form <b>such</b> <b>cooperation</b> takes in different alliances also flows from the respective bargaining power of allies and the relative importance of consensus, rather than perceived threats.
