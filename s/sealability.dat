40|$|This {{contribution}} {{compares the}} <b>sealability</b> performance of recently developed three synthetic foam formulations (that {{do not contain}} fluorosurfactants or fluoropolymers) with that of an {{aqueous film forming foam}} (AFFF). We apply the <b>sealability</b> methodology outlined in the Australian Defence Force Specification, DEF(AUST) 5706. This methodology specifies a 0. 28 m 2 small-scale indoor fire pan. The pan is first filled with 10 L of water and then 5 L of AVGAS (aviation gasoline, flash point of - 50 °C) or heptane (flash point of - 4 °C) is placed on top of the water. Foams were generated from a pressurised extinguisher with a foam nozzle as described in the standard's specification, set to create foams with expansion of 4 : 1. The foam spread across the fuel until the entire fuel surface was covered with foam. At 5 min intervals, a lit taper was introduced into the space above the pan area by passing it twice around the surface of the foam in a circular motion at a height of approximately 15 mm {{from the surface of the}} foam. The results demonstrate differences in the <b>sealability</b> performance between AFFF and fluorine-free foams (FfreeF). Under laboratory conditions, with a foam blanket 1 - 2 cm deep, best-performing FfreeF formulation (RF 6) provides about 30 % of the durability of an AFFF for protection against evaporation of low-flashpoint flammable liquids. We also note in the results the significant differences among FfreeF with almost no <b>sealability</b> of AVGAS vapours offered by the two other formulations...|$|E

In this study, the makeup, <b>sealability</b> and joint strength was analyzed from conditions of make-up loading, tension loading, compression loading and internal pressure loading by finite element method. The makeup torque, the contact pressure distributions of metal seal along the axis and the stress distributions of threaded connection are given. The results show that under tension loading, compression loading and internal pressure, the overall stress level of threaded connection is lower than of pipe. The anti-compression performance and joint strength of threaded connection is greater than of pipe. The contact pressures of metal seal maintain relatively high level of contact pressures under tension loading, compression loading and internal pressure.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive {{study on the}} geological characteristics of a multi-coalbed reservoir using coal cores collected from well drilling tests in Bide-Santang Basin, China. The study focuses on {{the investigation of the}} coalbed methane (CBM) -bearing property, porosity and permeability, <b>sealability</b> of capping rocks, and groundwater characteristics in coal seams, providing the experimental information on the control function of sequence strata for the coalbed methane. This reservoir is comprised {{of a large number of}} coalbeds and exhibits many distinctive geological characteristics of a CBM reservoir, such as high CBM content, complex vertical volatility of CBM content, vertical discontinuous distribution of porosity and permeability, strong sealing capping property and many vertical water-bearing systems, etc. The investigation shows that the unattached multiple superposed CBM-bearing system (UMSCS), which formed the unique multi-coalbed CBM reservoir, can be identified in the study area. Depending on the development scale of vertically unattached CBM-bearing coal seams, the CBM reservoir in the study area can be classified as simple UMSCS and complex UMSCS. The former, typically appearing in Zhuzang syncline and Agong syncline, exhibits the continuity of geological reservoir-forming characteristics in terms of less coal seams, much weaker <b>sealability</b> of capping rocks, higher CBM content, and many vertical water-bearing systems. The latter, typically represented by Shuigonghe syncline and Santang syncline, shows the continuity of geological reservoir-forming characteristics with a large number of coal seams, strong sealing capping property, and reasonably high CBM content. For simple UMSCS reservoirs, a sublevel exploitation method should be adopted for CBM exploitation in order to minimize the effect caused by larger variation of the reservoir energy in different systems. For complex UMSCS reservoirs, one effective way for CBM exploitation is to fracture virtual reservoir (mainly key sandstone member) to depressurize it uniformly and thus achieve large-scale discharging and mining in several adjacent CBM-bearing subsystems...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{conservative}} {{treatment of}} a vertical root fracture is bonding and sealing the gap of the root fracture. It is difficult to seal the gap completely from the root canal side. Grinding the gap wall using an ultrasonic endodontic file from the root canal side improves <b>sealability</b> of the gap However, there may be excessive and insufficient grinding. It is possible that dissolving the root canal wall with 10 % citric acid 3 % ferric chloride solutions （ 10 - 3 ） and 10 % sodium hypochlorite （NC） enlarge a region that is difficult for mechanical expansion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the <b>sealability</b> after enlarging the gap of a root fracture with a chemical method and together with an ultrasonic endodontic filing and chemical agents. In the first experiment, 1 millimeter thick dentin pieces were cut out from extracted human teeth, fractured in the direction of tooth axis, restored to the original position, and held. The gaps were treated by 10 - 3 for five minutes and NC for two minutes one time （one time group）, three times （three time group） and no time （control group）. In all groups, gaps were bonded using 4 META/MMA-TBB resin （Super Bond） to seal the fractured gaps. All pieces were then tested by dye penetration tests and the gaps were microscopically measured. In the second experiment, extracted human teeth were fractured vertically and restored. The gaps were treated by the following methods. 1 ） not treated （control group）, 2 ） ground from the root canal wall side with an ultrasonic endodontic file, until the Root ZX reading showed 1. 0 （grinding group）, 3 ） treated by 10 - 3 for 5 minutes and NC for 2 minutes three times （chemical group）, 4 ） treated by 3 rd method after grinding by 4 th method （combination group）. In all groups, gaps were sealed using Super Bond, tested by dye leakage tests, and microscopically measured. In the first experiment, enlarged width was significantly larger in the three times group than in the control and one time group. The rate of dye penetration was significantly smaller in the three times group than in the control and one time group. In the second experiment, the rate of dye penetration was significantly statistically smaller in the combination group than the other groups. These findings indicate that the combination of a chemical method and a mechanical method with the ultrasonic endodontic file in the gap of root fractures is effective to enhance the <b>sealability</b> of the fractured gap while preventing over grinding. 垂直歯根破折に対する保存治療の基本は，破折間隙を接着し，封鎖することである．超音波エンドファイルを用い，根管内から破折線を切削すると，破折間隙の封鎖性は向上するが，過剰切削や切削不足が生じることが課題である．一方，化学的な根管壁の溶解によって，機械的拡大が困難な部位の根管拡大が可能であるので，本研究では破折間隙の切削と化学的拡大を併用することで，接着後の封鎖性が向上するかを検討した． 　実験１．ヒト抜去歯から厚さ１mmの象牙質片を作製して破折，復位固定した．破折間隙に対して，処理群は 10 ％クエン酸/ ３％塩化第二鉄溶液（ 10 -３溶液）５分， 10 ％次亜塩素酸ナトリウム溶液（NC）２分の処理を１回あるいは３回行った．未処理群では破折間隙の処理は行わなかった．３群ともスーパーボンドで破折間隙を接着し，色素侵入試験を行うとともに破折間隙幅を計測した．その結果，間隙幅は３回処理群が他の２群より有意に広く（p＜ 0. 05 ），色素侵入率は３回処理群が他の２群より有意に小さかった（p＜ 0. 05 ）． 　実験２．ヒト抜去歯を垂直破折させて復位固定し，破折間隙に対して以下の処置を行った．①未処理群：処理なし．②形成群：ソルフィーZXのオートストップ値を 1. 0 に設定して超音波エンドファイルで破折間隙を切削．③化学的拡大群： 10 -３溶液５分，NC 2 分の処理を３回．④併用群：②の後に③の処理．４群ともスーパーボンドで破折間隙を接着後，色素侵入試験を行った．その結果，併用群においては歯根表面に切削が達している試料はなく，その色素侵入率は他の３群と比較して有意に小さかった（p＜ 0. 05 ）． 　以上の結果から，超音波エンドファイルによる破折間隙の切削と化学的な拡大を併用することは，過剰な切削を防止して封鎖性を向上するのに有効である...|$|E
