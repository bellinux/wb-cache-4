In 1805, Lambert's gaol closed. By this time, he weighed , and had become the heaviest authenticated person up to that point in recorded history. Unemployable and <b>sensitive</b> <b>about</b> his bulk, Lambert became a recluse.|$|E
5|$|An {{extended}} {{version of the}} film, including altered special effects, was released on March 22, 2002. Certain shots of E.T. had bothered Spielberg since 1982, as {{he did not have}} enough time to perfect the animatronics. Computer-generated imagery (CGI), provided by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), was used to modify several shots, including ones of E.T. running in the opening sequence and being spotted in the cornfield. The spaceship's design was also altered to include more lights. Scenes shot for but not included in the original version were introduced. These included E.T. taking a bath, and Gertie telling Mary that Elliott went to the forest on Halloween. Spielberg did not add the scene featuring Harrison Ford, feeling that would reshape the film too drastically. He became more <b>sensitive</b> <b>about</b> the scene where gun-wielding federal agents confront Elliott and his escaping friends and had them digitally replaced with walkie-talkies.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the maximum}} calibre of naval gun allowed under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was 40.6cm (16inch), Hitler soon had second {{thoughts}} about the guns {{to be used for}} the new ships and ordered that they be armed with 38cm (15inch) weapons. However, the 28.3cm turrets were readily available; 38cm turrets would take years to develop, and Hitler wanted capital ships as soon as possible to fulfill his political ideals. He was also reminded that, despite the allowances of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, the British had historically been <b>sensitive</b> <b>about</b> increases in main gun calibers aboard German capital ships. He therefore acquiesced to the ships' being armed with 28.3cm guns, with the provision that they be upgunned to 38cm at the earliest opportunity. The 38cm turret was eventually used in the s.|$|E

5|$|Although Elgar {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely <b>sensitive</b> <b>about</b> his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married {{the daughter of a}} senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a {{temporary}} worker Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) {{so that she}} can take her place when she goes on maternity leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is <b>sensitive</b> <b>about</b> her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist he is telling the truth Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E

He was known among comedic contemporaries and friends to be <b>sensitive</b> <b>about</b> how his comedy was perceived ("fatty falls down, everybody goes home happy"), and was particularly hurt by harsh critical reactions to Tommy Boy, a film he enjoyed making.|$|E

Throughout her life, she wore either full or three-quarter length sleeves to hide the scars. The half-forearm style became as much a Gracie Allen trademark as her many aprons and her illogical logic. When the couple moved to Beverly Hills and acquired a swimming pool, Gracie put on a bathing suit and swam {{the length of the}} pool to prove to her children that she could swim. (She fought a longtime fear of drowning by privately taking swimming lessons.) She never put on a bathing suit or entered the pool again.|$|E
25|$|Though {{celestial}} {{marriage is}} the only form of marriage recognized as a sacrament, the church permits sex within government-recognized marital unions, the notable exceptions being same-sex marriage, common law marriage, civil unions (in jurisdictions where marriage is available), and polygamy. The church is <b>sensitive</b> <b>about</b> its historical relationship with polygamy, and entry into a polygamous marriage, even where legal, will result in mandatory consideration of church discipline and possible excommunication. Today, the church's teachings allow married couples to decide what is appropriate sexual behavior between themselves. The law of chastity has also been interpreted to include various standards of modesty, which have varied according to cultural norms of the time. Serious offenses {{of the law of}} chastity may result in church discipline, including the possibility of excommunication.|$|E

25|$|The Baltic republics {{were largely}} {{isolated}} {{from the outside world}} between the late 1940s and the mid-1980s. The Soviets were <b>sensitive</b> <b>about</b> the Baltic area not only because concerns about its loyalty, but also because of a number of military installations located there due to its proximity to several non Eastern Bloc states, including surveillance centres and a submarine base. During the late 1960s, Soviet democratic movements found support amongst Baltic intellectuals. The Soviet Union signed the Helsinki Accords and the following year, a monitoring group was founded in Lithuania which produced dissident publications during the 1970s and 1980s. Nationalism and religion inspired people to small-scale demonstrations and underground activities. The European Parliament passed a resolution supporting the Baltic cause in 1982.|$|E
25|$|As the Austrian army of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen {{closed up}} to the Lahn, Jourdan was {{particularly}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>about</b> his left flank. Twice before he had been driven back from the Lahn after the Austrians turned his left flank. This time he placed too much strength near Wetzlar and Giessen. The Battle of Limburg began on 16 September when Austrians under Paul Kray mounted a strong attack against Giessen. Jourdan called up his reserves and repulsed Kray in fighting during which Jacques Philippe Bonnaud was mortally wounded. But Charles launched his main attack against Marceau's position at Limburg an der Lahn and Diez in the center. Despite the odds, the division of Andr√© Poncet held its ground stubbornly through eight hours of combat, retaining Limburg but yielding a small bridgehead at Diez. Marceau believed the situation was well in hand and planned to retake Diez the next morning with four battalions of infantry and eight squadrons of cavalry.|$|E
