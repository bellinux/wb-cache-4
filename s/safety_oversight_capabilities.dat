40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years, {{aircraft}} maintenance outsourcing has driven strong growth in the third-party Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility industry. In the United States, deficiencies in <b>safety</b> <b>oversight</b> and regulation {{have played a role}} in some maintenance-related incidents. Since then, Congress wrote legislation to require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to improve its <b>safety</b> <b>oversight,</b> particularly of offshore facilities. However, there has been no such pressure driving improvement in Australia. Questions have been raised about the poor practices in some offshore MRO facilities and about the <b>safety</b> <b>oversight</b> of offshored maintenance. This article argues that the existing system, based on International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, cannot provide certainty that the planes of Australian-registered airlines are maintained to best practice standards. This is for two reasons: the regulations have gaps and enforcement of the regulations leaves much to be desired...|$|R

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has responsibility for safety and industry promotion, licenses operations of commercial space launches and launch sites. To allow the industry to grow, Congress prohibited FAA from regulating crew and passenger safety before 2012, except in response to high-risk events. GAO evaluated FAA's (1) <b>safety</b> <b>oversight</b> of commercial space launches, (2) response to emerging issues, and (3) challenges in regulating and promoting space tourism and responding to competitive issues affecting the industry.
