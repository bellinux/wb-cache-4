40|$|Radish <b>sprouts</b> and <b>broccoli</b> <b>sprouts</b> {{have been}} implicated in having a {{potential}} chemoprotective effect against certain types of cancer. Each contains a glucosinolate that {{can be broken down}} to an isothiocyanate capable of inducing chemoprotective factors known as phase 2 enzymes. In the case of broccoli, the glucosinolate, glucoraphanin, is converted to an isothiocyanate, sulforaphane, while in radish a similar glucosinolate, glucoraphenin, is broken down to form the isothiocyanate, sulforaphene. When sprouts are consumed fresh (uncooked), however, the principal degradation product of broccoli is not the isothiocyanate sulforaphane, but a nitrile, a compound with little anti-cancer potential. By contrast, radish sprouts produce largely the anti-cancer isothiocyanate, sulforaphene. The reason for this difference is likely to be due to the presence in broccoli (and absence in radish) of the enzyme cofactor, epithiospecifier protein (ESP). In vitro induction of the phase 2 enzyme, quinone reductase (QR), was significantly greater for radish <b>sprouts</b> than <b>broccoli</b> <b>sprouts</b> when extracts were self-hydrolysed. By contrast, boiled radish sprout extracts (deactivating ESP) to which myrosinase was subsequently added, induced similar QR activity to <b>broccoli</b> <b>sprouts.</b> The implication is that radish sprouts have potentially greater chemoprotective action against carcinogens than <b>broccoli</b> <b>sprouts</b> when hydrolysed under conditions similar to that during human consumption...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Variety {{and crop}} {{management}} strategies affect {{the content of}} bioactive compounds (phenolics, flavonoids and glucosinolates) in green broccoli (calabrese) types, which are cultivated during summer and autumn in temperate European climates. <b>Sprouting</b> <b>broccoli</b> types are morphologically distinct and are grown over the winter season and harvested until early spring. Thus they show considerable potential for development as an import substitution crop for growers and consumers during the ‘hungry gap’ of early spring. The present study investigated the effect of variety and management practices on phytochemical content {{in a range of}} <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli</b> varieties. RESULTS: Yields were significantly higher in white <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli</b> varieties. Levels of phenolics and flavonoids were in the range 81. 6 - 270. 4 and 16. 9 – 104. 8 mg 100 g - 1 FW respectively depending on year and cultivar, and were highest in varieties TZ 5052, TZ 5055, Red Admiral and Improved White Sprouting. In-row spacing did not affect flavonoid content. Phenolic and flavonoid content generally increased with increasing floret maturity and levels were high in edible portions of the crop. Crop wastes (leaf and flower) contained 145. 9 - 239. 3 and 21. 5 – 116. 6 mg 100 g - 1 FW total phenolics and flavonoids respectively depending on cultivar, tissue and year. Climatic factors had a significant effect on phenolic and flavonoid content. Levels of total and some individual glucosinolates were higher in <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli</b> than in the green broccoli variety Ironman.

40|$|This paper presents, in Part One, {{a review}} of some basic {{marketing}} concepts involved in market and demand identification. The {{second part of the}} paper applies some of the concepts to a market evaluation of the prospects for frozen green <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli.</b> Two major market types are identified. These are the consumer and industrial markets. The industrial market can be further subdivided into the producer and reseller markets. Each market type has characteristics that allow it to be considered significantly different from the other types and, therefore, requires a relatively unique approach. The markets are described in terms of four distinct aspects of their activity. Products, which move through these markets, are defined as goods. These goods can be categorised into relatively distinct groups which require dissimilar marketing approaches. In order to identify the marketing approach most likely to be successful, the objectives of the purchaser must also be identified. These objectives will be fulfilled through a purchasing organisation which carries out purchasing operations. The characteristics of these four areas (goods, objectives, organisation and operations) will be significantly different between the different market types. Marketing activity can therefore be designed to take full account of these differences and therefore ensure maximum return on the marketing effort. Having identified the type of market with which the marketer is concerned and the type of marketing action indicated, the emphasis must then be on identifying the level and type of demand likely to be available. The objective is to measure the possible level of demand given varying sets of circumstances related to product price, competitor prices, promotion, quality, service, etc. Demand sensitivity analysis can also be undertaken to determine the likely responsiveness of the market to changes in specific variables. Demand identification must take place with two distinct time periods in mind. A short term forecast (up to one year) is essential for production activity decisions, while a long term forecast is essential for planning major production facility changes. Short term, or current, demand forecasts are often made from forecasts of demand for particular product classes with the refinement of the forecast until the individual product is isolated. A further method involves assessing total market potential for a product. This involves {{a review of}} all potential users of a product class and an assessment of the likely share of the potential market that can be achieved. Longer term demand assessments are most commonly made through use of a consumer survey. Other important methods are sales personnel forecasts, purchase of outside expertise, market testing and statistical analysis. The use of a marketing orientation in a competitive market is considered essential. The design of products to meet identified consumer requirements is the crucial element of a marketing approach. A product orientation is not compatible with achievement of a significant level of business success, especially in a competitive field. Part Two of the paper presents a report on a study of the market potential for frozen green <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli.</b> The market types identified covered the range from the consumer market through reseller market to producer market. The major markets are the consumer and reseller markets. A full survey of Christchurch supermarkets was carried out in order to assess the current reseller market position and the likely future for the product in this market. This survey involved discussion with the supermarket frozen goods manager and independent research into the position of frozen green <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli</b> in the vegetable market area. It was assessed that a significant potential for the product exists and that current demand from the reseller market could be stimulated through increased promotion at a retail level. The producer market analysis involved a review of the restaurant trade to assess the present and likely future usage of frozen green <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli</b> in this area. A significant potential demand for the product was identified from restaurants already using frozen vegetables and those with a high green vegetable requirement (e. g. Chinese restaurants), especially in the period when fresh broccoli is in short supply. As a result of the typical nature of a producer market, expansion of sales is likely to be more difficult than in the reseller market and careful attention will have to be paid to product quality and supply certainty. A very limited survey of the consumer market was undertaken. A consumer survey at point of sale was the method employed. As the product has only a low sales throughput at present (primarily due to low supplies) a significant consumer representation was not able to be obtained. No firm conclusions can therefore be drawn from this section of the study. Overall, a significant market potential for frozen green <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli</b> does appear to exist. The major area of demand will be from the reseller market and potential exists in the producer market for increased sales...|$|E

Methods Leaf material of purple <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli</b> ‘Santee’, Savoy cabbage ‘Wintessa’, and the wild B. oleracea accession Winspit was analysed for GSL production and used for biofumigation experiments on the beneficial soil invertebrates, Folsomia candida (springtail) and Eisenia andrei (earthworm) and the soil bacterial community. Results When mixed into soil, the Winspit plant material exerted the highest toxic effects on beneficial soil invertebrates by reducing survival and reproduction. Total GSL levels varied substantially between genotypes, in particular the aliphatic GSL (AGSL) sinigrin and gluconapin being highly abundant or exclusively present in Winspit. Differences between the genotypes regarding biofumigation effects on the soil microbial community were only observed on a temporal basis with the largest difference in bacterial community structure after 1 week.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Broccoli {{consumption}} {{has been}} associated with a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) derived from glucosinolates that accumulate in broccoli are dietary compounds that may mediate these health effects. Sulforaphane (SF, 4 -methylsulphinylbutyl ITC) derives from heading broccoli (calabrese) and iberin (IB, 3 -methylsulphinypropyl ITC) from <b>sprouting</b> <b>broccoli.</b> While there are many studies regarding the biological activity of SF, mainly undertaken with cancerous cells, there are few studies associated with IB. METHODS: Primary epithelial and stromal cells were derived from benign prostatic hyperplasia tissue. Affymetrix U 133 Plus 2. 0 whole genome arrays were used to compare global gene expression between these cells, and to quantify changes in gene expression following exposure to physiologically appropriate concentrations of SF and IB. Ontology and pathway analyses were used to interpret results. Changes in expression of a subset of genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Global gene expression profiling identified epithelial and stromal-specific gene expression profiles. SF induced more changes in epithelial cells, whereas IB was more effective in stromal cells. Although IB and SF induced different changes in gene expression in both epithelial and stromal cells, these were associated with similar pathways, such as cell cycle and detoxification. Both ITCs increased expression of PLAGL 1, a tumor suppressor gene, in stromal cells and suppressed expression of the putative tumor promoting genes IFITM 1, CSPG 2, and VIM in epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that IB and SF both alter genes associated with cancer prevention, and IB should be investigated further as a potential chemopreventative agent. ...|$|E

Spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRsp) and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were placed either on a control diet of modified AIN- 93 G or an experimental diet of modified AIN- 93 G supplemented with dried <b>broccoli</b> <b>sprouts.</b> The following parameters were examined: 1. Isothiocyanate absorption (an increased level of dithiocarbamates is reflective of ITC absorption), 2. Oxidative stress (a reduction in oxidative stress is evidenced by an increase in plasma protein thiols and blood glutathione (GSH)), 3. Acute phase proteins (a decreased APR is reflected by an increase in plasma albumin and a decrease in ceruloplasmin), 4. Activity of phase 2 enzymes (increased phase 2 enzyme induction results in higher activities of liver quinone reductase (QR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR)). My experimental results demonstrated that <b>broccoli</b> <b>sprout</b> feeding results in higher protein thiol levels in female SHRsp and higher blood GSH levels in males but no acute phase protein changes were observed in either male or female SHRsp. <b>Broccoli</b> <b>sprout</b> feeding caused higher QR and lower GST activities in female SHRsp but did not affect the activities of phase 2 enzymes in male SHRsp.
