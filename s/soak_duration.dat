40|$|As {{fisheries}} {{shift towards}} ecosystem-based management, {{the need to}} reduce impacts on by-catch has been increasingly recognised. In this study the catch composition, discard rate, and post-capture survival of species caught by gillnets in Tasmania, Australia, was investigated. Over half the commercial gillnet catch was discarded, with discard rates of ~ 20 % for target and > 80 % for non-target species. Capture condition, including initial mortality, was assessed using simple criteria {{for a range of}} species and related to <b>soak</b> <b>duration.</b> Delayed mortality was also assessed using tank trials and related to capture condition. By combining initial and delayed mortality rates post-capture survival was estimated. Longer soak durations generally resulted in slight, but significant, declines in capture condition and lower initial survival. Nonetheless, when combined with delayed survival, four of the five most commonly caught species (Cheilodactylus spectabilis, Latridopsis forsteri, Aplodactylus arctidens, Cephaloscyllium laticeps) exhibited high post-capture survival (83 - 100 %) for soak durations within the maximum regulated range. Post-capture survival of the one remaining commonly caught species, Notolabrus tetricus, (typically discarded) declined with increased <b>soak</b> <b>duration</b> from 84 % to 62 %, suggesting that this species would benefit from a further reduction in maximum <b>soak</b> <b>duration.</b> Initial and delayed survival rates for the species retained for tank trials exhibited a significant linear relationship, which was used to estimate delayed survival rates for the rarer species. This method enabled the estimation of potential post-capture survival rates for a diverse range of species and may have application in other data-limited situations where the relationships between fishing practices and by-catch survival are uncertain. Overall, our results suggest that <b>soak</b> <b>duration</b> regulation has been effective in reducing by-catch mortality for many species, noting that some species have low survival rates regardless of <b>soak</b> <b>duration...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} factors {{affecting}} the mortality of discarded Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Last update: July 16, 2011 Previous {{assessments of the}} Gulf of Maine Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock have included estimates of discards from the commercial and recreational fisheries. These estimates have assumed {{that there was no}} survival of fish discarded at sea. The topic of discard mortality and evaluation of appropriate mortality rates was included as a term of reference for the most recent Gulf of Maine cod assessment (NEFSC, 2012). Ultimately, the assessment concluded “…that the published studies probably overestimated survival, although it was difficult to characterize the extent of the bias. The discard mortality rates to be used in SARC 53 for Gulf of Maine cod are 100 % for all gears. ” There is a growing body of literature suggesting that there may be some survival of fish discarded at sea with the survival contingent on multiple factors including gear type, fish size, depth, season, <b>soak</b> <b>duration</b> and overall handling care. Incorporating the results from experimental studies into absolute estimates of fisheries removals is difficult due to the number of factors, the high degree of interactions effects and the uncertainty in the general population. This paper provides an overview of the scientific literature relevant to the survival of Atlantic cod discarded in the commercial fishery. While recreational catch is an important component of total catches of cod in United States waters, no known information exists on the survival of cod discarded in the recreational fishery...|$|E

We measured the effect of Save Wave alarms on the incidence of dolphin depredation and target fish catches. The study had two goals: (1) to quantify the effect of alarms on target species catch and (2) to quantify the effect of alarms on dolphin depredation. Fieldwork was conducted off Hatteras during June and August 2004. During this period, we attached alarms to 118 Spanish mackerel gillnet sets (63 active and 55 control). All catches were standardized for effort by incorporating measures of net length and <b>soak</b> <b>duration.</b> We collected data on total catch-per-unit effort (CPUE), Spanish mackerel CPUE, counts of fish discards, and evidence of depredation.

We observed several dolphins interacting with nets with active alarms, but did not observe a sufficient amount of dolphin depredation to quantify their response to the Save Wave alarms. These results suggest that Save Wave alarms do not affect fish catches.

Gibberellin, GA 3 or GA 4 f 7 at 100 ppm, alone or combined with 100 ppm Benzladenine (BA) or 500 ppm ethephon were incorporated in - 10 bar polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution to formulate nine treatments. Seeds were primed for 7 or 14 days at 15 C and seed germination was evaluated at 15, 25, and 35 C. The effect of seed priming in PEG on total germination in all three lots was not improved by the addition of growth regulators. Seed priming was more effective in improving seed germination at 25 C than 15 C, and was highly effective at a constant high temperature of 35 C. The effect of priming treatment was dependent on seed lot quality. Germination at 25 and 35 C of lot 2, which was judged to be of good quality, was improved by all treatments regardless of prime duration, whereas that of lots 1 and 3 was only improved after 14 days of priming by some of the treatments. Although addition of GA 3, ethephon, or GA 3 + ethephon to PEG did not result in improvement in seed germination compared to the PEG treatment alone, their addition helped improve germination compared to the nontreated control, whenever PEG failed to do so. Thus, addition of hormones might improve the performance of some seed lots which do not respond to priming in PEG alone. The use of high quality seed for priming is recommended to obtain the best results from priming. The use of primed seed during the warm part of the growing season in Florida could result in improved carrot stand establishment. Failure to obtain uniform field stands is a major factor limiting optimum yields in the production of carrots. Poor stands occur when planting is done during extremely warm temperatures (such as Aug. or Sept. in California or Florida) or by planting in cold soil temperatures (early spring in most northern climates). Seed priming {{has been shown to be}} useful in promoting seed germination under unfavorable conditions, and enhanced germination even under ideal conditions (Ells, 1963; Guedes and Cantliffe, 1977; Heydecker et al., 1975; Heydecker and Coolbear, 1977; Koehler, 1967; Parera and Cantliffe, 1994; Sachs, 1977; Salter and Darby, 1976). The use of seed priming allows the seed to imbibe water slowly, permitting the early stages of germination to begin without radicle protrusion through the seed coat.

PPF {{was treated with}} sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at various concentrations and <b>soaking</b> <b>durations.</b> Oil content analysis showed that the removal of oil residue was largely influenced by soaking time rather than NaOH concentration. The result {{was supported by a}} Fourier transform infra red analysis, where the peak intensities of carbonyl groups (C= 0) at 1630 - 1700 cm' 1 and alkene (C=C) at 1596 cm' 1 decreased with <b>soaking</b> <b>durations.</b> Longer <b>soaking</b> <b>duration</b> led to fully-swollen PPF cellulose chains, thus allowing more oil to be easily removed {{from the surface of the}} fibre. However, the removal rate was gradually decreased after 6 hours, probably due to the difficulty to remove the oil trapped among the entangled-swollen cellulose chains. The crystalline phase of PPF was changed into the amorphous rich phase, as shown by the shifted of bonded-OH stretching band at 3280 cm' 1 to freed-OH at 3345 cm' 1. In addition, the decrease of area under the curve of melting temperature (Tm) and the heat of melting from the differential scanning calorimetry analysis supported the findings. Meanwhile, LDPE/PPF biocomposite was prepared by blending the LDPE resin with various percentages of PPF and glycerol. The mixtures were compounded using a single screw extruder prior to blown extrusion into films. Results from the melt flow index and rheological tests showed that the addition of PPF increased the shear stress and viscosity of samples, owing to the restriction of chain mobility of LDPE by PPF particles. Higher PPF loading had also decreased the tensile strength and elongation at break of the film due to agglomeration of PPF’s particles that caused phase separation between PPF-LDPE matrix, thus weakening the strength of the samples. The formation of a discrete phase observed on the micro-images taken from the scanning electron microscopy supported the results. Meanwhile, increasing the amount of PPF from 3 wt% to 7 wt% had increased at about 43 % water absorption in 30 days due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between the OH groups of PPF, glycerol and water. This condition provided a suitable environment for the growth of microorganisms thus increasing the biodegradation rate of the samples at an average of 31 % weight loss in 12 weeks. However, Tm and the degree of crystallinity were unaffected with increasing PPF content as these properties are strongly influenced by LDPE...|$|R

This new method is expected to create a reliable differentiation between the enriched seeds and natural ones and consequently between the corresponding seedlings. & Results We showed that acorns of Quercus variabilis and Cyclobalanopsis glauca and seeds of Pinus koraiensis soaked in 15 N-urea solutions were successfully enriched. We did not find that δ 15 N value of seeds was a linear function of 15 N-urea <b>soaking</b> <b>duration.</b> However, with high urea dosage and extending <b>soaking</b> <b>duration,</b> the δ 15 N values in seedlings of Q. variabilis and P. koraiensis were higher than those of normal plants.

Its seed germination is inherently poor and becomes unpredictable, especially in semi-arid regions characterized by low rainfall, due to its extended period of dormancy. Thus its use for railway batters erosion control becomes a major concern where the development of good grass cover within a short time is required to minimize the risk of damage from storms. The effects of different germination media, and concentrations and <b>soaking</b> <b>duration</b> of sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) on seed germination were evaluated. Final seed germination without treatment was only 18 %, 15 % and 12 % in the potting mix, heavy clay soil and petridish, respectively. Final germination percentage and velocity of germination was significantly greater with potting mix, followed by clay and paper towelling. Similarly, days to first germination, final germination and mean time to germination (MTG) were significantly earlier for potting mix, followed by clay and paper towelling. Seed germination was highest (94 %) on 4 min of soaking with concentrated H 2 SO 4, and declined with extended soaking reaching to a lethal duration after 10 min. Seed germination was lower with lower concentration of the acid. Increasing acid concentration enhanced first germination, shorter duration for final germination and shorter MTG.

40|$|Putting {{an end to}} {{the rapid}} {{deterioration}} of concrete structures in the United States will only occur through the introduction of better materials and construction methods. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) reports the overall condition of concrete bridges in the United States to be a 2 ̆ 2 C+ 2 ̆ 2. Though better than other areas of the infrastructure, there is still room for improvement in concrete bridges. One major area that may be improved is that of the concrete bridge deck. The bridge deck is comprised of the actual driving surface. It is subject to many deterioration mechanisms including freeze/thaw cycles, de-icing salts, and cyclic loading. The bridge deck must be highly durable to combat the negative effects it is subjected to. A recent advancement to increase durability is the placement of a pre-saturated lightweight aggregate (LWA) inside concrete. This LWA will offset cracking associated with drying shrinkage and self-desiccation. The pre-saturated LWA is an expanded clay or expanded shale material is able to absorb water into the pores of its structure and release that water to hydrating cement. The current research is focused on determining the effects of this LWA <b>soaking</b> <b>durations</b> of 1, 3, and 7 days. A constant replacement rate of 300 lbs/yd 3 was used for the current study. A control mixture was cast for comparison purposes which contained no LWA. The research program concrete mix designs were developed in accordance with the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department bridge deck specification. Reported results included shrinkage/strain, compressive strength, modulus of rupture, and modulus of elasticity. Findings indicated that a 1 day soaked LWA preformed equivalent or better than extended <b>soaking</b> <b>durations</b> at mitigating concrete shrinkage...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{study on}} the {{crystallization}} behavior of a soda-lime-silica glass composition incorporating rice straw ash was carried out. Melting was carried out at 1500 °C in an alumina crucible for 5 hours. The glass produced was examined by differential scanning calorimetry to determine the glass transition and crystallization temperatures for use as heat-treatment temperatures to transform the glass into glass-ceramics. A similar composition made up using industrial chemicals was also melted for comparative purposes. Both glasses were heat-treated at 750 oC and 920 oC for 3 different <b>soaking</b> <b>durations.</b> Both glasses exhibited crystallization from the outer surface which increased in thickness as the soaking time was increased. Scanning electron microscopy was used to study the thickness and identity of the crystalline phases formed. Density and hardness measurements showed that the rice straw glass ceramics exhibited higher values than the glass-ceramics using industrial chemicals. The morphologies of the fracture surfaces of both glass-ceramic compositions were also evaluated by scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{amorphous}} silicon carbon (a-SiC:H) film deposited by the Hot Wire Chemical Vapor Deposition (HWCVD) technique on silicon substrates were soaked in simulated body fluid (SBF). Characterization {{of the film}} with different <b>soaking</b> <b>durations</b> in SBF {{was carried out by}} Fourier Transform Infrared (MR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurements. It was found that the relative amounts of carbon in the a-SiC:H film surface decreases with increase in soaking period. XPS results showed the adsorption of Ca and Mg on the a-SiC:H surface. This indicates the formation of negatively charged surface possibly due to formation of silanol groups or dissolution of carbon to SBF confirming the bioactivity of the material. Contact angle decreased from 74 degrees to 65 degrees during 30 days of soaking in the body fluid. Present study is an attempt to observe the interaction of a-SiC:H film prepared by HWCVD technique with the body environment for its future suitability as artificial heart valve and stent coating materials.

Enzyme cleansers are developed in attempt {{to break down the}} organic components of denture plaque. The aim of this research is to determine the efficient cleansing duration of papain solution to remove 24 -hour denture plaque. The research was done on 16 patients with complete dentures. Plaque removal was determined by Lowry method and SDS PAGE. The result shows that papain dose required to hydrolyze 24 -hour dentue plaque is 15. 66 TU/mg enzyme activity for 10 minutes soaking. Soaking the denture in papain for 10 minutes makes all of the detected plaque protein bands remobe. In conclusion, efficient cleansing duration of papain solution to remove 24 -hour denture plaque is papain activity of 15. 66 TU/mg by <b>soaking</b> <b>duration</b> of 10 minutes.

Optimization of grafting of acrylonitrile onto cellulosic material was performed by varying the reaction conditions, such as the <b>duration</b> of <b>soaking</b> of cellulosic material in ceric ammonium nitrate solu-tion, concentration of ceric ammonium nitrate solution, polymerization time, temperature of reaction, and acrylonitrile concentration and saponification time, in order to study their influence on percent grafting yield and grafting effi-ciency. The resulting cellulosic-g-polyacrylonitrile (PAN) copolymers were frac-tionated by extraction at 33 °C with N,N’-dimethylformamide. Fractions were characterized by determining both the % add-on and the free polymer. Saponi-fication of grafted copolymer was done by reaction with sodium hydroxide foll-owed by methanol precipitation. The absorbent polymer so produced gave fair water retention values.

Density of the composites decreased wit h increase in PMMA content, while, biaxial flexural strength (BFS) was 21 MPa for 20 wt. % PMMA and beyond which it decreased. A correlation between phase compositions of AW glass ceramics with BFS was attempted from the XRD results. In vitro bioactivity of the composites in a simulated body fluid (SBF) showed {{the formation of}} spherical globules on the surface within 7 days of soaking as observed by environmental SEM. Thin film XRD and EDX measurement confirmed these globules to be bone like apatite with Ca/P ratio 1. 53 and FTIR measurement showed the corresponding peaks for phosphates.
