40|$|Given {{the fragile}} nature of fish {{stocks in the}} North Sea, it is of {{increasing}} importance to produce accurate and informed estimates of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> {{for the purpose of}} setting TACs. In order to do this, realistic and reliable estimates of fishing mortality and the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> are needed. This paper will summarise a project currently underway in north-east Scotland which aims to improve stock estimates for fisheries management by making use of fishermen’s knowledge. Within the project, information will be collected from fishermen in two main areas; (a) assessments on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks,</b> and (b) factors influencing the level of fishing effort. The information on fishermen’s perceptions on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks,</b> and on how they make these assessments, will provide an opportunity to fine-tune current assessment procedures, thereby improving stock estimates for TAC purposes. Information on the factors that influence the level of fishing effort will provide policy-makers and fisheries managers with {{a better understanding of how}} fishermen make decisions that influence their fishing behaviour. This should then facilitate the process of designing more effective policy tools for controlling fishing effort. The overall aim of the project is to increase the reliability of stock assessments for management purposes, to take more formal account of the social and economic factors which influence fishing activities, with an ultimate aim of incorporating fishermen’s knowledge into management decision-making...|$|E

Our analysis is based on a bio-economic model which is examined as a dynamic control system in continuous time. Feasible development paths are discussed in detail. It is shown that participatory management may lead to serious problems if a purely resource-based management strategy is employed. The analysis suggests that a less risky management strategy can be implemented if limited data are available. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{status of}} the Mediterranean and Black Sea {{fisheries}} was evaluated for the period 1970 - 2010 on a subarea basis, using various indicators including the temporal variability of total landings, the number of recorded stocks, the mean trophic level of the catch, the fishing-in-balance index and the catch-based method of stock classification. All indicators confirmed that the fisheries resources of the Mediterranean and Black Sea are at risk from overexploitation. The pattern of exploitation and the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> differed among the western (W), central (C) and eastern (E) Mediterranean subareas and the Black Sea (BS), with the E Mediterranean and BS fisheries being in a worst shape.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{biological}} aspects and {{exploitation of the}} mackerel (Scomber scombrus) stocks occurring in the North Sea. The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> and exploitation in the North Sea area are investigated {{on the basis of}} annual releases of tagged fish and samples of commercial catches. Two populations occur, one spawning in the North Sea, the other in the Celtic Sea. The stocks are quite mixed, especially in the older age groups. Following the introduction of the purse-seine fishery, the North Sea stock (age three years and older) was fished down from a level of 2 5 million tonnes in the early 1960 's to about 250 000 tonnes in 1971. Since 1970 the fishery has been regulated, resulting in some recovery of the stock. The recruitment of the 1962 to 1971 year classes has fluctuated within the range 12 : 1. Assuming a recruitment level equal to the average recruitment of these year classes, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of the North Sea stock is estimated at 250 000 tonnes per year. The distribution area of mackerel is found to be related to stock size. The decline in stock size resulted in the disappearance of mackerel from fishing grounds previously exploited by conventional gears, whereas the availability of mackerel to the purse seine in offshore waters is only slightly affected. Density-dependent growth is indicated by an increased growth rate of the 1969 year class compared with that of the 1962 year class...|$|E

40|$|A {{permanent}} FAO/CECAF Working Group {{composed of}} {{scientists from the}} coastal countries and from those countries or organizations playing {{an active role in}} demersal fisheries in Central-West Africa, was created by CECAF in 2000. The first meeting of Subgroup North was organized in Saly, Senegal, from 14 to 23 September 2004. The overall objective of the Group is to contribute to the improvement of the management of demersal resources in Northwest Africa through assessment of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> and fisheries to ensure the best sustainable use of the resources for the benefit of coastal countries. The study zone for the Working Group is the CECAF zone of the Central-East Atlantic Ocean between Cap Spartel and the south of Senegal. For reasons of heterogeneity, the species and stocks assessed by the Working Group were divided into four groups: hake, other demersal fish, shrimps and cephalopods. For each of these groups information is provided on the fisheries: sampling schemes and sampling intensity, biological characteristics, stock identity, trends (catch, effort, biological data and abundance indices), assessment, management recommendations and future research. Approximately twenty eight different stocks-units were analysed and the results discussed. The models provided reliable results for twenty two of them, of which ten are overexploited and twelve seem not to be fully exploited. For five stocks, the results obtained by the models from the available data were not conclusive. Although the model did not give reliable results for these stocks, other information from fisheries and surveys indicate that many of them are overexploited. The results of the assessments confirm the conclusion reached at the last 2010 meeting that most of the stocks assessed are overexploited.

40|$|No poster available. There is a {{consensus}} {{in the scientific community}} that overexploitation of most fisheries worldwide has had significant negative effects on coastal marine ecosystems, and the majority of assessed fish stocks still require rebuilding programs. Almost all of the scientific studies conducted in recent decades have focused primarily on analysis related to the biological state of marine ecosystems (e. g., biomass, fishing effort, catches per unit of effort, trophic levels). However, despite the relevance of the economic effects of fish markets on the patterns of exploitation by fishermen, an analysis linking the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> with fish markets has not been attempted. Herein we describe the first effort to construct a seafood market index to measure the sustainability of seafood products. It is essential to understand not only the behavior of the harvested species from marine ecosystems, but also how economic factors (e. g., prices, concentration of seafood demand, concentration of local markets) can shift the status of exploited species and the strategies used by fishing companies. By combining data on monthly prices, trophic levels, size, and longevity of 130 fresh seafood species traded in the Port of Vigo (Spain) during 2001 - 2009 we demonstrate the potential value of the use of our sustainability of seafood markets index (SSMI). Preliminary results presented herein indicate: (i) a decrease in the unit value of the majority of seafood products, which has increased competitiveness among fishing companies, (ii) a decline of trophic levels of catches in the majority of species, and (iii) an increase in the mean longevity of traded species. These results highlight the need to consider economic factors and link them not only to the evolution of market incentives and their effects (e. g., prices, tax incentives, subsidies), but also to the state of marine resources and the availability of food for human consumption...|$|E
40|$|Demands for {{management}} advice on mixed and multispecies fisheries pose many challenges, {{further complicated by}} corresponding requests for advice on {{the environmental impacts of}} alternate management options. Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (beam trawl, otter trawl, industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the beam and otter trawl fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing beam trawl effort led to greater increases in beam trawl yield when otter trawl effort was low. If otter trawl effort was high, increases in beam trawl effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to FMSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield. Our approach directly addresses the need for assessment methods that treat mixed and multispecies issues collectively, address uncertainty, and take account of trade-offs between weight and value of yield, <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> and state of the environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{fisheries}} management is to provide the conditions for long-term, high and sustainable fishing. Most of the fish stocks in the North-East Atlantic's are transboundary and straddling, and some international agreements {{in the field of}} regulation of their fishing are required for effective management. Achieving multilateral international agreements in the field of fisheries is very difficult and long-term process, because it affects the economic and political interests of the contracting parties. The paper considers results of the analysis of stock dynamics of the most important fishery resources in the North-East Atlantic – herring, blue whiting and mackerel – in different historical periods. As in the past few decades, we have seen periods of both managed and unmanaged fisheries and in relation to the value of stocks of pelagic fish there have been significant fluctuations, in this paper the authors have attempted to estimate the value of concerted international fisheries management to maintain a stable <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> of pelagic fish. Implementation of scientific recommendations agreed by the participating countries of ICES and the joint management of the herring stock management contribute to the preservation of stock stable and optimal levels of withdrawal of the object. The historical experience of the international fishing of blue whiting has shown that compliance by states involved in the fishery advice of ICES and its reserve management activities and promotes the good stock condition. To save the mackerel stock within safe biological boundaries it is necessary to achieve the agreed long-term plan for managing its fisheries between all participants in the fishery. In the long term for the conservation of stocks of herring, blue whiting and North East mackerel in the safe biological boundaries, the international regulation of their fisheries based on the scientific recommendations of ICES in the framework of NEAFC and the Consultations of Coastal States is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Despite major criticism, catch {{per unit}} effort (CPUE) is still widely {{used as a}} measure for {{the size of the}} {{exploited}} stock, but its indicative value is affected by selection of a proper unit of effort. The unit of effort used in the Indonesian fisheries statistical system is poorly standardised with one trip made by a fishing unit of any type. Therefore, changes in catchability, induced by technical innovations cannot be accounted for in official statistics and thus bias the perception of fisheries authorities on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks.</b> This study shows that differences in technical characteristics in a coastal liftnet fishery on small pelagics around Ambon, such as unit size and type of lamps used to attract fish, influence both effort allocation and catch per trip. Larger fishing units (more windlasses) are more commercially orientated. They have a larger nonzero catch per trip–– 1. 5 times larger nonzero catch per added windlass––and ignore potentially small catches, as shows from their higher proportion of zero-catches. The shift from kerosene to electric lamps does not lead to a higher catch per trip, but the use of electric lamps is less laborious, inviting fishermen to fish also under more unfavourable light conditions such as during full moon. Model simulations of average catch per trip of two fishing areas show that technical innovations in the last 20 years have increased the mean catch per trip by a factor of 4. 1 in the fishing area with the largest technical improvements. Technical improvements explain 80 f the change in catch per trip in the official statistics over the last 15 years. Furthermore, the variance in catch per trip among individual fishing units has increased and so has the uncertainty in the average CPUE, as only part of the fishermen implemented technical improvements. Both developments stress the poor indicator value of catch per trip for developments in fish stock biomass and the importance to standardise the unit of effort. The characteristic high variability in catch in this fishery will always obscure effects of technical improvements in more local situations and smaller timeframes. Because of the inconsistent effects of the type of lamps used on the catch rate, it is questionable whether standardising the unit of effort by the type of lamp used will enlarge the precision in the CPUE. Nevertheless, standardising the unit of effort {{by the size of the}} unit will enlarge the precision in, and the indicator value of the CPUE in more aggregated catch data as used on higher levels in the fisheries administration of Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|The ICES Working Group for the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian waters Ecoregion (WGBIE) met in Lisbon, Portugal during 7 – 13 May 2014. There were 23 {{stocks in}} its remit {{distributed}} from ICES Divisions IIIa to IXa though mostly distributed in Sub Ar-eas VII, VIII and IX. There were 18 participants (of whom 2 participated by videocon-ference). The group was tasked with carrying out stock assessments and catch forecasts {{and providing a}} first draft of the ICES advice for 2014 for 16 stocks. 4 stocks were listed as “multiyear”. For those stocks, catch information was updated. For the remaining stocks, WGBIE had to finalise a draft advice prepared by WGNEW. Analytical assessments using age-structured models were conducted for {{the northern and southern}} stocks of megrim, the Bay of Biscay sole and nephrops stocks, whereas the two hake stocks and one southern stock of anglerfish were assessed using models that allow the use of only length-structured data (no age data). A surplus-production model, without age or length structure, was used to assess the second southern stocks of anglerfish. No analytical assessments have been provided for the northern stocks of anglerfish after 2006. This is mostly due to ageing problems and to an increase in dis-cards in recent years, {{for which there is no}} reliable data at the stock level. The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> for which no analytical assessment could be performed was inferred from ex-amination of commercial LPUE or CPUE data and from survey information. Four stocks within the remit of the WG went through the benchmarking process in 2014. For the two southern megrim stocks, the inclusion of discards and some modifi-cations in the assessment model settings were carried out. For northern hake, the ret-rospective pattern issue which arose in last year’s assessment was partly addressed and for southern hake, convergence issues of the assessment model were investigated. Three nephrops stocks from the Bay of Biscay and the Iberian waters are scheduled for benchmark assessments at the start of 2015. The WGBIE meeting spent some time plan-ning this benchmark (see Annex N) together with longer term benchmarks (2016 and after, see section 1.). A recurrent issue significantly constrained the group’s ability to address the terms of reference this year. Despite an ICES datacall with a deadline of 4 weeks before the meeting, data for several stocks were only available at the start of the meeting which lead to increase in workload during the working group, as in that case, the assessments could not be carried out in National Laboratories prior to the meeting as mentioned in the ToRs.

The state of this Pandalus stock in 2005 and 2006 is presented in Sect. 4. 5. It is based on the stock production assessment model and the recent trends in LPUE. The stock seems to be on the same, rather high, level as in recent years. Stock level seems to be well above the suggested reference point (30 % Bmsy). PANDALUS IN THE FLADEN GROUND (IVa). The most recent analytical assessment of this stock was presented in the 1992 ACFM Report (ICES, 1993). Landings have declined gradually from 1999 to 2003, but in 2004 nearly no catches were recorded (23 t). No monitoring of this stock has taken place, but it cannot be ruled out that the dramatic drop in 2004 also reflects a serious decline in the stock, see Section 5. 3. PANDALUS IN THE BARENTS SEA AND SVALDBARD AREA (Subareas I & II). Several models have been applied for assessment of this stock. However in recent years, the views on the state of the stock have been based on survey indices combined with trends in CPUE. SSB appears to have been declining in recent years, see Section 6. 4. BY-CATCH IN THE PANDALUS FISHERIES. Sections 7 and 8 give overviews of the by-catch based on mainly available logbook information. WORKING PROCEDURES JOINT ICES-NAFO MEETINGS. Comparing with the 2004 joint meeting, the 2005 ICES-NAFO meeting saw considerable improvements. The advantages and disadvantages of these joint meetings have become clearer. Disregarding the problems of adapting the ICES and NAFO meeting procedures it is obvious that (Section 2. 1) : A major advantage is the improved opportunities and obligations to discuss scientific and other topics of common interest concerning assessment of Pandalus stocks along with the increased number of scientists at the joint meetings. However, integrated management advice including ecosystem considerations in relation to management, is better discussed on a regional basis...|$|E
40|$|The ICES Working Group on the Assessment of Southern Shelf Stocks of Hake, Monk and Megrim (WGHMM) met in ICES Headquarters during May 10 - 16 2013. There were 24 {{stocks in}} its remit {{distributed}} from ICES Divisions IIIa to IXa though mostly distributed in Sub Areas VII, VIII and IX. There were 17 participants (of whom 2 participated part time and 2 by correspondence). The group was tasked with carrying out stock assessments and catch forecasts {{and providing a}} first draft of the ICES advice for 2013 for 11 stocks. Several stocks, nine functional units for Nephrops {{and some of the}} new stocks from last year’s WG were listed as “biennial 2 nd year”. For those stocks, catch and abundance indices information was updated. In addition, three new stocks were also added to the terms of reference in 2013 (two stocks of sea bass and one stock of striped red mullet). Analytical assessments using age-structured models were conducted for the southern stocks of megrim and the Bay of Biscay sole, whereas the two hake stocks and one southern stock of anglerfish were assessed using models that allow the use of only length-structured data (no age data). A surplus-production model, without age or length structure, was used to assess the second southern stocks of anglerfish. No analytical assessments have been provided for the northern stocks of anglerfish or megrim after 2006. For anglerfish this is mostly due to ageing problems and to an increase in discards in recent years, {{for which there is no}} reliable data at the stock level. For megrim, there have been severe deficiencies in the input data, of which several still remain. The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>stocks</b> for which no analytical assessment could be performed was inferred from examination of commercial LPUE or CPUE data and from survey information. Both hake stocks and both southern megrim stocks are scheduled for benchmark assessments at the start of 2014. The WGHMM meeting spent some time planning this benchmark (see Annex N) together with longer term benchmarks (2015 and after, see section 1.). A recurrent issue significantly constrained the group’s ability to address the terms of reference this year. Despite a deadline of 4 weeks before the meeting, data for several stocks were still not available at the start of the meeting which lead to increase in workload during the working group, as in that case, the assessments could not be carried out in National Laboratories prior to the meeting as mentioned in the ToRs. This is an important matter of concerns for the group members. Section 1 of the report presents a summary by stock and discusses general issues. Section 2 provides descriptions of the relevant fishing fleets and surveys used in the assessment of the stocks. Sections 3 to 13 contain the single stock assessments. This year a new section has been created for the new stocks. Several annexes follow. Additionally, the WG ToRs this year included a reconsideration of the reference points for northern hake (see Annex T) and an assessment of the progress on the interssessional work made on the use of SS 3 to the anglerfish stocks (Lophius budegassa and L. piscatorius) in Divisions VIIb-k and VIIIa,b (see Annex R) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{working paper}} argues that pension funds should adopt a funding {{principle}} {{that is consistent}} with a return on holdings conditional on the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> market. As will be shown, the expected "conditional rate of return" used in making this assessment will vary depending on the current ratio <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> prices to trend corporate earnings. This funding rule will lead to a more even flow of contributions into the fund than a rule that is based on a fixed return for assets over time...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a management that aims at controlling the removal from the stock, {{guided by a}} perception <b>of</b> the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> derived from limited data that does not allow an ordinary analytic assessment. In simulation modeling, there is a 'real' stock and 'real' removals, and the stock develops according to these removals. The management part creates a feed back loop through a noisy link between the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the true <b>stock</b> and the actual removals. The performance of the management {{will depend on how}} the real removal responds to the stock, and how the stock responds to the removals. Structurally, this is a quite simple feed-back system. The interior of the building blocks is complex and diverse, however, and include obstacles like time lags and stochastic terms. When an analytical assessment is not available, the link between the real stock and the management decisions is harder to understand and model, and it may be noisier. The main emphasis in this paper is finding decision rules that rely on sparse and noisy data. A simulation tool runs as a bootstrap and was made to cover a variety <b>of</b> <b>stocks,</b> decision rules and noise in a versatile way, but on a quite generic level. The link between <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> and the basis of the decision was modeled as SSB (or alternatively total stock biomass TSB) derived from the real stock numbers at age, but with random noise and a random year factor. Several types of harvest rules were explored, and pros and cons of various types are highlighted...|$|R
