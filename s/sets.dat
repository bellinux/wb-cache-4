5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain <b>sets</b> of elements are defined to be independent, {{in such a}} way that the independent <b>sets</b> satisfy properties modeled after the properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent <b>sets</b> are the <b>sets</b> of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, John von Neumann {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not <b>sets</b> and treating them differently. Von Neumann stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all <b>sets.</b> He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all <b>sets.</b> This axiom implies that these big classes are not <b>sets,</b> which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. Von Neumann also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all <b>sets.</b> This correspondence well-orders the class of all <b>sets,</b> which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
