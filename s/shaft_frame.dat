40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the existing design solution of shedding mechanism. It is characterised by a heald attachment into the heald shaft with a necessary design allowance. The preparation of a mathematical model for the new concept of the heald attaching to the heald <b>shaft</b> <b>frame</b> is explained in this study. A damping element for dissipating the energy created during the heald impact on the carrying wire of the heald shaft is currently used for the high-speed weaving loom. This system makes use of a damping element, fitted in the profile of the rod at an optimum distance from heald eye. This element provides for reduction of the heald velocity before its drop upon the supporting wire because the opposite section of the heald is pressed into the rubber element. The calculated results of the new concept of the heald attaching to the heald <b>shaft</b> <b>frame</b> are compared with the existing solution without application of the damping element...|$|E
40|$|Designing and {{constructing}} {{resistance welding}} machines involves {{a combination of}} electrical design, machine structures, mechanisms and controls. The machines vary from simple mechanisms to exceptionally complicated units. Monitoring the condition of large upset welding machines in operating industries has attracted increasing interest in recent years owing {{to the need for}} decreasing the energy consumption on production machinery and for reducing the extent of secondary damage caused by failures. Upset Welding (UW) is a resistance welding process utilizing both heat and deformation to form a weld. A micro-setup would certainly reduce heat consumption and offer greater efficiency.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is the problem of {{stability}} and vibration reduction in designed drive systems, in which the essential requirement is to meet the desired dynamic properties. Design/methodology/approach: : The method of stabilisation and reduction has been based on active synthesis, which makes it possible to obtain the desired mechanical effect through the proper selection of dynamic properties of the system, including the calculation of the active force {{as a function of the}} system force feedback. Findings: Presented approach simplifies the process of selecting the dynamical parameters of machine drive systems in view of their dynamical characteristics. Research limitations/implications: The scope of discussion is the synthesis of machine drive systems as discrete models of torsional vibrations. Such vibrations are more difficult to detect than flexural ones, which are accompanied by noise and vibrations of the adjacent elements (for example, <b>shaft</b> <b>frames).</b> Due to the absence of symptoms, torsional vibrations are particularly dangerous, as they may be unnoticeable until the destruction of subsystems occurs. Practical implications: High durability and reliability of drive systems is associated with proper setting of system parameters - inertial, elastical and damping. Proper setting of these parameters is made possible by applying synthesis techniques. Originality/value: We should emphasize that the considered problem varies from other issues met in classic mechanics or control theory.

The device comprises a shape memory alloy wire wound around a low-friction cylindrical drum contrasted by a backup beam spring and fitted to the output shaft through an overrunning clutch. Electrical heating produces a contraction of the wire, hence a rotation of the drum which is transferred to the shaft. Thanks to the overrunning clutch, during the recoiling phase, the drum rotates backward while the shaft does not move. Spurious backward movements of the shaft are contrasted by a second overrunning clutch linking the <b>shaft</b> to the <b>frame.</b> This article develops {{a model for the}} quasi-static simulation of the motor and the experimental characterization of a prototype device featuring three active drums, a rotary sensor and an angular brake to apply the external load.

The major components of the pelletizer were the hopper, rollers, a flat die, <b>shaft,</b> discharge tray, <b>frame,</b> V-belt, V-pulley and electric motor. These components were designed based on strength and rigidity. An electric motor drives the die by a shaft connected to its pulley. The rotation of the die initiates {{the rotation of the}} rollers which pick up the feed material and compress it into the die holes to form pellets.

40|$|Water {{is a very}} {{important}} component in the production process at underground coal mines. Current unfavourable economic conditions have forced the coal mining industry to identify and address every possible bottleneck preventing optimal production. An increase in water-related downtime was identified as one of the bottlenecks at Goedehoop Colliery’s Vlaklaagte Shaft. The purpose of this project was to identify the various causes that contributed to the high downtime (501 hours in 2013, which led to a potential profit loss of R 12. 9 million) and to suggest possible solutions. After a thorough investigation the main causes of water-related downtime were identified as low water pressure and low water flow caused by pipe leakages and bursts. The main root cause for the low water flow and pressure was identified as being the low pressure resistance (1600 kPa) of the thin-walled galvanized steel pipes used in the underground inbye water reticulation system. The pipes were selected according to the previous 1000 kPa pressure requirement for the continuous miner. However, the pressure requirement changed to 1500 kPa, which resulted in the pipes being exposed to much higher pressures than designed for. The water reticulation system was reviewed and current and future underground pipe layout and water requirements were determined for the <b>shaft.</b> The time <b>frame</b> in which the water consumption would be the highest was determined to be between 1 January 2014 and 7 September 2014.

40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} {{preliminary}} weight estimation methods that enable the feasibility studies of novel aero engines. The key contributions {{can be found}} in the analysis of the existing preliminary weight estimation methods, the de- velopment of a new preliminary weight estimation method and the study on the feasibility of a Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine. In more detail, the existing preliminary weight estimation methods are exam- ined in the rst part of the thesis, aiming to de ne their suitability for current turbofan engines, but also for future engine arrangements. For this purpose, they are examined not only quantitatively, to verify their accuracy, but also qualita- tively to gure out if they are able to re ect the key thermodynamic and design parameter variations on weight. Apart from NASA WATE no method achieves either the required accuracy, or simulates the weight trends. Realising the need for a more accurate, robust, exible and extensible method, a new "component based" method that performs basic component design to es- timate engine weight, is devised. Its accuracy is veri ed by comparing the whole engine weight prediction and estimated component design against the publicly available data of two major turbofan engines and the weight predictions of exist- ing weight estimation methods. ATLAS, the tool based on the above method was used to estimate weight over a range of Bypass Ratio (BPR) and Turbine Entry Temperature (TET) values for a Direct Drive Turbofan (DDTF) and a GTF two spool arrangement, reaching the following conclusions: The adjustments of Low Pressure Turbine (LPT) number of stages or geom- etry are not su cient, if high stage isentropic e ciency values are targeted at high BPR values For the examined engine model, with the given weight estimation method- ology, the weight reduction, when a gearbox is introduced at a DDTF, depends on the reduction of LPT stages, with the other components having negligible impact. However, it should be noted that a constant fan diameter was assumed for both con gurations. A fan loss model and more detailed weight estimation of <b>frames,</b> <b>shafts</b> and control and accessories is required to verify this conclusion.

If we relate the history of another place would be completely different, since it would be affected by other factors. For the study of this article we are situated in a mining zone with more than 25 centuries of history placed in the south-east zone of Spain. The Sierra Minera of Cartagena La Unión, at the south of the region of Murcia, occupies approximately approximately 10 x 5 kilometres and has a rectangular surface lengthened in direction North-East – Southwest. In this space we find one of the major accumulations of lead and zinc of the Iberian Peninsula. This mountainous set, which is considered part of the Bética mountain chain in its more oriental part, spreads parallel to the Mediterranean coast from the city of Cartagena up to Cabo de Palos and separates the littoral of the interior plain in which finds the city of La Union. The coastal zone is abrupt whereas the interior has softer mountains, coming up to the plain of the Cartagena's field. In all this Sierra, which colors ocres and reddish made presage to the former civilizations of the existence of mineral The ocres and redish colors along the sierra made presage to the former civilizations of the existence of a greats quantity minerals. In this space we find one of the major accumulations of lead and zinc of the Iberian Peninsula. The coastal situation of this territory, which was favoring the trade with other zones of the Mediterranean, the richness of its lands and fundamentally the mineral richness of its mounts, has motivated that different civilizations have fought to settle on this rich coast. We find a landscape deeply modified, become infested with elements archeoindustrials, as mineral washersy, head <b>frames,</b> <b>shafts,</b> and landscape elements as surgencias, rafts and dumps, which betray to us the great quantity of changes that have realized the different cultures on him it. The Sierra Minera of Cartagena - La Unión is in a zone deeply marked by the changes that suffered historically all the coasts of the Mediterranean Arch. From the Bronze Age we can find settlements in the zone that reflect the first works of mining industry. After the first Phoenician and Greek populations, that used methods of extraction based on wells and galleries technologies, the mining splendour came with the Romans, since they developed a few advanced technologies of exploitation that allowed creating a prosperous mining industry based basically on the lead and the silver. The great economic growth lived in the zone, thanks to the mines, brought the foundation of Carthago-nova, a prosperous Roman settlement with a great trade with other points of the Mediterranean and an advanced urbanism for the epoch. The present Cartagena, especially his old town, is seated on the ruins of buildings of Roman Period. These buildings, are being found nowadays in the works of the new constructions that there is realized in the city, which is giving a great archaeological importance to the same one. The intervention carried out by the Town council to safeguard this great patrimony consists of raising the ground floors and supporting the basements as museum spaces. One of the finds of major importance, that is necessary to highlight, is the Roman Theatre found under the ruins of the city, and that is just now near to his opening to the public once restored by the architect Rafael Moneo. After the Roman occupation, where the great majority of the mineral was extracted, there came near to the depletion of the mines with the means of extraction that existed till then, which led to the abandon of the mines and to a great economic crisis from the 2 nd century D. C. This situation was mixed with a few years of the history become infested with obscurantism, battles and diseases, the Middle Ages, which kept the zone in an economic lethargy of which would not wake up until centuries later. After centuries of almost total absence of the mining activity, arises, from 1840, one most important mining and metallurgical development that allowed to place to the district of Cartagena-La Unión, between the principal producers of lead, not only of Spain, but entire world. The Sierra of Cartagena, between 1860 and 1900, was producing as average 44 % of the production of lead of Spain, which in turn was appearing between the first world producers...|$|R
