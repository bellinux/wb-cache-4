5|$|Exactly who Ælfgar {{received}} {{aid from}} in the Irish Sea region is uncertain. It is conceivable that, after his flight from England in 1055, Ælfgar was outfitted in Dublin, then ruled by Murchad (with Diarmait as overlord). Likewise, since Diarmait's forces had previously driven Echmarcach from Dublin in 1052, and apparently from Mann in 1061, the joint campaign of Ælfgar and Magnús in 1058which utilised Islesmen and Dublinerscould well have involved Diarmait's cooperation as well. That being <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> several reasons to doubt a part played by Diarmait in Ælfgar's military undertakings. For instance, Diarmait seems to have lent assistance to Ælfgar's enemiesthe Godwinsonsin the 1050s and 1060s. Diarmait also appears to have previously backed Cynan ab Iago (fl. 1064), {{a man who was}} a bitter rival and seemingly the eventual slayer of Ælfgar's ally and son-in-law, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn.|$|E
5|$|It {{is notable}} for a carved roof, with lions {{and a small}} cider barrel purportedly carved by the monks of Muchelney Abbey. Sir John Betjeman was also {{inspired}} by an inscription on the candelabra. The church is quite plain on the outside but inside {{is one of the}} finest wooden carved roofs in the county. It is shallow pitched with massive, richly decorated tie beams and short king posts. The whole area of the roof is divided into square carved panels set in the framework of the structural timbers which are decorated with carved bosses where they intersect. There are 640 panels each carved with the same quatrefoil design. In the triangular spaces above each beam are dragon-like beasts. It is <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> bullet holes in the timbers, caused by soldiers who camped in the church in 1646 before the Battle of Langport. The 17th century pulpit and altar table are Jacobean woodwork. There are five other churches in the town, including Catholic and Methodist groups.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated that defense was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E

25|$|Saudi Arabia {{witnessed}} multiple {{terror attacks}} from different {{groups such as}} Al-Qaeda, whose leader, Osama Bin Laden, declared war on the Saudi government. On June 16, 1996, the Khobar Towers bombing killed 19 U.S. soldiers. The 9/11 Commission concluded that Hezbollah, likely {{with the support of}} the Iranian regime, was the perpetrator of that bombing in Saudi Arabia.

25|$|Hogwarts is a coeducational, {{secondary}} boarding school, taking {{children from}} ages eleven to eighteen.

Rowling initially <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> about one thousand students at Hogwarts. She later suggested around six hundred, while acknowledging that this number was still inconsistent with the small number of people in Harry's year. She further explained that this had resulted from her creating only 40 characters for Harry's year.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Health has <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> 650,000 HIV/AIDS cases, {{half of them}} among {{intravenous}} drug users, out of a nation of 1.3 billion people. (Although this overall estimate of HIV and AIDS cases was lowered in January 2006 – in a report put together by the Chinese government, the World Health Organisation and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) – from 840,000 to 650,000, officials say this reflected the use of different statistical methodology rather than {{a drop in the}} incidence.) Epidemiology experts have said that 1.5 million is closer to the true figure.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Marta Mirazon Lahr of the Department of Biological Anthropology at Cambridge University <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> two {{hypotheses}} on {{the origin}} of Mongoloids. Lahr said that one hypothesis is that Mongoloids originated in north Asia due to the regional continuity in this region and this population conforming best to the standard Mongoloid features. Lahr said that the other hypothesis is that Mongoloids originate from Southeast Asian populations that expanded from Africa to Southeast Asia {{during the first half of}} the Upper Pleistocene and then traveled to Australia-Melanesia and East Asia. Lahr said that the morphology of the Paleoindian is consistent with the proto-Mongoloid definition.|$|E

Prosecutors also <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> enough grounds for imprisonment of Lee Seok-ki and his accomplices, considering the following facts. The members of RO, a rebellion group, abided by the rules of organizational security.

25|$|Nearly every {{location}} in the imaginary setting is carried over from Portland's actual geography. The story begins in the protagonists' neighborhood, St. Johns, before moving across the Willamette River and into the impassable Wilderness, that is, The Wood. Pittock Mansion, located just south of Forest Park, appears under its real name, but serves as the seat of government of South Wood, while the Oregon Zoo is represented as the South Wood Prison. The Audubon Society of Portland is in the approximate location of the Avian Principality. Ellis <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a number of large trees in Forest Park, but no specific tree served {{as the model for}} the North Wood Council Tree.|$|E
25|$|Moderator Tom Brokaw of NBC News {{opened the}} debate {{by stating that}} since the first debate, a lot had changed {{in the world and}} for the worse. While Brokaw did not ask the initial questions, he did ask {{follow-up}} ones. When the candidates were asked who they would consider as the next Secretary of the Treasury, John McCain said that he might concur with Obama's suggestion of Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and then went on also to suggest former eBay president Meg Whitman. Barack Obama reiterated the mention of Buffett and <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> also many other qualified Americans. Both candidates said {{that it is important to}} choose as Treasury Secretary someone who earns the trust of the American people. The first 5 questions all were related to the economy.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 the European Union's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) {{reviewed}} {{the safety of}} DEHP in medical devices. The SCENIHR report states that certain medical procedures used in high risk patients result in a significant exposure to DEHP and concludes {{there is still a}} reason for having some concerns about the exposure of prematurely born male babies to medical devices containing DEHP. The Committee <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some alternative plasticizers available for which there is sufficient toxicological data to indicate a lower hazard compared to DEHP but added that the functionality of these plasticizers should be assessed before they can be used as an alternative for DEHP in PVC medical devices. Risk assessment results have shown positive results regarding the safe use of High Molecular Weight Phthalates. They have all been registered for REACH and do not require any classification for health and environmental effects, nor are they on the Candidate List for Authorisation. High phthalates are not CMR (carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction), neither are they considered endocrine disruptors.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{thought the}} {{expansion}} {{would be worth}} the player's investment if they enjoyed Fallout 4. Kirk McKeand (Eurogamer) <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no real choices to make in Nuka-World, though it still may be worthy of your time. Kat Bailey (USgamer) liked the expansion, and {{thought there was a}} lot to do in it, but not all of it is interesting. She said the expansion [...] "could be worse, but it could also be a whole lot better", but if you enjoyed Fallout 4, then [...] "there's good reason to pick up Nuka-World." [...] Nic Rowen (Destructoid) noted fans of the genre will probably enjoy Nuka-World, but others will be left unsatisfied. [...] Tassi believed it was worth the $20. Andrew Webster finished his review by saying Nuka-World was only for dedicated players.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} broadcast, [...] "Mountain of Madness" [...] finished 38th in {{ratings for the}} week of February 2–9, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 8.8, equivalent to approximately 8.5 million viewing households. It was the second-highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following King of the Hill. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an inventive episode, with several memorable moments". Tim Raynor of DVDTown.com <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some [...] "good, sidesplitting moments {{to say the least}} for this witty episode".

500|$|... "Company Picnic" [...] {{was filmed}} in Malibu, California. The episode {{featured}} about 360 extras, and was shot {{over the course}} of four days. Actor Ed Helms said of the episode, [...] "What the writers did is really fun and creative. It doesn't boil down to passive aggressive little picnic games with a vengeance. There's a lot more going on than that." [...] The episode marked return appearances of former guest stars Amy Ryan as Holly Flax and Idris Elba as Charles Miner. Ryan said she would love the prospect of returning to The Office in future episodes, but that there are currently no plans for such a return: [...] "I think that door [...] will always be open, just because it's such a nice party to go to.

500|$|Family Guy writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, {{including}} {{one in which the}} Griffins stay with Lenny and Carl and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of Ralph Wiggum's imagination. When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director Peter Shin, a former layout artist on The Simpsons, spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that [...] "by season 43 of The Simpsons and season 27 of Family Guy, someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{part of the}} {{regeneration}} of Weymouth and Portland, it {{was decided}} in 2007 that Weymouth's esplanade will be redeveloped {{in time for the}} 2012 Olympic Games.

Other alterations to the promenade were made, particularly around key areas such as the Jubilee Clock and the pier bandstand, with the introduction of new cafes and bars that connect the promenade and beach using innovative design, shaped like an upturned boat, also including a lighting scheme and seating areas with planting, fountains and trees. A 2010 council report <b>said</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> [...] "venues with an emphasis on an alcohol-led night out.
