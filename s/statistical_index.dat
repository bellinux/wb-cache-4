This paper discusses and illustrates a variety of measures which can be used to summarise predictive information available from a statistical model.

40|$|Abstract—“Dengue ” is an African {{word meaning}} “bone {{breaking}} ” because it causes severe joint and muscle pain {{that feels like}} bones are breaking. It is an infectious disease mainly transmitted by female mosquito, Aedes aegypti, and causes four serotypes of dengue viruses. In recent years, {{a dramatic increase in}} the dengue fever confirmed cases around the equator’s belt has been reported. Several conventional indices have been designed so far to monitor the transmitting vector populations known as House Index (HI), Container Index (CI), Breteau Index (BI). However, none of them describes the adult mosquito population size which is important to direct and guide comprehensive control strategy operations since number of infected people has a direct relationship with the vector density. Therefore, it is crucial to know the population size of the transmitting vector in order to design a suitable and effective control program. In this context, a study is carried out to report a new <b>statistical</b> <b>index,</b> ABURAS Index, using Poisson distribution based on the collection of vector population in Jeddah Governorate, Saudi Arabia.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{industrial}} park regional risk evaluation process, expert evaluation method is usually used to budget the constructed index system, {{so that the}} overall park risk value can be quantified. During setting the estimation system and expert assignment, in order {{to comply with the}} objective factor, Kappa statistics analysis method is adopted to evaluate the consistency analysis of the system setting of regional risk estimation and the expert's assignment situation. The Kappa statistic is an <b>statistical</b> <b>index</b> which via comparing two or more observers on the same things, or the twice or more observation results of one observer on the same thing,and the difference between the consistency and the consistency of actual observed value,which is caused by opportunity or by actual measurement, is used as <b>statistical</b> <b>index.</b> Kappa statistic and weighted Kappa statistic not only can be used to inspect the consistency and the reproducibility of ordered and unordered variable data, but also can give a magnitude which reflects the consistency. During the course of assessment, experts coming from different departments give respective grades of safety conditions in industrial park. Then indexes setup and grades by experts are discussed. The results indicate that grades by experts show good consistency...|$|E
