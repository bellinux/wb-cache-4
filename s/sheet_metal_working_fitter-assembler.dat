40|$|Most {{small or}} medium sized parts {{produced}} in mass production {{are made by}} shearing and forming of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal.</b> This technology is cost effective, but the achievable quality and geometrical complexity are limited when working high and highest strength steel. Based on the requirements for widening the process limits of conventional <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> the Fraunhofer IPT has developed the laser-assisted <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> technology. With this enhancement {{it is possible to}} produce parts made of high and highest strength steel with outstanding quality, high complexity and low tool wear. Additionally laser hardening has been implemented to adjust the mechanical properties of metal parts within the process. Currently the process is limited to lower sheet thicknesses (< 2 mm) to maintain short cycle times. To enable this process for larger geometries and higher sheet thicknesses the Fraunhofer IPT developed a system for double sided laser-assisted <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> within progressive dies...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> {{remains an}} {{important}} industry. It is argued that, to be competitive, the complete production chain {{needs to be}} optimised. Therefore, {{this article focuses on}} the optimisation of the production plan. The <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> shop is configured as a two-stage flow shop with laser cutting and air bending. In the literature, theoretical production planning models can be found for both individual processes. Unfortunately, those planning models have a low applicability in <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) {{due to the fact that}} they only focus on one single production step while in reality the planning decisions taken at the cutting stage affect the production plan for the air bending stage. An integrated production planning methodology is proposed to overcome this problem of individual optimisation by taking into account relevant bending information already at the cutting stage. An integer program is presented, incorporating some important practical requirements: (1) the planning model is suited for normal workpieces, rush orders, special workpieces and multiple-machine <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> shops and (2) the computational times to generate the production plan are limited. Ten real-life industrial test cases are used to evaluate the proposed methodology. The integrated production planning methodology results in schedules with a reduced makespan and a reduced set-up time at the press brake compared to the current way of planning. All planning models are developed in close cooperation with <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> SMEs to facilitate the implementation process. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the surface}} defects that arise in <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> is when the part {{is removed from the}} die. Since there are no {{external}} forces to make this defect, the origin of such fail is known as residual stress. Residual stress can develop in <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming due to non-uniform deformation. In this paper, the workpiece is carbon steel with different volume fractions and arrangements of ferrite and pearlite. Due to different stress-strain curves for each phase after cold rolling, one phase deforms elastically, whereas the other undergoes elastic-plastic deformation. On unloading to zero applied stress, this effect can produce residual stress. Therefore, {{in order to reduce the}} surface defects in <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming, an intelligent predictive code using a validated elastic-plastic finite element method is generated for a plain strain deformation of cold rolling process. Results show that in regular arrangement of ferrite and pearlite, workpiece microstructure has great influence on the residual stress distribution, and by decreasing the width of each strip, the fluctuation of residual stress is reduced. The purpose of this study is to develop the state of the art instructions for arrangement of phases after hot rolling process where the total residual stress produced after cold rolling and <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> will be minimized...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{the demand}} for a {{responsible}} use {{of natural resources and}} energy the need for lightweight materials is increasing. The most common materials for lightweight production are high and highest strength steel. These materials are difficult to machine using conventional <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> processes because the high strength leads to a limited formability and high tool wear. The Fraunhofer IPT developed the laser-assisted <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working.</b> Selective laser based heating of the part directly before machining softens the material locally. Thus the quality of the following cut can be increased, for example for shearing 1. 4310 the clear cut surface ratio can be increased from 20 % up to 100 % using a shearing gap of 10 % of the sheet thickness. Because of the softening of the material and thus the increased formability, parts with a higher complexity can be produced. For example 1. 4310 can be bent laser-assisted with a radius of 0. 25 mm instead of 2 - 3 mm using the convent ional process. For the first time spring steel can be embossed with conventional tools up to 50 % of the sheet thickness. For the implementation in series production a modular system upgrade "hy-PRESS" has been developed to include laser and scanner technology into existing presses. For decoupling the sensitive optical elements of the machine vibrations an active-passive damping system has been developed. The combination of this new hybrid process and the system technology allows to produce parts of high strength steel with a high complexity and quality...|$|R

40|$|To form curved surface, {{in-plane}} strain {{is introduced}} into a plate by using several {{methods such as}} line heating, press working and laser heating in shipbuilding and <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> in forming nose shape for the shinkan-sen. Laser forming could be a potential useful method for <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming as well as press working. Curved surface is classified based on its features of primary curvature radius into two typical shapes, so called bowl and saddle. So, when we research some technique to form curved surface, at least two types of bowl and saddle shapes should be investigated. For the bowl shape, some researchers reported that initial curvature radius has no effect on the in-plane strain induced by laser heating. In this report, the effect of initial curvature on the in-plane strain induced by laser heating is investigated for the saddle shape. As a result, shrinkage distributions caused by in-plane strain were varied with different initial curvatures. In this phenomenon, bending moment acts a key role in both heating and cooling processes. 秋季全国大会, 平成 20 年 9 月 10 - 13 日, 北九州国際会議場, 福岡...|$|R

40|$|Bending in <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming {{is defined}} as uniformly {{straining}} process around a linear axis. A V-bending process is normally used in <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> due to the tool and process simplicity. The main problem in bending process is a springback occurrence which causes an error in part dimension. In a micro level, the springback angle is difficult to be assessed because {{of the influence of}} size effects in all aspects of the system. The springback behavior has been investigated in many previous kinds of research. However, the springback correction is still needed to be studied extensively {{so that it can be}} implemented reliably in micro-bending. The purpose of this research is to investigate the influence of punch velocity and holding time to the springback angle. The process is performed to the 0. 1 mm thickness of copper foil. The punch velocities are 0. 1 mm/s, 1 mm/s, and 10 mm/s. While the variation of holding time, which is set during the bottoming stage, are 7 s, 9 s, and 11 s. The result shows that the punch velocity clearly influences the springback angle. In addition, the holding time during the bottoming stage is a potential factor in springback angle correction...|$|R

The in-plane strain is calculated with distance change of two geodesic lines. This in-plane strain distribution agrees with a strain distribution measured by shrinkage of the plate when the plate length is long. When plate length is short, these strains do not agree with each other. In this case, existence of some elongations cancelling effective in-plane strains appears in width change of the plate.

In <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> processing, this {{can be achieved by}} the use of materials with a supreme strength-to-weight and stiffness-to-weight ratio. Besides monolithic materials such as high-strength or light metals, in particular metal-plastic composite sheets are able to provide outstanding mechanical properties. Thus, the adaption of conventional, well-established forming methods for the processing of hybrid <b>sheet</b> <b>metals</b> is a current challenge for the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>working</b> industry. In this work, the planning phase for a conventional <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> forming process is studied aiming at the forming of metal-plastic composite sheets. The single process steps like material characterization, FE analysis, tool design and development of robust process parameters are studied in detail and adapted to the specific properties of metal-plastic composites. In material characterization, the model of the hybrid laminate needs to represent not only the mechanical properties of the individual combined materials, but also needs to reflect the behaviour of the interface zone between them. Based on experience, there is a strong dependency on temperature as well as strain rate. While monolithic materials show a moderate anisotropic behaviour, loads on laminates in different directions generate different strain states and completely different failure modes. During the FE analysis, thermo-mechanic and thermo-dynamic effects influence the temperature distribution within tool and work pieces and subsequently the forming behaviour. During try out and production phase, those additional influencing factors are limiting the process window even more and therefore need to be considered for the design of a robust forming process.

40|$|Abstract. Hot {{stamping}} of quenchenable {{high strength}} steels represents {{the most promising}} forming technology for the manufacturing of safety and crash relevant car parts. In such process, the manganese-boron steel 22 MnB 5 is homogeneously austenitized, formed and subsequently quenched in one process step, so that complex geometric structural components can be formed with an ultimate tensile strength up to 1500 MPa. Due to the high temperature, no lubrication is used during the process with consequent high wear and reduced service-life of the dies. Commercial available steel blanks usually present an Al-Si coating that has been specifically developed as a protection from oxidation and decarburization and, at the same time, has proved positive influence also on the decreasing the friction at interface between the blank and the dies during the forming. Although such coating is generally accepted as the only lubrication medium in hot stamping, its performances are considered not appropriate for a good lubrication. The paper presents the comparison of the standard Al-Si coating and a new Zn coating when applied to <b>metal</b> <b>sheets</b> in hot stamping.
