Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E
5|$|Peter Cane has {{distinguished}} between {{cases where the}} courts have found that an applicant has standing to represent identifiable individuals (associational standing), and cases where the applicant purports to represent the public interest (public interest <b>standing).</b> <b>Under</b> this analysis, ex parte Greenpeace may be regarded {{as an example of}} the former, and ex parte World Development Movement the latter. In 1994, the Law Commission recommended that there should be a two-track system for standing. An applicant should have standing in one of two situations: either in his or her personal capacity, in which case a remedy lies ex debito justitae ("from a debt of justice", that is, as a matter of right); or at the discretion of the court if it considers that it is in the public interest to accord standing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} prevent low back pain during dishwashing, we {{developed}} a standing aid for supporting the forward bending posture, and then evaluated {{the effects of the}} standing aid on decreasing load on the low back and legs. Eight female volunteers were asked to wash plates for 60 minutes in each of three working postures: (a) without the standing aid, (b) with the <b>standing</b> aid <b>under</b> the thighs, and (c) with the <b>standing</b> aid <b>under</b> the shins. The following were measured: electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), the force applied to the standing aid, the ground reaction force, the bending angle of the trunk, the bending angle of the knee, and local discomfort in body regions. While using the <b>standing</b> aid <b>under</b> the shins, the muscle load decreased in the low back and legs. While using the <b>standing</b> aid <b>under</b> the thighs, the muscle loads decreased in the low back but increased in the legs. It was suggested that the <b>standing</b> aid <b>under</b> the shins was more effective in decreasing the load on the low back and legs than the <b>standing</b> aid <b>under</b> the thighs...|$|R

After recording Revolver in 1966, McCartney went by himself on holiday to France, but asked to meet Evans in Bordeaux, at the Grosse Horloge church (on the corner of cours Victor Hugo and rue St. James). At exactly the pre-arranged time of one o'clock, Evans was <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> the church clock when McCartney arrived. They then drove to Madrid together, but after feeling bored, McCartney phoned Epstein's office in London and asked to be booked on a safari holiday in Kenya. When they arrived they visited the Amboseli Reserve at the foot of Mount Kilimanjaro, and also stayed at the exclusive Treetops Hotel, where the rooms are built on the branches of trees.|$|E

25|$|In the {{original}} Shower series from 1965, {{a man is}} depicted <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> a shower but with no water. Kabakov interpreted the work as a simple but universal metaphor about the individual who is always waiting for something, but never receives anything. Instead, the Italians and critics of communism interpreted the work as signifying Soviet culture and its lack of material reward. The publicity Kabakov received prevented him from getting work as an illustrator for four years, forcing him to work under someone else’s name. The use of an alter ego would become a common tool in Kabakov’s unofficial artwork.|$|E
25|$|In his {{responsibilities}} as Intergovernmental Affairs {{minister in the}} Jean Chrétien government, Dion was tasked with challenging the arguments of the Quebec sovereignty movement much more vigorously than in the pre-referendum period. The people of Quebec voted against the sovereignty option by a razor-thin margin (50.58% to 49.42%). Many federalists in Ottawa were caught off-guard by the results and believed that the referendum results would have no legal <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> Canadian law. The strongest complaints were on the presumed ambiguity of the 1995 question and that Quebec had tabled a law reserving the right for the National Assembly to declare independence unilaterally if constitutional negotiations with the Government of Canada failed.|$|E

25|$|Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corporation, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court, relying on Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, held that to {{establish}} <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> the civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provision that creates a civil cause of action for any person or entity injured in their business or property by reason of a RICO violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate that he or she was the direct victim of the defendant's RICO violation (e.g., a business may not sue a competitor that may have gained a competitive advantage by not paying taxes). The Court explained that this construction will save district courts from the difficulty of determining an indirect victim's damages caused by attenuated conduct.|$|E
25|$|The {{chest was}} a very {{important}} piece of furniture, and is often to be met with covered with the most elaborate carving (Orleans Museum). There is a splendid chest (14th century) in the Cluny Museum; the front is carved with twelve knights in armour <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> as many arches, and the spandrels are filled in with faces, dragons and so on. But it is to the 15th century that we look for the best work of this class; there is no finer example than that in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin. The front is a very animated hunting scene most decoratively arranged in a scheme of foliage, and the top bears two coats of arms with helms, crests and mantling. But the more general custom in chest decoration was to employ tracery with or without figure work; Avignon Museum contains some typical examples of the latter class.|$|E
25|$|Following the Napoleonic Wars and the {{excavations}} at Azincourt, Woodford {{returned home}} and in 1821 was given command of the third battalion of the Grenadier Guards in Dublin. He became a colonel on 23 November 1823. Under his command, he forbade flogging in the battalion and on 26 May 1830, banned <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> arms as a punishment. In 1835, Woodford published a pamphlet entitled Remarks on Military Flogging: its Causes and Effects, with some Considerations on the Propriety of its entire Abolition. In this, he recommended recreation for soldiers in barracks, the establishment of carpenters' shops, et cetera, to teach the men useful trades {{in addition to the}} establishment of regimental libraries. These reforms met the disapproval of Wellington and the King, William IV, although they remained in place. In part due to Woodford's advocacy, the purchase of commissions and the stock were abolished in 1871 (Cardwell Reforms) and 1855 respectively.|$|E

25|$|In the video, Norwood {{plays an}} all-seeing, all-knowing narrator, who gives the central male {{character}} pause with her wicked glances that {{let him know}} she's watching his every move. The pursuit starts with the singer performing the first lines of her song {{in the back of}} a cruising bus, while observing her boarding man next to a female, both discussing vehemently with each other. She's constantly moving and dancing, before the scene shifts to a scaffolding in front of a fenced building, where she performs the chorus in dusty backgrounds. The next scene shows her <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> a traffic light at a plied crossing, wearing a grey outfit and big glasses, wherefrom she enters a near barber shop and performs afresh in a hairdresser chair. At the same time the camera shows her man flirting with two girls. The video ends with a backflash on all locations Norwood was seen at, also catching the daytime in front of the sinking sun.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} findings in the tunnel chambers was a miniature mountainous landscape, 17 metres underground, with tiny pools of liquid mercury representing lakes. The walls and ceiling of the tunnel were found to have been carefully impregnated with mineral powder composed of magnetite, pyrite known as fool's gold and hematite, providing a special brightness to the place and to give the effect of <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> the stars as a peculiar re-creation of the underworld. At the end of the passage Gómez Chávez’s team uncovered four greenstone statues, wearing garments and beads, and their open eyes would have shone with precious minerals. Two of the figurines were still in their original positions, leaning back and apparently contemplating up at the axis where the three planes of the universe meet - probably the founding shamans of Teotihuacan, guiding pilgrims to the sanctuary, and carrying bundles of sacred objects used to perform rituals, including pendants and pyrite mirrors, which were perceived as portals to other realms.|$|E
25|$|Before the 15th century preaching had {{not become}} a regular {{institution}} in England, and pulpits were not so common. However, {{the value of the}} sermon began to be appreciated from the use to which the Lollards and other sects put this method of teaching doctrine, and pulpits became a necessity. A very beautiful one exists at Kenton, Devon. It is, as is generally the case, octagonal, and stands on a foot. Each angle is carved with an upright column of foliage between pinnacles, and the panels, which are painted with saints, are enriched with carved canopies and foliage; it is, however, much restored. The puipit at Trull, Somerset, is noted for its fine figure carving. A large figure <b>standing</b> <b>under</b> a canonv fills each of the nanelled sides. while many other smaller figures help to enrich the general effect. Examples of Gothic sounding boards are very rare; that, together with the pulpit, in the choir of Winchester is of the time of Prior Silkstede (1520), and is carved with his rebus, a skein of twisted silk.|$|E
