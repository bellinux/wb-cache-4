2500|$|The Corvette Grand Sports were raced {{with several}} {{different}} engines, {{but the most}} serious factory engine actually used was a 377 cubic inch displacement, all-aluminum, small block with four Weber side-draft carburetors and a cross-ram intake, rated [...] at 6400rpm. Body panels were made of thinner fiberglass to reduce weight and the inner body structure 'birdcage' was aluminum rather than steel. The ladder-type frame utilized large seamless steel tubular <b>side</b> <b>members</b> connected front and rear with crossmembers of about the same diameter tubes. Another crossmember was just aft of the transmission and a fourth one at the rear kick-up anchored the integral roll cage. The frame was slightly stiffer than the 1963 Corvette production frame and was 94 pounds lighter. A number of other lightweight components were utilized to reduce overall weight to about 800 pounds less than the production coupe. Initially the Grand Sport project was known simply as [...] "The Lightweight".|$|E

2500|$|The army's {{relationship}} to the Japanese was an uncomfortable one. Officers in the INA distrusted the Japanese. Leaders of the first INA sought formal assurances from Japan before committing to war. When these did not arrive, Mohan Singh resigned after ordering his army to disband; he expected to be sentenced to death. After Bose established Azad Hind, he tried to establish his political independence from the regime that supported him. (He had led protests against the Japanese expansion into China, and supported Chiang Kai-shek during the 1930s) Azad Hind depended on Japan for arms and materiel but sought to be as financially independent as possible, levying taxes and raising donations from Indians in Southeast Asia". On the Japanese <b>side,</b> <b>members</b> of the high command had been personally impressed by Bose and were willing to grant him some latitude; more importantly, the Japanese were interested in maintaining {{the support of a}} man who had been able to mobilise large numbers of Indian expatriates– including, most importantly, 40-,000 of the 45,000 Indians captured by the Japanese at Singapore. However, Faye notes that interactions between soldiers in the field was different. Attempts to use Shah Nawaz's troops in road building and as porters angered the troops, forcing Bose to intervene with Mutaguchi. After the withdrawal from Imphal, the relations between both junior non-commissioned officers and between senior officers had deteriorated. INA officers accused the Japanese Army high command of trying to deceive INA troops into fighting for Japan. Conversely, Japanese soldiers often expressed disdain for INA soldiers for having changed their oath of loyalty. This mutual dislike was especially strong after the withdrawal from Imphal began; Japanese soldiers, suspicious that INA defectors had been responsible for their defeat, addressed INA soldiers as [...] "shameless one" [...] instead of [...] "comrade" [...] as previously had been the case. Azad Hind officials in Burma reported difficulties with the Japanese military administration in arranging supply for troops and transport for wounded men as the armies withdrew. Toye notes that local IIL members and Azad Hind Dal (local Azad Hind administrative teams) organised relief supplies from Indians in Burma at this time. As the situation in Burma became hopeless for the Japanese, Bose refused requests to use INA troops against Aung San's Burma National Army, which had turned against Japan and was now allied with Commonwealth forces.|$|E

Engine and transmission location determination is an important thing that must be considered for a car. Method of locating engine and transmission will be proposed to determine the right position. This method depends to the size and type of engines. The project objective {{is to find a}} location for the engine mounting bracket for a new car. It is important to reduce the vibration from the engine and transmission to the car’s body or chassis. These is also important to fit the engine bay before consider the component of engine clearance with component of body. The stress analysis is done for the location test, different thickness of <b>side</b> <b>member,</b> and different cross section of <b>side</b> <b>member.</b> The FEA software Algor is use for this analysis and Solidwork to modeling the <b>side</b> <b>member.</b> Five different cross section and design are use to analyze the location of the engine mounting bracket. The range location of the mounting bracket is at the middle of the <b>side</b> <b>member.</b> This range depends to the packaging of the engine and the clearance between the components of engine with engine bay. Thickness of the <b>side</b> <b>member</b> also important to decrease the weight of the car and to minimize the stress value when load apply. For conclusion, not all the car has same location of mounting bracket location and many thing must consider before determine this location.

40|$|Abstract. Currently, {{the most}} {{important}} objective in designing automobiles {{is to focus on}} environment-friendly and safety performance aspects. For the environment-friendly aspect, the issues relate to the shift towards lightweight automobile production, for improving fuel-efficiency and reducing exhaust fumes. However, in contrast, the issues of the safety performance such as crash safety, comfort level and muti-functional programs demand increase of automobile’s weight. Therefore, the design of automobile should be inclined towards the safety aspects, but at the same time, it also should consider reducing the structural weight of an automobile. In this study, for lightweight design of <b>side</b> <b>member,</b> CFRP <b>side</b> <b>member</b> was manufactured from CFRP unidirectional prepreg sheet.
