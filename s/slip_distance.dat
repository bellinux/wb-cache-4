Analyzing a transient {{process in which the}} sliding velocity is instantaneously changed, we find that the critical <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> is proportional to the sliding velocity. We thus define the relaxation time, which is independent of the sliding velocity. It is found that the relaxation time is proportional to the layer thickness and inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure. An evolution law for the relaxation process is proposed, which does not contain any length constants describing the surface geometry but the relaxation time of the bulk granular matter. As a result, the critical <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> is scaled with a typical length scale of a system.

40|$|Oral Presentation - SteelsWork {{hardening}} evolution during deformation {{is typically}} examined quasi-statically by quenching-in the deformed structure. However quenching of gamma-Fe {{results in a}} complex martensitic structure and hence the presumed typical deformation of a face-centred cubic metal {{can not be easily}} validated. A recent derivation of constitutive relation can replicate the dynamic stress-strain curve from which the microstructure parameters can be determined (Saimoto and Van Houtte, Acta Mater., 2010 in press). In this determination the mean <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> is quantitatively derived from the measured curve and correlated to the resolved stress and strain at that point. The plot of shear stress versus inverse mean <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> reveals that initially the mean <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> decreases and then increases with strain. At some point a change of slope is observed and this point has been attributed to the matching of the increasing <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> to that of the decreasing cell size. This analysis have been applied to two low carbon steels, one with 0. 002 wt %C and the other with 0. 052 %C as reported by M. Huang et al. (Scripta Mater, 61, 2009).

Additionally, older adults’ adjusted friction utilization (AFU) on the slippery floor surface was not adjusted within the dynamic friction requirements, resulting in more falls.

40|$|The {{heat flow}} paradox {{provides}} {{evidence that a}} dynamic weakening mechanism may be important in understanding fault friction and rupture. We present here a specific model for dynamic velocity weakening that uses the mechanics of well-studied industrial bearings to explain fault zone processes. An elevated fluid pressure is generated in a thin film of viscous fluid that is sheared between nearly parallel surface. This lubrication pressure supports part of the load, therefore reducing the normal stress and associated friction across the gap. The pressure also elastically deforms the wall rock. The model is parameterized using the Sommerfeld number, which {{is a measure of}} the lubrication pressure normalized by the lithostatic load. For typical values of the material properties, <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> and velocity, the Sommerfeld number suggests that lubrication is an important process. If the lubrication length scales as the <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> in an earthquake, the frictional stress during dynamically lubricated large earthquakes is 30 % less than the friction with only hydrostatic pore pressure. Elastohydrodynamic lubrication also predicts a decrease in high-frequency (> 1 Hz) radiation above a critical <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> of a few meters. This prediction is well matched by the strong motion data from the 1999 Taiwan earthquake. The observed 2 orders of magnitude variation in scaled radiated energy between small (M_w 6) is also predicted by the lubrication model...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{conceptual}} {{model for the}} effective critical friction distance for fault zones of finite width. A numerical model with 1 D elasticity is used to investigate implications of the model for shear traction evolution during dynamic and quasi-static slip. The model includes elastofrictional interaction of multiple, parallel slip surfaces, which obey rate and state friction laws with either Ruina (slip) or Dieterich (time) state evolution. A range of slip acceleration histories is investigated by imposing perturbations in slip velocity at the fault zone boundary and using radiation damping to solve the equations of motion. The model extends concepts developed for friction of bare surfaces, including the critical friction distance L, to fault zones of finite width containing wear and gouge materials. We distinguish between parameters that apply to a single frictional surface, including L and the dynamic <b>slip</b> weakening <b>distance</b> do, and those that represent slip for the entire fault zone, which include the effective critical friction distance, Dcb, and the effective dynamic <b>slip</b> weakening <b>distance</b> Do. A scaling law for Dcb is proposed in terms of L and the fault zone width. Earthquake source parameters depend on net slip across a fault zone and thus scale with Dcb, Do, and the slip at yield strength Da. We find that Da decreases with increasing velocity jump size for friction evolution via the Ruina law, whereas it is independent of slip acceleration rate for the Dieterich law. For both laws, Da scales with fault zone width and shear traction exhibits prolonged hardening before reaching a yield strength. The parameters Dcb and Do increase roughly linearly with fault zone thickness.

Both the transient postseismic creep and the pattern of steady interseismic creep rates surrounding asperities depend on recent coseismic slip and fault rheologies.

As three groups of along-dip slip distribution are suggested by different slip inversions, we present three slip-weakening models. In each model, we assume uniform critical <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> eastward from the hypocenter, but several asperities with smaller critical <b>slip</b> <b>distance</b> westward from the hypocenter.

The average static stress drop calculated from the models is in the range of 4. 5 – 7 MPa, though large spatial variations of static stress drop exist. To prevent high-frequency radiation in the region eastward from the hypocenter, the fracture energy needed there is in the order of 10 MJ/m^ 2, and the average up-dip rupture speed cannot exceed 2 km/s.

Slow slip occurs near the boundaries of large earthquake rupture zones and may sometimes trigger fast earthquakes.

However, the processes that control slow rupture {{and the relationship between}} slow and normal earthquakes are enigmatic. Here we use laboratory experiments to simulate faulting in natural rock samples taken from shallow parts of the Nankai subduction zone, Japan, where very low-frequency earthquakes - a form of slow slip - have been observed.

However, the sizes of the slip nucleation patches in our laboratory simulations are similar to those expected for the very lowfrequency earthquakes observed in Nankai.
