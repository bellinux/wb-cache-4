5|$|After about 10 days (1–3 weeks {{depending}} on temperatures), larvae hatch and bore directly throughout the pod walls and develop within the seed. Larvae are thus protected from {{biological and chemical}} control. Larval development lasts two to three months. Before entering its pupal <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> larva cuts a circular cap. After around ten days of pupal <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> adult emerges from the seeds. Because mating and oviposition are spread over a few weeks, adults can emerge before or after harvest.|$|E
5|$|Audience {{etiquette}} {{is generally}} similar to formal western theatre—the audience quietly watches. Surtitles are not used, but some audience members follow {{along in the}} libretto. Because there are no curtains on the <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> performance begins with the actors entering the stage and ends with their leaving the <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> house lights are usually kept on during the performances, creating an intimate feel that provides a shared experience between the performers and the audience.|$|E
5|$|The current tournament {{features}} 38 clubs competing over a six- to eight-month period. There {{are three}} stages: the first <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> second {{stage and the}} knockout stage.|$|E
50|$|The {{league is}} {{completed}} in two <b>stages.</b> <b>The</b> first <b>stage</b> is <b>the</b> group round robin matches while <b>the</b> second <b>stage</b> is <b>the</b> straight 2-leg knock-out stage.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} two competitions, {{there were only three}} <b>stages.</b> <b>The</b> Final <b>Stage</b> became <b>the</b> fourth <b>stage</b> {{beginning}} with <b>the</b> 3rd Competition.|$|R
50|$|As {{it opened}} in <b>stages</b> <b>the</b> line closed in <b>stages.</b> <b>The</b> Bungay - Harleston section closed in late 1960 but freight between Bungay and Beccles lingered on until August 1964.|$|R
5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, {{gas bubble}} nuclei are simply stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic skins or membranes consisting of surface-active molecules. These skins are normally permeable to gas, and collapse is prevented by their compression strength. These skins can become stiff and effectively impermeable to gas when they are subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which <b>stage</b> <b>the</b> pressure inside increases during further compression as predicted by Boyle's law.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 in a <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place down the line, to a single point for 15th. In addition, some points could be won in intermediate sprints.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top ten in a <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> stage win awarded 12 points, second place awarded 10 points, third 8, and one point fewer per place down the line, to a single point for tenth. In addition, the first four riders across the intermediate sprint lines earned points, 5, 3, 2, and 1 in succession.|$|E
50|$|Boelen {{then took}} three {{consecutive}} <b>stages,</b> <b>the</b> first {{by winning the}} sprint of a four-man break away. Boelen outsprinted Huber on <b>stage</b> 5 for <b>the</b> second <b>stage</b> win. <b>The</b> Dutchman took both <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and <b>the</b> leaders jersey on the next day. Huber punctured but also ran out of energy on <b>the</b> longest <b>stage</b> of <b>the</b> 2011 event, resulting {{in a loss of}} more than ten minutes to Boelen.|$|R
5000|$|... 1976 As <b>the</b> cost of <b>staging</b> <b>the</b> contest increases, a {{new rule}} was {{introduced}} that, in future, each participating broadcaster {{would have to}} pay a part of <b>the</b> cost of <b>staging</b> <b>the</b> contest.|$|R
30|$|The {{treatment}} design approach, {{implemented in}} the acidizing expert system, is developed following an acidizing structure that includes guidelines prepared {{in the form of}} decision trees for six <b>stages,</b> namely: (i) <b>the</b> formation oil displacement <b>stage,</b> (ii) <b>the</b> formation water displacement <b>stage,</b> (iii) <b>the</b> acetic acid <b>stage,</b> (iv) <b>the</b> HCl pre-flush <b>stage,</b> (v) <b>the</b> main acid <b>stage,</b> and (vi) <b>the</b> over-flush <b>stage.</b>|$|R
5|$|After Tyler {{recovered}} from falling off <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> band {{returned to the}} stage in mid-October for two shows in Hawaii, one in Maui which was rescheduled from 2007 and finally played {{as part of a}} legal settlement, and an additional show which was played in Honolulu. In early November, the band played a concert in Abu Dhabi at the Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Although no jersey was awarded, {{there was}} also a {{classification}} for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time. There was another team classification that awarded points to each team based off their riding's finishing position in every <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> team with the highest total of points was the leader of the classification.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little {{except for the}} <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> {{critical}} assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led {{to a decline in}} the popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer's major French grand operas have begun to reappear in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> park also <b>staged</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} <b>the</b> final <b>stage</b> of <b>the</b> 2006 Tour of Britain cycle race (3 September).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> {{was shaped}} like a big flower and {{consisted}} of several elevators throughout <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> floor. Above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> were six large contractible pieces that could come {{together to create a}} large ball over <b>the</b> entire <b>stage.</b> Above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> in <b>the</b> centre, a large projector screen faced all sides of the area playing both live footage as well as video backdrops.

5|$|As in 1906, {{the race}} was decided by a points system. At {{the end of every}} <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> winner was given one point, the next cyclist two points, and so on. After the eighth stage, when there were only 49 cyclists left in the race, the points given in the first eight stages were redistributed among the {{remaining}} cyclists, according to their positions in those stages.|$|E

5|$|Beetles are {{the most}} widely eaten insects, with about 344 species used as food, usually at the larval <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> {{mealworm}} (the larva of the darkling beetle) and the rhinoceros beetle are among the species commonly eaten.|$|E
50|$|The race {{includes}} four <b>stages.</b> <b>The</b> first {{three of these}} are road <b>stages,</b> while <b>the</b> fourth is an individual time trial.|$|R
5000|$|In episodes 3 and 4, {{there are}} three contestants on <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> with {{pre-existing}} relationships.
