Thanks <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us.</b> This week {{we begin}} our star of the month festival for March — a thirty-six-film salute {{to one of the}} most underrated actresses of the Golden Age of Hollywood, the {{delightful}} Ann Sothern. Over the course of her sixty-year career, Ann Sothern found success on the stage, on radio, on film and, certainly, on television, becoming one of those faces which would, invariably, make an audience, en masse, kind of give it a happy sigh of relief, knowing well, now we're in good hands, I know I'm gonna have a good time. And with Ann Sothern, they always did. Still, I don't think the film industry ever really fully appreciated her abilities and rarely gave her a chance to stretch as an actress, something Ann lamented about later in her life. Early on, she spent time working all over Hollywood — at Warner Brothers, RKO, Twentieth Century Fox and things got particularly promising for her when she signed with the mighty MGM in 1939. But that didn't really pan out much either. She was so charming in whatever she was given to do, MGM put her in one film after another and never really upping the stakes by teaming with any of the big male stars on the MGM contract list, people like Tracy or Gable, Bob Taylor, Walter Pidgeon. But all that was still in the future when she made our next film, as a contract player at colo… Columbia Studios.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Fest became {{embroiled in a}} public dispute with the left-wing writer and Nobel Prize winner Günter Grass, who had {{admitted}} in his autobiography that he had joined the Waffen-SS in {{the last months of}} World War II. Fest criticised Grass, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> having <b>joined,</b> but <b>for</b> having concealed the fact for so many years while engaging in political criticism of others over their Nazi pasts. He said: [...] "After 60 years, this confession comes a bit too late. I can't understand how someone who for decades set himself up as a moral authority, a rather smug one, could pull this off." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is eminently a good plan," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "for travellers. In {{planning}} a journey, we ought always to include this item in our calculations. We ought to allow <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> conveyance, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> hotel bills, and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> losses, and then calculate on the losses {{just as much as}} we do on the payment of the railroad fares and hotel bills. That is the philosophy of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder, now, if I {{was divided}} up and inventoried," [...] said the latter {{as he ran}} over the paper, [...] "how much I might bring. Say <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the shape of my head, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> a high forehead, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> arms, and hands, and legs, and then <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> education, learning, talent, honesty, religion! Bless me! there would be small charge on that last, I'm thinking. But come, Eva," [...] he said; and taking the hand of his daughter, he stepped across the boat, and {{carelessly}} putting {{the tip of his}} finger under Tom's chin, said, good-humoredly, [...] "Look-up, Tom, and see how you like your new master." ...|$|R
