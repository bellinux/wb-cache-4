40|$|Abstract. Travel by {{air with}} long hours will create {{discomfort}} feeling for aircraft passenger especially economy class aircraft passenger. Long hour air travel will create physiological stress on aircraft passenger. It may due to seat space limitation, noise, vibration, cabin humidity {{as well as}} seat comfort. Seat comfort is a subjective feeling that related to psychological aspect of aircraft passenger. The current aircraft passenger seat {{is equipped with a}} passive function where the passenger themselves needs to adjust the seat for comfort seating position. The aircraft passenger will not able to adjust the seat when the aircraft passenger is in the low activity condition. The active <b>seat</b> <b>support</b> system was developed to support the aircraft passenger actively. The first prototype of active <b>seat</b> <b>support</b> system is focus on neck section. The head position of the aircraft seat was embedded with the system to detect the head position of the passenger. During the development of the active <b>seat</b> <b>support</b> system, total design technique was used. Five conceptual designs were generated for selection. To determine the final design of active neck support system, the matrix evaluation method was used. The weight of the concept was obtained through weight analysis...|$|E
40|$|Individuals who cannot {{functionally}} reposition themselves {{often need}} dynamic seating interventions that change body posture from automatic chair adjustments. Pelvis alignment directly affects sitting posture, and systems that adjust and monitor pelvis angle simultaneously might {{be applicable to}} control body posture in sitting. The present study explores whether it is feasible to monitor pelvis angle from <b>seat</b> <b>support</b> forces. Pelvis angle estimation was based on equivalent “two-force member��? loading for which pelvis orientation equals {{the orientation of the}} equivalent contact force. Theoretical evaluation was done to derive important conditions for practical application. An instrumented wheelchair was developed for experimental validation in healthy subjects. <b>Seat</b> <b>support</b> forces were measured, and mechanical analysis was done to derive the equivalent contact force from which we estimated the pelvis angle. Model analysis showed a significant influence of pelvis mass, hip force, and lumbar torque on the relation between the actual pelvis angle and the predicted pelvis angle. Proper force compensation and minimal lumbar torque seemed important for accurate pelvis angle estimations. Experimental evaluation showed no body postures that involved a clear relation between the pelvis angle and the orientation of the equivalent contact force. Findings suggest that pelvis angle could not be estimated in healthy individuals under the described experimental seating conditions. Validation experiments with impaired individuals must be performed under different seating conditions to provide a better understanding whether the principle is of interest for clinical application...|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of the crew seat attenuation system for the Orion Crew Module (CM) is to provide the crew with a low injury-risk landing environment under a range of crew configurations and landing conditions. The current design for the seat attenuation system provides the crew with a low risk of injury environment based on the Brinkley criteria {{for most of the}} landing conditions considered. Furthermore, the stroking of the seat attenuation system is within limits, and the clearance between the <b>seat</b> <b>support</b> platform and vehicle is not exceeded. For the limited number of landing conditions where a low injury risk is exceeded, the risk is never beyond a moderate level. The results presented in this study are based on a CM structural model that is rigid except for the pallet struts, which attenuate landing loads and reduce the accelerations transferred to the astronauts. The CM simulations include a soft soil landing. Several different crew configurations are evaluated in this study. It is expected that situations where the risk is above low can be eliminated in future design iterations...|$|E

40|$|Of all {{the members}} in an {{upholstered}} sofa frame, the front rail {{is perhaps the most}} difficult to design owing both to its support conditions and to {{the manner in which it}} is loaded. To date, structural analysis methods and design procedures have still not been fully developed for this member. The primary objective of this study was to develop and verify a computer-based procedure for the analytical design of the front rail in the sofa <b>seat</b> <b>support</b> system. A simplified parallel chord truss model was developed to model the deflection behavior of the front rail. The stretcher/stretcher brace system was modelled and its stiffening and reinforcement of the front rail with respect to front to back spring loads determined. ^ The validity of these analytical procedures was verified by mechanical tests of full-scale front rail/stretcher/stretcher brace systems. The deflections of the front rail under the action of 15 simulated front to back spring loads were measured at seven points. These experimental results were compared with deflection values predicted by the analytical procedures developed in this study. The differences between predicted and measured values expressed as a percentage of predicted values differed by less than 10 percent for all test data. It was concluded from this study that the analytical procedures developed were valid and could be readily incorporated into engineering design procedures for sofa frame constructions. ...|$|E
40|$|Wheelchair-users who cannot {{reposition}} themselves often {{suffer from}} pressure ulcers which are places of tissue {{breakdown in the}} buttock region under the sacrum and ischial tuberosities. Periodic pressure relief is needed to recover the buttock tissue from continuous deformation and impairment of tissue perfusion. Because pelvis alignment directly affects body posture and buttock load, a passive motion technique was developed that adjusts pelvis orientation independent from the trunk and <b>seat</b> <b>support.</b> This study investigates {{the effects of the}} so-called decoupled pelvis rotation (DPR) on the loads at the buttock–seat interface and evaluates whether this technique is applicable to regulate buttock load in sitting. Eighteen healthy male subjects participated in this study. Experiments were performed with a computer-aided adjustable simulator chair, instrumented with a concept of DPR. Measurements involved quasi-static actuated pelvis movements in the sagittal and frontal plane. Pelvis orientation, buttock interface pressures, seat reaction forces and centre of pressure were simultaneously measured. As a result of the induced passive pelvis movements, the pelvis rotated 19 ± 2 ° and 9 ± 2 ° in the sagittal and frontal plane, respectively. Significant relations were found between pelvis rotation and most quantities of buttock load. Findings suggest that DPR is an effective technique to regulate buttock load in able-bodied individuals. For clinical application, this technique is still to be evaluated on individuals who cannot functionally reposition themselves. Impairments to the neuromuscular function influence postural response from chair adjustments which makes clinical investigation necessary...|$|E
40|$|Operating heavy {{construction}} equipment is {{often associated with}} elevated rates of low back discomfort (LBD). However, there have been few formal studies that dealt with evaluating controls that can reduce the LBD among these workers. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effectiveness of using a continuous passive lumbar motion system (CPLMS) in reducing low back discomfort among operators of heavy earthmoving equipment. The CPLMS is an additional <b>seat</b> <b>support</b> that has a lumbar support bladder and a pump to provide cyclic inflation and deflation. Two groups of operators were identified as potential subjects for this intervention study, the intervention group with a mean age of 41. 2 years and experience of 9. 7 years used the CPLMS, and the control group with a mean age of 37. 5 years and experience of 7. 6 years did not use the CPLMS. Body part discomfort surveys were collected from both groups. In addition, the intervention group completed a CPLMS preference survey. The body part discomfort survey was collected up to eight days at three different times of the day. Results from the body part discomfort survey showed a decreasing trend the longer the CPLMS was used, for both the upper and low back region. A decreasing trend for the low back was also found comparing morning to evening discomfort scores across the days when using the CPLMS. When compared to their regular seat, 54 % of the operators felt very comfortable in using the CPLMS, 36 % of them wanted one for their equipment, and 54 % showed interest in experimenting with the CPLMS for a longer time period. Results from this study indicate that the use of a CPLMS can effectively reduce the low back discomfort experienced by operators of {{heavy construction}} equipment...|$|E
