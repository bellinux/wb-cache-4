5000|$|In 1947 most {{foreign policy}} liberals {{believed}} that a massive recovery program for European democracies was necessary to prevent their succumbing to Soviet aggression or to subversion by totalitarian ideology. In response to an urgent plea by Columbia scholars, Congress authorized interim relief. But there was fear {{that the level of}} assistance needed would put intolerable inflationary pressure on the U.S. economy. It was the Harvard faculty this time that provided the suggestion: an allocation program to moderate demand, restricting credit and if necessary price controls. Wage policy was not specifically enumerated but Coxs name on the list made clear that that would be part of the [...] "aggressive anti-inflationary measures" [...] that might be resorted to. That <b>spring</b> <b>aid</b> relief began under the Marshall Plan but no mechanism to intervene with the economy, especially wages, was introduced to replace the National Wage Stabilization Board, which had expired in 1947.|$|E
40|$|Dunlop Suspensions and Components {{manufacture}} microvon, {{a flexible}} polyurethane foam, {{which is used}} extensively in the automotive industry as spring aids for car suspension systems. The material is used because of its desirable non-linear elastic stress/stain characteristics, its quick recovery behaviour, and because it tends to produce little lateral expansion during compression. The design of such <b>spring</b> <b>aid</b> components, however, remains something of a black art, since the behaviour of the material is not fully understood. Complications arise because the mechanical properties of the material are controlled by {{a large number of}} physical, chemical and processing effects. The aim of the research has been to gain further understanding of the material, and its response under load, {{in order to be able}} to predict the compressive behaviour of the material. This has been achieved by combining microstructural observations of the deforming material with information obtained from detailed mechanical tests. There have been many attempts by researchers to describe the behaviour of cellular materials. This has been done in a variety of ways, and approaches have included developing complicated strain energy functions or utilising simple models based on repeating cell units. However, a number of difficulties are encountered when applying these material models to microvon. The microstructural observations and mechanical tests undertaken in this research have led to the development of new material models for cellular materials. Two types of model have been developed; a physical model and a series of phenomenological models. The physical model is a bi-linear relationship between stress, strain and density, in which the mechanisms of deformation are described. The phenomenological models have been developed using curve- fitting, to accurately predict the axial stress/strain and lateral/axial strain behaviour of microvon over a wide range of strain, density, temperature and strain rate...|$|E

The windscreen was hinged at the top for clearer sheltered wet-weather unmisted vision after dark. The front windows were fitted with louvres and, when open, the windows provided an extractor effect at their rear edge. The steering was by Bishop cam. The rigid axle suspension for both front and rear was controlled by long semi-elliptic <b>springs</b> <b>aided</b> by Armstrong hydraulic dampers.|$|R

His lands holdings increased when the Spring family were granted former abbey lands after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. During the reign of Edward VI he was referred to as lord of the manor of Leffey. He was knighted at the accession of Edward VI. <b>Spring</b> <b>aided</b> the dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk in suppressing the Lavenham revolt of 1525, by removing the bells from the Church of St Peter and St Paul, meaning the rebels could not be called to arms.|$|R

50|$|As the Princess' {{coronation}} day arrives, the Wizard {{decides to}} expose Alice's identity {{to the court}} via the Princess Test, to prove {{that she is not}} the princess. Alice climbs a mountain to retrieve some water from a <b>spring,</b> <b>aided</b> secretly by Tenderheart and Lotsa Heart; however, Alice gives the water to an injured unicorn. Angered by this, the Wizard demands that Alice make the flowers in the palace garden bloom magically. The princess secretly steps in and makes the flowers bloom. The Wizard, who had not been anticipating the Princess' return, suddenly exclaims he had her kidnapped, exposing his crime. The Care Bears, Alice, and the Wonderland characters confront the Wizard but the appearance of the Jabberwocky drives the villain insane, and he is arrested. The princess is crowned the new queen, and she helps Alice and the Care Bears return home.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{demographic}} {{study of}} Anthemis cotula L. revealed a protracted seedling recruitment pattern with peaks in autumn (pre-winter) and spring (post-winter). The major recruitment pulse in autumn {{contributes to the}} fecundity component of the life history while the minor recruitment pulse in <b>spring</b> <b>aids</b> in survival of the species. The total drymass accumulation shows striking variations between the pre-winter and post–winter populations. Compared to post-winter population, the pre-winter plants show higher drymass accumulation due to higher relative growth rate (RGR) and consequently higher number of seeds per plant. Allocation of dry matter to leaves was also higher. The present studies indicate that A. cotula tends to allocate {{a greater proportion of}} total biomass to above ground than to below ground parts which is characteristic of species invading disturbed habitats The extent of resource allocation to reproduction exhibited by the species is characteristic of the habitats that are less mature and are highly disturbed...|$|R

50|$|See drawing, right. The stackfreed {{consists}} of a stiff spring arm (A) with a roller at the end (B) which presses against an eccentric cam (D), usually the roller rides in a groove in the cam's edge. The cam is shaped like a snail. It has a gear on it (E) that is turned by a gear on the mainspring arbor (C), so it makes one turn during the clock's running period. The force of the spring arm against the cam exerts a retarding force on the mainspring, reducing its torque, which varies with {{the thickness of the}} cam. When the mainspring is fully wound up, the arm presses against the wide part of the cam. Since it is far from the axis, the retarding force it exerts is maximum. As the clock runs and the mainspring unwinds, the cam rotates and the spring bears against the narrower parts of the cam, reducing the retarding force gradually, to compensate for the declining force of the mainspring. At the end of the running period there was often a steep depression in the cam that the roller pressed against, so the force of the stackfreed <b>spring</b> <b>aided</b> the weakened mainspring.|$|R

60|$|In {{an instant}} the halyards slackened, and Dutton, who {{by this time}} had gained his self-command, though still weak and unnerved by the habits of the last fifteen years, forced the bight {{along the edge of}} the cliff, until he had brought it over a {{projection}} of the rocks, where it fastened itself. This arrangement caused the line to lead down to the part of the cliffs from which the young man had fallen, and where it was by no means difficult for a steady head and active limbs to move about and pluck flowers. It consequently remained for Wychecombe merely to regain a footing on that part of the hill-side, to ascend to the summit without difficulty. It is true he was now below the point from which he had fallen, but by swinging himself off laterally, or even by <b>springing,</b> <b>aided</b> by the line, it was not a difficult achievement to reach it, and he no sooner understood the nature of the change that had been made, than he set about attempting it. The confident manner of Dutton encouraged both the baronet and Mildred, and they drew to the cliff, again; standing near the verge, though on the part where the rocks might be descended, with less apprehension of consequences.|$|R

50|$|Mechanical {{connections}} between major sections were via shafts {{in the extreme}} rear, with couplings permitting disconnection without any attention, and probably relief <b>springs</b> to <b>aid</b> re-engagement. One might think that rotating an output shaft by hand in a pulled-out section would misalign the computer, but the type of data transmission of all such shafts did not represent magnitude; only the incremental rotation of such shafts conveyed data, and it was summed by differentials at the receiving end. One such kind of quantity is the output from the roller of a mechanical integrator; {{the position of the}} roller at any given time is immaterial; it is only the incrementing and decrementing that counts.|$|R

50|$|The M/16 was a {{relatively}} simple design. It was intended for static emplacement, and was mounted on a pedestal, allowing for 360° sideways movement. The mount allowed for an angle of elevation of between -1° and 75°. The gun barrel was 45 calibres long, and had 28 grooves (rifling) twisting to the right. The breech block was a semi-automatic horizontal wedge - the gunner had to manually open it to remove the case from the previous shot, but it closed automatically on the insertion of a new round. There was a hydro-pneumatic recoil cylinder under the barrel, with a heavy <b>spring</b> to <b>aid</b> the forward motion of the gun at high elevation. It was originally designed to fire under local command, but was later equipped to receive gun-laying information from a central sight.|$|R

50|$|The {{river was}} an {{important}} trade route for French, English and First Nations traders throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The tremendous flow rate {{of the river and}} its tributaries during the <b>spring</b> freshet <b>aided</b> the development of the timber industry in western New Brunswick, and the river became a conduit for log drives to sawmills and pulp mills in the south. The spring freshet can prove disastrous to property owners along portions of the river, particularly when ice jams cause extensive flooding during the spring break-up. Settlers of low-lying banks and islands along the St. John River had to adapt their land use practices to contend with the river’s fluctuating flow. The proprietors of seasonally flooded river islands, for instance, {{had to learn how to}} manage their properties collectively because freshets carried away their fences each year and left individual holdings vulnerable to damage from wanderinglivestock.|$|R
2500|$|The {{development}} of rail trails in southeastern Australia {{can be traced}} to the gold rushes of the second half of the 19th century. Dozens of rail lines <b>sprang</b> up, <b>aided</b> by the overly enthusiastic [...] "Octopus Act", but soon became unprofitable as the gold ran out, leading to a decreased demand for timber in turn. Decades later, these easements found a new use as tourist drawcards, once converted to rail trails. Dozens exist in some form, like the [...] Port Fairy to Warrnambool Rail Trail, but only a few — such as the [...] Murray to the Mountains Rail Trail — have been fully developed. Progress is frequently hampered by trestle bridges in unsafe condition, easements that have been sold off to farmers, and lack of funds. Funding is typically contributed in roughly equal parts from federal, state, and local governments, with voluntary labour and in kind donations contributed by local groups.|$|R
