40|$|This paper {{seeks the}} {{relative}} contribution of <b>sovereign</b> <b>risks</b> and firm-level credit risks in a firm’s rating assignment. The findings reveal that <b>sovereign</b> <b>risks</b> {{contribute to a}} major part of firms’ ratings in developing countries, whereas such risks play a negligible role in assigning ratings in developed countries. The authors show that this result for developing countries partly depends on the “country ceiling effect”–private ratings are bound upwards by their sovereign rating–but in these countries idiosyncratic information is irrelevant even for firms whose rating would lie anyhow well below their sovereign. They also document that the information content of firm ratings is much smaller in developing countries than in developed countries. Finally, the paper suggests that cross-country indicators of information quality, rule of law and other institutional quality indicators help explain this unsatisfactory situation but do not solve the puzzle entirely.

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{development}} of the European debt crisis, traditional index bond management has been severely called into question. We focus here on the risk {{issues raised by the}} classical market-capitalization weighting scheme. We propose an approach to properly measure <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> in a fixed-income portfolio. For that, we assume that CDS spreads follow a SABR process and we derive a <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> measure based on CDS spreads and duration of portfolio bonds. We then consider two alternative weighting methods which are fundamental indexation and risk-based indexation. Fundamental indexation is based on GDP indexation whereas risk-based indexation uses a risk budgeting approach based on our <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> measure. We then compare all these methods in terms of risk, diversification and performance. We show that the risk budgeting approach is the most appropriate scheme to manage <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> in bond portfolios and gives very appealing results with respect to active management of bond portfolios. ...|$|R

The regression tests show that the commonality is linked to both local and global financial and economic variables. Besides, we also notice intriguing differences in the <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> behavior of Asian and European countries. Specifically, we find that some variables, including foreign reserve, global stock market, and volatility risk premium, affect the of Asian and European <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risks</b> in the opposite direction.

40|$|While the US {{dollar and}} Japanese yen are {{considered}} as safe-haven currencies, both their sovereign {{credit default swap}} (CDS) spreads and exchange rate have varied {{in a wide range}} since late 2007.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{determinants}} of sovereign CDS spreads of five Euro area countries (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) {{after the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers. We find that global and/or European Monetary Union (EMU) -wide factors are the main drivers of changes in the sovereign CDS spreads in our sample. However, the impacts of those factors change with market uncertainty. There is a relatively tranquil regime where market uncertainty is low and a relatively turbulent regime where market uncertainty is high. The transition from the tranquil regime to the turbulent regime is driven by changes in the global jump risk, which suggests that contagion from the global financial market significantly affected the pricing of <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> in our sample. Domestic economic and financial indicators have little impact on the pricing of <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> in all sample countries except Italy. But changes in the <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> have significant impacts on domestic economic and financial indicators. Neglecting the financial contagion and feedback effects from <b>sovereign</b> credit <b>risk</b> to domestic economic and financial developments leads to spurious results regarding {{the determinants of}} sovereign CDS spreads...|$|R
