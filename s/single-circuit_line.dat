50|$|From Olinda Substation, the TANC 500 kV {{continues}} as a <b>single-circuit</b> <b>line,</b> although the tower structures change (see photos below) to a two-level pylon. The line proceeds south and then southeast {{along the western}} edge of the Sacramento Valley. It parallels Interstate 5 (about four miles (6.5 km) to the west) on its way south, although it's barely visible. It also parallels two 230-kV Pacific Gas and Electric lines for much of this segment and another WAPA 230 kV line. There is a series capacitor station near Maxwell in Colusa County to boost the line across the long Olinda-Tracy segment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – A {{current flowing}} through a {{distribution}} conductor produces induced voltage, which is harmful to a telecommunication line. Previous research on induced voltage {{has been focused}} on <b>single-circuit</b> <b>lines</b> in the distribution system. However, the double-circuit lines, referred to as parallel distribution lines, are widely used in distribution systems because they have significant economic and environmental advantages over <b>single-circuit</b> <b>lines.</b> Therefore, a study on the induced voltage in double-circuit lines is needed. This paper presents a method of calculating the induced voltage in a parallel distribution system using four-terminal parameters and vector analysis. The calculation method is verified by the Electromagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) simulation...|$|R

Because of the different lengths and sizes of the conductor, the dc installation {{needs to be able to}} operate in various voltages and currents. To be de-iced, the line must be closed off from the ac current at both ends. Line conductors are used to form a closed loop.|$|R

50|$|Hilpertsau-Weisenbach compact {{overhead}} line is installed on 7 lattice steel pylons, form {{which one is}} a termination tower, two are strainers, three are suspension towers and one is a branch tower. On the first look {{it looks like a}} line using triple bundle conductors, but a closer look offers, that the spacers between the conductors are insulators and so each conductor bundle is a complete circuit. After the 7th pylon, the line branches in two standard powerlines, which are the <b>single-circuit</b> <b>line</b> to Reichental and the double circuit line to Au im Murgtal. The first line is immediately after the branch pylon a conventional powerline, while the second shows the transition in the span field toward the next pylon.|$|E
50|$|Path 66 {{consists}} of the northernmost segment of TANC's 346 mi 500 kV line from Captain Jack substation to Tracy substation in California's Central Valley. Leaving Captain Jack substation, the line first heads southeast as a <b>single-circuit</b> <b>line</b> and runs parallel {{with the other two}} 500 kV lines across the Modoc Plateau. It then turns west and climbs in elevation and reaches its highest point near Grizzly Peak at about 6000 ft. From there, it heads south, spanning over the Stonecoal Valley and the Pit River. Near Round Mountain, it turns southwest and the line is joined by two 230-kV lines as all three lines head into the Sacramento Valley. As the line passes by Cottonwood, it turns west and crosses Interstate 5. Near Olinda, it turns south and enters Olinda substation. Here the line interconnects with transmission lines carrying power from Shasta Dam and Keswick Dam.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} loadability {{increase}} {{that can be}} obtained in radial transmission lines {{by means of a}} synchronous condenser connected at the receiving end of the line. In this configuration, the reactive power reserve at the receiving node can be used (at least in the best part) to control the reactive power flow in the radial line. This way, the voltage drop across the line can be controlled, avoiding to exceed the maximum voltage drop allowed. The result is a considerable increase of the loadability curves in the voltage drop region and, thus, a considerable power capability increase for medium length and long radial transmission lines. In order to accommodate growing load power, the use of a synchronous condenser can be a convenient alternative to {{the construction of a new}} line or to the doubling of a <b>single-circuit</b> <b>line...</b>|$|E

40|$|This is {{the second}} part of an {{investigation}} aimed at providing a thorough technical comparison between traditional and alternative overhead power transmission lines based on the loadability characteristics. The previous Part I has outlined and applied the fundamentals of the loadability analysis to three comparable <b>single-circuit</b> <b>lines.</b> In the present Part II, the analysis is broadened to three comparable double-circuit lines: traditional three-phase ac double-circuit lines (assumed as the reference system for the comparison), bipolar HVDC lines and non-conventional combined ac-dc lines. As in Part I, the loadability analysis takes into account thermal limits, voltage drop, power losses and – when feasible – steady-state and transient stability. Part II also performs an overall comparison among the different systems in single-circuit and double-circuit configuration to draw final conclusions...|$|R
40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} environment related to electric power installations is typically evaluated by numerical integration methods. Numerical techniques, although powerful, {{are not well}} suited for assessing the dependence of the field strength on electric and geometric parameters. In this paper, a fast procedure to analytically evaluate power-line magnetic fields, based on complex vectors, is proposed. The use of complex algebra greatly simplifies analytical calculations compared to other approaches proposed in literature, allowing also complex conductor arrangements {{to be taken into}} account. A general formula for the magnetic-field intensity of any multiphase <b>single-circuit</b> <b>line</b> configuration is obtained. An expression for practical three-phase line configurations is simply derived as a particular case of the general formula. The proposed approach is then extended successfully to double-circuit lines, taking the load differences between circuits into account. Approximate formulas are validated by comparing magnetic flux density values with those computed from the general expression...|$|E
40|$|The fault {{diagnosis}} of Electric Power System {{is a process}} of discriminating the faulted system elements by protective relays and subsequent tripping by circuit breakers. Specially, as soon as some serious faults occur on a power system, a lot of alarm information is transmitted to the control center. Under such situation, the operators are required to judge the cause, location, and the system elements with faults rapidly and accurately. Thus, good {{fault diagnosis}} methods can provide accurate and effective diagnostic information to dispatch operators and help them take necessary measures in fault situation so as to guarantee the secure and stable operation of the Electric power system. This thesis reports various techniques used for detection, classification and localization of faults on the high voltage transmission line.

40|$|Abstract- This {{paper has}} {{proposed}} a modeling method to simulate steady-state and transient induced voltages to an underground gas pipeline from an overhead transmission line. The simulation results of the steady-state ac induced voltages agree well with analytical results obtained from a well-known formula. The induced voltages are significantly dependent on the configuration of an overhead line. A hori-zontal line induces the largest voltage to a gas pipeline, and an induced voltage by a vertical twin-circuit line is smaller by about 20 % than that by a vertical <b>single-circuit</b> <b>line.</b> The simulation method is applied to investigate the effect of shielding wires and plates on reduction of the induced volt-age, and the simulation results agree well with analytical re-sults. It {{has been found that}} the induced voltage can be re-duced by about 10 % by one shielding wire and by about 25 % by five shielding wires, and an iron plate can reduce the in-duced voltage by about 50 % assuming the shielding wires and the plate are ideally grounded...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a methodology for a thorough technical comparison between traditional three-phase ac lines, {{on the one}} hand, and possible (in some cases non-conventional) alternative solutions that include HVDC lines, four-phase ac lines and combined ac-dc lines, on the other. The comparison {{is based on the}} loadability curves, which are calculated here for all the considered lines taking into account thermal limits, voltage drop, power losses and – when feasible – steady-state and transient stability. The focus is on four-phase ac and combined ac-dc lines, for which the loadability curves are derived for the first time, whereas the loadability curves of three-phase ac lines - well-known in the literature - are derived and used here just as the natural reference for the comparison. Due to the great deal of theoretical and numerical developments, the study is split in two. Part I analyzes <b>single-circuit</b> <b>lines</b> of comparable loadability at the thermal limit (three-phase, four-phase and monopolar HVDC). Part II broadens the analysis to double-circuit lines of comparable loadability at the thermal limit (three-phase, bipolar HVDC and combined ac-dc) and performs an overall comparison among the different systems in single-circuit and double-circuit configuration...|$|R
50|$|The Kintigh Generating Station, {{also known}} as Somerset Operating Co. LLC of the Upstate New York Power Producers is a 675-megawatt {{coal-fired}} power plant located in Somerset, New York, United States. The plant was owned by AES Corporation until bankruptcy. Its only currently operating unit was launched into service in 1984. Coal is provided to the plant via the Somerset Railroad. The waste heat is dumped into Lake Ontario, resulting in a warm-water plume visible on satellite images. The plant's smoke stack can be seen across Lake Ontario from the shores of Toronto, Pickering, Oshawa, and Ajax, Ontario. It {{can also be seen}} from points along the Niagara Escarpment, including Lockport, NY, approximately 20 miles south. Power from the plant is transferred by 345kV power lines on wood pylons, which run south from the plant through rural agricultural land. In Royalton, NY they connect to a pair of 345kV <b>single-circuit</b> <b>lines</b> called the 345-kV Niagara-to-Edic transmission line, owned by the New York Power Authority, and carried by steel pylons for approximately 200 miles from the Canada-US border at Niagara Falls, NY to a substation near Marcy, NY.|$|R
