I used to perform very well in Telugu, English, History, Geography but my ability in Mathematics is limited". He attributed his {{lack of interest in}} the subject and his poor vision as the reasons for this. He completed his education in Veeravasaram in 1881.

2500|$|The verbal {{morphology}} of the Kagoshima dialects {{is heavily}} marked by its divergent phonological processes. Vowels can, for instance, coalesce, devoice, or be deleted entirely {{depending on the}} preceding sound. For example, the standard form 書く kaku [...] "write" [...] becomes 書っ kaʔ in the dialects of the mainland {{as a result of}} high vowel deletion. In addition to such changes, noticeable morphological differences exist between the standard language and the dialects. For example, the Kagoshima dialects pattern more closely with Western Japanese and Kyushu dialects, using the negative ending -n as opposed to -nai. So the form 書かん kakan [...] "not write" [...] is used instead of the <b>standard</b> <b>equivalent</b> 書かない kakanai. Other examples include the use of the form -ute instead of -tte in the imperfective (ta) and participle (te) forms of verbs ending with the vowel stem -u, or the auxiliary おる oru (おっ oʔ) instead of いる iru for the progressive form. More specific to regions of Kyushu, the dialects continue to use the form -(y)uru for verbs that would end in -eru in standard Japanese, as in 見ゆる miyuru (見ゆっ miyuʔ) [...] "to be seen" [...] instead of 見える mieru, and they also use the auxiliary verb gotaru (gotaʔ) where standard Japanese uses the ending -tai to express desire, as in 食ぉごたっ kwo-gotaʔ [...] "want to eat" [...] as opposed to the standard forms 食いたい kuitai or 食べたい tabetai.|$|E
