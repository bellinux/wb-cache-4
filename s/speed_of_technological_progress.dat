40|$|This paper {{develops}} a theoretical model to analyse how a General Purpose Technology (GPT) shapes within-group wage inequality when workers are ex-ante equal, but their adaptability to new technologies {{is subject to}} stochastic factors that are history dependent. It is argued that the diffusion of a GPT leverages {{the importance of these}} stochastic factors in three ways. First, a rise in the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> embodied <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> raises the market premium to workers adaptable to the leading-edge technology. Second, the generality of the technology raises the ability of adaptable workers to transfer recently acquired knowledge to new machines. Third, the generality of the technology reduces the cost of retooling old machines, which increases the demand for adaptable workers. In the model the rise in within-group inequality is mainly transitory, and is mirrored by a rise in wage instability. The key predictions of the model are shown to be in line with some of the existing empirical evidence.

40|$|Background The use {{of novel}} {{algorithmic}} techniques is pivotal to many important problems in life science.

40|$|The {{increasing}} <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> and {{the associated}} onward digitalisation of our world, amplify an individualised form of advertising – called customised communication, which Google’s vice president recently {{claimed to be the}} biggest chance to advertising since the invention of the TV. Thereby, the fast developments outreached the reconditioning of respective theoretical explanation models. Whereas mass communication models exist since the 1960 ’s, there are no present communication models available, which are capable to illustrate the individual character of customised communication. Thus, the present paper provides an adjustment of common tools of mass communication on the special features of customised communication, resulting from differences and similarities in definition and generic communication parts as channel, message and receiver. Furthermore, as customised communication is enabled through the digitalisation of modern communication channels, a profound investigation of the three most important channels and their respective users is presented. Since, the investigation revealed that the differences outweigh the similarities, a communication model of customised communication has been developed. Thus, the main differences mainly result from the individual character of the message and the communication process itself. Whereas mass communication models initiate the communication process with a sender, customised communication starts with the interaction of a user with a digital channel. The data, resulting from this process build the information source for the individual composition of an advertising message on the company side. As a result, an advertising message is created which allows a company to directly target and address an individual and desired consumer. Evolving, within mass communication one message is transmitted to the mass, but within customised communication one message is composed for and targeted on one individual consumer. The here stated and summarised findings and conclusions are based on a profound literature review, as well as the application of different primary and secondary data within the paper.

Venture capital is needed to finance a spinoff, and therefore the expected profits from founding a spinoff depend on how easily venture capital can be acquired. Accordingly, thick venture capital markets might have two opposing effects. First, incentives of firms to invest in R&D might be reduced and, second, if spinoff formation results in technological spillovers between the parent firm and the spinoffs, the generation of spinoff firms might positively influence the future effi-ciency of the incumbent’s innovation efforts.

However, owing to the high <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> and the urgent need for bioinformatics tools, there is a widening gap between state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques and the actual algorithmic components of tools that are in widespread use. Results To remedy this trend we propose the use of SeqAn, a library of efficient data types and algorithms for sequence analysis in computational biology. SeqAn comprises implementations of existing, practical state-of-the-art algorithmic components to provide a sound basis for algorithm testing and development. In this paper we describe the design and content of SeqAn and demonstrate its use by giving two examples. In the first example we show an application of SeqAn as an experimental platform by comparing different exact string matching algorithms. The second example is a simple version of the well-known MUMmer tool rewritten in SeqAn. Results indicate that our implementation is very efficient and versatile to use. Conclusion We anticipate that SeqAn greatly simplifies the rapid development of new bioinformatics tools by providing a collection of readily usable, well-designed algorithmic components which are fundamental for the field of sequence analysis. This leverages not only the implementation of new algorithms, but also enables a sound analysis and comparison of existing algorithms. </p...|$|E

40|$|Defence date: 27 February 2015 Examining Board: Professor Árpád Ábrahám, EUI, Supervisor; Professor Miklós Koren, Central European University; Professor Ramon Marimon, EUI; Professor José Vicente Rodríguez Mora, University of Edinburgh. The thesis {{explores the}} role of {{technology}} {{in some of the}} most important economic phenomena of the last decades and examines how changes in the state of the economy could influence the nature of technology. In the first chapter I study the relation between supply of skilled labor, firms’ choice of optimal technology and wage inequality. Researchers have acknowledged that one of the key causes of the increase in inequality across OECD countries was the introduction of skill-biased production methods, which generated a higher demand for skilled workers. In the chapter, I explore whether the shift to skill-biased production method was a consequence of changing nature of new global technological paradigm (specifically, the arrival of the information technology) or a consequence of firms’ choice to exploit the new technological paradigm in a way that favors skilled workers. Such choice could be motivated by a rapid increase in availability of college graduates in 70 s and 80 s. To study these questions, I first observe that while the source of the latter cause is global, the source of the former rests in labor market conditions at the country level. Hence panel data estimators could be used to disentangle the two effects. I find that endogenous technology choice at the local level can explain 30 % of the increase of the college premium in the OECD countries. The second chapter studies how the rate and direction of technological change is influenced by the parameters of consumers’ preferences. I demonstrate that the elasticity of substitution between goods in the Dixit-Stiglitz framework can be represented as a simple linear function of a taste heterogeneity measure. I combine this result with Young’s model of endogenous growth, which predicts that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> depends positively on the elasticity of substitution between goods. The purpose of the third chapter is to summarize the convergence of Central and Eastern European to Western European economies in the period between 1995 and 2007.

40|$|The patent {{system of}} the People’s Republic of China has only a history of about 30 years, yet it hasundergone three major policy changes {{to keep up with}} the {{tremendous}} pace of economic and technologicalprogress in China. Once a country in which technological advance relies primarily on copyingand imitating foreign innovations, China is gradually shifting towards a regime that emphasizes onstrong intellectual property and indigenous innovation. It is fascinating, therefore, to witness this transition. It is important to enhance my understanding of the patent regime as a mechanism to promoteinnovation and the dissemination of knowledge, as is the purpose of the thesis. Both of the chapters in this dissertation focus on patent applicants’ preference for how quickly theywant their patent applications to be processed. This is nontrivial primarily due to heterogeneity in firmcharacteristics, nature of invention, market structure, technology backgrounds and many unobservablefactors. I propose two factors that partially determine an inventor’s preference for speed of patenting:the inter-temporal value patents of their invention and the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>progress.</b> The first chapter investigates the heterogeneous inter-temporal patterns of inventions’ value flowand the associated applicants’ patenting strategies for a small set of United States patents. To measurethe characteristics of different inventions’ inter-temporal value flow, we exploit a policy lever providedby the Chinese government that allows patent applicants to freely choose between one patentprotection of short examination delay, short protection period and another patent protection of longexamination delay, long protection period. We find that the majority of applicants that favor the formerprotection (short&shot) have Electronics and Mechanics inventions, whereas applicants that favorthe latter (long&long) are mostly within Pharmaceuticals and Drugs. We then exploit this variationin patent choices under the Chinese regime with applicants’ patenting strategies in the U. S., for identicalinventions. The empirical results suggest the short&short Chinese patent holders have a strongtendency of pursuing early U. S. patent issuance whereas the long&long patent holders have a strongtendency of maintaining their U. S. patents for long periods. The results are robust with or withouttechnology field fixed effects. The second chapter analyze the effect of faster technology development on firms patenting strategy. Using a dataset with information about patent applications in both China and the US, I find thatfirms are willing to secure early patent grants when technology moves ahead faster. The conventionalwisdom that a patent secures a flow of monopoly profits that depreciates at a constant speed over timeis not consistent with my empirical findings. Faster technology progress shifts the profits towards theearly periods, making early grants more important. The empirical results suggest that a more flexiblepatent regime which offers options for speed is more efficient...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2002. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Payment {{systems can}} be defined as a funds {{transfer}} system processing third party payments, supervised by a central bank or appropriate Regulatory Authority. (S. W. I. F. T., 1997). Therefore the importance of a well managed system, through regulatory methods, as well as self-regulation by the industry, cannot be over emphasized. According to Humphrey, (1996 : 923), the composition of non-cash transactions consists of the following five payment instruments. The paper-based transactions are composed of cheques and paperbased giros payments. The electronic transactions consist of electronic giro, debit card (POS), and credit card payments. According to Vives, (1998 : 168) there are normally two goals when a country wants to change its payment system, either it wants to increase efficiency, or it wants to reduce risk. If there is a conflict between risk and efficiency, the less risky solution must prevail. Credit risk and systemic risk poses the greatest challenges to payment systems. Credit risk exists when credit was granted to a participating member, which cannot fulfil its debt at the stage of payment need to be made. Systematic risks encompass situations in which the credit or liquidity problems for one or more market participants create substantial credit or liquidity problems for participants elsewhere in the financial system. (Emmons, 1997 : 11). In order to create international standards in addressing the risk issues involved the Bank of International Settlements was established. The Bank's predominant tasks are to promote the co-operation of central banks and to provide additional facilities for international financial operations, and to create and maintain stability of international monetary and financial systems. The Bank of International Settlements published the Lamfallussy report. From the findings of this report a series of policy recommendations regarding netting schemes. The Basle Committee was established by the Central Bank Governors of the Group of Ten countries as a result of serious failures and disturbances in the international currency and banking markets, with the main objective to improve the collaboration between bank supervisors world wide. The objective is met by using three different methods, namely. Exchange information on national supervisory arrangements, improving the effectiveness of techniques for supervising, and the setting of minimum supervisory guidelines and recommendations and recommended statements of best practices, expecting authorities to take steps to implement in their respective countries. To enable secure international payments the Society for Worldwide Inter-bank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) was created, with the mission to provide technology-based communication services across all financial markets through member banks and their market infrastructures so that they can meet their own and their end-customers' needs. There is a growing awareness among central banks of the need to ensure the integrity, the security and the stability of their country's payment system. The central bank's main function was to regulate the country's currency circulation, to facilitate' payment transactions and to pursue a credit and monetary policy serving the interest of the country as a whole. Because of their importance for the smooth operation of commerce of financial markets, central banks often own and/or operate large value payment networks themselves rather than leave this function solely to commercial banks. (Sato et a/., 1995 : 37). Commercial banks, or their agents, perform {{the vast majority of the}} clearing and processing of payment in developed countries, as well as providing the payment facilities to clients. The United States central bank is the main exception to this division of responsibility as it provides settlement service as well as check processing and over one-half of all Automatic Clearing Houses and wire processing services. (Sato et a/., 1995 : 32). The re-entry of South Africa in the global trade in the early 1990 s created new opportunities and challenges for the country. With the existing established payment system, South Africa provides a gateway to the Southern African countries. There are a number of fundamental changes in the financial markets, which have an impact on payment and settlement systems. The first important factor is the high <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>progress.</b> Secondly, the fundamental change in financial markets concerns the internationalisation of financial flows. From a central bank point of view, these developments, although in principle to be welcomed because of their contribution to the effect of allocation of financial resources, require close attention, as the interrelationships between worldwide financial markets could also give rise to a propagation of risks. (Koning, 1998 : 19). South Africa's payments system, as a well-functioning system, compares favourably with the best in the world; this is an essential requirement for participation in the international finance and trading. The challenge the South African banks face is the social responsibility to uplift the community on the one side, and compliance with the international rules and legislation on the other. In accordance to the minimum requirements set by the Lamfallussy report. The Reserve Bank of South Africa enforced strong policies via the Banking Council of South Africa, as well as the different committees and associations dedicated to certain payment systems. The South African Reserve Bank intent to provide an Electronic Communications and Transactions Bill in order to promote and regulate electronic communication and transactions. The Banking Council set certain criteria that will be implemented from the first of January 2002 on the item limits applicable to the certain electronic methods of payment. Councils and associations in the banking sector are established, self-regulatory as well as government controlled, to enforce rules and regulations to reduce the risk involved in the industry and comply with international requirements. A strong legal framework and the enforcement of certain risk prevention methods, for instance the enforcement of item limits and the change in the law on the crossing of cheques prove the commitment to participate internationally. The strong movement to same day settlement, (especially in high value payments via the SAMOS system), show that the payment industry in South Africa is on an ongoing process of implementing new procedures to comply with the international standards. Electronic money {{can be defined as}} stored value or prepaid products in which a record of funds or value available to the consumer is stored on a device in the consumer's possession. (Bank of International Settlements, 2001 : 1). Consumers benefit from the ability to use payment methods that are inexpensive, convenient, and accessible. (Bank of International Settlements, 1997 : 6). The participation in the payment processes by non-financial entities, coupled with the design and widespread use of unknown digital form of monetary value poses serious threats to the central bank's ability to control monetary policy and safeguard financial stability. Card based e-money schemes have been combined with functionality's such as access control, holder identification or local transportation ticketing. Network-based e-money schemes are operational or under trail in a limited number of countries. The existing payment system legislation applies to networkbased schemes. The South African Reserve Bank needs to constantly monitor and analyse the existing and new different methods of payment systems in order to create a low risk, stable, safe and a trade supportive environment for the improvement of its own economy, as well as for the Southern African region. Specific attention needs to be given to the high-value payment systems in order to reduce systemic risk. The prevalent factor is the real time settlement of the SAM OS (South African Multi Option Settlement) system. Finally, regulators need to coordinate actions, through the international and local platforms provides, to implant financial discipline, manage risk and support cross-border and regional trade. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Betaalstelsels kan gedefinieer word as 'n opdragte- of fondsoorplasingstelsel vir die maak van betalings aan 'n derde party, wat gereguleer word deur 'n sentrale bank of regering. (SWIFT, 1997). Die belangrikheid van 'n goedgereguleerde stelsel, deur middel van wetgewing, sowel as selfregulering deur die industrie, kan nie oorbeklemtoon word nie. Humphry (1996 : 923) beskryf die samestelling van nie-kontant betaalstelsels as die volgende vyf instrumente. Die papier gebaseerde transaksie wat uit tjeks, papier-gebaseerde "giro' bestaan. Elektroniese transaksies bestaan uit die elektroniese "giro", debiet- en kredietkaarte. Volgens Vives (1998 : 168) is daar normaalweg twee doelwitte wanneer verandering aan 'n betaalstelsels aangebring word, naamlik die verbetering in doeltreffendheid, of die vermindering van risiko, waar die laer risiko gewoonlik die voorkeur sal kry. Kredietrisiko en sistemiese risiko hou die grootste uitdagings vir betaalstelsels in. Kredietrisiko ontstaan waar krediet aan 'n deelnemende lid van 'n stelsel verleen word en die ander party nie kan presteer op die tydstip van betaling nie. Sistemiese risko's sluit situasies in waar krediet of likiditeit probleme vir een of meerdere deelnemers vir ander deelnemers groot krediet of likiditeits probleme skep in die finansiële stelsel. (Emmons, 1997 : 11). Om risiko's internasionaal aan te spreek is die Bank of International Settlements gestig. Die organisasie het ten doeI om koördinasie tussen die sentrale banke te bevorder en stabiliteit te skep in die internasionale monetêre en finansiële markte. Die Bank of International Settlements het die Lamfallussy verslag opgestel waarin verskeie beleid aanbevelings aangaande verrekeningstelsels gemaak word. Die Basle Committee is gestig deur die hoofde van die Groep van 10 lande se sentrale banke weens die mislukking en ontwrigting van geldeenhede en finansiële markte wêreldwyd, met die doelstelling om samewerking tussen banke wêreldwyd te bevorder. Dit word bereik deur drie metodes naamlik, uitruil van inligting wêreldwyd na adviseurs, verbetering in die verskaffing van advies en die daarstel van riglyne en aanbevelings aangaande die beste praktyke, wat regerings in hul eie lande kan aanwend. Vir die daarstelling van 'n gestandaardiseerde, veilige intenasionale opdragte en betalings stelsel is die Society for Worldwide Inter-bank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) gestig, met die missie om 'n tegnologie gebasseerde opdrag en kommunikasie stelsel daar te stel wat alle markte deur middel van lede lande en hul infrastrukture kliënte kan bedien. Daar is 'n toenemende bewuswording onder sentrale banke om die integriteit en die sekuriteit van hul eie betaalstelsel te verseker. Die hoof funksie van die sentrale bank is die regulering van die land se geldeenheid, om betalings moontlik te maak en die daarstel van krediet- en monetêre beleid vir die steun van die land se belange as geheel. Weens die belangrikheid in die suksesvolle werking van die kommersiële markte, besit sentrale banke groot gedeeltes van die verrekeningstelsels eerder om dit aan kommersiële banke oor te laat. (Sato et aI., 1995 : 37). Elke sentrale bank verskaf verskillende verrekeningsdienste afhangende van faktore soos die verskillende regsfaktore, sosiale faktore, politieke faktore, internasionale- en mededingende faktore. Kommersiële banke, of hul agente, is verantwoordelik vir die oorgrootte van verwerkingsaksies in ontwikkelende lande, asook die verskaffing van die betalingsmiddele. Die Verenigde State se sentrale bank is die hoof uitsondering wat self die verrekeningsdienste lewer, die prosessering van tjeks doen, die verrekeningshuise besit en verwerking dienste lewer. (Sato et al., 1995 : 32). Suid-Afrika se hertoetrede tot die internasionale finansiële wêreld in die vroeë jare negentig het geleenthede en uitdagings meegebring. Met 'n bestaande gevestigde betaalstelsel word Suid-Afrika beskou as die deur na die Suider- Afrikaanse lande. Verskeie fundamentele veranderinge in die finansiële markte het 'n impak op die betaal- en verrekeningstelsels. Eerstens die spoed van tegnologiese vooruitgang; tweedens die verandering van die finansiële markte in terme van kapitaalvloei. Uit die oogpunt van 'n sentrale bank, verg die toekenning van finansiële hulpbronne, intense aandag, omdat die interverwantskappe van finansiële markte wêreldwyd risiko's verhoog. (Koning, 1998 : 19). Suid-Afrika beskik oor 'n goed funksionerende betaalstelsel wat vergelyk kan word met die bestes ter wêreld en is van uiterste belang vir die internasionale deelname in finansiering en handel. Suid-Afrikaanse banke staan voor die uitdaging om aan sy sosiale verantwoordelikhede te voldoen om die gemeeskap op te bou aan die een kant en die vereistes om aan internasionale standaarde te voldoen, soos deur die Lamfallussy veslag voorgeskryf, aan die ander kant. Die Reserwe bank van Suid-Afrika dwing beleid af via die Banking Council of South Africa, asook verskeie kommisies en verenigings wat fokus op die verskeie betaalstelsels. Die Reserwebank van Suid-Afrika beoog om 'n "Electronic Communications and Transaction Bill" teen die einde van 2001 te publiseer vir die regulering van elektroniese kommunikasie en traksaksies. In Wetlike raamwerk en die afdwing van sekere risiko verminderende metodes, byvoorbeeld item limiete, wat gedurende Januarie 2002 in werking gestel word en die wysiging in die kruising van tjeks dui op die drastiese stappe wat aangebring word om internasionaal mededingend te wees, asook by internasionale riglyne in te pas. Daadwerklike pogings om selfde dag verrekeninge in die hoë waardestelsel (SAMOS) te implementeer en te voldoen aan die neergelegde internasionale standaarde. Elektroniese geld word gedefinieer as 'n gememoriseerde waarde of voorafbetaalde produkte waarin rekord van fondse of beskikbare waardes van 'n kliënt gehou word. (Bank of International Settlements, 2001 : 1). Verbruikers kry die voordeel van maklik toeganklike en goedkoop betalingsmetodes. (Bank of International Settlements, 1997 : 6). Die deelname van nie-finansiële instansies in die betalingsprosesse, daarmee saam die ontwerp en algemene gebruik van onbekende digitale vorms van monetêre waardes hou 'n bedreiging in vir die beheer van die sentrale bank om monetêre beleid af te dwing en finansiële stabiliteit te verseker. Kaartgebaseerde elektroniese geldskema's word in sekere gevalle is die fasiliteit gekombineer met funksionaliteit in die vorm van toegangsbeheer, houer identifikasie, of plaaslike transport kaarte. Netwerk gebaseerde elektroniese geldskema's is slegs in beperkte aantal lande operasioneel of onder ontwikkeling en bestaande wetgewing aangaande betaalstelsels word hoofsaaklik toegepas op die skema's. Daar word voorgestel dat die Suid-Afrikaanse Reserwebank moet op 'n voortdurende basis bestaande en nuwe verskillende betaalstelsels moniteer vir die daarstelling van 'n verlaagde risiko, met 'n stabiele- en veilige omgewing wat steun verleen aan die land se ekonomie, sowel as die omliggende Suider- Afrikaanse lande. Verdere pogings moet aangewend word word om hoë-waarde betaalstelsels (SAMOS) se sistemiese risiko te verminder deur van dieselfde dag vereffening gebruik te maak. Ter afsluiting moet daar met gekoordineerde aksies, wat plaaslik en internasionaal bestaan, aangewend word om finansiële dissipline daar te stel, risko's te bestuur en internasionale handel te bevorder...|$|E

40|$|The pace <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> is a {{construct}} that {{has evolved from}} technological change theories. Although the construct is well described, it lacks a valid objective measure. Measuring the pace <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> {{is believed to be}} important for both technology management and technology forecasting. A newly-developed objective measure of the pace <b>of</b> <b>technological</b> <b>progress</b> called the Technology Cycle Time indicator (TCT) is evaluated. The TCT indicator was used in two comparison analyses: (1) assessing the pace of progress of superconductor and semiconductor technologies; and (2) assessing the position of various countries patenting in the semiconductor technology field. The TCT assessments were then analytically compared with specialist assessments found in the literature. The findings reveale...|$|R
