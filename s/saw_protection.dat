5000|$|In Sophisims of free trade, John Byles championed {{protectionism}} and refuted the [...] "let it alone," [...] i.e., laissez faire system. Industries do not {{spring up}} out of nowhere, and home markets needs protectionism to stave off foreign competition. Byles said, [...] "But in truth the natural course of commercial affairs uninfluenced by legislation is impossible." [...] He could not conceive where England could have been at in 1851 without protectionism. He was convinced that new nations as well as old nations needed protectionism. He knew individuals {{and the private sector}} did not have the resources to create an immense future. Public wisdom had to do this monumental feat. Moreover, Byles called humanity the most profoundest cause. He stated that those who regard man in high esteem should not be subjected to unbridled foreign commerce. In sum, Byles <b>saw</b> <b>protection</b> as not a source of calamity and peril as free traders depicted it, but as a policy that spread industry and brought water, economic life where there was none.|$|E

In 1848, the Timber Ordinance No.24 was signed for the reservation of forests, largely for timber production. In 1873, Hooker advocated {{the protection of}} natural forests above 5000 feet as climatic reserves and in 1938 a law was passed prohibiting the removal of forest above 5000 feet. In 1885 Forest Ordinance No. 10 for the Conservation of forests <b>saw</b> some <b>protection</b> of forests primarily for sustainable wood production but also some protection of wildlife in sanctuaries. This was developed further in 1907 with Forest Ordinance No 16 with some protection of forests and their products in reserved forests and village forests, again for the controlled exploitation of timber.|$|R

Castile's objectives was to keep Granada in check, prevent it from raiding Castile and force it to continue paying tribute, which was an important source of income. On the other hand, the Marinids <b>saw</b> the <b>protection</b> of the Muslims in the Iberian peninsula, as well as participation in jihad against the Christian expansion there as their duty as Muslims and as a way to increase their legitimacy. By the time of Muhammad II's rule, Granada's main objective was to maintain independence from these two powers, preserve the balance of power, prevent an alliance between them, as well as controlling towns on the Castilian frontiers and ports on the Strait of Gibraltar (such as Algeciras and Gibraltar).|$|R

The ideals that it was based upon {{were brought to the}} papacy by Pope Leo IX (pope 1049–1054), and provided the ideology of the clerical independence that led to the Investiture Controversy in the late 11th century. This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor <b>saw</b> the <b>protection</b> of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms. The dispute represents a significant stage {{in the creation of a}} papal monarchy separate from and equal to lay authorities. It also had the permanent consequence of empowering German princes at the expense of the German emperors.|$|R

In the course of the dispute, Gregory and George T. Downing discovered that a law before the U.S. House of Representatives creating separate schools for black children. The pair along with Charles Purvis created an organization to fight this discrimination. The group gathered about it many leading civil rights figures, having Frederick Douglass as president, Richard T. Greener as secretary, and also including Frederick G. Barbadoes, John F. Cook, Francis James Grimké, Milton M. Holland, Wiley Lane, William H. Smith, Purvis, Downing, and Gregory. The group was supported by representative Dudley C. Haskell of Kansas and succeeded. In 1883, after the Civil Rights Cases <b>saw</b> civil <b>protections</b> for African Americans overturned by the US Supreme Court, Gregory was one of the organizers of mass meetings in protest which included Douglass, Robert Ingersoll, Samuel Shellaberger, and Jeremiah Rankin. He was a leader of the 1883 National Convention of Colored Men in Louisville, Kentucky, where Gregory was elected temporary and then permanent secretary and fellow DC Delegate Frederick Douglass was made president. In 1893, Gregory published a biography of Frederick Douglass entitled, Frederick Douglass the Orator: Containing an Account of His Life; His Eminent Public Services; His Brilliant Career as Orator; Selections from His Speeches and Writings..|$|R
40|$|Summary: This paper {{began with}} an {{observation}} made during re-analysis of the dataset from a study of Scottish adult support and protection practice. Namely, different practitioners could mean different things when {{they said they had}} been doing "adult protection" work. For this paper, therefore, practitioners' conceptualisations of adult protection work were hypothesised inductively from the dataset, and refined into categories through a process of constant comparison, open and axial coding. The dataset comprised material from case files and practitioner interviews relating to 23 "adults at risk". * Findings: When practitioners said they had been doing "adult protection" work, they could mean that: a) they perceived themselves to have been responding to abuse, harm or high risk; and/or b) they were adopting a certain formal, even coercive tone of work; and/or c) they had formally flagged the work as adult protection, including through the use of procedures. Practitioners drew on and combined these meanings in different ways. They also varied in {{the extent to which they}} <b>saw</b> adult <b>protection</b> as a distinctive type of practice and/or as different from what had gone before. * Applications: Support and protection work involves nuanced judgements about the nature and intentions of policy, about how these relate to particular situations and about how best to translate them into practice. Time and support is required for this complex work. Further research is needed to deepen understandings of the practice context, particularly with respect to risk. Policy-makers should engage with such research as they continue to develop adult protection/safeguarding policies...|$|R
5000|$|Serbia {{declared}} {{independence and}} {{war on the}} Ottoman Empire in 1876. The war ended with Serbian victory. Russian-Serbian relations deteriorated following the Treaty of San Stefano and Treaty of Berlin (1878), which <b>saw</b> Russian <b>protection</b> of neighbouring Bulgaria. Russia had made territorial concessions of partial Serbian expansion in the war to Bulgaria in the San Stefano treaty (superseded by the Berlin treaty), which was of great disappointment to Serbia. Following this, Serbian economic (and foreign policy) dependence on Austria-Hungary, which bordered Serbia to the north, modern Vojvodina, and the west in Bosnia and Herzegovina, was crucial. Serbian irredentism was forced, with Austro-Hungarian support, on the south and east, clashing with Bulgarian irredentism, with Russian support. Austria-Hungary and Serbia concluded a secret political agreement in 1881. The People's Radical Party was founded in 1881, gaining parliament majority by 1891; its aim was to throw off Austro-Hungarian dependence. Serbia was defeated in the war with Bulgaria in 1885, and Bulgarian unification was internationally recognized. Meanwhile, tensions between Serbia and Austria-Hungary grew. Serbian pretensions in creating a South Slavic state (Yugoslavism as opposed to Austro-Slavism) put fear in Austria-Hungary of potential devastation of the Austro-Hungarian empire. On the other hand, Russia became increasingly disappointed in Bulgaria where the monarchs, belonging to the German dynasty, pursued politics that Russia criticized. The 1901 massacres of Serbs in Kosovo was instrumental in a diplomatic conflict between Austria-Hungary, which supported the Albanians, and Serbia, which was supported by Russia. The Serbian king was overthrown in 1903, which saw the extinction of Obrenović dynasty and return of the Russophile Karađorđević dynasty. Serbia was supported by Russia in the economic Pig War (1906-08) with Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908; Russia did not interfere in the Bosnian crisis. The [...] "National Defence" [...] (Narodna Odbrana) organization was founded following the annexation, and sought to liberate Serb territories from Austro-Hungarian rule.|$|R
40|$|Axon {{degeneration}} plays {{a critical}} but ill-defined role in Parkinson disease (PD), and is actively regulated by pathways {{that are not}} well understood. Mitochondria orchestrate many of the processes that underlie axonal homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in PD pathogenesis. A better understanding of axonal mitochondria may therefore identify the cell biological processes that mediate degeneration and protection of the axon. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} mitochondrial transport is critical to axon protection after injury. I studied mitochondrial morphology, transport, and function in living zebrafish embryos. Using time-lapse confocal imaging of peripheral sensory neurons, I investigated the effect of injury on mitochondrial transport. I used two-photon laser axotomy to induce Wallerian degeneration (WD) of the distal axon. I found that acute transport arrest occurs in the distal axon, and motility does not recover before fragmentation. Although transport arrest was preserved in the proximal axon, which does not degenerate, increased mitochondrial trafficking after injury did not always correlate with axon protection. To determine whether mitochondrial ROS production is relevant to WD, I expressed the redox-sensitive biosensor roGFP 2 in the mitochondrial matrix. After injury, roGFP 2 was rapidly and persistently oxidized in the distal, but not the proximal, axon. The axon-protective protein WldS, which had only a mild and temporary effect on transport arrest after axotomy, robustly inhibited roGFP 2 oxidation and degeneration. To further investigate the importance of mitochondrial ROS production after injury, I expressed the transcriptional co-activator PGC- 1 alpha, which has roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS detoxification. I saw that overexpression of this protein delays roGFP 2 oxidation after injury, and delays WD. Mitochondrial ROS production is therefore a better predictor of axonal vulnerability than mitochondrial transport, and ROS detoxification may be a relevant therapeutic target to prevent axon degeneration. I then studied degeneration induced by alpha-synuclein (aSyn), a protein that is associated with PD. I expressed human wild-type aSyn in peripheral sensory neurons and saw that axon pathology precedes cell death in these cells. Early changes in mitochondrial morphology were consistent with increased fragmentation, and axonal varicosities were filled with swollen mitochondria. I also saw reduced mitochondrial trafficking in aSyn-expressing cells. Motile mitochondria favored retrograde transport towards the cell body. I hypothesized that protection of mitochondria might prevent degeneration in this model, as it had after axotomy. I therefore expressed PGC- 1 alpha in cells expressing aSyn, and <b>saw</b> robust <b>protection</b> against axon degeneration and cell death. These results suggest that axon degeneration pathways converge on mitochondrial dysfunction. Protection of mitochondria may therefore be a promising therapeutic target in the prevention and treatment of neurodegenerative disease...|$|R
