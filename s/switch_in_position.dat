5000|$|There {{have been}} several {{precursors}} to suspenders throughout the past 300 years, but modern suspenders were first invented in 1820 by Albert Thurston. They were once almost universally worn, due to the high cut of mid-nineteenth and early twentieth century trousers that made a belt impractical. During the nineteenth century, suspenders were sometimes called galluses. [...] Samuel Clemens, known for his work as the author Mark Twain, patented [...] "Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments" [...] (ADSG), {{becoming one of the}} first to receive a United States patent for suspenders in 1871. After losing popularity during World War I, when men became accustomed to uniform belts, suspenders were still regular attire throughout the 1920s. Because of their image as 'underwear', some men switched to belts during the 1930s as the vests which had hidden suspenders became worn less often. This also signaled the <b>switch</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> of securing buttons from the outside of the waistband to the inside. Life magazine stated in 1938 that 60% of American men chose belts over suspenders. Though the return of fuller-cut trousers in the 1940s revived suspenders, they did not dominate over belts again to the same extent. However, in the UK they remained the norm to wear with suits and dress trousers.|$|E
50|$|In 439, aggravated that Juqu Mujian's {{sister and}} {{sister-in-law}} Lady Li (with whom Juqu Mujian {{was having an}} affair) had tried to poison Princess Wuwei, and also unhappy that Juqu Mujian had friendly relations with Rouran, decided to launch a major attack on Northern Liang. Li Shun, who had previously advised him to attack Northern Liang, by this point had somehow switched positions and, along with Tuxi Bi, opposed such military actions, stating falsely that there was so little water and grass for grazing in Northern Liang that Northern Wei troops would suffer from thirst and hunger. At Cui Hao's insistence, however, Emperor Taiwu believed that he could conquer Northern Liang, and he launched the campaign. He quickly reached the Northern Liang capital Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) in the fall, capturing it after a short siege. Meanwhile, Yujiulü Wuti had launched a surprise attack on Pingcheng {{to try to save}} Northern Liang, but was repelled. (Cui Hao, who was a political enemy of Li Shun's, would attribute Li's <b>switch</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> to bribes by Juqu Mujian, and later Emperor Taiwu would force Li to commit suicide.) Northern Liang territory was largely in Northern Wei's control, and although both Juqu Mujian's brother Juqu Wuhui and Tufa Baozhou (禿髮保周), a son of Southern Liang's last prince Tufa Rutan, would try to hold various parts of Northern Liang territory, by 440 Tufa Baozhou would be dead by suicide after failures, and by 441 Juqu Wuhui had fled to Gaochang. Northern China was now united under Emperor Taiwu's reign, ending the Sixteen Kingdoms era and starting the Southern and Northern Dynasties era. He continued to treat Juqu Mujian as a brother-in-law, and Juqu Mujian was allowed to continue carry the title of Prince of Hexi.|$|E

40|$|In the {{constitutional}} history of South Africa, it was customary {{to provide the}} constitution with an Act number. Prior {{to the implementation of}} the 1993 Constitution (now repealed), Parliament was sovereign and as such could adopt, amend and repeal any law that it wished to. No distinction was made between a constitution and other ordinary parliamentary legislation. In pursuance of this tradition, Parliament passed the 1993 Constitution and accordingly allocated an Act number to it. Parliament became subordinate to the Constitution when it came into operation on 27 April 1994 and became the supreme law of the Republic (section 4). This <b>switch</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> meant that South Africa moved from a Westminster-type political order to one with a supreme Constitution.

40|$|Background: Mitochondria contain small genomes {{that are}} {{physically}} separate {{from those of}} nuclei. Their comparison serves as a model system for understanding the processes of genome evolution. Although complete mitochondrial genome sequences have been reported for more than 600 animals, the taxonomic sampling is highly biased toward vertebrates and arthropods, leaving much of the diversity yet uncharacterized. Results: The mitochondrial genome of a cephalopod mollusk, the Chambered Nautilus, is 16, 258 nts in length and 59. 5 percent A+T, both values that are typical of animal mitochondrial genomes. It contains the 37 genes that are typical for animal mtDNAs, with 15 on one DNA strand and 22 on the other.

There is strong skew in the distribution of nucleotides between the two strands.

40|$|Abstract Background Mitochondria contain small genomes {{that are}} {{physically}} separate {{from those of}} nuclei. Their comparison serves as a model system for understanding the processes of genome evolution. Although complete mitochondrial genome sequences have been reported for more than 600 animals, the taxonomic sampling is highly biased toward vertebrates and arthropods, leaving much of the diversity yet uncharacterized. Results The mitochondrial genome of the bellybutton nautilus, Nautilus macromphalus, a cephalopod mollusk, is 16, 258 nts in length and 59. 5 % A+T, both values that are typical of animal mitochondrial genomes. It contains the 37 genes that are almost universally found in animal mtDNAs, with 15 on one DNA strand and 22 on the other. The arrangement of these genes {{can be derived from}} that of the distantly related Katharina tunicata (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) by a <b>switch</b> <b>in</b> <b>position</b> of two large blocks of genes and transpositions of four tRNA genes. There is strong skew in the distribution of nucleotides between the two strands, and analysis of this yields insight into modes of transcription and replication. There is an unusual number of non-coding regions and their function, if any, is not known; however, several of these demark abrupt shifts in nucleotide skew, and there are several identical sequence elements at these junctions, suggesting that they may play roles in transcription and/or replication. One of the non-coding regions contains multiple repeats of a tRNA-like sequence. Some of the tRNA genes appear to overlap on the same strand, but this could be resolved if the polycistron were cleaved {{at the beginning of the}} downstream gene, followed by polyadenylation of the product of the upstream gene to form a fully paired structure.

It contains an unusual number of non-coding regions, especially considering that these otherwise often are generated by the same processes that produce gene rearrangements. The skew in nucleotide composition between the two strands is strong and associated with the direction of transcription in various parts of the genomes, but a comparison with K. tunicata implies that mutational bias during replication also plays a role. This appears to be yet another case where polyadenylation of mitochondrial tRNAs restores what would otherwise be an incomplete structure. </p...|$|E
