5000|$|A clip-on nut, {{also known}} as a sheet metal nut or a <b>speed</b> <b>nut</b> (but this is ambiguous, see <b>speed</b> <b>nut),</b> is a type of nut {{designed}} to be clipped to sheet metal. It is a type of captive nut commonly made as a cage nut.|$|E
50|$|The <b>speed</b> <b>nut</b> {{was invented}} by Albert H. Tinnerman, son of George Tinnerman (who founded Tinnerman Steel Range Company), in 1936. Tinnerman invented the nut to resolve issues with stove shipping. The {{invention}} was so successful it led the company away from building stoves to building fasteners.Tinnerman Products evolved from the <b>speed</b> <b>nut</b> development with manufacturing plants in Cleveland, Ohio. A modern manufacturing plant was constructed on Brookpark Road in the mid-1950s. Tinnerman Products was later acquired by Eaton Yale & Towne (Eaton Corporation).|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of speed nuts, mostly dependent on the shape of the nut, how it attaches to the workpiece, and what type of screw can be used. Most types are designed for either machine screws or sheet metal screws. Some nuts do not attach to the workpiece. These are usually shaped as either a rectangle, a flange nut, or a hex nut; the rectangular <b>speed</b> <b>nut</b> is also known as a flat-style <b>speed</b> <b>nut.</b> Speed nuts that attach to the workpiece usually are some form of a J-nut or U-nut.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis was {{performed}} at Scania CV AB in Södertälje at the engine development department, NMKA and at Scania Latin America in Sao Paolo, Brazil. Scania {{is a global}} company with operations in Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa and Australia. Scania is the world’s third largest manufacturer for heavy trucks and heavy bus segment. The constant development of new design solutions demands more stable mounting in Scanias production. Assemblies with new screw joints with different parameters affect {{the value of the}} clamping force for the joint and consequently the final product. It is critical that the screw joint has the right clamping force to assure that it fulfils its purpose. Large deviations can result in total loss of clamping force and engine breakdown. The purpose with this master thesis was to find the most important factors that affect the clamping force and form the basis of how different screw joints should be handled. Knowledge about Scania screw joints were collected by working in the production, observing drawings, a thorough literature study and by interviewing representatives from different departments. The problems regarding screw joints were found to be rather different at the departments and the problems had been an issue {{for a longer period of}} time. The mapping of screw joints resulted in a number of interesting screw joints with different kinds of problems. A discussion about the interesting screw joints was held in order to select joints to take a closer look at. By focusing on area of interest, area of responsibility and resources, five screw joints were selected, rocker arm shaft, main bearing cap, connecting rod and the oil sump in both aluminum and steel. The chosen screw joints represented specific types of screw joints on which the chosen parameters were tested. The important parameters that were tested are driver speed, friction and settlement. The equipment that was used throughout the work was the Ultrasonic, which measures the length of a screw with ultrasound. The authors feel that the equipment has given reliable results and that it has been easy and convenient to use during the tests since time consuming strain gages were avoided. The test results shows that the <b>speed</b> of the <b>nut</b> runner has a great influence on the clamping force and torque. Depending on the nut runner and which kind of screw joint that is examined the clamping force and torque varies. The friction affects the result of the tightening substantially, especially when tightening by torque. If torque and angle tightening is used it is an advantage to keep the initial torque as low as possible but high enough to keep the surfaces tight together before applying the angle. The test results regarding settlement show that the settlement is extremely dependent on the ingoing parts in the screw joint. Parameters such as screw and clamped parts affect both the tightening procedure and degree of settlement. The authors recommendations are that a decision has to be made about what information is important for each department. Furthermore, as the tightening procedure is really important for the final clamping force it is advisable to decide which department that is responsible of making the correct tightening parameters of a specific screw joint in the production. Hopefully this master thesis has woken an interest which in the future can make a difference for an even more stable production and in the end an even better quality at Scania CV AB.

5000|$|A <b>speed</b> <b>nut,</b> aka {{sheet metal}} nut or Tinnerman nut, {{is a type}} of locknut with two sheet metal prongs that act as one thread. They are made from spring steel.|$|E
5000|$|A J-nut is a nut that clips to {{the edge}} of the sheet metal. It is named after the way it is shaped; the thread is on the long side of the [...] "J". The thread may either be of a <b>speed</b> <b>nut</b> form or have an {{integrated}} hex or square nut. Due to the short retaining leg the nut is allowed to float more, which can help with misalignment, but the nut is free to un-clip from the sheet metal as well.|$|E
5000|$|A U-nut is {{very similar}} to a J-nut except that both legs are the same length. Because of this a {{retaining}} clip is usually formed on the leg without the threads. This helps keep the nut in place while not screwed down. The thread may be of a <b>speed</b> <b>nut</b> style, integrated nut, or have an extruded portion that is tapped.There are [...] "standard" [...] and [...] "wide-panel" [...] versions; the standard version has a solid hinge section, whereas the wide-panel version has a longer hinge with the center section cut-away to allow for easier installation.|$|E
5000|$|Tinnerman Wilderness Canoe Base, more {{commonly}} known as Tinnerman Canoe Base, is a [...] "high-adventure base" [...] located {{on the banks of}} the French River, in Ontario. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the French River area was a major trade route used to exchange furs trapped in the West with various goods made in the East and in Europe. Tinnerman is nicknamed the [...] "Land of the Joli Voyageur". The land that the Tinnerman base is located on was owned by Albert H. Tinnerman, inventor of the <b>speed</b> <b>nut.</b> After Mr. Tinnerman's passing in 1961, his grandson Bill Buttriss of Cleveland Ohio tried to obtain a commercial license for the camp. The Ontario government said that any one area would support only so many camps and they felt the lower French had enough camps at that time. Though appealed, a license was not possible for the camp. It was at this time the family decided to donate the camp to the Cleveland Area Scout Council. Two weeks after the formal donation, Mr. Buttriss received a letter from the Ontario government stating that since one of the camps in the area had closed its doors (Rainbow Lodge on Bass Creek), the license would now be available.|$|E
40|$|In Phase I of the Non-Intrusive Speed Sensor program, a {{computerized}} literature search {{was performed to}} identify candidate technologies for remote, non-intrusive speed sensing applications in Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) turbopumps. The three most promising technologies were subjected to experimental evaluation to quantify their performance characteristics under the harsh environmental requirements within the turbopumps. Although the infrared and microwave approaches demonstrated excellent cavitation immunity in laboratory tests, the variable-source magnetic speed sensor emerged as the most viable approach. Preliminary design of this speed sensor encountered no technical obstacles and resulted in viable and feasible <b>speed</b> <b>nut,</b> sensor housing, and sensor coil designs. Phase II of this program developed the variable-source magnetic speed sensor through the detailed design task and guided the design into breadboard fabrication. The speed sensor and its integral <b>speed</b> <b>nut</b> were evaluated at both unit and system level testing. The final room-temperature and cryogenic spin testing of the hardware demonstrated that the sensor was capable of generating sufficient output signal to enable remote speed sensing from 1500 to 40000 rpm over a speed nut/sensor separation of 3. 5 inches...|$|E
