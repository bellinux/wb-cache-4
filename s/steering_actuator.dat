40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the setting of}} power requirements of the <b>steering</b> <b>actuator</b> for an electric demonstration vehicle (EDV). The EDV is a small one-seater vehicle with mass of approximately ~ 400 kg and {{is equipped with a}} steer-by-wire system. The dimensioning of steering systems components other than the <b>steering</b> <b>actuator</b> is not discussed in this report. An analytic method has been developed to estimate maximum expected steering torque in creep and high speed scenarios. Furthermore, the model allows the prediction of suspension geometry influence on steering torque amplitude. The steering effort is analyzed by means of maximum expected tire forces, which are estimated by a simple physical tire model. In the tire model maximum tire-to-ground friction is estimated for various driving scenarios considering the physical limits of the tires. This approach allows the analysis to be performed independent of vehicle motion and without a detailed dynamic car model. The general design of the steer-by-wire system and a steering control setup is presented in order to evaluate the proposed steering system with respect to control time and precision. This is accomplished for a given actuator setup.

The Smart Space Drilling System (SSDS), which is currently being developed at Northeastern University (NU), is a compact self-propelled, steerable electromechanical drilling system that can penetrate into large depths in planetary bodies. In this paper we present the detailed design and modeling of the SSDS. Its main components are: a) the drill bit/cuttings bucket, b) the rotary propulsion unit including three 3 -degree of freedom (DOF) propulsion actuators, c) the power/control module, d) the non-rotating steering unit including three 1 -DOF <b>steering</b> <b>actuators</b> and e) the communication module.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with an integrated vehicle dynamic control using different kind of actuators. The new and very interesting trends in vehicle dynamic control are to synthesize multivariable controllers using LPV/H∞ framework, see [1]. A new strategy for global chassis control is proposed using a smart coordination between the front/rear active <b>steering</b> <b>actuators</b> and four active suspension ones {{in order to improve}} vehicle handling and ride performances. This control is achieved in the LPV/H∞ robust control framework, which allows activating appropriately the steering controllers and performs suitable combination with the suspension control depending on some varying parameters. First the use of front and rear <b>steering</b> <b>actuators</b> is of great interest to control the yaw rate, and to maintain a low side-slip angle {{in order to keep the}} vehicle stability (without using the braking systems that would reduce the vehicle speed). On the other hand the suspension control is adapted simultaneously (for each of the four active dampers) in order to ensure the passenger comfort in normal situations and, in the case of critical driving situations, to improve the road handling performances. In particular the objectives will be to mitigate the influence of the road profile (stochastic), to reduce the effects of load transfers, and to minimize the roll angle. A specific stability monitor based on the vehicle side-slip measurement provides the scheduling parameter which enables the active steering control when a dangerous situation appears. This new kind of scheduling strategy permits smooth control actions between the suspension and steering systems. The interesting side effect concerns the prevention of the car skidding behavior that would appear using active braking systems (due to possible high braking torques). Simulations on a full non-linear vehicle model, subject to dangerous driving situation, reveals the satisfactory improvements on the vehicle handling performance, stability and robustness of the proposed LPV/H∞ control strategy...|$|R
