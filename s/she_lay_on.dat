500|$|While in Toulon harbor on 29 December 1880, Richelieu {{caught fire}} {{and had to}} be scuttled to prevent her {{magazines}} from exploding. The ship capsized to port in [...] of water; <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> her barbettes almost at a 90° angle. In order to salvage her, all accessible guns, ammunition, masts, armor and movable decks were removed and the equivalent weight was placed in the ship's holds to lower her center of gravity. A sheer hulk was moved to her port side and cables were connected to [...] {{on the other side of}} Richelieu. 360 empty casks and [...] of cork were attached to the starboard side to prevent the ship from rolling too far the other way. After an hour and a half of lifting, Richelieu had been righted to a 45° angle; a subsequent effort completed the job.|$|E
2500|$|Without warning, {{automatic}} gunfire {{was discharged}} into the anti-Gaddafi protesters at 10:18am. Eleven people were hit, including the unarmed Fletcher who was fatally {{wounded in the}} stomach. As <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the ground, her fiancé (who was also a serving police officer) was at her side. Fletcher was taken to Westminster Hospital where she died from her injuries approximately one hour later. Libyan radio reported that the embassy was stormed and that those in the building fired back in self-defence against [...] "a most horrible terrorist action".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), {{when a man}} had an {{emission}} of semen, he was to bathe and remain unclean until evening. All material on which semen fell was to be washed in water and remain unclean until evening. And if a man had carnal relations with a woman, they were both to bathe and remain unclean until evening. When a woman had a menstrual discharge, she was to remain impure seven days, and whoever touched her was to be unclean until evening. Anything that <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> or sat on was unclean. Anyone who touched her bedding or any object on which she has sat was to wash his clothes, bathe in water, and remain unclean until evening. And if a man lay with her, her impurity was communicated {{to him and he}} was to be unclean seven days, and any bedding on which he lay became unclean. When a woman had an irregular discharge of blood, she was to be unclean as long as her discharge lasted. Seven days after the discharge ended, she was to be clean.|$|E
2500|$|Soon after that, Changing Woman {{wished for}} a mate. Every {{morning when the}} sun rose <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> her back until noon, {{her head to the}} west and her feet to the east. [...] At noon she went to the spring. She lay under the ledge and let spring water drip over her body. This took place each day for four days. On the fourth day, she heard a sound behind her and turned and saw a young man on a great white horse with black eyes. It had a long white mane, and pranced above the ground and not on the earth itself. The bridle and the saddle were white. The young man's moccasins and {{leggings}} were also white. The rider spoke: [...] "You lay towards me each morning until noon. When I am half over the center of the earth, you go to the spring. Your wish could not have two meanings. Go home and tell your father to build a brush hogan to the south of your home. Fill a basket with meal and set it in the hogan. Make a line of pollen from east to west across the basket on top of the meal. Make a line of pollen from north to south drawn around the basket. You and your father must sit there late into the night. He will then go home to his wife and you must stay there alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|One day {{her mother}} {{gave her a}} pair of new shoes; and after a fuss about putting them on, Kitty said, as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> kicking <b>on</b> the floor,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Yet, {{the next}} moment, {{she bit her}} lips as if the {{expression}} had unwittingly escaped her; and with a reckless shrug of her shoulders <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> back <b>on</b> her pillow.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'VE {{finished}} my book, {{and now what}} CAN I do till this tiresome rain is over?" [...] exclaimed Carrie, as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> back <b>on</b> the couch with a yawn of weariness.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Joe {{wants me}} to but I can't. Mother's last words to me, as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> her dying-bed, were, [...] "Never, never run away, Miranda," [...] and I promised.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'It wasn't foolish,' she said, still {{gazing at}} him as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the floor, with a sofa cushion under her head. 'It {{was the right thing}} to do. I knew best, then.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Lucy Peacock is {{the author}} of a facetious book of poems {{entitled}} [...] "Limericks by Lucy Peacock as The Duchess of Malfi - written as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> dead <b>on</b> the stage" [...] (2011).|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> back <b>on</b> her {{bed with}} closed eyes whilst Licinia kissed {{her hands and}} feet, re-arranged the {{embroidered}} coverlet and the downy cushions, {{and after a while}} shuffled out of the room.|$|R
60|$|It was daybreak, and {{the first}} gleam of light that leaped over the glassy sea tinged the golden curls of Polly Samson as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> {{sleeping}} <b>on</b> one of the cabin sofas. She awoke and started up.|$|R
60|$|When Dora's {{mind was}} once more clear {{she found herself}} in a much larger cabin than that she had {{formerly}} occupied. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> a couch, and Mrs. Goss, a fat, ugly-looking creature, sat beside her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> a {{couch in}} a small room curtained off from another, the latter large and light, and from which came a sound of low voices. She heard the quick tread of men; a door opened.|$|E
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> {{her back}} she tried twice {{to raise her}} arm. The third time she got two thin fingers to her lips and blew a kiss out of the black pit to Billy Jackson. Her arm fell back limply.|$|E
60|$|Rose for {{a moment}} could not see it. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> flat <b>on</b> her side, a two-master, her sails {{flapping}} and floating on the waves. Her anchor still held, but she had listed her cargo, careened, and so lay helpless.|$|R
50|$|The narrator visits {{his girlfriend}} {{one last time}} as <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> weakly <b>on</b> the beach, {{watching}} the sunset, listlessly begging {{to be allowed to}} work on her tan. The narrator quietly walks away, leaving her alone and contemplating his own mortality.|$|R
6000|$|Could John {{have heard}} what the poor girl was moaning to herself {{at that moment}} as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> writhing <b>on</b> the bed, he would have doubted her mother's assurance. 'If he had been dead I could have borne it, but this I cannot bear!' ...|$|R
60|$|Christine was so shaken {{that she}} was obliged to receive him as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> a sofa, beside the square table which was to have borne their evening feast. She fixed her eyes wistfully upon him, and smiled a sad smile.|$|E
60|$|A {{pleasant}} journey, a {{great deal}} of hugging and kissing, some tears and tender laments for baby, and then it was time to show the quilt, which mamma said was just what she wanted to throw over her feet as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> the sofa.|$|E
60|$|Over {{and over}} she rolled. Around and around she spun. She turned somersaults. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> {{her back and}} kicked her heels in the air. Never in his life had he known any one to act like that. There must be {{something}} the matter with her.|$|E
60|$|The brazen-tongued mill clock clanged {{the hour}} of two, when {{shuffling}} uncertain footsteps sounded on the hollow stairs. Rose raised her head to listen.

6000|$|... "I'm so glad I {{tried to}} look {{pleasant}} when I {{was lying on the}} board while Ralph did my head, for the pleasantness got into the clay face, and that made the lady like it," [...] said Jill, as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> resting <b>on</b> the sofa.|$|R
6000|$|Well, {{we managed}} to get her up into shallow water. When the tide receded <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> there <b>on</b> her side in the mud, quite a pitiable object for the premier battle-ship of a world--"the terror of the seas" [...] was the way Perry had {{occasionally}} described her.|$|R
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> {{her back}} {{she could see}} nothing above her. She was not cold for the straw around her formed a warm bed, and her cloak had been {{carefully}} arranged so as to cover her completely, whilst her feet were wrapped up snugly in a rug.|$|E
60|$|Eve turned quickly, and beheld {{the arms}} of her parent extended. She threw herself into them, when the pent and irresistible {{emotions}} broke loose in both, for they wept together, as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> his bosom, with a violence that in a man it was awfully painful to witness.|$|E
6000|$|... "The hour is near, brother," [...] Grace whispered, as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> <b>on</b> my bosom.

6000|$|... "I know he won't be any happier {{about it}} than someone else, who stood by you all through, and set her bright wits to work till the trouble was all cleared away," [...] said Mrs. Minot, looking at Jill's {{contented}} face, as <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> smiling <b>on</b> them all.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> down <b>on</b> her {{bed with}} a heavy sigh, and tried to sleep. It was useless. The dull weariness of herself which now possessed her was not the weariness which finds its remedy in repose. She rose again and sat by the window, looking out listlessly over the sea.|$|R
60|$|Maisie {{would have}} wept on the least encouragement, but Dick's indifference, albeit {{his hand was}} shaking as {{he picked up the}} pistol, {{restrained}} her. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> panting <b>on</b> the beach while Dick methodically bombarded the breakwater. 'Got it at last!' he exclaimed, as a lock of weed flew from the wood.|$|R
