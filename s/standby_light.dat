40|$|This study predicts new hybrid {{lighting}} {{applications for}} LEDs. In hybrid lighting, LEDs provide a low-energy 'standby' light level while another, more powerful, efficient light source provides light for occupied periods. Lighting controls {{will allow the}} two light sources to work together through an appropriate control strategy, typically motion-sensing. There are no technical barriers preventing the use of low through high CRI LEDs for <b>standby</b> <b>lighting</b> in many interior and exterior applications today. The total luminous efficacy of LED systems could be raised by increasing the electrical efficiency of LED drivers to the maximum practically achievable level (94 %). This would increase system luminous efficacy by 20 - 25 %. The expected market volumes for many types of LEDs should justify the evolution of new LED drivers that use highly efficient ICs and reduce parts count by means of ASICs. Reducing their electronics parts count by offloading discrete components onto integrated circuits (IC) will allow manufacturers {{to reduce the cost}} of LED driver electronics. LED luminaire manufacturers will increasingly integrate the LED driver and thermal management directly in the LED fixture. LED luminaires of the future will likely have no need for separable lamp and ballast because the equipment life of all the LED luminaire components will all be about the same (50, 000 hours). The controls and communications techniques used for communicating with conventional light sources, such as dimmable fluorescent lighting, are appropriate for LED illumination for energy management purposes. DALI has been used to control LED systems in new applications and the emerging ZigBee protocol could be used for LEDs as well. Major lighting companies are already moving in this direction. The most significant finding {{is that there is a}} significant opportunity to use LEDs today for <b>standby</b> <b>lighting</b> purposes. Conventional lighting systems can be made more efficient still by using LEDs to provide a low-energy standby state when lower light levels are acceptable...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{light source}} was a carbide lamp (acetylene gas lamp). It was converted to electric power on 23 March 1966, with an acetylene gas <b>standby.</b> The current <b>light</b> source is a 1,000 watt tungsten-halogen lamp.|$|R

[2] have compared lifetimes of series (parallel) systems arising out of different allocations {{of one or two}} <b>standby</b> redundancies in <b>light</b> of the hazard rate order, the increasing concave (convex) order, and the stochastic precedence order. Moreover, other authors have studied stochastic comparisons of lifetimes of series and parallel systems; for example, see [3 – 12], and references cited therein.|$|R
5000|$|Blue Shift 1 (2001): ‘Blue Shift’ is an {{interactive}} art installation, made for Art Center STUK in Leuven (Belgium). This Darwinian installation piece was realized together with evolutionary biologist Prof. Luc De Meester from the University of Leuven (Belgium) and engineers from electronics company Philips (Turnhout, Belgium). The project was originally conceived {{for the exhibition}} 'Hot Re-Strike' (curated by Stef Van Bellingen) at De Warande arts centre in Turnhout (Belgium) in 2005. Blue Shift (LOG.1) is {{an interactive}} art installation with a living model ecosystem at its core. Using single-cell algae, water fleas, fish and water snails, a compact aquatic community is {{set up in the}} exhibition space. The whole system is designed {{in such a way that}} visitors drastically induce a gradual microevolution of the - genetically determined - light-responsive behavior of the water fleas. When the system is in <b>standby,</b> yellow <b>lights</b> illuminate the aquaria from the top. The water fleas are strongly attracted to this light and swim near the surface of the water. Whenever a visitor approaches the installation and passes a wall-mounted sensor, blue spotlights on top of the aquaria are activated. The water fleas are repelled by this color of light, flee downwards and pass through holes in a false bottom of the aquaria. However, fish are residing in the lower sections of the aquaria and most of the water fleas are immediately wiped out. What can be considered to be a survival strategy in natural circumstances - blue light indicates clear open water and hence potential detection by fish - has quite a different meaning in this set up: it are exactly those water fleas which do not swim away from the blue light, that survive and reproduce. In this way, their genes will become dominant in the water flea populations and a 'contra-natural' selection will occur. When the work is on display, the artists-scientists continuously adjust the set-up and carry out new experiments. The installation aims to question the status of the utilitarian in art and science, and push interactive installation art into Darwinian realms.|$|R
40|$|The {{time when}} {{energy-related}} carbon emissions come overwhelmingly from developed countries {{is coming to}} a close. China has already overtaken the United States as the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. The economic growth that China has experienced {{is not expected to}} slow down significantly in the long term, which implies continued massive growth in energy demand. This paper draws on the extensive expertise from the China Energy Group at LBNL on forecasting energy consumption in China, but adds to it by exploring the dynamics of demand growth for electricity in the residential sector [...] and the realistic potential for coping with it through efficiency. This paper forecasts ownership growth of each product using econometric modeling, in combination with historical trends in China. The products considered (refrigerators, air conditioners, fans, washing machines, <b>lighting,</b> <b>standby</b> power, space heaters, and water heating) account for 90 percent of household electricity consumption in China. Using this method, we determine the trend and dynamics of demand growth and its dependence on macroeconomic drivers at a level of detail not accessible by models of a more aggregate nature. In addition, we present scenarios for reducing residential consumption through efficiency measures defined at the product level. The research takes advantage of an analytical framework developed by LBNL (BUENAS) which integrates end use technology parameters into demand forecasting and stock accounting to produce detailed efficiency scenarios, thus allowing for a technologically realistic assessment of efficiency opportunities specifically in the Chinese context...|$|R
