50|$|Violin {{varnishing}} is a multi-step process involving {{some or all}} of the following: primer, sealer, ground, color coats, {{and clear}} topcoat. Some systems use a drying oil varnish as described below, while others use <b>spirit</b> (or solvent) <b>varnish.</b> Touchup in repair or restoration is only done with <b>spirit</b> <b>varnish.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Charles Mennégand used a reddish-brown <b>spirit</b> <b>varnish</b> {{with golden}} {{highlights}} {{and he was}} very particular about using carefully chosen wood of an even and medium grain. He signed his work internally [...] "C. Mennegand" [...] or used printed labels reading Mennégand / Luthier / 26 rue de Trévise, Paris or C. Mennégand luthier / 26, rue de Trévise, Paris.|$|R
5000|$|Most resin or [...] "gum" [...] {{varnishes}} {{consist of}} a natural, plant- or insect-derived substance dissolved in a solvent, called <b>spirit</b> <b>varnish</b> or solvent varnish. The solvent may be alcohol, turpentine, or petroleum-based. Some resins are soluble in both alcohol and turpentine. Generally, petroleum solvents, i.e. mineral spirits or paint thinner, can substitute for turpentine. The resins include amber, dammar, copal, rosin, sandarac, elemi, benzoin, mastic, balsam, shellac, and a multitude of lacquers.|$|R
40|$|Two violins were investigated. The only {{intentionally}} introduced {{difference between}} them {{was the type of}} varnish. One of the instruments was covered with a <b>spirit</b> <b>varnish,</b> the other was oil varnished. Experimental modal analysis was done for unvarnished/varnished violins and a questionnaire inquiry on the instrument’s sound quality was performed. The aim of both examinations was to find differences and similarities between the two instruments in the objective (modal parameters) and subjective domain (subjective evaluation of sound quality). In the modal analysis, three strongly radiating signature modes were taken into account. Varnishing did not change the sequence of mode shapes. Modal frequencies A 0 and B(1 +) were not changed by oil varnishing compared to the unvarnished condition. For the oil varnished instrument, the frequency of mode B(1 +) was lower than that of the same mode of the <b>spirit</b> <b>varnished</b> instrument. Our two violins were not excellent instruments, but before varnishing they were practically identical. However, after varnishing it appeared that the oil-varnished violin was better than the spirit-varnished instrument. Therefore, it can be assumed with a fairly high probability that also in general, the oil-varnished violins sound somewhat better than initially identical spirit-varnished ones...|$|R
50|$|Kennedy was a {{prolific}} maker, working in various grades, from unpurﬂed instruments with thin dark and cracked varnish to distinguished and superbly ﬁnished instruments with a ﬁne transparent <b>spirit</b> <b>varnish.</b> He {{was well known}} to experiment and built some of his instruments with the bass-bar and the table carved out of a single slab of wood, in opposition to his prime work where the bar was glued {{on the inside of}} the table, like the Italian masters did. Today, very few instruments still bear the original design however, as most were restored or upgraded.|$|R
5000|$|This recipe bears a {{remarkable}} similarity to one for gold size published by both (Robert Dossie, 1764) [...] and (Stalker and Parker, 1688). In that version, linseed oil is boiled together with gum animi, asphaltum, litharge and umber in {{approximately the same}} proportions as the Pontypool recipe. (Watin, 1755) [...] also describes the use of asphaltum as an addition to the well-known <b>spirit</b> <b>varnishes</b> of the day. It appears that the secret recipe for Pontypool japan had been in existence for some time before its use for japanning metal.|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of overall}} paint or varnish {{decoration}} on {{large pieces of}} furniture was first popularised in Venice (then later throughout Italy). There {{are a number of}} 13th century references to painted or varnished cassone, often dowry cassone that were made deliberately impressive as part of dynastic marriages. The definition of varnish is not always clear, but it {{seems to have been a}} <b>spirit</b> <b>varnish</b> based on gum benjamin or mastic, both traded around the Mediterranean. At some time, shellac began to be used as well. An article from the Journal of the American Institute of Conservation describes the use of infrared spectroscopy to identify a shellac coating on a 16th-century cassone. This is also the period in history where [...] "varnisher" [...] was identified as a distinct trade, separate from both carpenter and artist.|$|R
5000|$|He used a <b>spirit</b> <b>varnish</b> which {{sometimes}} {{appears to have}} saturated the wood.His choice of wood was not always the best but that {{is due to the}} times in which he was living. From the 1750s {{to the end of the}} century Italy endured many wars and finding materials for instrument makers was at times very difficult."Decades of war, “reforms,” and repeated conquests by the French and Austrians dismantled the social and economic structure of Cremona as Duane Rosengard explains in a 1991 paper published in the Journal of the Violin Society of America. In the 1770s, just as Storioni emerged, the guilds that had governed the skilled crafts since the Middle Ages were abolished by the conquering Austrians. The Jesuit fathers, whose educational institutions were major patrons of the violin makers, were suppressed by the Pope; and the lay corporations, who conducted commerce on behalf of Cremona’s religious orders, were abolished. The church and nobility—primary patrons of the violin makers—lost power and money as the French and Austrians taxed and requisitioned treasure out of Italy to pay for the wars." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{most notable}} driers are litharge, sugar of lead, patent driers, sulfate of zinc and {{manganese}} dioxide. Liquid driers, such as terebene, {{are also in}} use. Litharge, an oxide of lead, is in most general use. Sugar of lead is used, ground in oil, for light tints. Sulfate of zinc and manganese driers are used for paints in which zinc white is the base, which would be injured by lead driers. Pigments are preparations of metallic, earthy or animal origin mixed into paint to give it color. For oil paint they are usually ground in oil; for distemper they are sold as a finely ground powder. The ordinary pigments are white lead, zinc white, umbers, siennas, ochres, chromes, Venetian red, Indian red, lampblack, bone black, vegetable black, ultramarine, Prussian blue, vermilion, red lead, oxide of iron, lakes and Vandyke brown. The term enamel paint was first given to a compound of zinc white, petrol and resin, which possessed on drying a hard glossy surface. The name is now applied to any colored paint of this nature. Quick-drying enamels are <b>spirit</b> <b>varnishes</b> ground with the desired pigment. For slow-drying enamels oil varnishes form the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|It is hard, {{durable and}} quick drying, but unless the varnish is {{carefully}} made it {{is liable to}} crack. Varnishes for inside work, or cabinet varnishes, are made {{with a variety of}} resins dissolved in linseed oil and turpentine. The resultant gives a hard, lustrous surface, somewhat less durable than that of carriage varnishes. Turpentine varnishes are made from soft gums, such as dammar, common resin and mastic; they are light in color, cheap and not very durable. Lacquers or <b>spirit</b> <b>varnishes</b> are made from very soft gums, such as shellac and sandarach, dissolved in methylated spirit. They are used for internal work, drying quickly, and becoming hard and very brilliant. Surfaces formed with such varnishes are liable to chip easily and scale off. Oil paint is very much improved by the addition of some varnish; it causes it to dry harder and more quickly and with a fine lustrous surface. The driers used for varnish are generally acetate of lead or litharge. An excess of driers makes the varnish less durable and causes cracking. There are many kinds of French polishes, mixed in different ways, but most are composed of shellac and sandarach dissolved in spirit. It is applied to the perfectly smooth surface of hard woods with a pad of flannel or wadding wrapped in linen, and well rubbed in with a circular motion.|$|R
5000|$|Golden {{produces}} {{two lines}} of [...] "final picture" [...] varnishes: polymer varnishes with ultraviolet light blocking properties are made for use with acrylic paints; mineral <b>spirit</b> acrylic (MSA) <b>varnishes</b> are made for use with both acrylic and oil paints and available in brush-able fluid and aerosol formulas. All the varnishes offered by Golden are removable for conservation and cleaning.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{paint is}} a type of slow-drying paint that {{consists}} of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil, commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white <b>spirit,</b> and <b>varnish</b> may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried oil paint film. Oil paints have been used in Europe since the 12th century for simple decoration, but were not widely adopted as an artistic medium until the early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties, it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation. Thickness of coat has considerable bearing on time required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively quickly.|$|R
40|$|Varnish {{and its use}} {{has been}} known since ancient times. Altho the {{knowledge}} of varnish {{has been attributed to}} the Japanese as early as 500 - 600 B. C., Tschirsch and A. D. Stevens say that the Japs did not possess this art originally, but that they probably acquired it from the continent during the third century. Nevertheless, varnish did not come into general use until the middle ages. In the 12 th century, a monk by the name of Theophilus published the first directions for making an oil varnish, {{but it was not until}} 1790 in England, and between 1820 and 1830 in France and Germany, that a factory was established for the commercial production of varnish. In general, a varnish may be defied as a homogeneous, sticky, viscous solution of resins, of a colloidal nature, which when applied to a surface in a thin coat, dries to a hard, smooth, glossy surface. The color of varnish varies considerably, depending on the grade and on its use. Pale varnishes are generally sought, yet there are many dark varnishes of excellent quality. The following scale gives an idea of the degree of color of varnish. A solution of 0. 25 g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 in 100 g pure concentrated H 2 SO 4 is equivalent to a very light varnish. A solution of 2. 00 g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 in 100 g pure concentrated H 2 SO 4 is equivalent to a medium varnish. A solution of 4. 00 g K 2 Cr 2 O 7 in 100 g pure concentrated H 2 SO 4 is equivalent to a dark varnish. Varnishes may be divided into two main classes, according to the manner in which the film dries. The varnishes of the first class, which is the largest and most important, are known as oil varnishes. These varnishes dry mainly by the oxidation of the oil, which forms a tough, elastic film. The secondary drying in these oil varnishes is caused by the evaporation of the volatile vehicle, and by the polymerization of the constituents. On the whole, the drying of an oil varnish is of a chemical nature. The varnishes of the second class are called <b>spirit</b> <b>varnishes.</b> These dry merely by the evaporation of the solvent, and there is practically no chemical action. The gum is transferred from a lump form into a thin sheet by means of the solvent. The most important example of this class is shellac, which is the hardened secretion of the lac insect, dissolved in alcohol...|$|R
