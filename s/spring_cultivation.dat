Atlantic e Pérola, obtidos do cultivo de outono (53; 68 e 100 dias após o plantio - DAP) e primavera (70; 78 e 99 DAP) foram levados ao laboratório e classificados quanto ao diâmetro (50 mm), contados e determinada individualmente a massa fresca. Em seguida, coletaram-se amostras para análise dos teores de amido, carboidratos solúveis totais, açúcares redutores e sacarose. Durante o cultivo de outono, a {{cultivar}} Atlantic apresentou maior massa fresca dos tubérculos ao final do ciclo e a cv. Pérola apresentou maior número de tubérculos em todas as colheitas. No cultivo da primavera a cv. Pérola apresentou maior massa fresca média dos tubérculos, sendo que em ambas cultivares, observou-se redução da produtividade ao final do ciclo, talvez em resposta ao estresse hídrico verificado no período. Considerando o fator cultivar, observa-se que o teor de amido foi significativamente maior nos tubérculos da cv. Pérola aos 53 e 100 DAP do cultivo de outono, enquanto a cv. Atlantic apresentou valores significativamente maiores de carboidratos solúveis totais aos 53 DAP. Houve redução nos teores de açúcares redutores, em ambas cultivares, ao final do cultivo de outono, o que também foi verificado para os teores de sacarose. Os teores de amido e carboidratos solúveis totais reduziram, em ambas cultivares ao longo do ciclo de primavera, sendo que não houve diferença entre as cultivares em relação aos teores de açúcares redutores e sacarose ao final do cultivo de primavera.

The effects of three irrigation programs (when depleted 30, 50 and 70 % of the available water holding capacity within 0. 90 m soil profile depth) on two grape cultivar (semillon and razaki) yields, and resulting CWSI were investigated. The non–irrigation treatment (NI) was also used for determination of fully stressed baseline. The lower (non-stressed) and upper (stressed) baselines were determined from measurements of canopy temperatures, ambient air temperatures and vapor pressure deficit values and the CWSI was calculated with three irrigation levels using the empirical approach.

A baseline scenario describing the current <b>spring</b> barley <b>cultivation</b> in Denmark was defined, and the expected main deviations were identified (differences in pesticide treatment index, modifications in nitrate leaching and change in crop yield). The main input data originate from experiments, where spring barley cultivars were cultivated in a climate phytotron under controlled and manipulated treatments. Effects of changed climate on both crop productivity and crop quality were represented, as well as impacts of predicted extreme events, simulated through a long heat-wave.

40|$|The {{validity}} of nematode data from field experiments {{depends largely on}} how well samples represent the nematode population. Data from an intensive sampling of three field plots before and after <b>spring</b> <b>cultivation</b> were used to compare eight simulated sampling schemes. Average deviation from the plot mean ranged from 10 % to 34 % before cultivation and from 7 % to 16 % after cultivation.

To investigate this question, X-ray tomography was used to measure soil pore space architecture at an image resolution of 65 μm for 64 samples taken in two consecutive years in the harrowed and ploughed layers of a silt loam soil a few weeks after <b>spring</b> <b>cultivation.</b> The results showed that the pore networks displayed key features predicted by classical percolation theory: a strong relationship was found between the percolating fraction and the imaged porosity, with a percolation threshold of ca. 0. 04 to 0. 06 m 3 m− 3 in the harrowed layer. A percolation threshold was less clearly identifiable in topsoil that had not been recently tilled, although this may probably be attributed to finite size sampling effects in this layer, which showed a more heterogeneous and structured distribution of the pore space. Although further work on more strongly structured soil horizons, especially subsoils, would be desirable, it is tentatively suggested that percolation concepts could prove useful to estimate the conducting macroporosity in management models of preferential flow and transport...|$|E

It was demonstrated that the possibilities of cost reduction apply mostly to tractor and machine expenditures. As far as energy consumption is concerned, in spring barley production, costs of fertilizers had the highest share (on average 50. 1 %), followed by diesel fuel (23. 9 %), whereas energy expenditure for plant protection made up a small part of energy purchase (0. 6 %).

40|$|Shallow {{cultivation}} to a {{depth of}} 5 - 7 cm has in the last years become a realistic alternative to common ploughless tillage (cultivation depth 1 0 - 15 cm), especially in Great Britain, France and Germany. Shallow cultivation means avoiding unnecessary soil loosening, preserving the soils natural structure, increasing activity in the top layer and decreasing fuel consumption with less power requirement. Two years ago VäderstadVerken AB developed a tillage tool for shallow cultivation called Rexius Carrier with System Disc. The tool consists of a heavy roller and a front tool called Systern Disc. The front tool includes two rows of concave, close mounted discs, which combined with a trave 1 ing speed of 10 - 14 km/h leaves a well leveled, 100 % work through, top layer. The aim of this thesis was to test shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier under Swedish conditions, as autumn cultivation and as <b>spring</b> <b>cultivation</b> after a catch crop. This thesis includes the results of three different series of field experiments. The first, "Minimized autumn tillage to a spring crop", R 2 - 4122, was started in the autumn 2000. The result of the trial showed the highest yield for mouldboard ploughing and the lowest for the shallow cultivation, with deeper ploughless tillage in between. The second series, "Spring seeding without autumn tillage, including a catch crop", R 2 - 4123, was started in the spring of 2001. The series contained three experiments on sites with different clay contents, and compared autumn and spring ploughing with ploughless tillage to different depths and with different tillage intensities. The shallow cultivation performed well in this comparison. Despite a less suitable seedbed, plant establishment and crop yield in the shallow cultivated plots was nearly as high as for autumn ploughing. The weed population was greatly reduced in the shallow cultivated plots. The spring ploughed plots had less sui 1 able seedbed properties, poorer germination, more weed and lower crop yield than autumn ploughed plots. The third series, "Shallow cultivation to winter seed", started in the autumn of 200 1. In this series conventional mouldboard ploughing was compared with shallow cultivation with Rexius Carrier, chisel ploughing with and without roller and heavy disc harrow with and without roller. Before the second cultivation the germination of weeds and volunteers was counted, without any differences between different treatments. Before the seeding, the amount of straw and stubble on the surface was compared using digital image analysis. No differences between the treatments were found. After the seeding, the seedbed properties and the plant establishment was determined. Due to the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn, which had an equalizing effect on the analyzed parameters, {{no significant differences between the}} treatments were found. The trials has shown that only shallow cultivation before seeding can give good opportunities for the following crop. The trial R 2 - 4123 showed that shallow <b>spring</b> <b>cultivation</b> after a catch crop can maintain harvest yield compared to conventional mouldboard ploughing. Shallow autumn cultivation has a future as an alternative to conventional methods. The plant establishment were quite comparable despite the large amount of rain that fell in the autumn...|$|E

Three spring cultivars of safflower, including a local variety (Isfahan) with two foreign cultivars (Gilla and CU 1) were sown at 4 and 19 Apr. and 4 May. Results showed except height of first branch, other morphological characteristics were affected by planting dates. The node number, height of first branch, and length of internodes varied considerably between cultivars, with a constant response of cultivars in different planting dates. The total and fertile capitula were not differing between cultivars, but Isfahan had the most kernels per capitulum with the lowest kernel weight and CU 1 showed just the reverse response. Earlier planting date lead to more produced and fertile capitula, and formation of more kernels in secondary capitula, with the highest produced and fertile capitula for Gilla, the highest total kernel per capitula for Isfahan, and the highest kernel weight for CU 1, especially in the first planting date. The stem height and diameter and branches numbers showed high correlation with seed yield; however, number of primary capitula showed the highest correlation with yield and was accounted for 90 percent of yield variation. According to these results, planting Isfahan variety at the first possible time, due to its nativeness and high adaptation to this arid climatic zone, {{provide an opportunity for}} producing higher yields in comparison with foreign cultivars.

Agricultural land is {{regarded}} as the most significant contributor to the loads, and measures to reduce losses of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loads have been proposed, both for the near and far future. Agricultural production was to a large extent considered in these scenarios, whereas effects on other ecosystem services were not evaluated. The question to be answered by this report is whether the measures adopted to reduce N and P losses improve or impair multiple benefits of agriculture. The question is answered for a specific catchment (Svärtaån) located in Sweden, but the method is thoroughly described to provide a potential method to also evaluate other catchments. This work was performed {{as a part of the}} Baltic Compass project (2013). The answer to the main question of whether the measures adopted to reduce N and P losses from agricultural fields improved or impaired multiple benefits of agriculture, seems to be that they improved. Most of the BAP measures had a positive influence on most of the MB-categories, the clearest exception being liming in tile drains which only improved the cost effectiveness. Except for water protection, the biosecurity MB-category was positively influenced by the most measures (6 out of 9) and with soil quality the next highest (5 out of 9). It is less clear how the absolute values evaluated for the MB index, can be compared among MB-categories. Among the BAP-measures, structural liming was the most positive measure (summing up the indices of all MB-categories), followed by buffer-zones and <b>spring</b> <b>cultivation</b> the next, although the cost effectiveness of these latter measures was evaluated to decrease.

The experiment was performed in a greenhouse during two growing seasons (spring and summer), adopting two plant densities (370 and 640 plants m- 2 for radish, 1800 and 2400 plants m- 2 for lamb's lettuce) and four nutrient solutions (differing in salinity by addition of 0, 10, 20 and 30 mmol L- 1 of NaCl). For radish, the increase of plant density decreased marketable product. The total biomass and yield were negatively affected by the increase of salinity but average hypocotyl length and diameter were not. Furthermore, almost all the parameters showed higher values in <b>spring</b> <b>cultivation.</b> The growing season interacted mainly with plant density: while in spring the plant density did not affect the fresh weight, in summer this parameter was lower at the higher density. On the contrary, marketable yield was similar in spring while it was reduced at the higher density in summer. Yield of lamb's lettuce increased along with density while it was negatively affected by salinity. Quality traits such as chlorophyll content, leaf length and dry matter were improved at low density and higher salinity. In spring yield was higher than in summer but quality was poorer. The salinity plant density interacted with plant density and growing cycle on affecting leaf length with higher extent at D 2 and in summer. Floating is a suitable cropping system for both lamb's lettuce and radish even if strong seasonal changes might occur in yield and quality of production...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris sp. vulgaris) crops {{account for}} about 30 % of world sugar. Sugar yield is {{compromised}} by reproductive growth hence crops must remain vegetative until harvest. Prolonged exposure to cold temperature (vernalization) in the range 6 °C to 12 °C induces reproductive growth, leading to bolting (rapid elongation of the main stem) and flowering. <b>Spring</b> <b>cultivation</b> of crops in cool temperate climates makes them vulnerable to vernalization and hence bolting, which is initiated in the apical shoot meristem in processes involving interaction between gibberellin (GA) hormones and vernalization. The underlying mechanisms are unknown and genome scale next generation sequencing approaches now offer comprehensive strategies to investigate them; enabling the identification of novel targets for bolting control in sugar beet crops. In this study, we demonstrate the application of an mRNA-Seq based strategy for this purpose. Results There is no sugar beet reference genome, or public expression array platforms. We therefore used RNA-Seq to generate the first reference transcriptome. We next performed digital gene expression profiling using shoot apex mRNA from two sugar beet cultivars with and without applied GA, and also a vernalized cultivar with and without applied GA. Subsequent bioinformatics analyses identified transcriptional changes associated with genotypic difference and experimental treatments. Analysis of expression profiles in response to vernalization and GA treatment suggested previously unsuspected roles for a RAV 1 -like AP 2 /B 3 domain protein in vernalization and efflux transporters in the GA response. Conclusions Next generation RNA-Seq enabled the generation of the first reference transcriptome for sugar beet {{and the study of}} global transcriptional responses in the shoot apex to vernalization and GA treatment, without the need for a reference genome or established array platforms. Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis identified transcriptional programmes associated with different sugar beet genotypes as well as biological treatments; thus providing important new opportunities for basic scientists and sugar beet breeders. Transcriptome-scale identification of agronomically important traits as used in this study should be widely applicable to all crop plants where genomic resources are limiting. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Introducing potato cultivars {{with high}} yield, early {{maturing}} and desirable quality {{have a key}} role in food security, decreasing the fluctuation of the price and the store costs and also providing fresh crops throughout the year. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plant is one of leading agricultural products in the world with 365 million ton glands in year stands in fourth place after wheat, rice and corn. The main objective of the breeding program is yield. Increase in plant yield in the past due to the gradual elimination of defects visible by experts and today the new criteria for selection are based on principles of morphological and functional characteristics associated with the plant. Variety is one of the effective factors on plant growth and development on potato that yields components of potato is heavily dependent on it. Yield increasing in each variety affect the genetic and natural structure of variety. Nine clones of Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Kennebec from sources in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, and the commercially grown clone, clone 1, which was imported from Vancouver, were multiplied from pathogen-tested seed and compared in 3 Victorian potato districts during 2 seasons. The results showed that differences exist in total and size grade yield and tuber number and appearance between clones of a cultivar. They further highlight the importance of selection work to maintain desirable characteristics of established cultivars and to remove mutants with undesirable characteristics. The results of the study, Hassanpanah and Hassanabadi (2012) showed that the clones 397003 - 7, 396151 - 27, 397045 - 100 and Savalan (check) produced higher total and marketable tuber yield, tuber number and weight per plant, plant height, main stem number per plant, tuber size average and stable tuber yield. These clones produced high and mid-uniform tuber, tuber inner crack and tuber inner ring, mid-late maturity and mid and high dry in comparison to those of check. Based on results of this experiment, the clones 397003 - 7, 396151 - 27 and 397045 - 100 could be selected for Ardebil region. The objective of this research was to evaluate the quantitative and qualitative traits of cultivars and advanced potato clones in <b>spring</b> <b>cultivation</b> (Jolge-e-Rokh region). Materials and Methods In this research, 18 potato clones for the quantitative and qualitative traits were compared with three check cultivars including: Agria (suitable for French-fries), Marfona (suitable for boiled eating) and Lady Rosetta (suitable for chips) in Jolge-Rokh Agriculture Research Station, the location 35 '¸ 50 ° north latitude and 59 ° east longitude and 1721 m above sea level, in crop year 2011. Experimental design was Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. Treatment consisted of 18 advanced potato clones: 396151 - 8, 397045 - 4, 397045 - 10, TP 12 - 13, TP 21 - 29, TP 12 - 8, 397007 - 16, 397007 - 17, 396140 - 6, 397009 - 8, 397015 - 14, 397003 - 7, 396151 - 27, 397045 - 100, 397097 - 9, 396151 - 20, 397045 - 7 and 69 indigenous with three control cultivars (Agria, Marfona and Lady Rosetta). Tubers were planted on two rows with 6 meters length. Distance between row and plants on the row were 75 and 25 cm, respectively. Area of each plot was 9 square meter. The evaluated characters were total yield, marketable yield, eye number, dry matter percentage, tuber number per plant, tuber weight per plant and mean of tuber weight. In order to measure total yield, after maturity, and remove the aerial organs, all of the tubers were harvested and the fresh weight was obtained. After removal of the tumor in bad shape, with soft rot and smaller than 30 mm that cannot be sold as part of the marketable yield, rest of them were used to measure marketable yield. Tuber dry matter percentage (TDM...|$|E
40|$|Temporal {{prediction}} of soil moisture and evapotranspiration has {{a crucial role}} in agricultural and environmental management. A lack of Irish models for predicting evapotranspiration and soil moisture conditions for arable soils still represents a knowledge gap in this particular area of Irish agro-climatic modelling. The soil moisture deficit (SMD) crop model presented in this paper is based on the SMD hybrid model for Irish grassland (Schulte et al., 2005). Crop and site specific components (free-draining soil) have been integrated in the new model, which was calibrated and tested using soil tension measurements from two experimental sites located on a well-drained soil under <b>spring</b> barley <b>cultivation</b> in south-eastern Ireland. Calibration of the model gave an R 2 of 0. 71 for the relationship between predicted SMD and measured soil tension, while model testing yielded R 2 values of 0. 67 and 0. 65 (two sites). The crop model presented here is designed to predict soil moisture conditions and effective drainage (i. e., leaching events). The model provided reasonable predictions of soil moisture conditions and effective drainage within its boundaries, i. e., free-draining land used for spring cereal production under Irish conditions. In general, the model is simple and practical due to the small number of required input parameters, and due to model outputs that have good practical applicability, such as for computing the cumulative amount of watersoluble nutrients leached from arable land under spring cereals in free-draining soils. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{trial was}} {{conducted}} on an organic dairy farm in Manawatu, New Zealand, to determine how well perennial weeds are controlled during pasture renewal. Changes in weed populations were monitored following three different non-chemical methods of regrassing. Regrassing by planting pasture 4 weeks after ploughing the old pasture (“grass-to-grass”) was compared for <b>spring</b> and autumn <b>cultivation.</b> The third method involved ploughing in spring, growing turnips over summer then regrassing in autumn. All three techniques caused signiicant increases in broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius) and creeping buttercup (Ranunculus repens) populations. Although both these species regrew from vegetative organs, it was the establishment of new seedlings following cultivation that appeared to increase populations most. This build-up of dock seedlings occurred more when using a crop than just grass-to-grass systems. A 2 -week fallow after ploughing gave better control of perennial weeds than having no fallow, but a 4 -week fallow gave little further improvement...|$|R
40|$|Seeds of 5 Swiss chard cultivars were sown on 20 April or 15 July, {{and single}} harvest of leaf rosettes was {{conducted}} on early July or half of October, respectively. Results of the study indicate the possibility of growing the Swiss chard both in spring and autumn term, but yield of leaves obtained in the spring was double as high as in the autumn cultivation. Among tested cultivars Green White Ribbed and Bresanne provided the highest, while Vulcan the lowest yield in spring growing. However, the choice of cultivar had not a significant meaning in autumn season <b>cultivation.</b> <b>Spring</b> season culture caused a significant reduction of nitrates accumulation and was preferable for the content of P, while autumn term for dry matter, K and Ca in both parts of leaves, vitamin C in leaf blades, and Mg in petioles. Irrespective of the term of growing and cultivar, leaf blades contained higher level of dry matter and Mg, while leaf petioles - nitrates, potassium and calcium. </p...|$|R
