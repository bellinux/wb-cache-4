50|$|A more <b>specialised</b> <b>operation</b> {{is based}} on an {{industrial}} estate in Liezen, 120 kilometres northwest of Graz amid the mountains of Northern Styria. This industrial town of 7,000 was once the home of state-owned engineering firm VÖEST Alpine. The works closed down in the 1990s with the loss of over a thousand skilled craft jobs. GBL (Gemeinnützige Beschäftigungsgesellschaft Liezen) http://www.gbl.at has created products that make good use both of these specialist skills and of traditional local materials. The most original line produced is water wheels. The workshop helped renovate three old watermills and the idea grew from there. The normal size is one-and-a-half metres across, but they make them as big as three metres. And they are all made from local larch wood. The company has found a niche market at the intersection of tourism, the environment and science education, and also fabricates items such as Archimedes' screws, which make popular hands-on exhibits at a local water theme park.|$|R

50|$|On October 2001 the Jianshe Industries (Group) Corporation (owned by the China South Industries Group) won a bid {{to produce}} the PLA's next {{generation}} of submachine gun to replace the Type 79 and the Type 85 silenced submachine guns, beating out other competitors such as the Changfeng CF-05 due to its ease of construction and operation. At the 2005 International Police Equipment Expo in Beijing, Jianshe revealed their final product, a bullpup, blowback, open bolt submachine gun that externally resembled the QBZ-95 assault rifle which was then given the designation QCW-05. At the 2006 MILIPOL Expo, a smaller police and export version of the QCW-05 called the 'Jianshe JS 9mm', a silenced submachine gun, was revealed to the public. The 'JS 9mm' is chambered for the popular 9×19mm Parabellum calibre. The QCW-05 {{is intended to be}} PLA's frontline personal defence weapon for personnel in non-combat roles such as vehicle crews and aircrews who would normally be confined to quarters where a full assault rifle would be unwieldy and by <b>specialised</b> <b>operation</b> units such as the People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces and People's Armed Police.|$|R

40|$|Hard metals can {{be defined}} as {{composites}} containing extremely hard ceramic particles in a softer metal matrix. They are characterised by their extreme hardness and brittleness. Given the strength of these materials, their working presents a considerable challenge for which mechanical methods are often insufficient. The cause of this lies in the very high cost of machining tools and the long machining times involved which make such operations on economic. Electrochemical machining(ECM) offers the potential for high precision micromachining. Among its advantages are its ability to shape materials without imposing thermal or mechanical stress. The anodic dissolution of the workpiece depends solely on its electrochemical properties. Mechanical properties such as hardness or ductility have no effect. This makes ECM an attractive alternative machining process for materials difficult to work by mechanical means. In the present study, a <b>specialised</b> <b>operation</b> for micro-patterning of metal carbides was studied in which an electrolyte jet was used in a closed circuit electrolyte loop(Jet-ECM). A special feature of this technology is that the current is restricted to the zone on which the jet impinges. This ensures a very localised removal of material. Even complex structures can be machined in this way using continuous DC current and so high rates of metal removal can be achieved in comparison to processes using pulsed current. In this work, metal was selectively removed from the surface of tungsten carbide to form point or line microstructures. In the former case, there was no movement of the jet nozzle. In the latter case, linear or multiaxial tool movement was used. Beyond this, by creating overlapping lines, a three-dimensional pattern could be formed on the test material...|$|R
