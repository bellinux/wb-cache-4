Overall reaction {{to the implementation of}} Common Core has been mixed, with some criticism by Democratic-leaning groups (e.g. that Common Core does not mandate any computer literacy skillset) and differing criticism by Republican-leaning groups (e.g. that Common Core is effectively federalising control of curriculum standards), along with many positive reactions from both types of groups.|$|R
5000|$|Proponents of the system, {{guided by}} a {{conception}} very like the standard one-dimensional incentive model, argue that these incentives will lead teachers to work harder at teaching and to take greater interest in their students' success. Opponents counter that the principal effect of the proposed reform would be that teachers would sacrifice such activities as promoting curiosity and creative thinking and refining students' oral and written communication skills in order to teach the narrowly defined basic skills that are tested on <b>standardised</b> <b>exams.</b> It would be better, these critics argue, to pay a fixed what without any incentive scheme than to base teachers' compensation only on the limited dimensions of student achievement that can be effectively measured.

40|$|IntroductionIn resource-rich settings, bedside {{ultrasound}} has rapidly {{evolved to}} be {{a crucial part}} of emergency centre practice and a growing part of critical care practice. This portable and affordable technology may be even more valuable in resource-limited environments where other imaging modalities are inaccessible, but the optimal amount of training required to achieve competency in bedside ultrasound is largely unknown. We sought to evaluate the feasibility of implementation of a mixed-modality bedside ultrasound training course for emergency and generalist acute care physicians in limited resource settings, and to provide a description of our core course components, including specific performance goals, to facilitate implementation of similar initiatives. MethodsWe conducted a standardised training course at two distinct sites—one large, urban tertiary hospital in Tanzania with a dedicated Emergency Centre, and one small, rural, hospital in southern Mexico with a general, acute intake area. We report on pre-training ultrasound use at both sites, as well as pre- and post-training views on most useful indications. ResultsOverall, participants were very satisfied with the course, although approximately one-third of the providers at both sites would have preferred more hands-on training. All participants passed a <b>standardised</b> <b>exam</b> requiring image acquisition and interpretation. DiscussionIntroducing bedside ultrasound training in two distinct resource-limited settings was feasible and well-received. After a brief intensive period of training, participants successfully passed a comprehensive examination, including demonstration of standardised image acquisition and accurate interpretation of normal and abnormal studies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a novel approach}} for the automatic assessment of children's responses to <b>standardised</b> English <b>exam</b> questions. The constrained nature of the question and answer medium is exploited to produce an automatic assessment mechanism that is both highly accurate and produces a reasonable level of response yield. It is shown that the novel approach can achieve 100 % scoring accuracy on 44 % of all responses compared to a traditional lexical approach that has an error rate of 41 %. When a thresholding method, {{similar to that used}} in the novel approach is applied, the traditional approach can achieve an accuracy of 100 % but with a response yield of only 5 %. The approach introduced in this paper is thus shown to have a significant advantage over the traditional lexical based assessmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{academic}} added-value can {{be associated with}} a variation in the cognitive development of students who complete an educational cycle at a given institution belonging to a reference universe, related to the tendency shown by all students in the aforementioned universe. Certain knowledge {{at the beginning and end}} of the cycle must be evaluated to estimate such variation. The pertinent literature states that learning is the result of students, teachers, and classmates’ intellectual capacity, mainly within the family and an institution.

40|$|The article {{warns against}} the {{negative}} impacts of external assessment. These impacts are already noticeable in Slovenia, specifically and {{mainly in the}} teaching approach and learning efforts used for taking the <b>standardised</b> Matura <b>exams.</b> There is a narrowing of overall learning goals and a neglecting of the areas that, although vital for students’ development, are not assessed in the exams themselves, as well, there are increased stress levels {{before and during the}} exams, which could result in a poorer performance. The article then proposes a portfolio approach in which students set their own learning goals, pursue them, reflect both on their achievements and alternative ways to make better progress. The portfolio approach lends itself extremely well to developing a student’s writing skills gradually, as the awareness of learning goals and the setting of one’s own, in combination with self-assessment and reflection are better motivators than just following preset objectives...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of <b>standardised</b> final <b>exams</b> (in Germany called 2 ̆ 2 Zentralabitur 2 ̆ 2) in eight federal states of Germany, {{in answer to}} the PISA studies published in 2001, has {{a significant impact on}} the teaching. This is true also for the musical education. Teachers have to adjust their lessons to the regulations in order to prepare the students in an optimal way for the final examination. The herewith presented work is concered with research studies based on the Grounded Theory Methodology in order to analyse the impact of the 2 ̆ 2 Zentralabitur 2 ̆ 2 on the personal concepts and strategies of music teachers in Niedersachsen. The investigations were motivated by the following questions: Does the Zentralabitur influence the teachers individual mindsets, preparations and lessons? In which areas and to what extent do teachers perceive changes? How do they actually deal with the changed circumstances? Personal concepts were emerged in order to reveal the influence of the Zentralabitur. Based on an empirically grounded construction of types and a typology the different coping strategies are compared. Finally possible enhancements of the Zentralabitur are proposed and suggestions for the education and preperation of teachers dealing with centralized school systems are summerised...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of the growing trend of Chinese {{students}} wanting to study abroad, IELTS (International English Language Testing System) exam {{has become one of the}} most popular <b>standardised</b> language <b>exams</b> with thousands of Chinese students preparing for IELTS listening, reading, writing, and speaking tests every year. This qualitative classroom inquiry evaluates the effectiveness of an online IELTS listening course and explores how the instruction of L 2 (second language) listening strategies proposed by Vandergrift (1997, 1999) facilitated students’ listening performance. It also examines the impact of online classroom community on students’ online learning experience and how online interaction helps the development of students’ sense of community. A total of seven adult students of English as a second language were enrolled in a four-week online IELTS listening course which was taught completely on the Internet through Sina Weibo and Wechat. During the course, online interaction between students and the teacher was observed and analysed. These participants finished a reflective pre-test and post-test so that their listening performance before and after the course could be examined. Pre-course and post-course interviews were also designed to collect students’ perceptions of the course effectiveness and online interaction. The results of the study suggest that lower-level English learners rely more on cognitive strategies during listening comprehension, and advanced learners make use of both metacognitive and cognitive strategies to facilitate their listening. Besides, lower-level learners are also capable of acquiring metacognitive strategies in a short period of time whereas their metastrategic awareness might not be fully developed. It has also been found that strong sense of community has a great impact on students’ online learning experience. Students with stronger sense of community feel less isolated and learn better than those without a community spirit because they are less likely to drop out and have more opportunities to access help from the other community members. For an online community to flourish, both close relationships among group members and academic achievements are needed and equally important. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} educational impact of the University of Geneva Faculty of Medicine (UGFM) emergency medicine clerkship training with that provided by the Swiss Army medical officer cadets school (ARMY). The assessment was designed to assess students' clinical knowledge and competency in major emergency situations, ACLS (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) and ATLS (Advanced Traumatic Life Support). METHODS: Prospectively, 56 UGFM students were compared with 52 ARMY officer cadets by a multiformat pre- and post-training examination. The exam consisted of a multiple-choice questionnaire (MCQ), a <b>standardised</b> vignette-based oral <b>exam</b> (SOE) and a standardised practical cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) exercise. RESULTS: Overall, on the pre- and post-training testing, total scores improved significantly for the UGFM by 10 % (from 63 to 73 %) and for the ARMY by 9 % (from 60 to 69 %). Knowledge assessed on the MCQ improved for the UGFM by 8 % (64 to 72 %) but not significantly for the ARMY. Performance on the SOE improved by 10 % for UGFM (54 to 64 %) and the ARMY (47 to 57 %) as well as performance on the CPR, which improved by 15 % for UGFM (72 to 87 %) and 19 % for the ARMY (67 to 86 %). Post-training performance indicated that, respectively, UGFM {{scored significantly higher than}} the ARMY on the MCQ (72 and 68 %) and the SOE (64 and 57 %) but not on the CPR. Internal reliability indexes for the MCQ, SOE and CPR were respectively 0. 72, 0. 86 and 0. 92. Correlations between the MCQ, SOE and CPR varied between 0. 07 to 0. 19. CONCLUSIONS: In general, the multimethod assessment seemed to provide a complementary approach to evaluation of the trainees' competency in emergency training. Except for the ARMY MCQ performance, both training programmes seemed to be effective in improving trainees' overall knowledge and clinical performance. The trainees' performances are reviewed and discussed in terms of the specific skills assessed on the SOE, the context of the trainees' expected level of performance, the teaching and evaluation approaches, and implications in establishing the equivalence of the two programmes...|$|R
