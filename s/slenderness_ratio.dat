[...] Fitzgeralds long-ship design was developed without the benefit of research, development, test, and evaluation principles while computerized analytical technology was not available at the time she was built. Ramsey noted that Fitzgeralds hull was built with an all-welded (instead of riveted) modular fabrication method, which was used for the first time in the GLEW shipyard. Ramsey concluded that increasing the hull length to [...] resulted in a L/D <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio</b> (the ratio of the length of the ship to the depth of her structure) that caused excessive multi-axial bending and springing of the hull, and that the hull should have been structurally reinforced to cope with her increased length.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{structural}} columns {{are commonly}} of intermediate length, the Euler formula has little practical application for ordinary design. Issues that cause {{deviation from the}} pure Euler column behaviour include imperfections in geometry of the column in combination with plasticity/non-linear stress strain behaviour of the column's material. Consequently, a number of empirical column formulae have been developed that agree with test data, all of which embody the <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratio.</b> Due to the uncertainty {{in the behavior of}} columns, for design, appropriate safety factors are introduced into these formulae. One such formula is the Perry Robertson formula which estimates the critical buckling load based on an assumed small initial curvature, hence an eccentricity of the axial load. The Rankine Gordon formula (Named for William John Macquorn Rankine and Perry Hugesworth Gordon (1899 [...] 1966)) is also based on experimental results and suggests that a column will buckle at a load Fmax given by: ...|$|E

The other parts of the investigation were concerned with creep properties of these alloys in tension and in compression. The former is described by R. J. Kauffman; the latter by R. C. Thatcher (Refs. 11 and 12). Creep characteristics of 75 S-T 6 aluminum alloy columns having various effective <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> were investigated at 450 °F and 550 °F. Of primary interest was the region of applied stresses near the maximum stresses which these columns would sustain. Lateral creep deflection of the column midpoint was measured. Coincident with this measurement, time to failure of the column was also measured. Columns tested at 550 °F had rectangular cross sections and had effective <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> of 25. 5, 39. 9, 48. 6 and 57. 2. Columns tested at 450 °F. had rectangular cross sections and had effective <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> of 25. 5, 48. 6 and 57. 2. Testing equipment was designed and constructed for the investigation. A constant load was applied to the specimen by means of a lever arm having a ten to one mechanical advantage. The specimen was heated in an electric oven. The oven was maintained at temperature by automatic electrical control. It was found that 75 S-T 6 aluminum alloy columns having effective <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> of 25. 5 to 57. 2 are suitable for short time (0 - 10 min.) use at 450 °F and 550 °F...|$|R

Reducing the web-flange <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> {{is the most}} effective way in preventing local member buckling as stipulated in the latest earthquake specifications. However, older steel beam-column connections that lack the adequate <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> stipulated for new SMFs are vulnerable to local plastic buckling. This study investigates postponing the formation of local buckles in beam flanges and webs at the plastic hinge region of modified SMF connections (welded haunch) by the use of externally bonded Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (GFRP). The research includes finite element (FE) modeling. The energy dissipation capacity of existing SMF connections is anticipated to increase with GFRP laminates bonded to flanges of beams in plastic hinge locations. Cantilever beams with and without GFRP were analyzed under quasi-static cyclic loading and the effects to the plastic local buckling of the GFRP laminates added to the steel beams were observed. Both geometric and material nonlinearities are considered. The mechanical properties of the GFRP material were obtained through standard ASTM tests and were utilized directly in the FE model. Steel beams with flange <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> of 8 to 12 and web <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> of 40 - 60 - 80 were analyzed.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to build upon {{previous}} post buckling research by including the effects of material degradation on column strength due to temperature increase. Failure of a structure during a fire occurs in most part because of material degradation. As the temperature increases the stiffness and strength of a structural material decreases and ultimately results in failure. 	In this study, columns with three different types of end restraints were studied. These are: Pinned-Pinned Columns, Pinned-Fixed Columns, Fixed-Fixed Columns. For each end-restraint type three different <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> were considered: λ= 50, λ= 125, and λ= 200. After the data was reviewed, some conclusions that can be made are 	Axially restricted columns with lower <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> are more affected by material degradation. This is because columns with lower <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> have a higher Tcr allowing the effects of material degradation to begin affecting the columns strength at much lower T/Tcr ratios, in some cases before the ratio even reaches 1. Axially restricted columns with a higher number of rotational end-restraints are more affected by material degradation. This can also be attributed to a higher Tcr that allows the effects of material degradation to begin affecting the columns strength at much lower T/Tcr ratios...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResults of a {{parametric}} {{investigation on}} {{the failure of}} metallic strut lattices subjected to multi-axial loads are presented. The study involves two microscopic parameters related to the geometry of struts: strut-level strengthening and <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios.</b> The strengthening procedure is designed such that minimum-strengthening represents the octetruss while maximum-strengthening represents the three-dimensional Warren truss. This way, the effects of both strut-level stretching and bending on the deformation responses together with coupled failure due to plastic yield and elastic buckling can be studied. The evaluated theoretical failure envelopes that include microscopic global and localized failure compare well with the numerical failure data obtained from finite element analysis. Among results, while the strengthening and <b>slenderness</b> <b>ratios</b> expectedly influence the sizes and shapes of the failure surfaces, they also dramatically alter microscopic deformation mechanisms leading to macroscopic failure...|$|R
