5|$|Believed to {{have been}} {{introduced}} by Al-Husayn II ibn Mahmud, although some sources, such as Abdel-Wahab, claim {{that it was in}} use three centuries earlier, the flag was rectangular in shape and divided into nine stripes, the middle one green and double the size of all other bands, while the others alternated between yellow and red. Featured {{in the center of the}} green <b>stripe</b> was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each <b>stripe.</b> These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star voided with a disk of a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk voided in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger red disk. The first yellow <b>stripe</b> contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second <b>stripe,</b> red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third <b>stripe</b> (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth <b>stripe</b> (second white one) is identical to the second <b>stripe.</b>|$|E

5|$|In Polish heraldry, the {{tincture}} of {{the charge}} has priority {{in relation to the}} tincture of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white <b>stripe</b> is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white <b>stripe</b> should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white <b>stripe</b> should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white <b>stripe</b> should be placed over the heart.|$|E

The flag is a rectangular cloth consisting of two horizontal stripes: a red upper <b>stripe</b> covering two-thirds of the flag's height, and green lower <b>stripe</b> covering one-third. A vertical red-on-white Belarusian decorative pattern, which occupies one-ninth of the flag's length, is placed against the flagstaff. The flag's ratio of width to length is 1:2.|$|E

5|$|White-and-red flags {{were first}} waved during a {{patriotic}} demonstration on May 3, 1916 in Warsaw. The organizing committee advised participants about the correct {{alignment of the}} colors, that is with the white <b>stripe</b> above the red one. Still, many demonstrators brought flags with the red <b>stripe</b> on top. On August 1, 1919, almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918, the Sejm officially introduced a white-and-red bicolor as the Polish national flag. In order to avoid confusion with the white-and-red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and tugboats, the same act of Sejm introduced {{a variant of the}} flag with the coat of arms in the white <b>stripe</b> for use as a civil ensign and by Polish diplomats and consuls abroad.|$|E

5|$|A creamy-white or {{pale yellow}} <b>stripe,</b> bordered above with gold and below with black, extends {{from behind the}} eye, across the {{typically}} copper-coloured tympanum to the groin. This <b>stripe</b> rises to form a dorsolateral fold towards the groin. Another <b>stripe</b> of the same colour begins below the eye and continues to the shoulder. The abdomen is cream or white, and has a coarsely granular texture. The legs are green, bronze, {{or a combination of}} both, and the inside thigh and groin are blue-green. Mature males develop a yellowish colouration to the vocal sacs on their throats. The tympanum is distinct and ovular in shape, and the species has enlarged toe discs to aid in climbing. As this species is often found in water, the fingers are free from webbing, while the toes are almost completely webbed. When in breeding condition, males develop nuptial pads on their thumbs, which are used to grip females during mating. These are coloured brown during the breeding season, but are inconspicuous and paler {{during the rest of the}} year. During the breeding season, females develop a blueish hue on their feet, while males' legs turn rusty orange.|$|E

5|$|Distinct {{signs of}} sexual {{dimorphism}} {{are seen in}} the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker {{after the age of}} two years.

One long white <b>stripe</b> runs along the back, with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black <b>stripe,</b> and there is no throat beard. A black <b>stripe</b> runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear {{on each side of the}} lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears.
