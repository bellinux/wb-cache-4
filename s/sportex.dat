40|$|Title: Customer {{satisfaction}} with {{the service of the}} store <b>Sportex.</b> cz Leader: Mgr. Jan Šíma Objectives: The aim of this work is to use the survey to find out the customer {{satisfaction with}} the service of the sports store <b>Sportex.</b> cz. Furthermore, {{based on the results of}} questionnaires, to propose new solutions and the arrangement for the existing sports shop <b>Sportex.</b> cz. If the customers are satisfied with the purchase, they will visit this store for further purchases in the future again. Methods: Quantitative research using electronic and written questioning Results: Customers are most satisfied with the service and retail facilities. Assortment is considered to be above average. The weakest aspect appears to be the availability and location of the store. Based on the results, as the main pillar of changes, it was recommended extending the range of the new products, introduce light banner in front of the store, extend the opening hours, buy of the receipt printer and rethink the pricing policy.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the process of}} creating an internet shop <b>Sportex.</b> cz from its beginning. The aim is to describe and explain each step of this process. First, buying online e-shop solutions, then choosing a domain name and managing the business to create a successful online store. I have been in the internet busines for over three years and have extensive experience with running an e-shop, <b>Sportex.</b> cz, which serves as an example for describing all procedures. The process and the thesis are divided into three parts. Prezentation of company, description of individual procedures and their evaluation and final evaluation. The description of individual procedures explains my choice of the steps I selected. In the Final evaluation I describe and sum up the results of the individual steps.

Methods: In this thesis i will be concerning both examining the current situation of chosen store's marketing mix, and possible future improvements and proposing new concepts. I will use qualitative methods such as interviews, while quantitative methods such as questionnaire. Further on I will apply a SWOT analysis. Both internal and external information will serve me to do so. I will work with secondary dates. Results: Thanks to the used methods, I propose particular measures to improve {{the operation of the}} business on each marketing mix tools. As the main pillar of the product I suggest specialization only for ball sports and swimming and expand the range for women. As a next step, focus on events and quantity discounts. From advertising to maintain and support positions in search engines, along with the introduction of applications verified customers.

The thesis describes forms of internet marketing and is focused on backlinks analysis. The practical part is applied to competitive environment of shops with vol-leyball equipment. The main objective of thesis is analyze internet marketing e-shop <b>Sportex.</b> cz from perspective of competing subject, which has no information from inside of firm. The next objective is find out whether and why the e-shop is leader in selected segment {{of the market and}} what is the competitive advantage. The last objective is create the recommendation to potential subjects which want to break into a market and decide if {{it is a good idea}} or not. In the theoretical introduction is explained what internet marketing means and is compared with other types of marketing. In next step are the forms of internet marketing briefly de-scribed. At the beginning of the practical part is inserted a chapter about selection and defini-tion of the competitive environment and it is chosen e-shop for detailed analysis. The ending summarizes the results of analysis and evaluated if was achieved the objective of thesis. Contribution of this thesis it should be create a model solution how to analyze internet market-ing e-shop, especially backlinks and also evaluate the results of the analysis for a selected seg-ment of the market...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Spinal {{mobilisation}} {{is commonly}} used {{in the field of}} manual medicine to address lumbar joint dysfunction. In addition, lumbar mobilisation has been proposed as a method to improve lower limb neurodynamic mobility, however, there is no published research to support this hypothesis. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of a posterior-to-anterior lumbar mobilisation technique on straight leg raise (SLR) and passive knee extension (PKE). Methods: A randomised controlled experiment was conducted. Male participants (n= 23) were recruited and randomly allocated to receive a posterior-to-anterior L 4 /L 5 lumbar mobilisation or a sham technique. Additional male participants (n= 12) were recruited into a control group. The main outcome measures used to represent lower limb range of motion were SLR and PKE tests; neck flexion (NF) was used as a structural differentiation test to reduce neurodynamic mobility for each measure. Results: The experimental intervention demonstrated a ‘very large’ effect (d= 2. 14) on increased pre-post SLR measurements and a ‘large’ effect (d= 1. 6) on SLRNF when compared with the control group. The sham intervention was associated with similar improvements, demonstrating a ‘large‘ effect for both pre-post SLR (d= 1. 7) and SLRNF (d= 1. 3) ranges. Analysis between experimental, sham and control groups showed a significant increase for pre-post ranges of SLR (p< 0. 001) and SLRNF (p= 0. 003). Pre-post ranges of PKE were not affected by either intervention (p= 0. 36). Immediate improvements in range of SLR (p< 0. 01) and SLRNF (p< 0. 04) following the application of the lumbar mobilisation or sham technique were not evident after a 48 -hour follow-up period. The addition of neck flexion as a structural differentiation test demonstrated a ‘trivial’ effect on pre-post ranges of SLR versus SLRNF (d< 0. 16) for all intervention groups. Conclusion: A posterior-to-anterior lumbar mobilisation technique applied to the L 4 /L 5 vertebrae improved neurodynamic SLR and SLRNF mobility, with minimal effect on PKE measurements, however, the sham technique demonstrated similar results. A placebo effect is discussed to explain these comparative findings. These observed improvements are not attributable to the engagement of joint articulation applied at a putative neural convergence point in the lumbar spine. The application of the L 4 /L 5 PA lumbar mobilisation and sham technique increased lower limb neurodynamic mobility in asymptomatic male participants. NB.
