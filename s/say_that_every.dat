25|$|Another {{representation}} is obtained {{by noting that}} the image of any closure operator on a complete lattice is again a complete lattice (called its closure system). Since the identity function is a closure operator too, this shows that the complete lattices are exactly the images of closure operators on complete lattices. Now the Dedekind-MacNeille completion can also be cast into a closure operator: every set of elements is mapped to the least lower (or upper) Dedekind cut that contains this set. Such a least cut does indeed exist and one has a closure operator on the powerset lattice of all elements. In summary, one can <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> complete lattice is isomorphic to the image of a closure operator on a powerset lattice.|$|E

[...] When Maurice Leyland was preferred to Frank Woolley in the touring party to Australia in 1928-9, he fulminated against {{the selection of a}} [...] "cross-batted village-greener". When he scored 63* in the 1892 University Match, three of the best Cambridge batsmen were run out during his innings, including no less a figure than F.S. Jackson, his captain. When it appeared that one of them would have to go, Weigall is supposed to have sacrificed his partner by calling: [...] "Get back, Jacker. I'm set." [...] Swanton sums him up thus: [...] "... he may well sound a rather preposterous fellow...

2500|$|After sailing {{far enough}} for safety, Every gave the non-conspirators {{a chance to}} go ashore, even deferentially {{offering}} to let Captain Gibson command the ship if he would join their cause. According to Charles Ellms, Every's words to Gibson were, [...] "if you have a mind to make one of us, we will receive you; and if you turn sober, and attend to business, perhaps in time I may make you up of my lieutenants; if not, here's a boat, and you shall be set on shore." [...] The captain declined and was set ashore with several other sailors. The only man who was prevented from voluntarily leaving was the ship's surgeon, whose services were deemed too important to forgo. All of the men left on board the Charles II unanimously elected Every captain of the ship. Some reports <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>Every</b> was much ruder in his dealings with Captain Gibson, but agree that he at least offered him the position of second mate. In either case, Every exhibited an amount of gentility and generosity in his operation of the mutiny that indicates his motives were not mere adventure.|$|E

2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer {{told that}} Rabbi Eliezer heard God {{say the words}} of [...] "See, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil." [...] God said that God had given Israel these two ways, one good, the other evil. The good one is of life, the evil one of death. The good way has two byways, one of righteousness and the other of love, and Elijah stands exactly between the two. When a person comes to enter one of the ways, Elijah cries out {{in the words of}} [...] "Open the gates, that the righteous nation that keeps truth may enter in." [...] Samuel the prophet, placed between the two byways, asked on which of the two byways to go. If he went on the way of righteousness, then the path of love would be better; if he went on the way of love, the way of righteousness would be better. But Samuel said that he would not give up either of them. God told Samuel that because the prophet had placed himself between the two good byways, God would give him three good gifts. Thus {{everyone}} who does righteousness and shows the service of love inherits the three gifts of life, righteousness, and glory (as [...] promises). Leading to the way of evil are four doors, and at each door stand seven angels — four merciful angels outside, and three cruel angels inside. When a person comes to enter a door, the merciful angels urge the person not to enter but to repent. If the person heeds them and repents, it is well, but if not, they tell the person not to enter the next door. Even as the person is about to enter the fourth door, the merciful angels <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> day God calls on people to return.|$|E
