5|$|The A3 {{section of}} Zagreb bypass is {{currently}} the busiest section of the Croatian motorway network, with annual average daily traffic (AADT) volume exceeding 40,000vehicles, leading to congestion of the six-lane bypass at peak hours, especially during the summer, when tourist traffic adds to the congestion. The mainline toll plazas at Bobovica and Ivanja Reka can both become bottlenecks at <b>such</b> <b>times.</b> The alternative to the bypass is going through the city via Ljubljanska, Zagrebačka and Slavonska avenues. Despite being a shorter and a more direct route, those avenues are much more congested than the bypass at rush hours and they contain at-grade intersections and traffic lights at some of their junctions.|$|E

Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the {{beginning}} of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city he has lived in all his life where Clannad is set. He is very straightforward in his comments to others and will not hesitate to speak his mind, even if he comes off as rude during <b>such</b> <b>times.</b> Despite this, Tomoya is very loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Neptune has {{a profound effect}} on the Kuiper belt's structure due to orbital resonances. Over a timescale comparable to the age of the Solar System, Neptune's gravity destabilises the orbits of any objects that happen to lie in certain regions, and either sends them into the inner Solar System or out into the scattered disc or interstellar space. This causes the Kuiper belt to have pronounced gaps in its current layout, similar to the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. In the region between 40 and 42 AU, for instance, no objects can retain a stable orbit over <b>such</b> <b>times,</b> and any observed in that region must have migrated there relatively recently.|$|E

The bed was once the king's personal bed and was kept inside the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya; however once {{it was no longer}} used it was transferred to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. The bed {{is in the form of}} a high platform with many layers, and small steps leading to the top. When royal ceremonies are carried out within the throne hall, member of the royal family take their seat in the southern transept, while government officials sit to the north, Buddhist monks to the east; the funeral urn is to the west. During <b>such</b> <b>times</b> the throne and bed were used as altars for Buddha images.|$|E

25|$|However, outcrossing may be {{abandoned}} {{in favor of}} parthenogenesis or selfing (which retain the advantage of meiotic recombinational repair) under conditions in which the costs of mating are very high. For instance, costs of mating are high when individuals are rare in a geographic area, such as when {{there has been a}} forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones to arrive. At <b>such</b> <b>times</b> mates are hard to find, and this favors parthenogenic species.|$|E

It flies about either late or early in the morning in the shade of the jungles. It can be sometimes seen in bright sunlight visiting flowers, such as Glycosmis, Buddleia, Chromolaena and Lantana, but is very wary and energetic at <b>such</b> <b>times,</b> moving jerkily and rapidly between flowers or across inflorescences. It can also be seen mud-puddling or at bird droppings.|$|E

25|$|The framed tent (1965–1967). This is {{the largest}} and most {{colorful}} of the Westfalia side tents. It's different from the earlier small and large awning-based tents in two important ways: the addition of large, screened windows on the side curtains, and a free-standing frame that allows the tent to be left at the campsite while the bus is driven away for groceries or side trips. The tent also has a rear door that can be zipped closed at <b>such</b> <b>times.</b> Both front and rear flaps can be rolled up and held open by cloth ties or (on later models) straps with lift-the-dot fasteners.|$|E
25|$|In the Caucasus, jackals mainly hunt hares, small rodents, pheasants, partridges, ducks, coots, moorhens and passerines. They readily eat lizards, snakes, frogs, fish, {{molluscs}} and insects. During {{the winter}} period, they will kill many nutrias and waterfowl. During <b>such</b> <b>times,</b> jackals will surplus kill and cache {{what they do}} not eat. Jackals will feed on fruits such as pears, hawthorn, dogwood and the cones of Common Medlars. European jackals tend not to be as damaging to livestock as wolves and red foxes are, though they can become a serious nuisance to small sized stock when in high numbers. The highest number of livestock damages occurred in southern Bulgaria: 1,053 attacks on small stock, mainly sheep and lambs, were recorded between 1982–87, along with some damages to newborn deer in game farms.|$|E
25|$|The High Court sits {{on every}} day of the year except Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, {{although}} a Judge may lawfully sit on such days if directed to do so by the Chief Justice or if the Judge is of the opinion that the business to be despatched is extremely urgent. The High Court sits at <b>such</b> <b>times</b> and at such places as the Chief Justice appoints from time to time. When the Supreme Court moved from the Old Supreme Court Building and City Hall Building at 1 and 3 Saint Andrew's Road respectively to the present Supreme Court Building at 1 Supreme Court Lane, the Chief Justice formally appointed the new building as a place where the High Court sits by way of a notification dated 20 June 2005.|$|E

25|$|Traffic on the Trent and Mersey {{main line}} {{was such that}} it {{suffered}} from water shortage in dry periods, and water levels on the Caldon branch were often too low at <b>such</b> <b>times,</b> as the water was used to keep the main line moving. In 1796, the company {{wanted to build a}} reservoir at Rudyard, to improve the situation, and a branch to Leek was included in the Bill, as {{it was the only way}} to obtain the consent of the Leek authorities and landowners for the reservoir. The Bill was defeated in Parliament, after which the Peak Forest Canal Company proposed to build a branch of their canal from Marple to Leek, and on to join the Caldon branch. It would also have included a reservoir at Rudyard, but the plan was short-lived, as the Trent and Mersey succeeded in getting their bill passed when they submitted it to Parliament for a second time in 1797. To ensure that the water from Rudyard could be used to supply the main line, the Leek branch had to join the top level of the Caldon branch, and so the original route with the three Park Lane locks was closed and a new route built, with a three-lock staircase between the junction and the old line of the canal. This was altered again in 1841 to the present arrangement, where the canal to Froghall passes under an aqueduct on the Leek branch, and three separate locks at Hollinhurst raise the old line up to the summit level.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah treats {{also the}} laws of the shofar (iii.2); the horn of the cow may not be used (iii.2); the form of the trumpet for Rosh ha-Shanah, the fast-day, and Yovel is {{determined}} (iii.3-5); injuries to the shofar and the remedies are indicated (iii.6); in times of danger the people that pray assemble in pits and caves (iii.7); they pass the house of worship only on the outside while the trumpets sound (iii.7); they are exhorted to be firm by being reminded of Moses' uplifted hands in the war with the Amalekites (iii.8). In <b>such</b> <b>times</b> the deaf-mutes, insane, and children are legally unfit for blowing the trumpets. Johanan ben Zakkai established that the shofar trumpets be blown at Jamnia and the surrounding places even if the festival fell on the Sabbath, while at one time this was done only in the Temple (iv.1); he also fixed the lulav outside of the Temple for seven days, and forbade the eating of new grain {{on the second day of}} Passover (iv.2); he extended the time for examining witnesses until the evening, and had them come to Jamnia even in the absence of the av bet din (iv.3). The Mishnah then treats of the order of the prayers (iv.4), of the succession of the Malkuyot, Zikronot, and Shoferot, of the Bible sentences concerning the kingdom of God, Providence, and the trumpet-call of the future (iv.5), and of the leader in prayer and his relation to the teki'ah (iv.6); descriptions of the festival are given in reference to the shofar (iv.7); then follows the order of the traditional trumpet-sounds (iv.8); and remarks on the duties of the leader in prayer and of the congregation close the treatise (iv.9).|$|E
