500|$|René Angélil, Dion, and the Sony family began {{selecting}} prospective songs at {{the beginning}} of 2001, and on 28 August 2001 she started recording vocal tracks for nearly two dozen songs at Montreal's Piccolo Studios. Because of Dion's unwillingness to leave her seven-month-old baby, the album's collaborators traveled to Montreal. [...] "I didn't feel the pressure to try and outdo anything," [...] Dion said of her time in the studio. [...] "I proved myself before, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> can enjoy. I was relaxed, I just let go. It was such a pleasure." [...] The album was scheduled for release internationally on 25 March 2002 and in North America on 26 March 2002. However, it was first released in Australia, on 22 March 2002.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{constant}} media attention, Mukerji remains guarded {{about her}} personal life. Unlike many other celebrities, Mukerji limits her {{interactions with the}} media and is sometimes labelled a recluse; {{she said in a}} 2011 interview, [...] "Today actors have become more open with the media. But this has posed a problem for actors like me because if I don't do that, then I end up being called reclusive. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have changed myself and am easily approachable." [...] Mukerji has collaborated frequently and maintained a close friendship with actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and filmmaker Karan Johar. The nature of Mukerji's relationship with filmmaker Aditya Chopra was the topic of fervent tabloid reporting in India, though she refused to publicly talk about it. On 21 April 2014, she married Chopra at a private ceremony in Italy. On 9 December 2015, she gave birth to their daughter, named Adira.|$|E
500|$|Górecki now had two texts: {{one from}} a mother to her son, the other from a {{daughter}} to her mother. While looking for a third that would continue the theme, he decided on a mid-15th-century folk song from {{the southern city of}} Opole. Its text contains a passage in which the Virgin Mary speaks to her Son dying on the cross: [...] "O my son, beloved and chosen, Share your wounds with your mother..." [...] (Synku miły i wybrany, rozdziel z matką swoje rany...). Górecki said, [...] "this text was folk-like, anonymous. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> had three acts, three persons... Originally, I wanted to frame these texts with an introduction and a conclusion. I even chose two verses (5 and 6) from Psalm 93/94 in the translation by Wujek: 'They humiliated Your people, O Lord, and afflicted Your heritage, they killed the widow and the passer-by, murdered the orphans. However, he rejected this format because he believed the structure would position the work as a symphony [...] "about war". Górecki sought to transcend such specifics, and instead structured the work as three independent laments.|$|E

500|$|Liam Lacey, also {{writing for}} The Globe and Mail, {{described}} Iyall's voice as [...] "sultry [...] sexy", while Mason called it [...] "powerful". Her style {{has sometimes been}} compared to Chrissie Hynde, vocalist for the Pretenders. Richard Harrington of The Washington Post acknowledged the similarity, but also noted the influence of other singers in [...] "Never Say Never" [...] where Iyall mixed the [...] "aggressive bitchiness of , the coy confrontational tactics of Patty Donahue of the Waitresses and the slack sensuality of Debbie Harry of the earliest Blondie." [...] Iyall used to find the comparison annoying, but eventually warmed to it: [...] "When people said I sounded like her, I'd [...] say, 'Oh yeah, thanks a lot.' But this year, I've {{fallen in love with}} [...] Learning To Crawl <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> don't care if [...] people want to make comparisons." [...] After a live show in 1982, [...] Niester contended that she was the weakest part of the group and had the [...] "vocal range of an automobile horn". Billboard writer Kathy Gillis wrote after a concert two years later that Iyall exhibited a [...] "dramatic range that, while not extreme in either direction, was touching." ...|$|E
500|$|Developers tasked both art and map design {{personnel}} {{with creating}} levels, ensuring visual quality. Hall implemented a [...] "grow as you play" [...] philosophy, choosing to show certain features and statistics (like [...] "Beat" [...] {{or the use}} of MysTech) only after the player enabled their use. Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays—numerical or qualitative (using categories such as [...] "very good" [...] or [...] "bad"). Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games: [...] "One of the things I hate about RPGs is, you've got, like, 'here's this thing and here's that thing' and it's like 'this is 52 and that's 53' I mean, what's the difference? It's like, OK it's 'a point,' and the formula will come up to be like 'two points' and like, sure, that's going to make a difference. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have to hit the guy three times..." [...] Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal, and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions. Fatima's name is a pun born from the phrase, [...] "What am I doing?" [...] Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having forgotten what comes next in the current quest or storyline.|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{proportion}} of viewers responded negatively when Vicki {{was shown to}} have an abortion. Johnson claims she received abusive letters from fans of the show {{and that she was}} stopped in the street twice by older women who told her [...] "it was quite wrong [...] to have got rid of the baby. I found that awkward at the time. But, gradually, I came to realise it was rather flattering. Those women believed in my character so completely they forgot she wasn't real. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> think I must have been doing a good job." [...] Johnson has since been critical of the storylines given to her character describing them as weak.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 January 2014 whilst {{appearing}} on The Jonathan Ross Show, Saunders officially {{confirmed that the}} movie will definitely be happening, as she felt obliged to write a script for a film adaptation after threatening it for so long. Saunders was quoted as saying: [...] "Joanna Lumley kept announcing it and saying, 'Yes she's going to do it,' and then Dawn French on our radio show at Christmas said, 'I bet £100,000 that you don't write it,' <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> have to write it, otherwise I have to pay her £100,000'" [...] In April 2014, Saunders again confirmed on BBC Breakfast {{that she was in}} the process of writing the film, and gave a prospective release date of sometime during 2015.|$|E
2500|$|Around this time, Hou Cheng sent {{a trader}} to {{purchase}} 15 horses, {{but the man}} escaped with the horses and headed towards Xiaopei (小沛; present-day Pei County, Jiangsu) {{with the intention of}} defecting to Liu Bei. Hou Cheng personally pursued the trader and retrieved all the horses. Lü Bu's officers then threw a feast to celebrate Hou Cheng's achievement. Hou Cheng prepared 5-6 hu (斛) of wine and about ten roasted hogs, and he presented half a hog and five dou (斗) of wine to Lü Bu before the feast started. He knelt down and said, [...] "With your grace, I managed to retrieve the stolen horses. The others came to congratulate me, so I prepared some wine and hogs for a feast. I don't dare to start first, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>I</b> present the food and wine to you." [...] Lü Bu was furious and he said, [...] "I banned alcohol, but you and the others dare to throw a party! Are you plotting with them to kill me?" [...] Hou Cheng was shocked and he immediately left. He also discarded the wine he prepared and returned the gifts he received from the other officers. Later, Hou Cheng, along with his colleagues Song Xian (宋憲) and Wei Xu (魏續), captured Lü Bu's strategist Chen Gong and general Gao Shun, and led their troops to surrender to Cao Cao.|$|E
