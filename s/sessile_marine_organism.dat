40|$|The brachiopod Terebratulina retusa has {{migrated}} 3000 - 4000 km {{from the}} Iberian Peninsula {{as far north}} as Spitsbergen during the past 10 ka. This migration was caused by the progressive northward reestablishment of the North Atlantic Current, which had been deflected south during the last ice age and which represents the primary method of dispersal for short-lived pelagic brachiopod larvae. This migration has resulted in two similar but morphometrically distinct species, Terebratulina retusaand Terebratulina septentrionalis, occasionally occurring together.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{complete}} {{understanding of}} barnacle adhesion remains elusive as the process occurs within and beneath {{the confines of a}} rigid calcified shell. Barnacle cement is mainly proteinaceous and several individual proteins have been identified in the hardened cement at the barnacle-substrate interface. Little is known about the molt- and tissue-specific expression of cement protein genes but could offer valuable insight into the complex multi-step processes of barnacle growth and adhesion. Methods The main body and sub-mantle tissue of the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite (basionym Balanus amphitrite) were collected in pre- and post-molt stages. RNA-seq technology was used to analyze the transcriptome for differential gene expression at these two stages and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze the protein content of barnacle secretions. Results We report on the transcriptomic analysis of barnacle cement gland tissue in pre- and post-molt growth stages and proteomic investigation of barnacle secretions. While no significant difference was found in the expression of cement proteins genes at pre- and post-molting stages, expression levels were highly elevated in the sub-mantle tissue (where the cement glands are located) compared to the main barnacle body. We report the discovery of a novel 114 kD cement protein, which is identified in material secreted onto various surfaces by adult barnacles and with the encoding gene highly expressed in the sub-mantle tissue. Further differential gene expression analysis of the sub-mantle tissue samples reveals a limited number of genes highly expressed in pre-molt samples with a range of functions including cuticular development, biominerialization, and proteolytic activity. Conclusions The expression of cement protein genes appears to remain constant through the molt cycle and is largely confined to the sub-mantle tissue. Our results reveal a novel and potentially prominent protein to the mix of cement-related components in A. amphitrite. Despite the lack of a complete genome, sample collection allowed for extended transcriptomic analysis of pre- and post-molt barnacle samples and identified a number of highly-expressed genes.

40|$|Drivers of {{recruitment}} in <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> are often poorly understood, {{due to the}} rapidly changing requirements experienced during early ontogeny. The complex suite of physical, biological, and ecological interactions beginning at larval settlement involves a series of trade-offs that influence recruitment success. For example, while cryptic settlement within complex microhabitats is a commonly observed phenomenon in <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms,</b> {{it is unclear whether}} trade-offs between competition in cryptic refuges and predation on exposed surfaces leads to higher recruitment. To explore the trade-offs during the early ontogeny of scleractinian corals, we combined field observations with laboratory and field experiments to develop a mechanistic understanding of coral recruitment success. Multiple experiments conducted over 15 months in Palau (Micronesia) allowed a mechanistic approach to study the individual factors involved in recruitment: settlement behavior, growth, competition, and predation, as functions of microhabitat and ontogeny. We finally developed and tested a predictive recruitment model with the broader aim of testing whether our empirical insights explained patterns of coral recruitment and quantifying the relative importance of each trade-off. Coral settlement was higher in crevices than exposed microhabitats, but post-settlement bottlenecks differed markedly in the presence (uncaged) and absence (caged) of predators.

30|$|A {{critical}} phase {{during the}} life cycle of <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> is the planktonic dispersal stage, (larvae in the case of invertebrates such as barnacles and hydroids; motile spores in the case of many seaweeds), during which they settle and attach to a surface. Settlement is a selective process involving reversible contact with the substratum through exploratory behavior in response to a range of surface-associated signals. Having selected a suitable surface the attached larvae/spores then undergo metamorphosis to generate the adult organisms. When the immersed surface is man-made, the resulting colonization is a nuisance phenomenon generally referred to as ‘biofouling’, which causes major financial and environmental problems in various industries. Ships and leisure vessels, membrane filters, heat exchangers, underwater sensors and aquaculture systems are all subject to biofouling, with the consequence for ships of higher fuel consumption (and hence greenhouse gas and soot emissions) and demand for frequent cleaning [1].|$|R

40|$|Abstract Numerous studies {{demonstrate}} how <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> utilize chemical, structural, and nutritional deterrents {{to persist in}} predator-rich environments. Little is known, however, about how mobile, more behaviorally complex species minimize predation by integrating avoidance and deterrence strategies. We investigated this using sabellid polychaete worms from the Caribbean and temperate western Atlantic. Sabellids extend their feather-like radioles beyond their protective tubes for feeding and respiration; the body remains inside the tube and the radioles retract when threatened. We used co-occurring consumers to determine the palatability of radioles and bodies {{for each of the}} eight species tested. In addition, we examined chemical or structural traits aVecting palatability and evaluated predator escape traits, such as tube strength, speed of radiole retraction, completeness of retraction, and sensitivity to a nearby disturbance. All species had unpalatable radioles that were chemically or structurally defended, but only two species had unpalatable bodies. Thus, most species allocated defenses to tissues that were most exposed to predation. The two species with chemically defended bodies, Bispira brunnea and Bispira variegata, relied less on behavioral escape...|$|R
40|$|The larval {{swimming}} patterns {{prior to}} settlement {{play an important}} role in geographic dispersal and genetic connection for <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms.</b> This study examined how swimming patterns and size change with age for larvae of the bryozoan, Bugula c. f. californica. We observed three different swimming patterns, including upward swimming, downward swimming, and sinking which were observed every hour post hatch for four hours until the onset of settlement each day. We used analysis of digital photographs to measure the body length and width of larvae within the same cohort. Almost all early stage larvae swam up to the top in the first hour, but in later stages larvae changed their swimming pattern to swim down or sink. Upward velocity averaged at about 2 mm per second and decreased over time, and in the fourth hour the larvae started to sink at about 2 mm per second. In addition, there is no significant difference among the values of the lengths or widths of the larvae over time, but these phenotypic characteristics did vary within the age cohorts...|$|R

Although distribution patterns in <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> have frequently been attributed to functional characteristics interacting with wave-induced water motion, similar evidence for mobile organisms is lacking. Links between fin morphology and swimming performance were examined in three diverse coral reef fish families from two major evolutionary lineages. Among-habitat variation in morphology and performance was directly compared with quantitative values of wave-induced water motion from seven coral reef habitats of different depth and wave exposure on the Great Barrier Reef. Fin morphology was strongly correlated with both field and experimental swimming speeds in all three families. The range of observed swimming speeds coincided closely with the magnitude of water velocities commonly found on coral reefs. Distribution patterns in all three families displayed highly congruent relationships between fin morphology and wave-induced water motion. Our findings indicate a general functional relationship between fin morphology and swimming performance in labriform-swimming fishes, and provide quantitative evidence that wave energy may directly influence the assemblage structure of coral reef fishes through interactions with morphology and swimming performance...|$|R

Precision was generally unaffected by the intensity of sampling within quadrats (25 v. 50 v. 100 point-intercepts) or between environments (in situ v. on photographs v. within the laboratory) and appeared to be of secondary concern to decisions about replication. Computer digitising (estimates of surface area of each taxon) provided the least precise estimates and did not justify the additional laboratory time required to process them.

40|$|Suspension feeders are <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> {{dependent}} on plankton and organic particles transported {{by the water}} column for food. This study focused {{on the distribution of}} four suspension feeders (Dendropoma maxima, Spirobranchus giganteus, Heteractis magnifica, and Tridacna maxima) in Mo’orea, French Polynesia based on current, suspended particle abundance, and substrate type. Both D. maxima and S. giganteus were more frequently present at the site with highest current flow and suspended particle abundance. The positive correlation between current and suspended particle, or food, abundance suggests that a stronger current transports more organic particles to a set location than a weaker current. In comparison, H. magnifica and T. maxima abundance and occurrence were not related to current. This is because they are less reliant than D. maxima and S. giganteus on the current for suspension feeding. In comparison, all four species studied showed substrate preference. The distribution of the suspension feeders studied showed varying dependence on current and substrate type. Since suspension feeders regulate primary production by consuming plankton, their distribution and abundance greatly affects marine food chains. Understanding coral reef food chains is vital for comprehending the niche suspension feeders’ fill in coral reef ecosystems...|$|R

During growth, these organisms {{are subjected to}} increasing bending moments as height increases and they may modify their mechanical supports accordingly. Here we used the sea whip Junceellafragilis as a model species to examine how sessile organisms modify their skeletal supports to cope with hydrodynamic forces during growth. Eighty-one colonies of J fragilis (height 5 - 156 cm) were collected from two populations in southern Taiwan. Within-colony variations in skeletal elements, namely the axial skeleton and sclerites, {{as well as the}} coenenchyme and water content were investigated by measurements taken from the base, middle, and top of colonies. The typological distribution of sclerites within colonies was examined in another 31 colonies. The results showed that the relative weight of axial skeleton increases while that of sclerites decreases with colony height, which suggests that the colony switches from using sclerites to axial skeleton as the main support system during growth. The axial skeleton at the colony base thickens {{in such a way as}} to maintain or slightly decrease its bending stress. A greater density of sclerites, mostly double-heads, found at the colony base also adds to the resistance to bending. Moreover, colonies living in environments with greater flows seem to incorporate more skeletal materials.

40|$|Sponges {{and other}} sessile {{invertebrates}} are lacking behavioural escape or defense mechanisms and rely therefore on morphological or chemical defenses. Studies from terrestrial systems and marine algae demonstrated facultative defenses like induction and activation to be common, suggesting that <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> also evolved mechanisms {{to increase the}} efficiency of their chemical defense. However, inducible defenses in sponges have not been investigated so far and studies on activated defenses are rare. We investigated whether tropical sponge species induce defenses in response to artificial predation and whether wounding triggers defense activation. Additionally, we tested if these mechanisms are also used to boost antimicrobial activity to avoid bacterial infection. Laboratory experiments with eight pacific sponge species showed that 87 % of the tested species were chemically defended. Two species, Stylissa massa and Melophlus sarasinorum, induced defenses in response to simulated predation, which is the first demonstration of induced antipredatory defenses in marine sponges. One species, M. sarasinorum, also showed activated defense in response to wounding. Interestingly, 50 % of the tested sponge species demonstrated induced antimicrobial defense. Simulated predation increased the antimicrobial defenses in Aplysinella sp., Cacospongia sp., M. sarasinorum, and S. massa.

This temporal comparison {{of the amount of}} in vivo 15 N labeling of nitrogen-containing metabolites represents a direct way to discover and evaluate factors influencing natural product biosynthesis, as well as the timing of specific steps in metabolite assembly, and is a strong complement to more traditional in vitro studies.

This technique also afforded the production of the neurotoxic jamaicamides to be more carefully studied, including an assessment of how jamaicamide turnover compares with filament growth rate and primary metabolism and provided new insights into the biosynthetic timing of jamaicamide A bromination. This approach should be valuable in determining how environmental factors affect secondary metabolite production, ultimately yielding insight into the energetic balance among growth, primary production, and secondary metabolism, and thus aid in the development of methods to improve compound yields for biomedical or biotechnological applications...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the patterns and processes {{associated with the}} population dynamics of Balanus glandula during the early phase of invasion along the Pacific coast of eastern Hokkaido, population surveys were conducted from 2002 to 2011 at five shores, each consisting of five paired plots (scraped recruitment plot and unscraped establishment plot), along 49 km of coastline located 144 km east of the eastern front of the invasion of this species in 2000. Larval recruitment was first detected in 2004, but {{the establishment of a}} population was not observed until 2 years later at the westernmost shore of the study area. Occurrence increased from non-native barnacle present in 4 % of plots in 2006 to 100 % in 2011, but mean coverage remained low (< 5 %) in 2011. Most local population coverage fluctuated without indicating clear temporal trends, but coverage in one plot showed a consistent pattern of rapid increase. Local extinctions occurred, but rates of local extinction decreased with time as larval recruitment increased. Lag times between recruitment and establishment occurred for 64 % of the paired plots and ranged from 1 to 4 years. Lag times decreased after 5 years, when larval recruitment increased. These findings suggest that the intensity of larval recruitment determined invasion dynamics during this early phase of the invasion, and the monitoring of recruitment is therefore essential for early detection of invasions by <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> and prediction of their range expansion...|$|R

This study was aimed at examining the temporal and spatial variability of the marine cave environment, including temperature, salinity, light intensity, cave morphology and hydrodynamism, along with the dissolutional effect caused by the mixing of sea and freshwater. The general distribution of organisms in the Y-Cave was positively correlated to the light gradient and reduced water circulation, thus the highest species diversity and abundance were recorded in the front part of the cave. The phylum Porifera was the most dominant group, and the poriferan species diversity in the cave ranks among the ten highest in the Mediterranean.

Mitochondrial respiratory rates (states 3 and 4 stimulated by glutamate) and phosphorylation efficiency [respiratory control ratio (RCR) {{and the relationship between}} ADP and oxygen consumption (ADP/O) ] were measured. Cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activity and cytochrome concentrations (a, b, c 1 and c) were measured to investigate the rearrangements of respiratory chain subunits. The potential implication of an alternative oxidase (AOX) was investigated using an inhibitor of the respiratory chain (antimycin A) and through gene expression analysis in gills and digestive gland. Results indicate a downregulation of mitochondrial capacity, with 60 % inhibition of respiratory rates after 12 h of hypoxia.

These include nursery for fish, anchor point for <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> species and feeding ground for many different organisms. Detailed knowledge of such reef habitats and their properties is thus crucial for the determination of marine protected areas and consequently also for the management of the North Sea. As stones and boulders usually cannot be recovered from the seafloor to be investigated in the lab most analyses have to rely on non-invasive methods like e. g. underwater video- and diver-observation data. Due to these limitations these habitats are not well understood with regard to their spatial distribution, temporal development and ecology. Furthermore, there is no standardized way to assess the structure and cover of biological communities on such hard-substrates, which discourages comparison of data between different regions. We here present a standardized workflow to analyse underwater videos of hard-substrate habitats recorded in different areas of the North Sea. The idea is to combine these detailed information with an area-wide habitat classification based on sidescan sonar data. For image-based evaluation, the videos are transformed into single frames, extracted every five seconds of video running time and imported into a self-developed image analysis script. This script allows the user to select and count different descriptors in numerical categories. These include amongst others the different size classes of stones, the areal coverage of <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms,</b> the surrounding sediment properties or the presence of grazers. These semi-quantitative data are subsequently statistically analysed to produce a set of standardized characteristics of the hard-substrate habitats and the controlling factors of their current state and development. Preliminary results show that boulders in sandy environments are predominantly covered by sessile invertebrate organisms (e. g. the soft coral Alcyonium digitatum and the sea-anemone Metridium senile), while cobbles are largely uncovered. In muddy areas, however, even cobbles show a higher amount of sessile coverage though at an earlier or reduced state of development. The proposed method allows to obtain detailed data on the distribution, kind and composition of <b>marine</b> <b>sessile</b> <b>organisms</b> populating hard-substrate habitats in the North Sea. Already at this stage, the practical assumption of many investigations that stones are all and always inhabited by the typical organisms, which is utilized in many investigations can hardly be supported. Our research further shows the need to develop methodologies to upscale these observations to be able to assess spatial patterns between and within larger reef complexes.

We conducted parallel manipulative experiments on a rocky shore and in a mangrove forest to assess (1) the relative importance of tidal elevation and substrate type (bare, live oysters, or dead oysters) in determining the spatial distribution of new (< 1 mm) S. glomerata recruits and (2) the contribution {{of settlement}} and postsettlement processes in setting patterns of spatial variation in established oyster populations. Patches of habitat with either live oysters, dead oysters, or no conspecifics were established at 3 tidal elevations at each site, and natural settlement and postsettlement mortality were monitored through time. At each site, and regardless of the substrate provided, we detected a similar pattern of fewer new S. glomerata recruits and greater postsettlement mortality on the high intertidal shore rather than the mid or low intertidal shore. Substrate type, by contrast, influenced the abundance of new recruits, but not subsequent postsettlement mortality. Consequently, over a period of months, direct effects of tidal elevation rather than effects of substrate type determined spatial patterns of oyster recruitment on the rocky shore and in the mangrove. Consequently, we documented that on a rocky shore and in a mangrove forest, settlement and early postsettlement mortality vary similarly across tidal elevation gradients and substrate types to determine the distribution of S. glomerata. 8 page(s...|$|R

There are no standard assay conditions for this important species and therefore the initial study of this thesis (Chapter 2) quantified the effect of key factors on the settlement of pediveligers and plantigrades to provide a standardised and reproducible assay method. Density dependent settlement did not occur for either pediveligers or plantigrades. Settlement increased in drop assays in a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle, while bottom shade had no effect of any magnitude. In addition, settlement was significantly enhanced by storing pediveligers for between 4 and 24 days at 4 ºC. Overall, these data provide the template to optimise and standardise static laboratory settlement assays for mussels {{in order to develop}} materials that either enhance settlement for the aquaculture industry, or deter settlement for antifouling applications. Furthermore, simple mechanisms such as storage at 4 ºC can enhance settlement beyond current methods used in aquaculture hatcheries.

40|$|Biofouling is the {{accumulation}} of <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms,</b> such as algae, tube worms and barnacles on man-made substrata and has negative economic and ecological implications. Ship hulls are readily fouled, which significantly increases drag while decreasing ship fuel efficiency when moving through water. Fouled hulls have also become important vectors of invasive species. These problems are minimized when hulls are painted with a toxic anti-fouling or non-toxic foul-release coating. Due to recent restrictions of anti-fouling paint use, {{research and development of}} non-toxic alternatives has increased. Novel hull coating efficiency is often quantified by the critical removal stress value of barnacles from the coating. Barnacle adhesive cement protein content is thought to be responsible for barnacles’ incredible ability to adhere underwater. The expression level and type of adhesive proteins has eluded scientists due to their extreme insolubility within cured barnacle cement. Identification of these proteins may provide insight to the adhesion of fouling species and aid coating development. Barnacles are a cosmopolitan organism, able to withstand a wide range of environmental conditions, yet foul-release coating research had not previously incorporated environmental factors as variables in determining coating performance. Temperature is known to affect protein structure and function and is also a formative factor of barnacle larvae survival and development. Even so, the interaction between temperature and barnacle adhesion to has not previously been explored. We examined the effect of temperature on barnacle adhesion to foul-release coatings. After observing differences in critical removal stress due to temperature, we attempted to attribute these differences to specific proteins within the adhesive using 2 D SDS PAGE. Gel image analysis determined that there were significant differences in cement protein expression between barnacles raised within different temperatures. Preliminary protein identification with Mass Spectronomy (MALDI TOF/TOF) was performed, however further research and a larger barnacle genomic database is needed to elucidate barnacle cement protein sequences...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{components}} in assessing <b>marine</b> <b>sessile</b> <b>organism</b> demography is determining recruitment patterns to benthic habitats. An analysis of serially deployed recruitment tiles across depth (6 and 12 m), seasons (summer and winter) and space (meters to kilometres) was used to quantify recruitment assemblage structure (abundance and percent cover) of corals, sponges, ascidians, algae and other sessile organisms from the northern sector of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Polychaetes were most abundant on recruitment titles, reaching almost 50 % of total recruitment, yet covere...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{structures}} are a conspicuous, yet poorly understood {{component of the}} marine environment along urban coastlines. Previous work has shown that different types of structures support different diversities and relative abundances of <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms.</b> Studies {{on the effects of}} substratum composition, age, orientation and the effects of predation have failed to explain the observed differences in assemblages that develop on different types of structures. We assessed the model that differences in epibiotic assemblages between pontoons and pilings were due to the floating nature of pontoons versus the fixed (relative to the seafloor) nature of pilings, as opposed to other structural differences (colour, shape, surface type, etc.). Two additional (nonmutually exclusive) models were also tested. These were that the presence of a ‘swash zone‘ constantly exposed to wave action and/or attachment to the benthos could cause differences between pontoons and pilings. We hypothesized that purpose-built experimental structures that floated would develop different assemblages from structures that were held fixed relative to the seafloor, regardless of whether they were pontoons or pilings. If swash were important, then structures floating just below the surface would differ from structures floating at the surface. If attachment to the benthos were important, then pilings attached to the benthos would differ from all the other structures. Multivariate analyses supported the hypothesis that both floating and the presence of swash were important in creating a typical pontoon assemblage, while other factors (type of structure, attachment to the benthos) were not. Several taxa contributed to these differences, including the mussel Mytilus edulis, the polychaete tubeworm Hydroides sp. and several algal taxa. Differences between fixed and floating structures have implications for the interpretation of previous studies done on floating docks. More studies of this kind are needed in order to inform the managers of urban waterways about the implications of adding different types of structures to the coastal environment. M. G. Holloway and S. D. Connel...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss a}} macroscopical growth model {{which can be}} used to {{simulate}} growth forms of complex-shaped branching organisms with radiate accretive growth. This type of growth processes can be found in many different <b>marine</b> <b>sessile</b> <b>organisms.</b> We use scleractinian corals and a branching sponge as an example. With the radiate accretive growth model a wide range of morphologies and the influence of the physical environment (light and nutrient distribution by advection-diffusion) can be modelled. We show an (preliminary) example of how the accretive growth model can be coupled with a model of gene regulation and body plan formation in a branching sponge...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} 'super competitors' in nature is usually {{attributed}} to organisms facing trade-offs in resource allocation. Here we identify another mechanism, dependent on indirect interactions among species and non-random spatial organization, in which selection favours restraint in competitive ability. In simple spatial models of a three-species intransitive network, indirect interactions favour slower growth and selection limits {{the difference in}} growth rate among species. The mechanism involves a trade-off between selection at the individual level, which selects for increased growth rate, and at the community level, which acts to limit growth rate to less than the maximum possible. If the difference in growth rates among species becomes too large, then the community becomes unstable and collapses to a monoculture of the slowest growing species. The mechanism requires both the intransitive network structure and selforganized spatial structure in the system. Similar behaviours arise in more complex systems of more than three species, and where there are reversals in interaction outcomes between species pairs. The work suggests that spatial self-structuring, indirect interactions and selection acting on community properties can be important in evolution. It provides a partial explanation of {{the high level of}} species coexistence and apparent restraint in interspecific interactions evident in some assemblages of <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> colonial <b>organisms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Within this {{investigation}} a more environmentally friendly strategy was pursued to obtain antifouling compounds with higher biocompatibility {{based on the}} chemical defenses of <b>sessile</b> <b>marine</b> <b>organisms.</b> <b>Marine</b> algae and cyanobacteria have {{shown to be a}} good example of them representing actually a rich source of potential natural high value antifouling compounds. During this work, it was desired to evaluate or demonstrate the technical feasibility to obatain natural antifouling compounds using an approach through the development of a bioprocess. To achieve this goal it was necessary to aboard several involved aspects from the perspective of different disciplines such as microbiology, chemistry, and biochemical engineering. The brown alga Sargassum muticum and cyanobacteria Geitlerinema sp. were evaluated as producers of bioactive natural antibiofouling compounds and extractions methods were developed to get a preconcentration of these compounds into crude extracts. These experiments comprised a comparison of antimicrobial activity of culture medium extracts (from the cyanobacterial strain Flo 1) obtained using two polymeric resins (AmberliteTM XAD- 16 and XAD- 1180) for pre-concentration of exometabolites as well as physiological studies relating growth with excretion of these bioactive compounds. Concerning to the first point, the yield of extraction of crude medium extract (mg of crude extract mL- 1 of supernatant) was calculated for cultures of different ages and the two mentioned resins. In all the cases, {{it was found that the}} obtained culture media extracts of Geitlerinema sp. exhibited antimicrobial activity after one week of cultivation. The potential of these crude extracts as potential antifouling agent was demonstrated by the determination of their antimicrofouling activity upon a number of bacteria and fungi, using microdilution methods and taking as reference the chemical biocides TBTO (bis (tributyltin) oxide) and zinc pyrithione. The task to develop antifouling compounds from natural sources were supported by the establishment of analytical methods-(ESI) MS/MS, GC-FID, GC-MS) which enabled the identification and quantification of bioactive substances present in the crude extracts. Several exometabolites produced by Geitlerinema sp could be identified (harmane, norharmane and 4, 4 -dihydroxybiphenyl). The synthesis of bioactive compounds with antimicrobial activity, excreted by <b>marine</b> <b>organisms,</b> strongly depends on their growth conditions, therefore also the effect of cultivation conditions of microorganisms on the production and excretion of antimicrobial metabolites have been investigated. To improve the light uptake rate from the photosyntetic cells a flat-photo bioreactor module for the cultivation of filamentous cyanobacteria was designed. It was evaluated the production of antimicrobial compounds using cyanobacterial cells forming a biofilm on the surface of a flat-fotobioreactor operating in batch-modus under different conditions of illumination. From these results, it can be concluded that the technical feasibility (basic design) for the continuous production of antifouling compounds from the culture of marine bacteria is possible, but it needs to be improved with respect to: (i) the stability on the production and excretion of the metabolites by the microorganisms, (ii) a better understanding the mechanisms that regulate their expression and (iii) the yield and grade of recovery during the separation of the compounds...|$|R
40|$|For <b>sessile</b> benthic <b>marine</b> <b>organisms</b> {{adhesion}} to {{a stable}} substrate {{is important for}} survival. Sedimentary systems, however, generally lack stable surfaces. How sessile species like the mussel, Mytilus edulis, are able to achieve stability in unstable sediments is not fully understood. An intertidal mussel bed in the tidal flats in the Western portion of the Dutch Wadden Sea was selected to investigate adhesion behavior of M. edulis. Sampling was conducted along a hydrodynamic gradient along the Front-edge, Center and Back-edge of a mussel bed. Mussels along the bed edges were characterized by adhesion to fine shell debris and high numbers of byssus threads. Mussels {{in the center of}} the bed were characterized by adhesion to shells of living conspecifics and relatively low numbers of byssus threads. An experimental investigation to isolate the role of perturbation on adhesion strategies was carried out under laboratory conditions. Experimental results show that under perturbed conditions mussels developed increased numbers of byssus threads relative to mussels left unperturbed. Additionally, mussels subjected to perturbation preferentially adhered more frequently to fine shell debris while unperturbed mussels adhered more frequently to conspecifics. Results show that differentiation in adhesion strategy is driven by physical perturbation and mediated by bed density. The results also suggest that adhesion by mussels in a sedimentary environment is a selective process in which larger shell fragments and shells of conspecifics are the preferred substrate...|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{variation}} in <b>marine</b> <b>sessile</b> <b>organisms</b> is frequently related to environmental factors. Quantifying such variation is relevant {{in a range}} of ecological studies. For example, analyzing the growth form of fossil organisms may indicate the state of the physical environment in which the organism lived. A quantitative morphological comparison is important in studies where <b>marine</b> <b>sessile</b> <b>organisms</b> are transplanted from one environment to another. This study presents a method for the quantitative analysis of three-dimensional (3 D) images of scleractinian corals obtained with X-ray Computed Tomography scanning techniques. The advantage of Computed Tomography scanning is that a full 3 D image of a complex branching object, including internal structures, can be obtained with a very high precision. There are several complications in the analysis of this data set. In the analysis of a complex branching object, landmark-based methods usually do not work and different approaches are required where various artifacts (for example cavities, holes in the skeleton, scanning artifacts, etc.) in the data set have to be removed before the analysis. A method is presented, which is based on the construction of a medial axis and a combination of image-processing techniques for the analysis of a 3 D image of a complex branching object where the complications mentioned above can be overcome. The method is tested on a range of 3 D images of samples of the branching scleractinian coral Madracis mirabilis collected at different depths. It is demonstrated that the morphological variation of these samples can be quantified, and that biologically relevant morphological characteristics, like branch-spacing and surface/volume ratios, can be computed.

40|$|The {{competitive}} {{ranking of}} three <b>marine</b> <b>sessile</b> <b>organisms</b> was determined from overgrowth observations {{and found to}} be intrasitive. Overgrowth results were dependent upon relative vertical relief which, in turn, was related to colony area. Discriminant function analysis demonstrates that competitive rankings can be largely predicted {{on the basis of}} knowledge of the size-frequency distribution of interacting populations. Because size increases with age for these species, size-dependent competition implies age-dependent competition. The role of age structure in determining the results of inter-specific interactions has been curiously neglected, particularly as it relates to competitive ability, yet the age dependence of competitive ability suggests (i) the occurrence of intransitivity in purely exploitative systems, (ii) a mechanism for frequency-dependent behavior, (iii) the production of limit cycles, and (iv) the possibility of size refugia...|$|R
