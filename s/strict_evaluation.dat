40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conditional random field-based approach for identifying speaker-produced disfluencies (i. e. if {{and where they}} occur) in spontaneous speech transcripts. We emphasize false start regions, which are often missed in current disfluency identification approaches as they lack lexical or structural similarity to the speech immediately following. We find that combining lexical, syntactic, and language model-related features with the output of a state-of-the-art disfluency identification system improves overall word-level identification {{of these and other}} errors.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The SLC {{feedback}} system [1, 2] is a generalized, database driven system that applies state-space formalisms {{to stabilize the}} beam. Feedback {{has proven to be}} essential to the successful operation of the SLC. Problems encountered in running high current beams have forced us to adopt tighter tolerances on feedback control parameters and have motivated a <b>stricter</b> <b>evaluation</b> of feedback performance. Of particular concern is the fact that linac feedback loops are routinely operated with lower than design gain. The design of each feedback loop relies on knowledge of the slew rates of the correctors used to cancel perturbations and of the noise spectrum of the beam. The effect of differences in corrector speeds has been measured and analyzed using high current beams. For a series of loops in succession correction for over compensation, or cascade [3], was found to be necessary, in which information from each loop is passed on to the loop immediately downstream.

Short- and intermediate-term {{results have been}} previously published while long-term results have not. The long-term results of 22 patients treated with corrective osteotomy for symptomatic distal radius malunion are presented (range 6 - 24 years, mean 13 years). All patients completed the DASH questionnaire and the modified Gartland and Werley, and Green and O'Brien scores postoperatively. Wrist alignment was assessed through standard wrist radiographs. Average wrist flexion-extension was 72. 5 % of the contralateral limb. Grip strength averaged 71 %. The DASH score averaged 16 points corresponding to mild perceived disability. Results were categorized as fair on both the Gartland and Werley score (average 9 points) and the modified Green and O'Brien score (average 67 points).

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of lung injury among South Korean adults was examined in a hospital-based case-control study, and the suspected cause was exposure to humidifier disinfectant (HD). However, a case-control study with community-dwelling controls {{was needed to}} validate the previous study's findings, and to confirm the exposure-response relationship between HD and lung injury. Each case of lung injury was matched with four community-dwelling controls, according to age (± 3 years), sex, residence, and history of childbirth since 2006 (for women). Environmental risk factors, which included type and use of humidifier and HD, were investigated using a structured questionnaire during August 2011. The exposure to HD was calculated for both cases and controls, and the corresponding risks of lung injury were compared. Among 28 eligible cases, 16 patients agreed to participate, and 60 matched controls were considered eligible for this study. The cases {{were more likely to}} have been exposed to HD (odds ratio: 116. 1, 95 % confidence interval: 6. 5 - 2, 063. 7). All cases were exposed to HDs containing polyhexamethyleneguanidine phosphate, and the risk of lung injury increased with the cumulative exposure, duration of exposure, and exposure per day.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{identify}} the limitations of previously published systematic reviews evaluating the outcome of root canal treatment. Traditionally, periapical radiography {{has been used to}} assess the outcome of root canal treatment with the absence of a periapical radiolucency being considered a confirmation of a healthy periapex. However, a high percentage of cases confirmed as healthy by radiographs revealed apical periodontitis on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and by histology. In teeth, where reduced size of the existing radiolucency was diagnosed by radiographs and considered to represent periapical healing, enlargement of the lesion was frequently confirmed by CBCT. In clinical studies, two additional factors may have further contributed to the overestimation of successful outcomes after root canal treatment: (i) extractions and re-treatments were rarely recorded as failures; and (ii) the recall rate was often lower than 50 %. The periapical index (PAI), frequently used for determination of success, was based on radiographic and histological findings in the periapical region of maxillary incisors. The validity of using PAI for all tooth positions might be questionable, as the thickness of the cortical bone and the position of the root tip in relation with the cortex vary with tooth position. In conclusion, the serious limitations of longitudinal clinical studies restrict the correct interpretation of root canal treatment outcomes. Systematic reviews reporting the success rates of root canal treatment without referring to these limitations may mislead readers. The outcomes of root canal treatment should be re-evaluated in long-term longitudinal studies using CBCT and <b>stricter</b> <b>evaluation</b> criteria...|$|R

Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example recurrence relations such as the factorial.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Free theorems {{establish}} interesting {{properties of}} parametrically polymorphic functions, solely from their types, {{and serve as}} a nice proof tool. For pure and lazy functional programming languages, they can be used with very few preconditions. Unfortunately, in the presence of selective strictness, as provided in languages like Haskell, their original strength is reduced. In this paper we present an approach for restrengthening them. By a refined type system which tracks the use of <b>strict</b> <b>evaluation,</b> we rule out unnecessary restrictions that otherwise emerge from the general suspicion that <b>strict</b> <b>evaluation</b> may be used at any point. Additionally, we provide an implemented algorithm determining all refined types for a given term. ...|$|E

Launchbury 1993 [...] describes some difficulties that lazy evaluation introduces, particularly in analyzing a program's storage requirements, and proposes an operational semantics to aid in such analysis. Harper 2009 proposes including both <b>strict</b> and lazy <b>evaluation</b> in the same language, using the language's type system to distinguish them.|$|R
30|$|For future work, we plan {{to improve}} upon the results {{presented}} here {{in terms of the}} recall metric, {{as well as in the}} manner of reducing its noisiness and responsiveness. One way to do this is by carrying an automatic weighting to remove noisy influences during the calculation of the GCC-PHAT. Another is to investigate other types of ITD-to-DOA models, specifically near-field techniques so that the proposed system is usable in more types of applications. In addition, it is of interest to develop a much more sophisticated DOA-to-track association technique, since it is very probable that such associations will break when having sound sources cross each other; however it is also important to maintain the low footprint requirement in such associations, which, unfortunately, is not satisfied by current techniques (such as the ones based on particle filters). We also plan to implement a <b>stricter</b> <b>evaluation</b> methodology for moving sources, providing a more representative evaluation metric for their tracking. Although keeping the number of microphones low is an important topic of this work, {{we plan to}} explore the addition of microphones to this solution for the DOA estimation in a 3 D space to broaden the range of fields of where this approach can be applied. Moreover, we will explore its implementation in some of the aforementioned applications, specifically in the area of hearing aid design, where the small amount of microphones has been a limiting requirement. Another applicable area is that of Bioacoustics, by carrying census of animal species that interact with each other by song (birds, marine mammals, etc.) in acoustic scenarios that are far more dynamic and complex than the ones presented in this work and do not assume the presence of speech sources.|$|R
40|$|Functional {{programs}} are widely appreciated for being "declarative" (algorithms are not over-specified) and implicitly parallel. However, when modeling state, both properties are compromised {{because the state}} variables must be "threaded" through most functions. Further, state "updates " may require much copying. A solution is to introduce assignments, as in ML and Scheme; however, for meaningful semantics, they resort to <b>strict,</b> sequential <b>evaluation.</b> We present an alternative approach called M-structures, which are imperative data structures with implicit synchronization. M-structures are added to Id, a parallel non-strict functional language. We argue that some programs with M-structures improve on their functional counterparts in three ways: they are (1) more declarative; (2) more parallel; and (3) more storage efficient. Points (1) and (2) contradict conventional wisdom. We study two problems: histogramming a tree, and graph traversal, comparing functional and M-structure solutions [...] . ...|$|R
