5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for his second}} film, Enam Djam di Jogja (Six Hours in Yogyakarta), Ismail recalled Djajakusuma to Jakarta. For the film, Djajakusuma helped Ismail adapt the General Assault of 1 March 1949 for the screen. Production was completed on a low budget; Djajakusuma later recalled that their camera had to be powered by a car battery. Despite this and other difficulties, Djajakusuma stayed on after the film's completion, completing another work for Perfini, Dosa Tak Berampun (Unforgivable Sin), later that year. Ismail served as director for this film, {{about a man who}} leaves his family after he is transfixed by the <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> a waitress.|$|E

500|$|The anglicized name Isaac is a {{transliteration}} of the Hebrew term Yiṣḥāq which literally means [...] "He laughs/will laugh." [...] Ugaritic texts {{dating from}} the 13th century BCE refer to the benevolent <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> the Canaanite deity El. Genesis, however, ascribes the laughter to Isaac's parents, Abraham and Sarah, rather than El. According to the biblical narrative, Abraham fell {{on his face and}} laughed when God (Hebrew, Elohim) imparted the news of their son's eventual birth. He laughed because Sarah was past the age of childbearing; both she and Abraham were advanced in age. Later, when Sarah overheard three messengers of the Lord renew the promise, she laughed inwardly for the same reason. Sarah denied laughing when God questioned Abraham about it.|$|E

500|$|Crash Team Racing {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} review aggregator Metacritic. Official PlayStation Magazine described Crash Team Racing as [...] "the game that made kart racing cool" [...] and proclaimed that [...] "nothing has ever matched its quality." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly {{noted that the}} game was [...] "heavily inspired by Mario Kart, but still an amazing multiplayer racer." [...] Doug Perry of IGN stated that the game was [...] "rock solid" [...] in playability and graphics, but was critical of [...] "the insanely capitalistic <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> Crash." [...] Jeff Gerstmann of GameSpot called the game [...] "a great Mario Kart clone", and that it succeeded where similar games like Mega Man Battle & Chase, Bomberman Fantasy Race, Diddy Kong Racing, Chocobo Racing and Mario Kart had failed. Johnny Liu of Game Revolution concluded that {{despite the fact that}} the game [...] "doesn't add much to the tired genre, it manages to do everything well." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007 and 2008, Lovato played Charlotte Adams on the Disney Channel {{short series}} As the Bell Rings. Lovato auditioned for the channel's {{television}} film Camp Rock and series Sonny with a Chance during 2007 and got both roles. Lovato played the lead character, aspiring singer Mitchie Torres, in Camp Rock. The film premiered on June 20, 2008, to 8.9million viewers. Its soundtrack was released three days earlier; however, {{the music was}} considered less current than that of High School Musical. Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Lovato's acting skills were underwhelming and she [...] "has the knee-jerk <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> someone who is often told she has a great smile". Lovato sang four songs on the soundtrack, including [...] "We Rock" [...] and [...] "This Is Me". That summer, she began her Demi Live! Warm Up Tour before the release of her debut album and appeared on the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour.|$|E
500|$|Later {{historian}}s, however, took Gibbon's emphases even further. As Marxist historian G.E.M. de Ste. Croix {{put it in}} 1954, [...] "The so-called Great Persecution {{has been}} exaggerated in the Christian tradition to an extent which even Gibbon did not fully appreciate." [...] In 1972, the ecclesiastical Protestant historian Hermann Dörries was embarrassed to admit to his colleagues that his sympathies lay with the Christians rather than their persecutors. W.H.C. Frend guesses that 3,0003,500 Christians {{were killed in the}} persecution. Although the number of verifiably true martyrs' tales has fallen, and estimates of the total casualty rate have been reduced, some modern writers are less skeptical than Gibbon of the severity of the persecution. As the author Stephen Williams [...] wrote in 1985, [...] "even allowing a margin for invention, what remains is terrible enough. Unlike Gibbon, we live in an age which has experienced similar things, and knows how unsound is that civilised <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> incredulity at such reports. Things can be, have been, every bit as bad as our worst imaginings." ...|$|E

500|$|Martin Conway {{describes}} {{the portrayal of}} a dignified man marked by a grave expression and deep [...] "furrows ploughed by seventy years of labour and sorrow". Conway believed {{the strength of the}} portrait is in part achieved through Dürer's ability to convey this hardship, {{while at the same time}} presenting a man still imbued with traces of pride, and possessing [...] "a kind old face". Noting the obvious affection between the father and son as well as the half <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> the older man, he wonders if that grin might have been born of Albrecht the Elder's satisfaction that his toil has been rewarded by a son of such talent, who was now about to set out on the world for his wanderjahr. A contributing factor to this pride is that Albrecht the Elder trained his son in his own profession, as a jeweller, but at one point came to regret the choice of apprenticeship as the younger man was so obviously suited to drawing and painting. However, his son learned many skills during that period and it gave him a discipline with his hands that became a defining factor of his work, especially in his ability as an engraver.|$|E
500|$|Mathieu Amalric as Dominic Greene, {{the main}} villain. He {{is a leading}} member of Quantum posing as a {{businessman}} working in reforestation and charity funding for environmental science. In the 2015 Bond film Spectre, he is revealed {{to have been a}} member of the titular crime syndicate, of which Quantum is a subsidiary. Amalric acknowledged taking the role was an easy decision because, [...] "It's impossible to say to your kids that 'I could have been in a Bond film but I refused.'" [...] Amalric wanted to wear make-up for the role, but Forster explained that he wanted Greene not to look grotesque, but to symbolise the hidden evils in society. Amalric modelled his performance on [...] "the <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> Tony Blair [...] the craziness of Sarkozy," [...] the latter of whom he called [...] "the worst villain we [...] have ever had... he walks around thinking he's in a Bond film." [...] He later claimed this was not criticism of either politician, but rather an example of how a politician relies on performance instead of a genuine policy to win power. [...] "Sarkozy, is just a better actor than [...] Ségolène Royal—that's all," [...] he explained. Amalric and Forster reconceived the character, who was supposed to have a [...] "special skill" [...] in the script, to someone who uses pure animal instinct when fighting Bond in the climax. Bruno Ganz was also considered for the part, but Forster decided Amalric gave the character a [...] "pitiful" [...] quality.|$|E
