5000|$|In 2016, {{computer}} security researchers from Fidelis Cybersecurity and Exatel discovered the browser surreptitiously sending sensitive browsing and system data, such as ad blocker status, websites visited, searches conducted, and applications installed with their version numbers, to remote servers located in Beijing, China. According to Maxthon, {{the data is}} sent {{as part of the}} firm's 'User Experience Improvement Program' and it is [...] "voluntary and totally anonymous." [...] However, researchers found the data still being collected and sent to remote servers even after users explicitly opt-out of the program. The researchers further found the data being sent over an unencrypted connection (HTTP), leaving users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Fidelis' Chief Security Officer, Justin Harvey, noted the data [...] "...contains almost everything you would want in conducting a reconnaissance operation to know exactly where to attack. Knowing the exact operating system and installed applications, and browsing habits it would be trivial to send a perfectly crafted <b>spear</b> <b>phish</b> to the victim or perhaps set up a watering hole attack on one of their most frequented websites." [...] Soon after this incident, developers from Maxthon found out that it was just a bug that caused some testing information being sent to the company's server for user experience improvement, and it has been fixed immediately according to Maxthon's CEO Jeff Chen. He also stated that [...] "security and privacy are top priorities at Maxthon".|$|R

On April 15, which in Russia was a holiday in honor of the military's electronic warfare services, the hackers seemed to become inactive for the day. Another sophisticated hacking group attributed to the Russian Federation, nicknamed Cozy Bear, was also present in the DNC's servers at the same time. However the two groups each appeared to be unaware of the other, as each independently stole the same passwords and otherwise duplicated their efforts. Cozy Bear appears to be a different agency, one more interested in traditional long-term espionage.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{similar to}} [...] "phishing", <b>spear</b> <b>phishing</b> is a {{technique}} that fraudulently obtains private information by sending highly customized emails to few end users. It is {{the main difference between}} phishing attacks because phishing campaigns focus on sending out high volumes of generalized emails with the expectation that only a few people will respond. On the other hand, <b>spear</b> <b>phishing</b> emails require the attacker to perform additional research on their targets in order to [...] "trick" [...] end users into performing requested activities. The success rate of spear-phishing attacks is considerably higher than phishing attacks with people opening roughly 3% of phishing emails when compared to roughly 70% of potential attempts. However, when users actually open the emails phishing emails have a relatively modest 5% success rate to have the link or attachment clicked when compared to a spear-phishing attack's 50% success rate.|$|E
