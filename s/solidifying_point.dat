40|$|A {{modified}} quadratic partial {{least squares}} (MQPLS) algorithm based on non-linear constrained programming is proposed, {{in which a}} sequential unconstrained minimisation technique is employed to calculate the outer input weights and the parameters of inner relationship. Other existing quadratic partial least squares (QPLS) algorithms are also reviewed and compared with the proposed MQPLS in the applications to two datasets, one being an artificial dataset and the other being the real data from an industrial fluidised catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) main fractionator. It is shown that the MQPLS not only can explain better the underlying variability of the data but also achieves improved modelling and predictive performance over the existing QPLS algorithms. An inferential control system is implemented on the distributed control system for an industrial FCCU main fractionator, in which the soft-sensor {{is built based on}} the MQPLS algorithm to estimate the diesel oil <b>solidifying</b> <b>point</b> online and the controller is established via a constrained dynamic matrix control algorithm.

40|$|Catalytic {{cracking}} fractional colurnn is {{the most}} important production device for refining enterprises in China. Its main products are car gasoline and diesel fuel. The yield and quality of these two kinds of products decide directly the economie efficiency of enterprises. In order to increase the economic efficiency of enterprises, it is needed to better adjust and control the quality of car gasoline and diesel fuel. Because fluidized catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) is in closed state, it is impossible to observe actual production process manually. But if people cannot timely master product quality condition, it is impossible to adjust effectively the technological parameters in order to control product quality. But at present, it takes four hours to obtain quality level of products if using the method of manual sampling testing. If it is as this, production process cannot, based on the analyzed results, be timely adjusted. Therefore, developing the real-time product quality intellect forecasting and analysis system of fractional column and realizing forecasting and analysis on-line have important theoretic meaning and value in engineering application. This system can real-timely forecast product quality of fractional colurnn, and can also real-timely analyze the factors affecting the products. So, the adjustment oftechnological parameters is more targeted, and shortens adjustment time, and increases efficiency. It {{is no doubt that the}} economic efficiency will increase. The thesis, taking fractional colurnn of fluidized catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) as research target, with the aim of forecasting product quality level of fractional column, establishes quality forecasting model through the method of neural network, and speculates the critical technological parameters that are hard to measure or impossible to measure at all through the technological parameters that are easy to measure. The system first finishes interactive interface between control system and operator with the functions of dynamic display and real-time data acquisition through configuration software DCS (Distributed Control System), which can supervise, control, activate and manage the whole system. Then it will realize product quality forecasting of fractional colurnn through the method of combining utility function based on average level and neural network. Finally it will realize the analysis of factors affecting product quality through the method of combining fuzzy technology and neural network. The thesis, through system configuration and using neural network technology to forecast product quality of fractional colurnn and analyze the factors affecting product quality, combines fuzzy technology and neural network which play their respective advantages to finish the display and control of operation state of fractionation system and realize real-time forecasting and analysis. The online forecasting system of product quality of catalytic cracking fractional colurnn based on the method mentioned above is developed for many small and medium petrochemical enterprises. The aim is to transform the equipments under the present condition of small and medium petrochemical enterprises with no change in the hardware of the original DCS (Distributed Control System) of refining enterprises. Therefore, this system has many advantages such as small investment, short transformation time and easy realization, etc. Currently, this system has been tried on the fluidized catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) in Tianjin First Petrochemical Plant in China. The operating result shows that the value and laboratory value of dry point of car gasoline and <b>solidifying</b> <b>point</b> of diesel fuel forecasted real-timely in this model have better goodness of fit, satisfying the requirements of product quality index. The test result shows that the technical path and method using neural network technology to forecast product quality put forward in the thesis is feasible. ______________________________________________________________________________ MOTS-CLÉS DE L’AUTEUR : Catalytic cracking, Fractional column, Neural networ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. F. A.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Set in Belgium in the 1990 s, Wolvendael (Flemish for Valley of the Wolves) fictionalizes the {{aftermath}} of one of Europe's biggest scandals. Our protagonist, Arjen Desmet, is an aspiring journalist whose life and relationships are beginning to suffer because of his single-minded obsession with getting "the whole story. " Drawing from the tradition of Belgian comics such as Tintin, the whole story, it turns out, is more grotesque and hilarious than we could have anticipated; Arjen Desmet ends up unwittingly above his pay grade as political intrigue, monsters, and comedy convene in this farcical take on horror as a film genre. A screenplay, or film script, is best read as a blueprint for producing a dramatic film. The screenwriter lays the structural and aesthetic foundation by composing the setting, story, pacing, characterization, and visual tone. Only when this blueprint is structurally sound can the director and crew render {{the words on the}} page into a film. Screenplays generally follow a three act structure. Act I should be thought of as the set up; since viewers are more open minded {{at the beginning of a}} film, world building and characterization need to be <b>solidified</b> at this <b>point.</b> The dramatic premise is introduced and by the end of the act, should culminate in an inciting event [...] the catalytic conflict that will drive the rest of the story. Act II addresses the ongoing confrontations and obstacles that pull the protagonist out of his comfort zone, eventually landing him at his lowest point. Act III is typically shorter, since it focuses entirely on the resolution. Sometimes dubbed the "final battle," this act lifts the protagonist out of the mire that is Act II so that he can be confronted by or implicated in the climax of the film before the denouement unfurls. Though it adheres to the traditional three act structure, Wolvendael features two notable idiosyncrasies. Like the bulk of Raymond Carver's stories, it begins after a major conflict and focuses on what goes on behind closed doors. Though the context is not as subtle as a Carver piece, tension is endemic to the script's story world, rendering it unstable from the very beginning in spite of our protagonist's obliviousness. Wolvendael's other quirk comes in its favoring of the anticlimax over the climax. The European infatuation with farce (see Voltaire's Candide) maintains that an anticlimactic ending is no less potent than a climactic one [...] it is simply gratifying for sobering reasons, not redemptive ones. Good examples of successful anticlimaxes occur in Anton Corbijn's A Most Wanted Man and Hayao Miyazaki's animated masterpiece, Spirited Away. Speaking of animation, a two-dimensional rendering of the script could be as, if not more viable than live action since several characters flirt with caricature, sensational and quasi-supernatural events abound, and the script itself was born from a Belgian love for comic art...|$|R
40|$|The Lac des Iles Complex {{contains}} the Roby, Twilight, and High-grade zones, {{which make up}} Canada’s only primary platinum-group element (PGE) ore deposit with a grade of 3 ppm Pd + Pt. The ores have remarkably high Pd/Pt ratios, averaging 7 in the Roby and Twilight zones and even higher, 14, in the High-grade zone. In contrast most PGE-dominated deposits have Pd/Pt ratios of 0. 5 to 3. The Lac des Iles ore zones occur within a small (2 ×y 3. 5 km) concentrically zoned mafic intrusion and are approximately 0. 5 km wide by 1 km long at surface. There are three major rock types present, gabbronorite, metagabbronorite, and chlorite-actinolite schist. The Roby and Twilight zones consist of magmatic breccia of gabbronorite or metagabbronorite, which contains pegmatoidal and varitextured patches. The gabbronorites have adcumulate textures and consist of deformed plagioclase and orthopyroxene with minor interstitial clinopyroxene, biotite, and hornblende. In the metagabbronorites the pyroxenes and hornblende {{have been replaced by}} actinolite and the plagioclase has been partly altered to sericite. In the most altered metagabbronorites the plagioclase has been replaced by chlorite. The High-grade zone occurs between the breccia of the Roby zone and the homogeneous East Gabbro. The main rock type is actinolite-chlorite ± talc schist. Three sulfide assemblages are present: (1) pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite ± pyrite; (2) pentlandite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite; and (3) chalcopyrite, pyrite, and millerite. Assemblage (1) is present in all rock types and shows equilibrium textures in the fresh rocks. Assemblages (2) and (3) are present only in the metagabbronorite and chlorite-actinolite schist and show disequilibrium textures. Pentlandite is an important host for Pd in assemblages (1) and (2), the other important hosts for Pd in these assemblages are Pd tellurides. In assemblage (3) the Pd is found {{in a wide variety of}} platinum-group minerals (PGM); Pd tellurides, Pd sulfides, Pd antinomides, and Pd arsenides. The PGM in assemblages (1) and (2) are found in association with the sulfides, while in assemblage (3) they are found as isolated grains. Whole-rock geochemistry shows that the most of the rocks no matter what their texture or degree of alteration have similar compositions. Most compositions fall on plagioclase-orthopyroxene tie lines. Mantle-normalized patterns show that the rare earth element (REE) and high field strength element (HFSE) concentrations are low (0. 8 − 2 times mantle) and similar. In this flat pattern there are positive Sr, Eu, Pb, and Sc anomalies. These observations are consistent with the rocks being plagioclase-orthopyroxene adcumulates. A small group of metagabbronorite and schist samples show MgO, CaO, and Cr enrichment, indicating the presence of some cumulate olivine, clinopyroxene, and/or chromite. The rocks no matter what their texture or degree of alteration have similar incompatible element ratios, indicating that they all are comagmatic. The low normative clinopyroxene concentrations and the low HFSE content of these rocks suggest that there is very little trapped liquid component present. This observation appears to be in contradiction to the field appearance of the magmatic breccia which indicates the matrix represents a frozen magma. We suggest that the magma chamber was being deformed at the time of intrusion and the fractionated liquid was squeezed out of both the matrix and fragments during this process. The formation of pegmatite and varitextured rocks could have occurred when the magma became fluid saturated and this fluid infiltrated the partially consolidated gabbronorite causing recrystallization. The composition of the varitextured and pegmatiodal rocks is similar to that of the other rocks and thus the fluid did not appreciably change the composition of the recrystallized rocks. Processes that have been considered for forming the ores include: collection by a sulfide liquid from a silicate magma; zone refining of the sulfides during repeated injections of magmas; and collection of the metals by deuteric or hydrothermal fluids. For samples from the Twilight and Roby zones there is a strong correlation between S, Cu, and PGE, indicating that sulfide minerals control the PGE and thus collection by a sulfide liquid could have occurred. However the high Pd/Pt ratio of the ores suggests that the sulfide liquid did not segregate from a primary mafic magma. Possibly, there was a feeder chamber to the Lac des Iles intrusion. The magma in the feeder system became saturated in sulfide liquid and this collected and crystallized in a structural trap between chambers. A fresh injection of S-undersaturated magma from the lower chamber partially melted the sulfides, enriching the magma in S, Cu, Pd, and Au. The Pd-enriched magma was then injected into the Lac des Iles chamber, mixed with the partially consolidated resident magma, and Pd-rich sulfides segregated from it. In the High-grade zone there appears to have been an additionally low temperature process that added Pd, Au, As, and Sb to these rocks. Possibly these elements were added by a fluid that exsolved from the magma in underlying magma chamber and which scavenged the elements from the sulfides formed at depth. The fluid was focussed in the shear zone between the East Gabbro and the Roby zone because most of the Lac des Iles intrusion had <b>solidified</b> at this <b>point...</b>|$|R
