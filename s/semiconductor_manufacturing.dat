5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are {{produced}} from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for nitrocellulose, acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers {{are produced}} from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in <b>semiconductor</b> <b>manufacturing</b> processes, where it is used as a resist solvent).

40|$|Abstract: Although Thailand’s {{electronics}} {{industry has}} been considered as one of strategic sectors, {{the evidence in this}} article shows that it is dominated by midstream and downstream activities. Despite accounting for a quarter of electronics exports, <b>semiconductors</b> <b>manufacturing</b> is confined to low value added activities. The lack of industrial policy has restricted technological upgrading in the industry. Upgrading efforts made by both public and private initiatives have so far failed. The case studies show that firms in Thailand must acquire and develop technological capabilities to stimulate the industry’s transformation from low to high value added activities...|$|R

25|$|Microlithography and {{nanolithography}} refer {{specifically to}} lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 micrometers are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 nanometers are considered nanolithographic. Photolithography {{is one of}} these methods, often applied to <b>semiconductor</b> <b>manufacturing</b> of microchips. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated photomask or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.|$|E
