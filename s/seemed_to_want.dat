5|$|Her {{position}} {{changed the}} following month. She {{had had a}} series of rows with Bamber. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. She told him he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Bamber in her presence, and it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing that woman too. Mugford smashed a mirror, slapped Bamber and he twisted her arm up her back. Three days later she went to the police and changed her statement.|$|E
25|$|Bridge {{also wrote}} and edited many carols, and was {{editor of the}} Westminster Abbey Hymn-Book and the Wesleyan Hymn-Book. Among his shorter works are many songs, both comic and serious. The former were popular, and Bridge commented that he had written {{a good deal of}} serious music, but that nobody <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to hear it.|$|E
25|$|This era saw the {{development}} of the new innovations in roller coasters that included extreme drops and speeds to thrill the riders. By the end of the First World War, people <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> an even more exciting entertainment, a need met by roller coasters. Although {{the development}} of the automobile provided people with more options for satisfying their entertainment needs, the amusement parks after the war continued to be successful, while urban amusement parks saw declining attendance. The 1920s is more properly known as the Golden Age of roller coasters, being the decade of frenetic building for these rides.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of time-sharing systems {{led to a}} number of problems. One was that users, particularly at universities where the systems were being developed, <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to hack the system to get more CPU time. For this reason, security and access control became a major focus of the Multics project in 1965. Another ongoing issue was properly handling computing resources: users spent most of their time staring at the terminal and thinking about what to input instead of actually using the resources of the computer, and a time-sharing system should give the CPU time to an active user during these periods. Finally, the systems typically offered a memory hierarchy several layers deep, and partitioning this expensive resource led to major developments in virtual memory systems.|$|E
500|$|Many years later, {{another of}} his followers, Virginia Downsborough, {{recalled}} that during the mid-1960s he [...] "talked a lot about Sara Northrup and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> {{to make sure that}} I knew he had never married her. I didn't know why it was so important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't have cared less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. When he talked about his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them." [...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E
500|$|Newspapers {{stressed}} {{different aspects}} of Bakke, often reflecting their political ideology. The conservative Chicago Sun-Times bannered Bakke's admission in its headline, while noting that the court had permitted affirmative action under some circumstances. The Washington Post, a liberal newspaper, began its headline in larger-than-normal type, [...] "Affirmative Action Upheld" [...] before going on {{to note that the}} court had admitted Bakke and curbed quotas. The Wall Street Journal, in a headline, deemed Bakke [...] "The Decision Everybody Won". According to Oxford University Chair of Jurisprudence Ronald Dworkin, the court's decision [...] "was received by the press and much of the public with great relief, as an act of judicial statesmanship that gave to each party in the national debate what it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> most".|$|E

Has it been fair thus far?" [...] Detractors began to liken him to [...] "the cranky uncle who lives in the attic," [...] or [...] "the angry old guy that just <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to become angrier." [...] Berkeley political scientist David Terr found that moderator George Stephanopoulos directed roughly five percent of his questions to Gravel; in a poll asking who did the best in the debate, Gravel placed seventh among the eight candidates. National opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination continued to show Gravel with one percent or zero percent numbers. By the end of the third-quarter 2007, Gravel had about $17,500 in cash on hand, had collected a total of about $380,000 so far during the 2008 election cycle, and was continuing to run a threadbare campaign with minimal staff.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} the summer of 1979 and {{continued}} periodically through November, with the production team shooting in several intervals for a few days each. A number of prominent gay activists, including Armistead Maupin, Cleve Jones and Sally Gearhart, assisted Crile and Diekhaus with the project, although Gearhart and fellow activist Del Martin began questioning their motives, coming to believe the network [...] "was out to do a hatchet job". Crile interviewed Gearhart for the piece but by the date of her interview she was so mistrustful of the producers that she took measures to try to prevent herself from being misrepresented. [...] "I would lift my voice at a certain point so what I said could not be cut. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> me to vilify Diane (sic) Feinstein in some way and set her in opposition to the gay community....During one of the breaks I told him that I didn't feel good about it...I felt I had been twisted and manipulated." [...] Ultimately Gearhart's interview was cut entirely, for which she was [...] "ecstatic". When Crile began his interview with then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein by asking [...] "How {{does it feel to be}} the mayor of Sodom and Gomorrah?" [...] Feinstein threw him and his crew out of her office.|$|E
2500|$|Clarke {{wrote an}} op-ed for the Washington Post on May 31, 2009 harshly {{critical}} of other Bush administration officials, entitled [...] "The Trauma of 9/11 Is No Excuse". Clarke {{wrote that he}} had little sympathy for his fellow officials who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to use the excuse of being traumatized, and caught unaware by Al-Qaeda's attacks on the USA, because their being caught unaware was due to their ignoring clear reports a major attack on U.S. soil was imminent. Clarke particularly singled out former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice.|$|E

2500|$|Commenting on Brooks' {{return to}} his native state of Oklahoma, Brandy McDonnell of The Oklahoman remarked [...] "the frenzied {{audience}} nearly drowned out Brooks' stellar band on several occasions." [...] She later stated, [...] " [...] talent and zeal as an entertainer remain unmatched." [...] Also following a concert in the tour's second leg, Francie Swidler of The Denver Post stated, [...] "Brooks <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to make everyone in the arena to feel special, fan or not", noting that Brooks [...] "made it all look effortless". After Brooks' 8-concert stint in Houston, Chris Gray of the Houston Press summarized the concert by saying, [...] "Combine raw adrenaline, effortless showmanship, grade-A musical smarts, flawless execution, and enough heart to power the CenterPoint substation {{across the street from}} Toyota Center, and youâ€™ve got a performer for whom there's no such thing as too much hype." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for Halfway to Sanity began in early 1987 at Intergalactic Studios in New York City, described by Rey as [...] "a dingy place in midtown." [...] For the recording process, drums, guitars, and bass were all recorded {{earlier in the}} afternoon, whereas the vocal track was always recorded {{later in the evening}} with the instrumentals already played. Rey explained that they did this because [...] "it was quicker to learn songs without any vocal, so they did." [...] Joey, however, wanted to work out [...] "how to phrase his singing" [...] and was not a fan of this method of recording. Johnny insisted that no one involved with the album would listen to Rey, not letting him make decisions that needed to made by him as the album's producer. He pointed out that Joey and Richie made it hard for the producer because they wanted to remix or change tracks. Richie, however, stated that Johnny, along with their manager Gary Kurfirst, made the album process difficult by wanting the band to spend as little money possible. He explained that he himself wanted to be more radio-friendly and promote more so they might have a hit album, but Johnny and Kurfirst didn't think it would make a difference. Richie would later recall: [...] "Why would you not want an album to be as successful as it could be? Gary Kurfirst <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>want</b> to keep the Ramones an underground band, I guess his thinking was, he'd profit more." ...|$|E
