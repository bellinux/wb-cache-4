40|$|Whales receive {{underwater}} sounds {{through a}} fundamentally different mechanism than their close terrestrial relatives. Instead of hearing through the ear canal, cetaceans hear through specialized fatty tissues {{leading to an}} evolutionarily novel feature: an acoustic funnel located anterior to the tympanic aperture. We traced the ontogenetic development of this feature in 56 fetal specimens from 10 different families of toothed (odontocete) and baleen (mysticete) whales, using X-ray computed tomography. We also charted ear ossification patterns through ontogeny to understand the impact of heterochronic developmental processes. We determined that the acoustic funnel arises from a prominent V-shaped structure established early in ontogeny, formed by the malleus and the goniale. In odontocetes, this V-formation develops into a cone-shaped funnel facing anteriorly, directly into intramandibular acoustic fats, which is likely functionally linked to the anterior orientation of <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> in echolocation. In contrast, the acoustic funnel in balaenopterids rotates laterally, later in fetal development, consistent with a lateral <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> pathway. Balaenids and several fossil mysticetes retain a somewhat anteriorly oriented acoustic funnel in the mature condition, indicating that a lateral <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> pathway in balaenopterids may be a recent evolutionary innovation linked to specialized feeding modes, such as lunge-feeding...|$|R

5000|$|The {{sinking of}} [...] in 1912 spurred the Canadian {{inventor}} Reginald Fessenden (1866-1932) {{to begin work}} on a long-distance underwater <b>sound</b> transmission and <b>reception</b> <b>system</b> that could detect hazards {{in the path of}} a ship. This led to the invention of the Fessenden oscillator, an electro-acoustic transducer which by 1914 had a proven ability to transmit and receive sound at a distance of 31 miles across Massachusetts Bay and to detect an iceberg ahead of a ship at a range of two miles by bouncing sound off it and detecting the echo, as well as an occasional ability to detect the reflection of sound off the ocean bottom. Further impetus to developing practical applications of underwater acoustics came from World War I, which prompted the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and United States Army Coast Artillery Corps to experiment with sound as a means of detecting submerged submarines. In postwar experiments, the Coast Artillery Corps's Subaqueous Sound Ranging Section conducted experiments in shallow water in Vineyard Sound off Massachusetts in which it detonated explosive charges underwater at the ends of established baselines and measured the amount of time it took for the sound to arrive at hydrophones at the other ends of the baselines in order to establish very accurate measurements of the speed of sound through water. And in 1923, the Submarine Signal Company improved upon its underwater signaling devices by equipping them with radio transmitters that sent signals both to identify the particular device and to indicate to approaching ships that it would generate an acoustic signal at a specific time interval after it sent the radio signal, allowing ships to identify the specific navigational aid they were approaching and {{to take advantage of a}} one-way ranging capability that let their crews determine their direction and distance from the navigational aid.|$|R

40|$|Odontocetes use {{active sonar}} for echolocation, {{navigation}} and socialisation. Their sonar is characterised by narrow transmission and reception directivity patterns, over {{a variety of}} ranges and frequencies. Typical echolocation clicks of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) last between 50 - 200 mu s, with a broad frequency range of similar to 100 - 170 kHz depending on circumstances. These characteristics are very attractive {{for the design of}} bio-inspired sonars, but the actual mechanisms of <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> are not well understood. Physiological and behavioural evidence suggests that dolphins hear the echoes of their high-frequency clicks through their lower jaws. The angular precision predicted by this theory is however much less than dolphins have been observed to display. A recent hypothesis is that the teeth also play a part in <b>sound</b> <b>reception,</b> acting as a passive beam-forming structure. This paper presents 2 -D models of acoustic propagation in a dolphin jaw, based on real measurements, and shows the importance of multiple scattering between teeth, potential masking effects, and the match between theoretical directivity and that observed in the field. We use these results to look at the implications for realistic biosonar design...|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanism}} of {{sensorineural hearing loss}} in otosclerosis is less well understood. It may resultfrom direct injury to the cochlea and spiral ligament from the lytic process or from release of proteolytic enzymes into the cochlea. There are certainly a few well documented instances of sclerotic lesions directly obliterating sensory structures within the cochlea and spiral ligament, which have been photographed and reported post-mortem. Other supporting data includes a consistent loss of cochlear hair cells in patients with otosclerosis; these cells being the chief sensory organs of <b>sound</b> <b>reception.</b> A suggested mechanism {{for this is the}} release of hydrolytic enzymes into the inner ear structures by the spongiotic lesions.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{concerns about}} the effects of anthropogenic noise on baleen whales (suborder Mysticeti), we lack basic information about their auditory physiology for comprehensive risk assessments. Hearing ranges and sensitivities could be measured if customized equipment and methods were developed based on how baleen whales receive <b>sound.</b> However, <b>sound</b> <b>reception</b> pathways in baleen whales are currently unknown. This thesis presents an integrative approach to understanding hearing in baleen whales through dissections, biomedical imaging, biochemical analyses, and modeling sound propagation through a whale head using the Finite Element Method (FEM). We focused on the minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) because {{it is one of the}} smallest and most abundant mysticete species, reducing logistical difficulties for dissections and experiments. We discovered a large, well-formed fat body extending from the blubber region to the ears and contacting the ossicles. Although odontocetes, or toothed whales, are thought to use specialized "acoustic fats" for <b>sound</b> <b>reception,</b> no such tissues had been described for mysticetes to date. Our study indicates that the basic morphology and biochemical composition of the minke whale "ear fats" are very different from those of odontocete acoustic fats. However, the odontocete and mysticete fatty tissues share some characteristics, such as being conserved even during starvation, containing fewer dietary signals compared to blubber, and having well-defined attachments to the tympano-periotic complex, which houses the middle and inner ears. FE models of the whale head indicated that the ear fats caused a slight increase in the total pressure magnitude by the ears, and this focusing effect could be attributed to the low density and low sound speed of the ear fats in the models. Fatty tissues are known to have lower densities and sound speeds than other types of soft tissues, which may explain why they are an important component of the auditory system of odontocetes, and perhaps mysticete cetaceans as well. In an aquatic habitat where the pinna and air-filled ear canal are no longer effective at collecting and focusing so'und towards the ears, we propose that both odontocete and mysticete cetaceans have incorporated fatty tissues into their auditory <b>systems</b> for underwater <b>sound</b> <b>reception.</b> by Maya Yamato.

40|$|The {{arrival of}} more than one million migrants, many of them refugees, has proved a major test for the European Union. Although {{international}} relief and monitoring agencies have been critical of makeshift camps in Calais and Eidomeni where infectious disease and overcrowding present major health risks, few have examined the nature of the official <b>reception</b> <b>system</b> and its impact on health delivery. Drawing upon research findings from an Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded project, this article considers the physical and mental health of asylum-seekers in transit and analyses how the closure of borders has engendered health risks for populations in recognised reception centres in Sicily and in Greece. Data gathered by means of a survey administered in Greece (300) and in Sicily (400), and complemented by in-depth interviews with migrants (45) and key informants (50) including representatives of government offices, humanitarian and relief agencies, NGOs and activist organisations, are presented to offer an analysis of the <b>reception</b> <b>systems</b> in the two frontline states. We note that medical provision varies significantly from one centre to another and that centre managers {{play a critical role in}} the transmission of vital information. A key finding is that, given such disparity, the criteria used by the UNHCR to grade health services reception do not address the substantive issue that prevent refugees from accessing health services, even when provided on site. Health provision is not as recorded in UNHCR reporting but rather there are critical gaps between provision, awareness, and access for refugees in <b>reception</b> <b>systems</b> in Sicily and in Greece.
