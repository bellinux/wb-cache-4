5000|$|On April 20, 2012, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} 17 [...] "Solar Energy Zones" [...] {{with the}} best potential for priority solar development. Three of those are in Utah.

5000|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} the in situ production of oxygen, hydrogen and CO from the martian hematite deposits via a two-step thermochemical /H2O splitting process,and specifically in the magnetite/wustite redox cycle. [...] Although thermolysis is the most direct, one-step process for splitting molecules, it is neither practical nor efficient {{in the case of}} either H2O or CO2. This is because the process requires a very high temperature (> 2500 C) to achieve a meaningful dissociation fraction. This poses problems in finding suitable reactor materials, losses due to vigorous product recombination, and excessive aperture radiation losses when concentrated solar heat is used. The magnetite/wustite redox cycle was first proposed for <b>solar</b> <b>application</b> on earth by Nakamura, {{and was one of the}} first used for solar-driven two-step water splitting. In this cycle, water reacts with wustite (FeO) to form magnetite (Fe3O4) and hydrogen. The summarized reactions in this two-step splitting process are as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|For {{the large}} and {{increasing}} rural population in the developing countries, decentralized <b>solar</b> <b>applications</b> could be relevant. However, new solar technologies being developed in the laboratories presently have to ultimately be acceptable in the field conditions. The conditions which have to be satisfied before the <b>solar</b> <b>applications</b> cold be acceptable are discussed. The solar pump is examined in detail in particular due to the interest expressed by many developing countries in this specific application. A comparative techno-economic analysis is carried out for solar pumps and diesel pumps which considered escalation of the diesel price and factors related to climate, geography, locale, social, and institutional environment for two types of uses namely for drinking water and for irrigation. It seems unlikely that a solar pump could compete with the diesel engine before the costs are brought down {{by a factor of}} 20 - 50 for irrigation purposes. However, for obtaining the drinking water the cost reduction required is by a factor less than 10 than currently charged for the prototypes. Although specific example of India is taken the matters are relevant to most developing countries. The issues discussed for the case of a solar pump are also relevant to other <b>solar</b> <b>applications</b> used only for seasonal purposes since the capital costs are high and operating diesel pumps during the season would be cheaper for several decades...|$|R
