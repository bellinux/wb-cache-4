In 1934, Gordon Gibson, Sr. {{and his brother}} were <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> <b>to</b> discover Malahat up for sale for only $2,500 that they bought her on the spot. She {{was used as a}} self-propelled log barge, carrying Sitka spruce from the Queen Charlotte Islands to the booming ground at the Powell River in Teakerne Arm in Desolation Sound. Because the Malahat required a crew of fifteen, one of the challenges for a local lumbering operation was assembling a crew with experience in seamanship as well as logging.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Deaf Havana {{spent a lot of time}} touring as a support band; they would not play a {{headline}} tour until April 2012, 5 months after {{the release of}} Fools and Worthless Liars. They began by supporting Skindred on their headline tour across Europe, followed by acting as support, alongside Tek-One, to Architects on their UK tour. Speaking before their April 2012 headline tour, which featured The Swellers and The Dangerous Summer as support, James Veck-Gilodi said: 'We are <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> <b>to</b> finally get out on the road and headline again. We've spent the last year or so writing and recording the album and been lucky enough to have some amazing support shows... but to be able to go out and play songs from Fools and Worthless Liars and headline is going to be great'. The band are due to play another headline tour, at larger venues, in November 2012. Support will come from There For Tomorrow and Canterbury. Deaf Havana had been due to travel to the USA to support There For Tomorrow in September 2012, but due to a problem with the arrival of their visas, this did not take place.|$|E

500|$|Swift desired for Caillat to sing {{background}} vocals {{but in a}} loud manner, {{enough for}} audiences to recognize who sang backup. Originally Swift and Caillat were only to harmonize in the chorus, but as Caillat recorded, Swift decided to include her voice more throughout the track because of how impressed she was.

500|$|... "Five Short Graybles" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, and Cole Sanchez, from a story {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, and Kent Osborne. The episode {{was directed by}} Larry Leichliter. This was the first episode that Page worked on for the series; he was <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> <b>to</b> be working on the series that after he finished the storyboard, he traveled to Hawaii as a personal reward. The episode can trace its genesis to a short, but humorous scene involving a high five that Ward {{had been forced to}} cut from an episode. Ward was unhappy about the edit, and later jokingly said via his Twitter that he would make an episode entirely about high-fives. Although Ward was being facetious, the idea of using a high five as an overarching plot point was then used in [...] "Five Short Graybles".|$|E

Feldmann's [...] "agenda was to have an album that was palatable for a generation of ADD kids." [...] The band members and Feldmann felt a breakthrough in direction with the song [...] "Cynical", which they immediately chose as the opening song on the album. According to Hoppus, the band recorded a total of nearly 50 songs. By mid-February, the album was [...] "70–80%" [...] complete, according to Barker, and work was reportedly completed in early March 2016. By the end of March, the group were still narrowing down the songs that would be present on the album. The trio posted their progress via their respective social media accounts during the recording, in the form of Snapchat and Instagram clips. All parties seemed satisfied with the record.

40|$|The work of Donald Preziosi {{represents}} one of the most sustained and often brilliant attempts to betray the modern discipline of art history by exposing its skillful shell game: precisely how and why it substitutes artifice, poetry, and representational schemes for putative facticity and objectivity (that desirous and yet ever elusive Kunstwissenschaft that art historians prattle on about). This attempt is inseparable from a sinuous, witty, involutive writing style that meanders between steely insight and coy suggestions of how art history could be performed otherwise. Preziosi’s writes art history. In doing so he betrays its disciplinary desires. It is this event of betrayal that has made his work <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>to</b> some, <b>so</b> troubling to others...|$|R
60|$|To {{tell the}} truth, Alvina herself {{was a little}} {{repelled}} by the man's love-making. She found him fascinating, but a trifle repulsive. And she was not sure whether she hated the repulsive element, or whether she rather gloried in it. She kept her look of arch, half-derisive recklessness, which was so unbearably painful to Miss Frost, and <b>so</b> <b>exciting</b> <b>to</b> the dark little man. It was a strange look in a refined, really virgin girl--oddly sinister. And her voice had a curious bronze-like resonance that acted straight on the nerves of her hearers: unpleasantly on most English nerves, but like fire on the different susceptibilities of the young man--the darkie, as people called him.|$|R
500|$|Fatboy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created for}} the first series of the EastEnders online spin-off EastEnders: E20 who also appear in the main show, along with ZsaZsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from E20, was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> <b>to</b> be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been on in my house for as long as I have been alive. I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. I love being part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the truth to that character from the knowledge I have.

500|$|Mucho Macho Man {{was given}} his basic start under saddle by Carole and John Rio. Still tall and lanky, {{he was sent}} to Bill White for race training, with Carole telling the trainer, [...] "physically this horse is late, but mentally he's way ahead." [...] Throughout his racing career, Mucho Macho Man has been {{described}} as a generally calm horse with a good temperament, a [...] "happy" [...] horse who [...] "likes his job", [...] "businesslike" [...] and easy to rate. However, he disliked being whipped, and was notorious for his dislike of wet conditions, performing poorly when asked to run in the mud; his worst races were on sloppy tracks. [...] Though viewed as [...] "laid back", he was generally very fast out of the starting gate, which caused him problems twice in his three-year-old season when he tore off a front horseshoe by stepping on his own front heels with his hind feet. [...] Ritvo said [...] "I think he's <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> <b>to</b> get out of the gate that he's springing before his front feet are gone." [...] His quickness out of the gate, described by one of his jockeys as akin to that of a Quarter Horse, became an asset once he matured. [...] Steve Haskin noted that the horse was undefeated whenever he had the lead by the eighth pole but had never won when he did not.|$|E
500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but I managed to do them. I was <b>so</b> <b>excited</b> <b>to</b> get to the top... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E

For this study, more than 200 professional hockey fans were interviewed and observed over a two-month period during the 2013 - 14 season. The specific aim of this research was to determine which hockey plays fans report as the most <b>exciting</b> <b>to</b> them, and what draws people to the games. Additional insights about hockey’s excitement were studied in order to provide deeper meaning of fans’ interest in and loyalty to the game. Preliminary data analysis reveals that fights, big hits, and overtime play rank among the most <b>exciting</b> <b>to</b> fans. Additional findings pertaining to crowd noise—through the use of seismometers—will also be presented, and implications for future research drawn...|$|R

Laemmle managed to lure William Ranous, one of Vitagraph's best directors, over to IMP. Ranous introduced Laemmle to Lawrence and Solter, and they began to work together. Lawrence and Solter worked for IMP for eleven months, making fifty films. After this, they went on vacation in Europe.|$|E
