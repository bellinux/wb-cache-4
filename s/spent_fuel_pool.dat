25|$|On December 22, 2014, TEPCO crews {{completed}} {{the removal of}} all fuel assemblies from the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> of reactor 4. 1331 spent fuel assemblies were moved to the ground-level common <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool,</b> and 204 unused fuel assemblies were moved to the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> of reactor 6 (Unit 4 was out of service for refueling {{at the time of}} the 2011 accident, so the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> contained a number of unused new fuel assemblies).|$|E
25|$|On 22 December 2014, Tepco crews {{completed}} {{the removal of}} all fuel assemblies, and the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> of Reactor 4 no longer contained any stored fuel rods.

25|$|From 31 March, {{additional}} {{sea water}} {{was added to}} the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool,</b> initially by using a concrete pump. Fresh water was used from 14 May.

25|$|Indian Point stores used {{fuel rods}} in two <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> at the facility. The <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> at Indian Point are not stored under a {{containment}} dome like the reactor, but rather they are contained within an indoor 40-foot-deep pool and submerged under 27 feet of water. Water {{is a natural}} and effective barrier to radiation. The <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> at Indian Point are set in bedrock and are constructed of concrete walls that are four to six feet wide, with a quarter-inch thick stainless steel inner liner. The pools each have multiple redundant backup cooling systems.|$|R

25|$|Reactor 4 was not {{operating}} when the earthquake struck. All fuel rods from Unit 4 had {{been transferred to}} the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> on an upper floor of the reactor building prior to the tsunami. On 15 March, an explosion damaged the fourth floor rooftop area of Unit 4, creating two large holes in a wall of the outer building. It was reported that water in the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> might be boiling. Radiation inside the Unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there for long periods. Visual inspection of the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> on 30 April revealed no significant damage to the rods. A radiochemical examination of the pond water confirmed that little of the fuel had been damaged.|$|E
25|$|Officials are {{reported}} to have considered insertion or targeted aerial dropping of boric acid, boronated plastic beads or boron carbide pellets into the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> to absorb neutrons. France flew 95 tonnes of boron to Japan on 17 March 2011 and the US has provided 9 tons. Neutron absorbing boric acid has been add to water injected into the reactor cores, but is unclear if boron was included with the spraying of <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> (SFP)s.|$|R

2500|$|Failure of {{emergency}} power following the tsunami resulted in loss of coolant from each reactor, hydrogen explosions damaging the reactor buildings, and water draining from open-air <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 8 April 2011, a small 3.8 liter leak of {{radioactive}} water spilled from <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> holding <b>fuel</b> rods following an aftershock from the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake.|$|R
25|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{generate electricity}} {{by using the}} heat of the fission reaction to produce steam, which is used to drive turbines in order to generate electricity. When the reactor stops operating, the radioactive decay of unstable isotopes in the fuel continues to generate heat (decay heat) for a time, and so require continued cooling. Initially this decay heat amounts to approximately 6.5% of the amount produced by fission, decreasing over several days before reaching shutdown levels. Afterwards, spent fuel rods typically require several years in a <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> before they can be safely transferred to dry cask storage vessels. The decay heat in the Unit 4 <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> had the capacity to boil about 70 metric tons of water per day.|$|E
25|$|On 8 November workers did enter reactor-building no. 4, and {{inspected}} {{the place to}} {{determine the cause of}} the hydrogen-blast on 15 March 2011. They found the 5th floor more severely damaged compared with the 4th floor, where the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> was located. The fuel itself was found undamaged. The workers also found a severely damaged air conditioning duct on floor 5. These findings did not support earlier assumptions that the hydrogen in the blast originated from the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> of reactor 4, but instead proved that the explosion was caused by hydrogen from the number 3 reactor, after the valves were opened. The hydrogen reached the fifth floor of reactor building 4 through the aforementioned damaged air conditioning duct.|$|E
25|$|Japan's {{nuclear safety}} agency NISA {{reported}} two holes, each 8 meters square, or 64 m² (690 sq ft), {{in a wall}} of the outer building of Unit 4 after the explosion. At 17:48 {{it was reported that}} water in the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> might be boiling. By 21:13 on 15 March, radiation inside the Unit 4 control room prevented workers from staying there permanently. Seventy staff remained at the plant, while 800 had been evacuated. By 22:30, TEPCO was reportedly unable to pour water into the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool.</b> By 22:50, the company was considering using helicopters to drop water, but this was postponed because of concerns over safety and effectiveness, and the use of high-pressure fire hoses was considered instead.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a {{prolonged}} interruption of cooling due to emergency situations, {{the water in the}} <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> may boil off, possibly resulting in radioactive elements being released into the atmosphere.|$|R
50|$|Because {{they are}} hot both radioactively and thermally, {{this is done}} via cranes and under water. For this reason the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> storage <b>pools</b> are above the reactor in typical installations. They are {{shielded}} by water several times their height, and stored in rigid arrays in which their geometry is controlled to avoid criticality. In the Fukushima reactor incident this became problematic because water was lost from one or more <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> and the earthquake could have altered the geometry. The fact that the fuel rods' cladding is a zirconium alloy was also problematic since this element can react with steam at extreme temperatures to produce hydrogen, which can ignite with oxygen in the air. Normally the fuel rods are kept sufficiently cool in the reactor and <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> {{that this is not}} a concern, and the cladding remains intact for the life of the rod.|$|R

25|$|On 10 August, the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> was {{switched}} from the water-injection system – that functioned some 5 months – to a circulatory cooling system. For {{the first time}} since the 11 March disaster, all four damaged reactors at the plant were using circulatory cooling systems with heat-exchangers.|$|E
25|$|On 28 May, the {{temporary}} seawater cooling pump for Reactor 5 stopped, which {{was discovered by}} TEPCO at 21 local time. At that time, {{the temperature in the}} reactor was 68°C, and in the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> 41°C. At 11 in the morning the following day the temperatures had risen to 92.2°C and 45.7°C. Cooling was restored at 12:49.|$|E
25|$|Dry cask storage {{typically}} involves taking {{waste from}} a <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> and sealing it (along with an inert gas) in a steel cylinder, which {{is placed in}} a concrete cylinder which acts as a radiation shield. It is a relatively inexpensive method which can be done at a central facility or adjacent to the source reactor. The waste can be easily retrieved for reprocessing.|$|E

2500|$|Cherenkov {{radiation}} {{is used to}} detect high-energy charged particles. In pool-type nuclear reactors, beta particles (high-energy electrons) are released as the fission products decay.

This phenomenon is used to verify the presence of <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> in <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> for nuclear safeguards purposes [...]|$|R
25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} {{is only part}} of the {{life-cycle}} for nuclear power. The process starts with mining (see Uranium mining). Uranium mines are underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mines. In any case, the uranium ore is extracted, usually converted into a stable and compact form such as yellowcake, and then transported to a processing facility. Here, the yellowcake is converted to uranium hexafluoride, which is then enriched using various techniques. At this point, the enriched uranium, containing more than the natural 0.7% U-235, is used to make rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular reactor that the fuel is destined for. The fuel rods will spend about 3 operational cycles (typically 6 years total now) inside the reactor, generally until about 3% of their uranium has been fissioned, then they will be moved to a <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> where the short lived isotopes generated by fission can decay away. After about 5 years in a <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> the spent fuel is radioactively and thermally cool enough to handle, and it can be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Entergy workers while digging {{discovered}} a small leak in a <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool.</b> Water containing tritium and strontium-90 was leaking {{through a crack}} in the pool building and then finding its way into the nearby Hudson River. Workers were able to keep the spent fuel rods safely covered despite the leak. On March 22, 2006 The New York Times also reported finding radioactive nickel-63 and strontium in groundwater on site.|$|E
25|$|Initially, it {{was thought}} that some water (estimated to be about 1.5L) from the <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> leaked into the Sea of Japan {{as a result of the}} quake. Later, more {{detailed}} reports confirmed a number of releases, though most of them were far less active than common natural radiation sources. According to the NISA, this was the first time a release of radioactive material happened as a result of an earthquake.|$|E
40|$|The natural {{catastrophe}} at Fukushima Dai-ichi 2011 enlightened the nuclear community. This master thesis reveals the non-negligible risks regarding {{the short term}} storage of <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel.</b> The thesis has also investigated {{the possibility of using}} natural circulation of air in a passive safety system to cool the <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>pools.</b> The results where conclusive: The temperature difference between the heated air and ambient air is far too low for natural circulation of air to remove any significant amount of heat from the <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>pool</b> in a worst case scenario. Air, as with any gas, has too low density and a specific heat too low to be able to remove the heat generated by <b>spent</b> nuclear <b>fuel</b> shortly after it has been removed from the reactor core. The author does not deny the possibility of slightly prolonging the boiling with other designs. The author does however suggest other possibilities to prolong cooling with the conclusion that large enough <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> would constitute the simplest solution...|$|R
25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant {{comprised}} six separate {{boiling water}} reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE) and {{maintained by the}} Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). At {{the time of the}} Tōhoku earthquake on 11 March 2011, Reactors 4, 5, and 6 were shut down in preparation for re-fueling. However, their <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> still required cooling.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{covers the}} application of heat accumulation systems in nuclear power engineering, namely in nuclear power plants. It is mainly a case of passive emergency systems, whose task is to accumulate the heat produced in the reactor’s active zone and in <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> during DBA (design-basis accidents) or beyond DBA. A particular example of heat accumulation is steam condensation after LOCA (loss of coolant accident). The primary circuit steam leakage increases containment pressure {{and has to be}} decreased by the steam condensation. This thesis deals with a theoretical substitute for ice condensers, which are used as a passive safety measure in some nuclear power plants. The substitute involves a choice of an alternative material, whose melting temperature (for heat accumulation) is closer to nuclear power plant operating temperatures. The other part of the dissertation discusses heat accumulation in <b>spent</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pools</b> in case of all cooling systems failure...|$|R
