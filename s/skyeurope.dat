5000|$|While {{attempting}} to hasten <b>SkyEurope's</b> demise in June 2009, Wizz Air claimed {{it had been}} [...] "profitable for several years". However, as a private company it {{is not required to}} publish its financial accounts - annual reports are still available. In November 2009, it emerged that Wizz Air was significantly loss-making and had never made a profit while delaying the pay-back of €32 million of debt by five years. Losses since commencing operations total €78 million, which, in 2009, fueled suggestions that the airline would file for bankruptcy. Since then Wizz Air reported profits in 2012, in 2013, in 2014 and in 2015. Wizz Air has the second lowest CASK (cost per available seat km) among European airlines.|$|R

At 30 September 2008, the Company failed to comply with stipulated financial covenants, such as liquidity and net worth thresholds. As a result, an event of default would allow lessors to terminate the leases with immediate effect and either claim damages and/or require immediate redelivery of the aircraft. On 24 November 2008, <b>SkyEurope</b> received a default notice from GECAS, {{as a result of}} late lease payments. On 9 January 2009, GECAS terminated the lease of six aircraft and ordered <b>SkyEurope</b> to immediately return the 737s. On that day, several <b>SkyEurope</b> flights were delayed up to seven hours. Three additional aircraft were returned to the lessor on 5 January 2009.|$|E

50|$|<b>SkyEurope</b> Airlines was a {{low-cost}} airline headquartered in Bratislava, with its main base at M. R. Štefánik Airport (BTS) in Bratislava, Slovakia, and another base in Prague. The carrier {{filed for bankruptcy}} on 31 August 2009 and suspended all flights on 1 September 2009. The airline operated short-haul scheduled and charter passenger services.|$|E
50|$|In June 2009, in {{an effort}} to avoid bankruptcy, <b>SkyEurope</b> {{announced}} a restructuring of the company and received bankruptcy protection from the Slovak courts (valid in the whole European Union). However, this failed and on 1 September 2009, the airline went into bankruptcy. In March 2010 liabilities were estimated up to 180 million Euro and assets less than 6 million Euro (including 0,5 million of cash).|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{passengers}} served at Bratislava Airport decreased temporarily in the early 1990s due to competition from the nearby Vienna International Airport (which is only 55 km away from Bratislava Airport), but passenger numbers have been quickly increasing since. In 2005, the airport served 1,326,493 passengers; and in 2008, 2,218,545 passengers. Nevertheless, due to the economic downturn {{and the collapse of}} Slovak Airlines, <b>SkyEurope</b> Airlines, Air Slovakia and Seagle Air, the {{number of passengers}} has declined to just over 1,4 million in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Each {{operator}} of a scheduled or charter flight uses an airline call sign when communicating with airports or {{air traffic control}} centres. Most of these call-signs are derived from the airline's trade name, but for reasons of history, marketing, or the need to reduce ambiguity in spoken English (so that pilots do not mistakenly make navigational decisions based on instructions issued to a different aircraft), some airlines and air forces use call-signs less obviously connected with their trading name. For example, British Airways uses a Speedbird call-sign, named after the logo of its predecessor, BOAC, while <b>SkyEurope</b> used Relax.|$|E
50|$|<b>SkyEurope</b> was {{established}} in November 2001 and started operations on 13 February 2002 (domestic flight Bratislava-Kosice operated with 30 seat turboprop Embraer 120 ER Brasília). It was founded by Alain Skowronek (Chairman) and Christian Mandl (Chief Executive) and financed by EBRD, ABN AMRO and EU funds. Although some criticized the decision to base an airline in Bratislava, Mandl saw {{the effect that the}} low cost carriers were having in Western Europe and envisioned it going a step further with a low-cost carrier in a low cost country. Mandl and Skowronek were aware of the catchment area of Bratislava Airport with the airport being located within a one-hour drive of Vienna, Brno and Győr and a catchment area of four countries: (Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} factors {{influencing}} {{the profitability of}} European budget airlines through {{a detailed analysis of}} three airlines: Ryanair, EasyJet and <b>SkyEurope.</b> It begins by defining budget airlines and examining their origins in Europe. It then looks at previous studies that determine factors that influence the rate of return in aviation. It then undertakes a detailed analysis of the airlines' performance from 2000 to 2008. The study concludes by identifying the factors that influence profitability in this industry. They are giving employees stock options, discouraging unions, outsourcing or relocating jobs to countries with lower labor costs, fuel hedging, adopting more fuel-efficient aircraft, outsourcing maintenance to countries with lower labor costs, improving management, a clear cut business strategy, a high load factor, the ability to generate ancillary revenue, size, scale and first mover advantage...|$|E
