40|$|In this paper, {{the gaseous}} {{desiliconization}} during slagging by limestone and lime in a Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) were studied by thermodynamic analysis. The {{results showed that}} part of the silicon in molten iron could volatilize into SiO in both slagging modes, but by using different methods. In the limestone <b>slagging</b> <b>mode,</b> CO 2 from limestone could massively oxidize the silicon in molten iron into gaseous SiO in the hotspot zone. In the lime <b>slagging</b> <b>mode,</b> SiO can be reduced from SiO 2 in slag. Both methods are dependent on the hotspot zone. The SiO amount generated from the former method is larger than the latter is...|$|E
40|$|To {{allow the}} future use of coal for power {{generation}} {{a very low}} level of emissions is required, as expected in well-designed IGCC gasification power plants. This study focuses on an entrained-flow gasifier unit operated in <b>slagging</b> <b>mode,</b> where the conversion of coal into syn-gas occurs together with the separation of mineral ashes that experience a molten state into the gasifier due to the high operating temperatures. These two processes need to be both carefully controlled to achieve high gasification efficiencies: flow configurations promoting the centrifugal motion of particles enhance the separation of ashes, {{but at the same}} time unburnt char particles can in this way be transferred to the gasifier’s walls covered by a flowing molten slag layer possibly layered by previously impacted char particles. As highlighted in previous studies of this research group, different interaction mechanisms may establish upon impact of char/ash particles with the slag layer. Entrapment of char particles into the slag leads to a decrease in the particle burn-off degree, while segregation of char particles into a “dense-dispersed phase” upon interaction with other particles layered onto the slag phase can enhance the overall particle residence time and, thus, the conversion efficiency. Adopting numerical simulations, it has been shown that the occurrence of desired segregation phenomena is possible for both unconverted (non-sticky char) and converted (sticky ash) particles. Following this path, in this paper numerical DEM simulations of a prototype entrained-flow slagging gasifier have been developed to establish the role of the level of particle burning, and therefore of the properties relevant to particle-particle interaction (e. g. particle stickiness degree and deriving characteristics), on the distribution of char particles in the whole reactor. Even in presence of simplifying assumptions, the results reveal the importance to take into account the particle-particle interaction for a correct prediction of the effective residence time distribution of particles in the reactor. The effective flux of particles towards the wall slag layer appears indeed strongly dependent on the initial particle-particle contact characteristics in the region of the gasifier where the dense phase develops. In the proposed configuration of a downward gasifier, this is the result not only of the interaction among particles in the region of injection but also of the distribution pattern that establishes after the first impact of particles with the walls...|$|E
40|$|Optimisation of the <b>slag</b> <b>mode</b> in the ladle {{with the}} help of briquetted fluxing agents, based on Al 2 O 3 under various {{technological}} conditions is the object of this paper. The aim of the industrial experiments was to assess the possibility of achieving the optimum chemical composition of the slag that would improve the kinetic conditions of the refining ladle slag during the treatment in secondary metallurgy units. Industrial experiments were focused on comparing the influences of different slag-making agents such as lime (CaO), briquetted fluxing agents and deoxidation agents forming calcium carbide (CaC 2) and granular aluminium (Algranul). During the evaluation of the <b>slag</b> <b>mode</b> in the ladle, samples of the steel from different technological places under operational conditions were taken to assess the desulphurization degree. The samples of the slag for evaluating the chosen parameters, such as basicity, the content of easily reducible oxides, the proportion of CaO/Al 2 O 3 and the Mannesmann index, were taken too. Further, the temperature and the oxygen activity in the steel were continuously measured too. The results mentioned in this paper represent the basic information about the possibilities of the slag-mode optimisation in the ladle using different proportions of the slag-making additions, briquetted fluxing agents as well as the deoxidation agents within secondary metallurgy.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} of this work is experimental determination of temperature dependences of viscosity of the molten CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system and assessment of impact of CaO on the viscosity of this system. Design/methodology/approach: The ternary oxide system CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2, which represents a simplified basis of the casting powder, was chosen for the experiment. Dependencies of viscosity on the concentration of CaO and on the temperature were determined experimentally. For this purpose were prepared a concentration series with additions of 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 wt. % of calcium oxide. Experimental measurements of viscosity was performed with use of the high-temperature viscometer Anton Paar FRS 1600. Findings: Viscosity of the studied systems decreases exponentially with the increasing temperature. Viscosity decreases with the increasing addition of CaO. Viscosity reaches its minimum value of 0. 447 Pa. s (at T = 1723 K) at the basicity of CaO/SiO 2 = 1. 13. Viscosity increases with the further addition of CaO (CaO/SiO 2 > 1. 2). Influence of addition of CaO is more pronounced at higher temperatures. Research limitations/implications: Viscosity in molten oxide system {{is determined by the}} internal structure. Exact clarification of the change of structure of the oxide system caused by the increased content of CaO requires additional analyses, such as Fourier transformation infrared spectra and Raman spectra. Practical implications: The choice of an optimum <b>slag</b> <b>mode</b> influences not only the main metallurgical processes, but also the values of technical-economic indicators of the whole steelmaking process. Viscosity is an important factor affecting the service properties of slags, as it {{plays an important role in}} the area of mass transfer at chemical reactions in metallurgical processes. Originality/value: The viscosities of CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system were measured under conditions of CaO/SiO 2 = 0. 78 - 1. 44, 47. 20 - 35. 98 wt. % SiO 2, 36. 90 - 51. 90 wt. % CaO and 15. 90 - 12. 12 wt. % Al 2 O 3...|$|R
