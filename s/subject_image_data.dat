40|$|Medical {{assessment}} of penetrating injuries {{is a difficult}} and knowledge-intensive task. Physical examination and computed tomographic (CT) imaging data must be combined with detailed anatomic, physiologic, and biomechanical knowledge to assess the injured subject. We are developing a methodology to automate reasoning about penetrating injuries using canonical knowledge combined with specific <b>subject</b> <b>image</b> <b>data.</b> We build a three dimensional geometric model of a subject from segmented images. We link regions in this model to concepts in two knowledge sources: (1) a comprehensive ontology of anatomy containing organ identities, adjacencies, and other information useful for anatomic reasoning, and (2) an ontology of regional perfusion containing formal definitions of arterial anatomy and corresponding regions of perfusion. We developed problem solvers that can determine the organs that are injured given particular trajectories of projectiles, whether vital structures—such as a coronary artery— are injured, and can predict the propagation of injury ensuing after a vital structure is injured. This methodology may improve the speed and accuracy of rapid {{assessment of}} penetrating injury...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{iterative}} bootstrapping framework {{to create and}} analyze statistical atlases of bony anatomy such as the human pelvis from a large collection of CT data sets. We create an initial tetrahedral mesh representation of the target anatomy and use deformable intensitybased registration to create an initial atlas. This atlas is used as prior information to assist in deformable registration/segmentation of our <b>subject</b> <b>image</b> <b>data</b> sets, and the process is iterated several times to remove any bias from the initial choice of template subject and to improve the stability and consistency of mean shape and variational modes. We also present a framework to validate the statistical models. Using this method, we have created a statistical atlas of full pelvis anatomy with 110 healthy patient CT scans. Our analysis shows that any given pelvis shape can be approximated up to an average accuracy of 1. 5036 mm using the first 15 principal modes of variation. Although a particular intensity-based deformable registration algorithm was used to produce these results, {{we believe that the}} basic method may be adapted readily for use with any registration method with broadly similar characteristics. ...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{reported}} neurocognitive impairments associated with chronic marijuana use. Given that the hippocampus contains a high density of cannabinoid receptors, hippocampal-mediated cognitive functions, including visuospatial memory, may have increased vulnerability to chronic marijuana use. Thus, the current study examined brain activation during {{the performance of a}} virtual analogue of the classic Morris water maze task in 10 chronic marijuana (MJ) users compared to 18 nonusing (NU) comparison <b>subjects.</b> <b>Imaging</b> <b>data</b> were acquired using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI at 3. 0 [*]Tesla during retrieval (hidden platform) and motor control (visible platform) conditions. While task performance on learning trials was similar between groups, MJ users demonstrated a deficit in memory retrieval. For BOLD fMRI data, NU subjects exhibited greater activation in the right parahippocampal gyrus and cingulate gyrus compared to the MJ group for the Retrieval-Motor Control contrast (NU > MJ). These findings suggest that hypoactivation in MJ users may be due to differences in the efficient utilization of neuronal resources during the retrieval of memory. Given the paucity of data on visuospatial memory function in MJ users, these findings may help elucidate the neurobiological effects of marijuana on brain activation during memory retrieval...|$|R
40|$|Functional neuroimaging {{analysis}} is generally applied to studies of groups of subjects. The {{most commonly used}} imaging modality is functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) and most software packages are designed mainly {{for the analysis of}} fMRI data of task-based studies. The same software and approaches to analysis are also applied to other modalities, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and to different study types, such as the detection of abnormalities in individual brain scans by comparison with a normal database. The validation and optimization of individual parts of processing and complete analyses usually relies on the use of well-characterised human, modified human or simulated data. Work presented in this thesis employs well-characterized human data for the optimization of a study involving the administration of high doses of a drug to <b>subjects.</b> <b>Imaging</b> <b>data</b> was acquired using two complementary pharmacological magnetic resonance (MR) techniques - arterial spin labeling (ASL) and blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD). After optimization, the concordance between the two techniques and overall sensitivity was shown to be improved. The application of optimization techniques with respect to areas such as ageing, image registration and count scaling has been demonstrated to markedly improve the reliability and sensitivity of the voxel-based techniques. Because there are issues surrounding the comparability of datasets acquired on different cameras, using a printed subresolution phantom {{has been shown to be}} useful in the investigation of the imaging characteristics of different systems. In conclusion, this work has demonstrated the importance of optimization and simulation across a number of different studies with a particular focus on single subjects. The range, scope and complexity of neuroimaging studies can be expected to increase in the future in response to the ageing population, increasing computer power and improved understanding for disorders affecting the brain.

40|$|Background Tagged MRI is an {{established}} technique for the tracking of local deformations of the myocardium. The {{quantitative assessment of}} myocardial stress and strain is however a non-trivial task and only few software tools are available for clinical use. The purpose of this work was the evaluation of a phase-based motion tracking method for fully automatic calculation of deformation parameters from tagged MRI sequences. Methods We calculated motion fields which {{form the basis for}} the computation of myocardial stress and strain for 40 single-slice tagged MR image sequences of healthy <b>subjects.</b> <b>Image</b> <b>data</b> was acquired at two different sites with four different MR scanners (Siemens Espree 1. 5 T, Avanto 1. 5 T, Trio 3 T and Biograph 3 T). Tagging grid spacing ranged from 6 to 8 mm, and in-plane resolutions from 1. 2 to 1. 6 mm. Images were oriented in short-axis (39) and 2 -chamber view (1). The phase-based motion tracking approach estimates local deformation based on the application of quadrature filters. The resulting motion field can then be used for motion tracking {{as well as for the}} calculation of stress and strain. For the assessment of the motion field quality, tracked landmarks were compared with expert observations. Two observers placed corresponding landmarks on tagging line crossings in 5 (2 CH) or 6 (SAX) AHA segments of the myocardium in all image sequences. Inter-observer difference as well as deviation from the automatically tracked landmarks was calculated. Results Calculation time of the automatic motion tracking algorithm was 39. 13 ± 36. 98 s on average per data set. The average deviation of the tracked landmark positions from the observer annotations was 0. 43 ± 0. 35 mm, and the average inter-observer difference was 1. 17 ± 1. 43 mm. The highest errors occurred for timeframes with rapidly moving myocardium and temporarily hidden tag lines due to throughplane motion. Conclusions Altogether, automatic tracking error was in the order of magnitude of the voxel resolution, and is lower than the inter-observer difference. The evaluation shows that the method is capable of quantifying motion from tagged MRI data as well as manual observers. We thus assume that the method is suited for the calculation of clinically relevant parameters, such as circumferential and radial strain. The presented method is integrated into an OsiriX plugin that has been made available for clinical research...|$|R
40|$|Obesity {{represents}} a major and growing global public health concern. The mass media {{play an important}} role in shaping public understandings of health, and obesity attracts much media coverage. This study offers the first content analysis of photographs illustrating UK newspaper articles about obesity. The researchers studied 119 articles and images from five major national newspapers. Researchers coded the manifest content of each image and article and used a graphical scale to estimate the body size of each <b>image</b> <b>subject.</b> <b>Data</b> were analysed with regard to the concepts of the normalisation and stigmatisation of obesity. Articles’ descriptions of subjects’ body sizes were often found to differ from coders’ estimates, and subjects described as obese tended to represent the higher values of the obese BMI range, differing from the distribution of BMI values of obese adults in the UK. Researchers identified a tendency for <b>image</b> <b>subjects</b> described as overweight or obese to be depicted in stereotypical ways that could reinforce stigma. These findings are interpreted as illustrations of how newspaper portrayals of obesity may contribute to societal normalisation and the stigmatisation of obesity, two forces that threaten to harm obese individuals and undermine public health efforts to reverse trends in obesity...|$|R
40|$|A {{process for}} x ray {{registration}} and differencing results in more efficient compression is discussed. Differencing of registered modeled <b>subject</b> <b>image</b> with a modeled reference image forms a differential image for compression with conventional compression algorithms. Obtention of a modeled reference image includes modeling a relatively unrelated standard reference image upon a three dimensional model, which three dimensional model {{is also used}} to model the <b>subject</b> <b>image</b> for obtaining the modeled <b>subject</b> <b>image.</b> The registration process of the modeled <b>subject</b> <b>image</b> and modeled reference image translationally correlates such modeled images for resulting correlation thereof in spatial and spectral dimensions. Prior to compression, a portion of the image falling outside a designated area of interest may be eliminated, for subsequent replenishment with a standard reference image. The compressed differenced image may be subsequently transmitted and/or stored, for subsequent decompression and addition to a standard reference image so as to form a reconstituted or approximated <b>subject</b> <b>image</b> at either remote location and/or at a later moment in time.

40|$|This Paper {{represents}} {{a method for}} the automatic segmentation of the brain in magnetic resonance (MR) images of the human head. The method identifies brain areas of interest, including the gyri and other subcortical structures that were manually delineated {{in a set of}} labelled training images. Principal components analysis (PCA) is applied to the training ensemble in order to learn a PCA atlas subspace, which is a dimensionality-reduced linear subspace of labelled brain images. We employ this subspace to segment and label previously unseen <b>subject</b> <b>images.</b> This is accomplished by finding the PCA atlas closest to an input <b>subject</b> <b>image</b> through orthogonal projection of the latter into the subspace. The PCA atlas is then non rigidly registered to the <b>subject</b> <b>image</b> and the non rigid transformation is used to transfer the labels from the former to the latter, thereby segmenting the <b>subject</b> <b>image.</b> Our method is compared with alternative methods and the results are validated using overlap and distance metrics...|$|R
