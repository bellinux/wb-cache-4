40|$|A {{new model}} of visual {{perception}} is proposed. The model, intended for an autonomous intelligent system, {{is based on the}} integration between symbolic and subsymbolic processing. No hypotheses are made about the adequacy of this model as a model of human vision: the proposed model is currently under development for a robot system. The proposed system is made up by a symbolic level based on a terminological and an assertional component and a <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level</b> based on dynamic conceptual space, a vectorial space describing by its dynamics the perceived scene. The role of the <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level</b> is to define the semantics of the symbolic level: concepts and roles correspond to sequences in the dynamic conceptual space. The link between symbolic and subsymbolic components is made up a neural network architecture, acting as the extension function of the symbolic component. Examples of the implementing system are reported. 1. Introduction Thedesignand the realisation of intelligent autonomoussys [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{computer}} aided {{medical diagnosis}} (CAD), interpretability of learned models {{is an important}} concern. Unfortunately, the raw data used to train a model are often in subsymbolic form (for instance, images), which makes the application of symbolic learning methods difficult.

A common formalism {{can be used}} to describe two seemingly different models: the Boltzmann machine connectionist learning model and the Bayes network model for probabilistic reasoning. The learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines can be adapted to a general algorithm for adjusting conditional probabilities on the links in a Bayes network.

Systems Integration. Based on notions that there have already been created simple and specific AI systems (such as systems for computer vision, speech synthesis, etc., or software that employs some of the models mentioned above) and {{now is the time for}} integration to create broad AI systems.

40|$|Human-level {{intelligent}} agents must autonomously navigate complex, dynamic, uncertain environments with bounded {{time and}} memory. This requires that they continually update a hierarchical, dynamic, probabilistic (uncertain) internal model {{of their current}} situation, via approximate Bayesian inference, incorporating both the sensory data and a generative model of its causes. Such modeling requires suitable representation at multiple levels of abstraction from the <b>subsymbolic,</b> sensory <b>level</b> to the most abstract conceptual representation. To guide our approach, we identify principles for perceptual representation, perceptual inference, and the associated learning processes. Based on these principles, a predictive coding extension to the HTM Cortical Learning Algorithms (CLA), termed PC-CLA, is proposed as a foundational building block for the systems-level LIDA cognitive architecture. PC-CLA fleshes out LIDA’s internal representations, memory, learning and attentional processes; and takes an initial step towards the comprehensive use of distributed and probabilistic (uncertain) representation throughout the architecture. 1...|$|R

40|$|A new {{cognitive}} architecture for {{artificial vision}} is proposed. The architecture, aimed at an autonomous intelligent system, is cognitive {{in the sense}} that several cognitive hypotheses have been postulated as guidelines for its design. The first one is the existence of a conceptual representation level between the <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level,</b> that processes sensory data, and the linguistic level, that describes scenes by means of a high-level language. The conceptual level plays the role of the interpretation domain for the symbols at the linguistic levels. A second cognitive hypothesis concerns the active role of a focus of attention mechanism in the link between the conceptual and the linguistic level: the exploration process of the perceived scene is driven by linguistic and associative expectations.

40|$|Automatic speech recognizers {{currently}} perform {{poorly in}} the presence of noise. Humans, on the other hand, often compensate for noise degradation by extracting speech information from alternative sources and then integrating this information with the acoustical signal. Visual signals from the speaker’s face are one source of supplemental speech information. We demonstrate that multiple sources of speech information can be integrated at a <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level</b> to improve vowel recognition. Feedforward and recurrent neural networks are trained to estimate the acoustic characteristics of the vocal tract from images of the speaker‘s mouth. These estimates are then combined with the noise-degraded acoustic information, effectively increasing the signal-to-noise ratio and improving the recognition of these noise-degraded signals. Alternative symbolic strategies, such as direct categorization of the visual signals into vowels, are also presented. The performances of these neural networks compared favorably with human performance and with other pattern-matching and estimation techniques...|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} body {{of evidence}} has shown that attention is a multi-type and multilevel cognitive faculty. The dominant computational modeling approaches to attention have often focused on one specific type of attention at one specific level. In particular, various connectionist modeling techniques at the <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level</b> have been widely adopted. In this paper, we report a symbolic computational model of the Attentional Network Test, which simulta-neously involves different types of attention (alerting, orienting, and executive control), each subserved by distinctive attentional networks in the brain. The model was developed in ACT-R, a rule-based cognitive architecture. The {{results show that the}} model, by sequentially firing rules {{at a rate of about}} one every 40 ms, was able to capture the effect of each attentional network. The model implies that while the attentional networks can be distinguished at both neuroana-tomical and behavioral levels, different attentional networks may adopt similar computational operations at least at a symbolic rule level. ! 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade the {{development}} of multirobot systems has shown with growing evidence how a well-balanced deliberative-reactive coordination is the key issue to provide the group with an efficient and robust collective behavior. Usually, but not necessarily, deliberation {{is linked to the}} planning dynamical role exchange whereas reactivity is associated with the ability of the system to stress any condition which could fertilize cooperation. Using a chemical metaphor we could say that reactive cooperation should emerge from the interaction between individiduals through an appropriate catalyst whose availability increases as cooperation increases. In the paper we present an attempt to satisfy the constraint by maintaining at the <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level,</b> {{as long as it is}} possible, all the relevant information to coordinate a multirobot system.

40|$|To {{overcome}} {{the black box}} behaviour of neural networks many different approaches have been proposed. Up to {{now there is no}} standard tool being able to handle general feedforward networks. In this paper a method is proposed to combine visualization techniques with transformation algorithms to interpret neural feedforward networks. An application in ultrasonic crack detection will show that the overcoming of the black box structure of neural networks is not academical. It shows that the optimization of a network after training is possible and highly usable. 1 Introduction There are many approaches trying to {{overcome the}} pure subsymbolic behaviour of neural networks (e. g. Touretzky and Hinton 1986, Eppler 1993). Neural networks operate at a <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level</b> because no symbolic knowledge is required to design a network.

40|$|All {{accounts}} of human reasoning (whether {{presented at the}} symbolic or <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level)</b> have to reckon with the temporal organization of the human processing systems and the ephemeral nature of the representations it uses. We present three new empirical tests for the hypothesis that people commence the interpretational process by constructing a minimal initial representation. In the case of if A then C the initial representation captures the occurrence of the consequent, C, {{within the context of}} the antecedent, A. Conditional inference problems are created by a categorical premise that affirms or denies A or C. The initial representation allows an inference when the explicitly represented information matches (e. g., the categorical premise A affirms the antecedent oAo) but not when it mismatches (e. g., onot-Ao denies A). Experiments 1 and 2 confirmed that people tend to accept the conclusion that onothing followso for the denial problems, as indeed they do not have a determinate initial-model conclusion. Experiment 3 demonstrated the other way round that the effect of problem type (affirmation versus denial) is reduced when we impede the possibility of inferring a determinate conclusion on the basis of the initial representation of both the affirmation and the denial problems...|$|E
40|$|Whereas the {{identification}} and control of linear systems is well understood, this does not apply in general to nonlinear systems. Here, neural nets open up new paths {{for the treatment of}} multidimensional nonlinear systems as well as the possibility of adaptive readjustments to changes of the environment and of the system parameters. The advantages of neural control are of particular value for robotics. On the subsymolic level, the goal is a symbiosis between sensorics and actuatorics and neural signal processing and control. However, we do intend to use traditional AI-techniques in cases where a robust knowledge representation is required which goes beyond the <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level,</b> e. g. for space representation. In many applications, the problem is to extract significant control parameters from visual sensor data in a robust and efficient manner. For this task, neural nets are suited particularly well. Mathematical models for machine learning as well as unifying dynamical concepts will be utilized to achieve quantitative, generalizable results with respect to the efficiency of neural nets, by taking into account the real world requirements for control tasks with respect to performance, reliablitity and fault tolerance. Speech is of special signigicance for the dialogue with autonomous systems. Since neural nets have lead to encouraging results in speech processing, corresponding techniques will also be applied in robotics...|$|E
40|$|Theories of {{generative}} linguistics {{hold that}} language processing occurs {{by means of}} the manipulation of symbols by explicit rules. The past 15 years have seen the development of a radical challenge to this view, derived from a form of computational modelling called Parallel Distributed Processing or connectionism. Connectionist linguistic theory holds that language processing takes place at a <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level,</b> and that the appearance of rule-driven behaviour is formed by the abstraction of patterns from the environment. The English past tense has become a critical arena of dissent between symbolic and subsymbolic theories of linguistics. There are two current dominant theories of past tense inflection: hybrid dual-route theory, championed by Pinker, posits a symbolic, explicit, default rule for the regularisation process, and an associative memory component for irregular exceptions; single-route theory maintains that regular and irregular inflectional morphology may both be accounted for within a single, subsymbolic, associative system which contains no explicit linguistic rules. This doctoral thesis describes a new classification of phonological similarity between verbs ('neighbourhood density'), which is used to develop mutually-exclusive and empirically-testable hypotheses from the two dominant theoretical perspectives of English past tense inflectional morphology. Empirical research is conducted in the domains of experimental psychology, electrophysiology and Connectionist modelling: four novel verb elicitation tasks are performed on adults; two ERP studies investigate brain activity for regular, irregular and novel verb inflection; and five neural network simulations are built in order to compare human data with network performance. Data are reported which have implications for single- and dual-route theories of past tense processing. </p...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} {{research}} in artificial intelligence followed a symbolic paradigm which required {{a level of}} knowledge {{described in terms of}} rules. More recently subsymbolic approaches have been adopted as a suitable means for studying many problems. There are many search mechanisms which can be used to manipulate subsymbolic components, and in recent years general search methods based on models of natural evolution have become increasingly popular. This thesis examines a hybrid symbolic/subsymbolic approach and the application of evolutionary algorithms to a problem from each of the fields of shape representation (finding an iterated function system for an arbitrary shape), natural language dialogue (tuning parameters so that a particular behaviour can be achieved) and speech recognition (selecting the penalties used by a dynamic programming algorithm in creating a word lattice). These problems were selected on the basis that each should have a fundamentally different interactions at the <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level.</b> Results demonstrate that for the experiments conducted the evolutionary algorithms performed well in most cases. However, the type of subsymbolic interaction that may occur influences the relative performance of evolutionary algorithms which emphasise either top-down (evolutionary programming - EP) or bottom-up (genetic algorithm - GA) means of solution discovery. For the shape representation problem EP is seen to perform significantly better than a GA, and reasons for this disparity are discussed. Furthermore, EP appears to offer a powerful means of finding solutions to this problem, and so the background and details of the problem are discussed at length. Some novel constraints on the problem's search space are also presented which could be used in related work. For the dialogue and speech recognition problems a GA and EP produce good results with EP performing slightly better. Results achieved with EP have been used to improve the performance of a speech recognition system...|$|E
40|$|The subsymbolic {{approach}} to {{natural language processing}} (NLP) captures a number of intriguing properties of human-like information processing such as learning from examples, context sensitivity, generalization, robustness of behavior, and intuitive reasoning. Within this new paradigm, the central issues are quite different from (even incompatible with) the traditional issues in symbolic NLP, and the research has proceeded without {{much in common with}} the past. However, the ultimate goal is still the same: to understand how humans process language. Even if NLP is being built on a new foundation, as can be argued, many of the results obtained through symbolic research are still valid, and {{could be used as a}} guide for developing subsymbolic models of natural language processing. This is where DISCERN (DIstributed SCript processing and Episodic memoRy Network (Miikkulainen 1993), a subsymbolic neural network model of script-based story understanding, fits in. DISCERN is purely a subsymbolic model, but at the high level it consists of modules and information structures similar to those of symbolic systems, such as scripts, lexicon, and episodic memory. At the highest level of natural language processing such as text and discourse understanding, the symbolic and subsymbolic paradigms have to address the same basic issues. Outlining a subsymbolic {{approach to}} those issues is the purpose of DISCERN. In more specific terms, DISCERN aims: (1) to demonstrate that distributed artificial neural networks can be used to build a large-scale natural language processing system that performs approximately at the level of symbolic models; (2) to show that several cognitive phenomena can be explained at the <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level</b> using the special properties of these networks; and (3) to identify central issues in subsymbolic NLP and to develop well-motivated techniques to deal with them. To the extent that DISCERN is successful in these areas, it constitutes a first step towards building text and discourse understanding systems within the subsymbolic paradigm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} whether the connectionist approach is an appropriate paradigm for the construction of simulation models of psychological processes. The strongest connectionist claim is that psychological properties simply emerge from interactions among the units of a network; meaningful features are distributed in these units, which therefore are not representions of anything. The problem is then: how such a system can describe a psychological system and be relevant to explain it ? It is suggested that the psychological relevance of connectionist descriptions should not be rejected on the grounds that they are limited to a hardware-like or implementational level. Connectionist descriptions would be best considered as different scientific "objects", constructed from the same prescientific "facts". As different objects they need not be at different levels of generality or abstraction and the translation of one representation into another is unnecessary.    As to the explanatory power of connectionist models, it is claimed that it cannot come from the interaction among units, if this interaction is invoked at the same time to give the model a psychological nature. Neither can the explanatory power come from the fact that connectionist models produce phenomena similar to human psychological processes, since this similarity should refer explicitly to features that have already been accepted independently as psychological. The claim that connectionist analysis is psychologically relevant at a <b>subsymbolic</b> <b>level</b> is eventually considered. There is a possible confusion in this claim: sub-symbolic models may be non-symbolic as to their object but they must be symbolic as models. A non-symbolic model simply would not be a model, since - by definition - it must represent something. Sub-symbolic models, however, may be non-symbolic in the sense that there are no symbols in the modelled reality. In this regard, connectionist systems seem to help in overcoming the idea - encouraged by current AI and Cognitive Science - that any psychological process should be considered as made out of symbols...|$|E
