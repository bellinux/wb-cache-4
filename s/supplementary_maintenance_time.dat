This method employs the real-time and dynamic decision-making method and adjusts the optimal <b>maintenance</b> <b>time</b> in real time according to {{the information in the}} equipment’s operating process, making it more conform to the actual condition.

For example, in military fields, good maintainability will reduce the downtime caused by maintenance, improve the executing ability of equipment to increase combat efficiency, and also in the field of manufacturing, downtime of product line caused by maintenance will cause great loss, but now there isn’t a useful method to measure the <b>maintenance</b> <b>time</b> in the design stage to verify if the <b>maintenance</b> <b>time</b> can meet maintainability requirement, while traditional way rely on statistic data in the physical prototypes in the later stage, which is lagged, and modifies the design is very difficult.

As the cluster <b>maintenance</b> <b>time</b> increases, the accuracy of predicting the vehicle's future position and speed decreases. But in COMAC, this decrease is very small since our algorithm is more adaptable to the driver's reactions to the interdistance and relative speed between the two following vehicles.

40|$|Maintenance is {{the most}} common product-oriented Product Service System (PSS) offering, as well as a core {{activity}} of the manufacturing system lifecycle, since it accounts for as much as 60 to 70 % of its total costs. Commonly, in the Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs), the maintenance activities of customised engineering-to-order (ETO) products highly depend on the experience of engineers and shop-floor experts, without considering specific tools and algorithms that can capture the knowledge and reuse it in an efficient way. Moreover, the estimation of the <b>maintenance</b> <b>time</b> for a new maintenance project, which is among the main offerings in the maintenance, is solely based on the engineer’s experience and knowledge.

40|$|Abstract—The Object-Oriented (OO) {{paradigm}} {{has become}} increasingly popular in recent years. Researchers agree that, although maintenance {{may turn out to}} be easier for OO systems, it is unlikely that the maintenance burden will completely disappear. One approach to controlling software maintenance costs is the utilization of software metrics during the development phase, to help identify potential problem areas. Many new metrics have been proposed for OO systems, but only a few of them have been validated. The purpose of this research is to empirically explore the validation of three existing OO design complexity metrics and, specifically, to assess their ability to predict <b>maintenance</b> <b>time.</b> This research reports the results of validating three metrics, Interaction Level (IL), Interface Size (IS), and Operation Argument Complexity (OAC).
