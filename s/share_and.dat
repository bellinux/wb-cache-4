40|$|Analyses for {{variable}} <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> freeness {{are important}} {{both in the}} automatic parallelisation and in the optimisation of sequential logic programs. In this paper, a new analysis is described which can infer <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> freeness information to an unusually high degree of accuracy. By encoding structural properties of substitutions in a sharing group fashion, a powerful depth-k <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> freeness analysis is synthesised which exploits the synergy between tracing <b>sharing</b> information <b>and</b> tracking term structure. The analysis propagates groundness with the accuracy of <b>sharing</b> groups <b>and</b> yet can precisely infer <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> freeness. Correctness is formally proven...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sharing</b> <b>and</b> {{integrating}} Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System/Science (GIS) {{models are}} critical for developing practical application systems. Facilitating model <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> model integration {{is a problem for}} model publishers and model users, respectively. To address this problem, a framework based on a Web service for <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> integrating RS and GIS models is proposed in this paper. The fundamental idea of the framework is to publish heterogeneous RS and GIS models into standard Web services for <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> interoperation and then to integrate the RS and GIS models using Web services. For the former, a “black box” and a visual method are employed to facilitate the publishing of the models as Web services. For the latter, model integration based on the geospatial workflow and semantic supported marching method is introduced. Under this framework, model <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> integration is applied for developing the Pearl River Delta water environment monitoring system. The results show that the framework can facilitate model <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> model integration for model publishers and model users...|$|R

Many Apple engineers {{had long been}} pressing for lower-cost options {{in order to build}} market <b>share</b> <b>and</b> increase demand across the entire price spectrum. With Gassée out, a rush started to quickly introduce a series of low-cost machines. Three market points were identified, a very low-cost machine aimed at costing $1,000, a low-cost machine with color graphics, and a more upscale color machine for small business use. In time, these would develop as the Classic, Macintosh LC, and Macintosh IIsi. Unlike the '020 and '030 based models, the Macintosh Classic has the original Macintosh startup sound.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> {{job scheduling}} {{in a network}} of workstations (NOW). Along with traditional methods of load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> job scheduling, it also examines methods referred to as epoch load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> epoch scheduling respectively. Epoch load sharing evenly distributes the load among workstations with job migration that occurs {{only at the end}} of predefined intervals. The time interval between successive load sharing events is called an epoch. The objective is {{to reduce the number of}} times that global system information is needed to make allocation decisions, while at the same time achieving good overall performance and fairness of individual job service. In the epoch scheduling case, processor queues are rearranged only at the end of epochs. The objective is to find an epoch that minimizes the number of queue rearrangements, while being fair and producing good system performance. Simulation is used to measure performance issues associated with load <b>sharing</b> <b>and</b> job scheduling.

5|$|On June 19, 2013, Microsoft {{announced}} (in {{response to}} the negative reaction) that it would reverse its changes to Xbox One's DRM and game licensing model. As with Xbox 360, users {{would be able to}} <b>share</b> <b>and</b> resell physical games without restrictions, and beyond a mandatory software update upon the console's initial setup process to enable playback of Blu-ray and DVD video, the console would not require a permanent internet connection to operate. These changes required the family sharing features, along with the ability to play games without their disc after installation, to be dropped. Xbox One chief product officer Marc Whitten stated that the family sharing feature may return in the future, but could not be implemented on launch due to time restraints. Don Mattrick, the then president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business, stated that the licensing changes were in {{response to the}} negative public reaction. Other analysts believed that the change was in direct response of Sony's aggressive position during its E3 press conference. Mattrick, who had been a leader in Xbox One development, announced his departure from Microsoft on July 1, 2013, to become CEO of Zynga. Analysts speculated that his departure was predicated on the poor response and subsequent reversal of the plans for Xbox One.|$|E
