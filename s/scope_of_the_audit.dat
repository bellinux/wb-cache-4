However, the law does not assign the latter role to external auditors. This situation results in an expectations gap in relation to both <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auditors and <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> external <b>auditing.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> growing economic importance <b>of</b> consulting and <b>the</b> long years <b>of</b> auditor tenure is likely to impair auditor independence.

From a democratic perspective there is need for auditors to recognize the citizens as the principle, which implies fulfilling the people’s expectations of their role as well as aiming at limiting mismanagement {{of the public sector}}.

In the article, the author attempted to answer the question about what <b>the</b> perspective <b>of</b> performance <b>audit</b> development is in Poland in <b>the</b> next couple <b>of</b> years. To achieve the goal, the author used an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Polish and foreign literature on the subject, an analysis of legal instruments <b>of</b> internal <b>audit,</b> <b>the</b> comparative analysis method, and benchmarking (modelled on the British practice, the author indicating the implications connected with implementing performance audits in public finance sector units in Poland as well as mentioning legal-economic loopholes that should be closed in order to raise <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> performance <b>audit</b> in public finance sector in Poland).

Two approaches to the identification of politically sensitive clients are explored: the auditor-general as a monitor of the agency relationship between politicians and bureaucrats and an institutional approach, which places emphasis on the independence of the auditor-general.

40|$|MSc (Enginnering), Faculty of Engineering and the Built EnvironmentIn {{recent years}} {{companies}} have made {{increased use of}} Lean Manufacturing audits to measure the degree of Lean Manufacturing implementation within their organizations. Thereafter, a gap analysis highlights areas for improvement, which leads to increased Operational Performance. This approach may be flawed. The audit may measure Lean Manufacturing characteristics that are not beneficial or the Lean Manufacturing audit may be inaccurate due to auditor bias or inadequate scope. The result is frustration {{and a lack of}} belief in the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing as a competitive strategy. This study tests the hypothesis that “Lean Manufacturing audits drive improvements in Operational Performance. ” A sample company comprising sixty four organizations operating in a job shop and Batch operations management environment is used as a case study. The organizations manufacture and service high value added products for heavy industry. The Lean Manufacturing audit developed to assess the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing audits in driving Operational Performance uses Lean Manufacturing characteristics commonly used in previous research. These characteristics include policy deployment, standardized work, visual management and housekeeping, quick changeover techniques, total preventative maintenance, continuous improvement, error proofing, cultural awareness, material control and level production. Commonly used Operational Performance measures such as On-Time-Delivery, Inventory turns and Direct Labour Utilization are used to assess Operational Performance. A range of independent auditors were used to gather data on the extent of implementation of Lean Manufacturing and Operational Performance measures. Structural Equation Modelling is used to relate the results of the Lean Manufacturing audits to Operational Performance. This is the first known paper to use Structural Equation Modelling in measuring the extent of implementation of Lean Manufacturing to Operational Performance. Lean Manufacturing audit results have a significant correlation to Operational Performance but {{with a high degree of}} variation in Operational Performance not accounted for by the results of the Lean Manufacturing audit. This variation is caused by the inadequate <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audit</b> relative to Operational Performance measures as well as auditor bias.

40|$|Existing {{legislation}} on inclusion {{of information on}} social and environmental issues in Company reporting does not provide an adequate guarantee that the information reported is material or complete. This legislation {{is present in the}} Companies Act 2006, and was recently updated in the Companies Act (Strategic Report and Directors Report Regulations) 2013. This means that investors will find it difficult to use existing data to inform decisions, even as the demand for this type of information is increasing. The solution is to amend the Companies Act to incorporate a necessary requirement for assurance of non financial impact information. Directors are currently required to provide a statement asserting that shareholders have the information necessary to assess company performance, business and strategy. <b>The</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial <b>audit</b> is to report on whether these statements are inconsistent with the information that the auditors have acquired in <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> performing <b>the</b> <b>audit.</b> This <b>scope</b> should be extended to requiring assurance on the materiality and completeness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> information regarding <b>the</b> wider impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company's operations. Shareholders and other stakeholders would then be able to use this information in their investment decisions. In <b>the</b> meantime, examples <b>of</b> discrepancies in Company reporting can be raised with the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). The first section explores issues arising from current approaches to reporting on social and environmental issues. The second focuses on related current legislation in the Companies Act and how limitations create challenges for reporting useful information.

One of them, in our opinion, is to determine the status of the audit as a form of scientific knowledge. This, in turn, requires a clear definition of the subject of audit, missing not only in domestic but also foreign economic literature. Theoretical study of the content and <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audit</b> showed that there are different interpretations of this concept in the countries with developed market economies (US, UK) and the Kazakhstan legislation. Analysis of multiple interpretations and definitions revealed a narrow view of the audit activities in Kazakhstan legislation. In order to improve the efficiency of the audit work is recommended management of large and medium-sized organizations use simulation methods, structural analysis and design based on the Conditional Split of the company business processes, sub-processes, procedures, functions, etc., which, ultimately, will allow Sort already performed the action and determine the need for the implementation of new procedures or functions aimed at improving the quality of the audit.

40|$|As {{clinical}} governance {{moves from}} concept to practice, it {{is emerging as}} a realistic strategy to promote and improve quality within the National Health Service, as well as satisfying the demand for external accountability. In the context of blood transfusion, the area of responsibility encompasses product liability, as well as efficient use of blood as a resource and transfusion as an appropriate clinical response. Clinical governance may be a modem catch phrase, but the principles it enshrines have long been established within blood transfusion, and in other aspects of haematology. Here, an audit cycle comprising four audits over a 10 -year period to monitor the use of cross-matched blood in a large district general hospital is described. Initially, blood use was considered by hospital site, and by the surgical procedure {{for which it was}} requested. Later. the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audit</b> was expanded to consider usage by individual consultant. A standard of efficient use of cross-matched blood was taken to be a cross-match to transfusion ratio of < 1. 5. The information was reviewed by the hospital transfusion committee, who have a key role in coordinating and assessing the practice of transfusion within a hospital. In this hospital, audit {{has been one of the}} main tools for improving practice, in particular by enabling the implementation and continuous revision of a maximum blood order schedule. Further, as the process of audit has developed, problem areas have been highlighted, and strategies to improve usage have been brought in with encouraging results. The audit is now being expanded again to include a greater focus on usage of cross-matched blood in the nonsurgical setting...|$|E

While performance audits and metrics have been conducted in government for decades, the application to projects is fairly new. The research evolved from a doctoral study of 700 construction projects. The doctoral study extracted factor data from audit reports, and objectively and empirically compared <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> different factors on audit results. Subsequent published analyses reviewed <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project <b>audits,</b> evaluated existing project assessment methods to identify essential elements for project review, and studied stakeholder interviews to extract their primary concerns and definitions <b>of</b> success. <b>The</b> model is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> two decades of project management & controls expertise, extensive literature review, research, and leading practices gathered {{from around the globe}} on project performance assessment and <b>audit.</b> Although <b>the</b> case studies and interviews were from construction projects in the United States, the tools may be applied to projects in any industry, worldwide. Even though audit is a common mechanism for both external and internal project oversight, existing performance audit standards and guidance are not just insufficient but nearly non-existent. Published literature, research, professional associations, and oversight bodies exist in the evaluation and financial audit fields, but not in <b>the</b> domain <b>of</b> performance <b>audit.</b> As such, practitioner approaches to scope and methodology are highly variable. This variability, which includes issues of audit sampling and review rigor, team composition, industry knowledge, audit scope, quality and availability of data, and other factors, has been proven to impact audit results. Economy, efficiency, effectiveness, and risk - concepts integral to the very definition performance audit - are rarely assessed in practice, a gap which could be considered by stakeholders to be a deficiency in <b>the</b> <b>audit</b> process, essentially a failure to deliver the depth and breadth of review promised or implied. Further, while traditional audit methods of testing procedural compliance can be effective in organizations where activities are repetitive and predictable, many projects are considerably more complicated, the project organization is temporary, and processes continuously evolve in response to changing circumstances and risk. Standard audit techniques applied in such situations are ineffective. This model focuses on giving stakeholders confidence in project delivery. It enables qualitative and quantitative findings, is flexible and modular, and can be applied in any industry, sector, and country, while satisfying regulatory requirements...|$|R
40|$|Financial {{statement}} fraud {{control has}} attracted considerable attention and associated response {{in recent years}} due to the incalculable collateral damage that could drain the long term success of companies. This research aims to present recommendations to improve financial statement fraud control in commercial companies. The research also evaluates the current strategies for the prevention and detection of financial statement fraud and the reaction thereto. Accordingly, the research attempts to highlight the best practices and weaknesses from the present practices. Based on <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> two Malaysian commercial companies, the research provides ameliorations to improve the current weaknesses, in particular, to financial statement fraud control. The research takes a normative {{point of view in}} making recommendations for financial statement fraud control. A qualitative research methodology is adopted in conducting the investigation to understand <b>the</b> actual conduct <b>of</b> practices. Hence, <b>the</b> primary data are acquired from the case study companies and interviews with <b>the</b> relevant group <b>of</b> respondents, and secondary data from the law, regulations, legislation and professional guidelines. The research investigates the financial statement fraud regulations to understand the legal framework as well as the legal practice. Furthermore, the professional guidelines are examined to understand what the professional bodies have suggested to manage <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> fraud, thereby enabling the researcher to understand <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual practices and provide improvements for financial statement fraud control. In addition, interviews with regulators, forensic accountants, external auditors and independent bodies are conducted to develop an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protocols <b>of</b> financial statement fraud in Malaysia. Therefore, <b>the</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> research are a mix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present practices, respective roles, and perceptions concerning <b>the</b> issues <b>of</b> financial statement fraud control. The case study findings demonstrate that neither case study company is highly concerned about <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> financial statement fraud control. This provides an indication that no evidence was gained concerning specific controls embedded in the present internal control system and typifies the actual practice, in particular, the prevention, detection and response strategies to mitigate financial statement fraud. <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> evidence presents a research limitation to identify any best practices for <b>the</b> mitigation <b>of</b> financial statement fraud in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> commercial companies in Malaysia. The research results indicate that the case study companies are highly reliant on their respective internal controls for <b>the</b> prevention <b>of</b> financial statement fraud and detection strategies. In addition, they demonstrate that <b>the</b> present internal <b>audit</b> functions focus on operational audit and concern pertaining to corporate risk. This provides an indication that <b>the</b> <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal <b>auditing</b> work is not primarily concerned with <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial statement information, but rather with <b>the</b> risk <b>of</b> losses to <b>the</b> respective companies. This certainly leaves scope for an expectation gap to arise in <b>the</b> present internal <b>audit</b> functions and <b>the</b> association <b>of</b> internal <b>audit</b> and risk towards financial statement fraud. The particular aspects concerning <b>the</b> detection <b>of</b> fraud in financial statements and financial statement fraud control have been perceived differently between the company’s internal and external auditors. <b>The</b> combined results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perceived control by company management, <b>the</b> present <b>audit</b> functions, and <b>the</b> detection and control responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> internal and external auditors provide and support <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> an internal <b>audit</b> expectation gap. <b>The</b> overall case study findings indicate evidence of an internal audit expectation gap, which constitutes a serious flaw in the internal control systems adopted by the companies. Therefore, <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> this research might improve the present internal control system and provide a more holistic solution for financial statement fraud control. A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> findings also indicates that Malaysia implements the lowest penalties and exercises the most lenient enforcement in relation to financial statement fraud cases compared to the UK and the US. The research has made contributions to research methodology; contributions to knowledge about the present practices in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> practical recommendations to improve practice; contributions to academic theory in relation to <b>the</b> theoretical concept <b>of</b> financial statement fraud control and internal auditing of financial statement and, finally, contributions to the regulators and standard setters. The research also offers anti-fraud programmes, particularly in respect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prevention, detection and response strategies as part of a company’s efforts to mitigate financial statement fraud. Overall, the research contributes to <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> financial statement fraud control and provides practical recommendations for financial statement <b>auditing</b> theory. <b>The</b> focus on financial statement fraud in commercial companies would enhance <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issued financial statement...|$|R
