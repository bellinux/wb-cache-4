5|$|Taxable, Glimmer and Big Drum were {{complicated}} in execution, requiring {{coordination of}} air and naval forces. Launched in poor weather conditions, Taxable {{did not appear to}} have the desired effect and failed to elicit any <b>significant</b> <b>response</b> from the Germans. The reaction to Glimmer was more encouraging. The attacks on the bomber squadrons indicated, at least to the satisfaction of RAF Bomber Command, that the Germans believed a genuine threat existed. There is no evidence that Big Drum elicited any specific response from the shore. According to historian Mary Barbier, the adverse conditions and complexity of the operations contributed to the limited enemy response.|$|E

25|$|The defeat raised serious alert {{not only}} in Tarnovo, but also in Constantinople, forcing John Kantakouzenos to abdicate and {{removing}} {{one of the main}} facilitators of the Ottoman invasion. Faced with threat, Bulgaria and Byzantium made an attempt for rapprochement. In 1355 a daughter of the Bulgarian Emperor, Keratsa, married Andronikos, the infant son of the new Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos. Unfortunately, the new relations between the houses of Tarnovo and Constantinople did not live up to the expectations of mounting a more <b>significant</b> <b>response</b> to the invading Ottomans.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Significant</b> other <b>responses</b> to patients’ {{symptoms}} {{are important for}} patient illness outcomes in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME); negative responses {{have been associated with}} increased patient depression, whilst increased disability and fatigue have been associated with solicitous <b>significant</b> other <b>responses.</b> The current study aimed {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>significant</b> other <b>responses</b> and patient outcomes within the context of daily life. Design: Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM). Method: Twenty-three patients with CFS/ME and their significant others were recruited from specialist CFS/ME services. Sixty momentary assessments, delivered using individual San Francisco Android Smartphones, were conducted over a period of 6 days. All participants reported on affect, dyadic contact, and <b>significant</b> other <b>responses</b> to the patient. Patients reported on symptom severity, disability, and activity management strategies. Results: Negative <b>significant</b> other <b>responses</b> were associated with increased patient symptom severity and distress reported at the same momentary assessment; there was evidence of a potentially mediating role of concurrent distress on symptom severity. Patient-perceived solicitous responses were associated with reduced patient activity and disability reported at the same momentary assessment. Lagged analyses indicate that momentary associations between <b>significant</b> other <b>responses</b> and patient outcomes are largely transitory; <b>significant</b> other <b>responses</b> were not associated with any of the patient outcomes at the subsequent assessment. Conclusion. The results indicate that <b>significant</b> other <b>responses</b> are important influences on the day-to-day experience of CFS/ME. Further research examining patient outcomes in association with specific <b>significant</b> other behavioural <b>responses</b> is warranted and future interventions that target such significant other behaviours may be beneficial...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} crop type, and of {{fertility}} and crop protection management within crops, on ground beetle species activity were investigated using the Nafferton Factorial Systems Comparison Experiment, using pitfall traps in 2005. Thirteen species gave <b>significant</b> <b>responses</b> to crop type, with seven showing {{a preference for}} cereals and none for grass/clover. There were 22 <b>significant</b> <b>responses</b> to fertility and six to crop protection within crop types. Sixteen of the responses to fertility and four to crop protection resulted in more activity in organically managed plots. Fertility effects were found most in wheat, barley and grass/clover whilst crop protection effects were mainly in beans and vegetables.

25|$|The {{questions}} were {{by no means}} restricted to practical problems, but many of them, in case the interpretation of a halakic or haggadic passage in the Talmud was the subject of inquiry, were theoretical in nature. In their discussion of theoretical problems the responsa of the Spanish scholars are noteworthy for the untrammeled scientific spirit that permeates them far more than those of the French school. Even in responsa that are practical in bearing, a distinction may be drawn between the two schools. Although these response can still be found in <b>significant</b> <b>response</b> anthologies today, they are not as significant as the response written during the Geonic period.|$|E
25|$|In July 1940, skirmishes took place, between Luftflotte 2, under Albert Kesselring and Hugo Sperrle's Luftflotte 3 on one side, and {{air vice marshal}} Keith Park's No. 11 Group RAF of Fighter Command on the other. The initial battles {{revolved}} around the British southern coast. Attempts by German air fleets to interdict British shipping in the English Channel were met with a <b>significant</b> <b>response</b> from the RAF, and many air battles ensued over the Channel. They were referred to by the Germans as Kanalkampf ("the Channel battles"). Richthofen made use of his Do 17P reconnaissance aircraft to locate convoys. When located, he usually dispatched a Gruppe (30 aircraft) to engage the convoy, holding other Stuka Gruppen back for repeat attacks. The campaign was complicated by the weather, which grounded the Corps for long periods, and while the Ju 87s proved effective, they proved vulnerable to RAF fighters. On 17 July 1940, Richthofen was promoted {{to the position of}} General der Flieger in recognition of his service.|$|E

25|$|Cerebral {{activation}} {{during performance}} on three cognitive tasks (verbal learning, arithmetic, and divided attention) were compared after both normal sleep and 35 hours of total sleep deprivation (TSD) {{in a study}} by Drummond and Brown. Use of fMRI measured these differences in the brain. In the verbal learning task, fMRI indicated the regions involved in both verbal learning and memorization. The results found that both TSD and a normal night of sleep showed a <b>significant</b> <b>response</b> in the prefrontal cortex and following TSD displayed a response of additional areas which included other prefrontal areas, bilateral inferior parietal lobule and superior parietal lobes. Increases in sleepiness also correlated with activation of two ventral prefrontal regions and a correlation between a greater activation in bilateral parietal lobes (which include language areas) and lower levels of impairment on free recall were also found following TSD. In the arithmetic task normal sleep showed the expected activation in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal working memory regions but following TSD only showed activation in the left superior parietal lobe and the left premotor cortex in response, with no new areas to compensate (as was found in verbal learning). Increased sleepiness was also correlated with activation in a ventral prefrontal region, but only one region. The divided attention task combined both verbal learning and the arithmetic task. fMRI indicated that cerebral response after TSD {{is similar to that of}} the verbal learning task (specifically the right prefrontal cortex, bilateral parietal lobes, and cingulate gyrus showing the strongest response). The implication of this finding is that additional brain regions activated after both verbal learning and divided attention tasks following TSD represent a cerebral compensatory response to lacking sleep. For example, there is a decline in response of the left temporal lobes during both tasks which is involved in different learning tasks during a rested state but involvement of the left inferior parietal lobe in short-term verbal memory storage following TSD suggests that this region might compensate. No new areas for the arithmetic task may suggest that it relies heavily on working memory so compensation is not possible, in comparison to tasks such as verbal learning which rely less on working memory.|$|E
