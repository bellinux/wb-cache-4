5000|$|The Nesquehoning Creek valley {{consists}} of some residential and industrial development. Urban development {{is concentrated in}} the Borough of Nesquehoning and Hometown along the climb to Barnesville, where the transportation corridor can drop down into the Mahanoy Creek Valley. In 1830 Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company operating manager Josiah White opened mining digs at overt anthracite outcroppings in Room Run ravine (Also spelled Rhume Run), and built a <b>self-acting</b> <b>plane</b> (funicular) railroad two miles downstream to the company's Lehigh Canal.|$|E
5000|$|Whishaw {{describes}} the rope-worked incline: [...] "There is a <b>self-acting</b> <b>plane</b> of 1200 yd in length on {{that portion of}} the line next the Monkland Kirkintilloch Railway; the lower part being a single way, the middle part double, and the upper part formed with three rails. The ascending train consists usually of four loaded wagons and the descending train of six or seven empty wagons; the time occupied in the ascent is 3•50 minutes; the rope used is about 4+1/2 in circumference; the sheeves sic are of 14 in diameter, and are placed at intervals of 21 feet." ...|$|E
50|$|Next {{the line}} descended {{down to the}} valley {{by means of a}} <b>self-acting</b> <b>plane</b> called Nanny Mayor's bank (or Nanny Mayer's bank); it was ¾ mile long, with a {{gradient}} of 1 in 41. From the bottom of this incline, horses drew the wagons along the near-level past White Hall and Rowley (or Cold Rowley), then reaching the ravine at Hownes Gill where a break occurred in the line. The cleft at Hownes Gill is 800 feet wide and 160 feet deep, with steep rocky sides. When the line was planned, it was obvious that a viaduct was unaffordable and an alternative means of crossing was adopted. A track of with four rails, the outer pair at a gauge of 7 feet 0 1/8 inches and the inner pair at 5 feet 1¾ inches, was laid down each face of the ravine, with gradients of 1 in 2½ on the west side and 1 in 3 on the east. A special cradle was built for each side, with the lower wheels larger than the upper wheels, so as to keep the platform level. The wagons were run on to one of these cradles and were lowered to the bottom, where they were transferred to the other cradle for the ascent of the other side. The wagons travelled sideways-on. Both cradles worked simultaneously, driven by a 20 hp stationary engine situated at the bottom, the ascending and descending cradles partly balancing one another. Only one railway wagon could be handled in each direction at a time, limiting the throughput to twelve an hour.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} about 6 mi in extent, and it {{included}} two <b>self-acting</b> inclined <b>planes</b> to gain altitude in reaching {{the high ground}} where the mines were located.|$|R
50|$|By 1825 he {{had gained}} {{sufficient}} reputation and {{expertise in the}} design and testing of locomotives that in 1825 he was able to publish his influential book A Practical Treatise on Rail-roads and Interior Communication, in which he analysed the various types of 'motive power' then in use: <b>self-acting</b> <b>planes,</b> fixed steam-engine planes, horses and steam locomotives. He was also invited to give evidence before committees of both houses of parliament on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Bill and then appointed as one of the three judges, along with John Rastrick and John Kennedy, at the subsequent Rainhill Trials of 1829. He republished his book, considerably enlarged by reports and discussion of the trials, as a second edition in 1831. A third edition appeared in 1838.|$|R
25|$|The pit {{known as}} Wellington, renamed William in 1843, was also {{operating}} from 1843; coal was brought down from it to Lady Anne by a separate <b>self-acting</b> inclined <b>plane.</b> In 1847 no. 9 Pit was sunk, near to Lady Anne. Light parallel iron rails {{were used in}} the short branch connection. In 1850 the George Pit was sunk on the north of Cuttlehill; a standard gauge waggonway was built to connect to the nearby Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway.|$|R
50|$|Once {{raised up}} the shaft, the coal was yarded or emptied into wagons; each of 1 t capacity. Loaded wagons were run in pairs down a <b>self-acting</b> {{inclined}} <b>plane</b> railway (two loaded wagons going down hauled another two emptied ones up). They were then pushed by hand, assisted by gravity, along a graded wooden trestle. It crossed a sandy area, now occupied by Hunter Street and the Great Northern Railway, to a loading staith at which small ships could berth while coal was tipped into their holds.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} surviving {{features of the}} tramway are the elevated tramway branch at Bugsworth Basin, Stodhart Tunnel and the <b>self-acting</b> inclined <b>plane</b> at Chapel-en-le-Frith, known as the Chapel inclined plane. The elevated tramway branch forms part of the Scheduled Ancient Monument of Bugsworth Basin. It was believed that the Grade II* listed Stodhart Tunnel was the oldest railway tunnel in the world until archaeological work on the Butterley Gangroad (also in Derbyshire) in May 2013 suggested that Fritchley Tunnel on that line was older than Stodhart Tunnel. A wagon is {{on display in the}} York Railway Museum and a wheel and track items at the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{other early}} railways, it {{followed}} canal practice {{in that it}} consisted of essentially level sections linked by inclines (taking {{the place of the}} canal's locks), where the trains were drawn up and lowered down by rope. Even so, it featured some quite heavy earthworks. From a station and coal wharf alongside the Soar Navigation at West Bridge {{on the west side of}} the Fosse Way in Leicester, it headed northwards for about a mile, before passing through the [...] long tunnel at Glenfield, to the valley of the Rothley Brook. It proceeded about five miles to Desford, then swung north west towards Bagworth. The original Bagworth station was at the foot of a 1 in 29 <b>self-acting</b> inclined <b>plane</b> to the summit at 565 ft. Then the line passed through a cutting at Battleflat before reaching Bardon Hill and on to Long Lane where new collieries were opened. Beyond Long Lane the railway descended by a further inclined plane of 1 in 17 to the existing coal mines at Swannington and an end on connection with the Coleorton Tramway, which linked to further coal mines and limestone quarries. The track was to be single throughout.|$|R
50|$|The Llancaiach Branch railway {{line was}} a mineral branch line in Glamorganshire, South Wales. It was {{authorised}} in 1836 {{as part of}} the Taff Vale Railway, and its purpose was to connect collieries at Llancaiach and bring their output to Cardiff for onward shipment. It was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and built on the standard gauge. It opened in 1841 from a junction (later known as Stormstown Junction) with the Merthyr line immediately south of Abercynon (then called Navigation House). It was intended to be horse worked, and included a <b>self-acting</b> rope-worked inclined <b>plane</b> near the junction. The collieries were slow to use the line, preferring their customary use of a tramroad and the Glamorganshire Canal, and the value of the line was diminished when the Taff Vale Extension line, an east-west connecting line belonging to the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway, intersected it and cut off the colliery connections, and the line became dormant.|$|R
