In 1998, Brown supported forcibly removing homeless people from Golden Gate Park and police crackdowns on the homeless for drunkenness, urinating, defecating, or sleeping on the sidewalk. Brown introduced job training programs and a $11 million drug treatment program. San Francisco, then the United States' 13th largest city, had the nation's third largest homeless population at a peak of 16,000. In November 1997, he requested nighttime helicopter searches in Golden Gate Park.

From sending messages he came to making direct speech to the kite--without, however, ceasing to send the runners. Doubtless, the height of the tower, seated as it was on the hill-top, the rushing of the ceaseless wind, the hypnotic effect of the lofty altitude of the speck in the sky at which he gazed, and the rushing of the paper messengers up the string till sight of them was lost in distance, all helped to further affect his brain, undoubtedly giving way under the strain of beliefs and circumstances which were at once stimulating to the imagination, occupative of his mind, and absorbing.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 1100 bleeds off gasses {{to operate}} the action through ports in the barrel {{near the end of}} the fore end. The gasses then drive a steel action sleeve that fits around the {{magazine}} tube and connects to the bolt carrier to the rear, ejecting the spent shell. A fresh shell is released from the magazine, which trips the carrier release, and the action spring in the stock pushes the bolt forward, picking up the fresh shell and loading it into the chamber. With modifications to the trigger group to regulate feed and firing, the design is basically a gas powered Model 870. The design team <b>spent</b> many <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> hours test firing and getting input from shooters on the design before it was released for production. The fact that plastic shotshells had come onto the scene, and even the older paper shells were carrying improved coatings, made for more reliable ammunition, which no doubt assisted the 1100 to become a true breakthrough in gas operated shotgun reliability. The design was self-compensating to an extent not seen previously, in that any 2-3/4" [...] shell could be fired without adjustment in the standard models, and both 2-3/4" [...] and 3" [...] Magnum shells could be used interchangeably on the Magnum versions. The Remington 1100’s carrier release is located on the underside of the firearm which is unlike a number of other semi-automatic shotguns such as the Mossberg 930 or the FN SLP whose carrier releases are located on the side.|$|R

40|$|We live in {{a culture}} that depends on {{technologies}} to record our behavior and coordinate our actions with billions of other connected people. In this computational culture, humans and machines continue to perpetuate deep-seated injustices. Our abilities to observe and intervene in other people's lives also allow us to govern, forcing us to ask how to govern wisely and who should be responsible. In this dissertation, I argue that to govern wisely, we need to remake large-scale social experiments to follow values of democracy. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, I <b>spent</b> time with <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> communities on the social news platform reddit and learned how they govern themselves. I designed CivilServant, novel experimentation software that communities have used to evaluate how they govern harassment and misinformation. Finally, I examined the uses of this evidence in community policy deliberation. As we develop ways to govern behavior through technology platforms, {{we have an opportunity to}} ensure that that the benefits will be enjoyed, questioned, and validated widely in an open society. Despite common views of social experiments as scarce knowledge that consolidates the power of experts, I show how community experiments can scale policy evaluation and expand public influence on the governance of human and machine behavior. by J.

500|$|The {{foremost}} document {{containing the}} work of Archimedes is the Archimedes Palimpsest. In 1906, the Danish professor Johan Ludvig Heiberg visited Constantinople and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD. He discovered {{that it was a}} palimpsest, a document with text that had been written over an erased older work. Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them, which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as vellum was expensive. The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes. The parchment <b>spent</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s. On October 29, 1998 it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $2 million at Christie's in New York. The palimpsest holds seven treatises, including the only surviving copy of On Floating Bodies in the original Greek. It is the only known source of The Method of Mechanical Theorems, referred to by Suidas and thought to have been lost forever. Stomachion was also discovered in the palimpsest, with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts. The palimpsest is now stored at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, where it has been subjected to a range of modern tests including the use of ultraviolet and [...] light to read the overwritten text.|$|E
