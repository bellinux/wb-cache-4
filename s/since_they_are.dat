5|$|Although {{one might}} expect stylets to be fossilized <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> made of the mineral calcium phosphate, none have been found. As nemertea are {{otherwise}} completely soft-bodied, one would expect fossils {{of them to be}} extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus Fibratus clouds {{appear as}} thin and fibrous looking. Noticeably, {{they are the}} most common type of cirrus cloud. They might {{indicate}} windy weather, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> mostly formed by wind shear on higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Other sounds {{attributed}} to this rail, such as loud screams, may be incorrect, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> like those {{produced by the}} pale-vented bush-hen (Amaurornis moluccana).|$|E

50|$|In 1912, {{these four}} {{locomotives}} were taken onto the SAR roster as unclassified engines, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> considered obsolete. <b>Since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{excluded from the}} SAR renumbering schedules, they retained their NZASM engine numbers until <b>they</b> <b>were</b> eventually scrapped.|$|R
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> morally equivalent, {{perhaps it}} is not {{surprising}} that the cure for political injustices is identical to the cure for economic ones: namely, the institution of democracy in both economic and political spheres (Russell 1938:234).|$|E
5|$|After {{meeting a}} gay soldier, Sam persuades a {{reluctant}} Kunal {{to pretend that}} they are lovers so they can rent the apartment.

50|$|In 1912, the railmotor, {{along with}} the ten railmotor engines, were taken onto the SAR roster as {{unclassified}} locomotives <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> considered obsolete. <b>Since</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> excluded from the SAR renumbering schedules, they retained their CSAR engine numbers.|$|R

5|$|Although most serpins control {{proteolytic}} cascades, some proteins with a serpin structure are not enzyme inhibitors, {{but instead}} perform diverse {{functions such as}} storage (as in egg white—ovalbumin), transport as in hormone carriage proteins (thyroxine-binding globulin, cortisol-binding globulin) and molecular chaperoning (HSP47). The term serpin is used to describe these members as well, despite their non-inhibitory function, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> evolutionarily related.|$|E
5|$|Bat dung {{has been}} mined as guano from caves {{and used as}} fertilizer. Bats are natural {{reservoirs}} of many diseases including rabies; <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread diseases. Bats are sometimes numerous enough to serve as tourist attractions, and are used as food across Asia and the Pacific Rim. In many cultures, bats are popularly associated with darkness, death, witchcraft and malevolence.|$|E
5|$|Essential genes include Housekeeping genes (critical {{for basic}} cell functions) {{as well as}} genes that are {{expressed}} at different times in the organisms development or life cycle. Housekeeping genes are used as experimental controls when analysing gene expression, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> constitutively expressed at a relatively constant level.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, {{the use of the}} organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic archaea are a vital part of sewage treatment, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> part of the community of microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas. In mineral processing, acidophilic archaea display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.|$|E
5|$|In {{the most}} recent Third Amendment {{decision}} handed down by a federal court, on February 2, 2015, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada held in Mitchell v.

5|$|Individual F. aurea {{trees are}} common on dairy farms in La Cruz, Cañitas and Santa Elena in Costa Rica, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often spared when forest is {{converted}} to pasture.

5|$|Maine Coons require ample {{protein and}} {{nutrients}} in their diets. <b>Since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a large cat breed {{with high levels}} of energy, it is best to feed them quality food. Food that lists meat as the first ingredient is best for the Maine Coon.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are {{essential}} tools in biotechnology, biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology. The yeasts brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) are important model organisms in science, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> simple eukaryotes {{that can be}} grown rapidly in large numbers and are easily manipulated. They are particularly valuable in genetics, genomics and proteomics, for example in protein production.|$|E
5|$|Some areas were, in fact, {{decorated}} with gold: the shields between the Ignudi and the columns between the Prophets and Sibyls. It seems {{very likely that}} the gilding of the shields was part of Michelangelo's original scheme, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> painted to resemble {{a certain type of}} parade shield, a number of which still exist and are decorated in a similar style with gold.|$|E

5|$|Such long-distance {{high-speed}} railways are {{not included}} in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, and it is likely that railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> easier to build. It is likely that a high-speed railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures are {{relatively}} cold for its latitude {{due to the}} cold Malvinas Current and the high altitude. For example, in Tierra del Fuego temperatures are colder than at equal latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current. A characteristic of the temperature pattern is the NW–SE distribution of isotherms due {{to the presence of}} the Andes.|$|E
5|$|The North Ronaldsay sheep is {{an unusual}} breed of domesticated animal, {{subsisting}} largely on a diet of seaweed, <b>since</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> confined to the foreshore {{for most of the}} year to conserve the limited grazing inland.
