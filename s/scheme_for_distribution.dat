50|$|The {{following}} <b>scheme</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> of {{prize money}} {{was used for}} much of the Napoleonic wars, the heyday of prize warfare. Allocation was by eighths. Two eighths of the prize money went to the captain or commander, generally propelling him upwards in political and financial circles. One eighth of the money went to the admiral or commander-in-chief who signed the ship's written orders (unless the orders came directly from the Admiralty in London, in which case this eighth also went to the captain). One eighth was divided among the lieutenants, sailing master, and captain of marines, if any. One eighth was divided among the wardroom warrant officers (surgeon, purser, and chaplain), standing warrant officers (carpenter, boatswain, and gunner), lieutenant of marines, and the master's mates. One eighth was divided among the junior warrant and petty officers, their mates, sergeants of marines, captain's clerk, surgeon's mates, and midshipmen. The final two eighths were divided among the crew, with able and specialist seamen receiving larger shares than ordinary seamen, landsmen, and boys. The pool for the seamen was divided into shares, with each able seaman getting two shares in the pool (referred to as a fifth-class share), an ordinary seaman received a share and a half (referred to as a sixth-class share), landsmen received a share each (a seventh-class share), and boys received a half share each (referred to as an eighth-class share).|$|E

Simplified frequency response model is used to estimate the frequency deviation by adjusting the system parameters under the effect of distributed generation. The amount of power supply at each bus is assessed by utilizing WAM of nodal market power assessment. Then priority of shedding load at various buses is determined to compare with mismatch power at different buses.

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new backup {{protection}} scheme, named coordinated backup protection (CBP) <b>scheme,</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> networks containing distributed generation. The proposed protection scheme {{takes into account}} the issues faced by traditional backup protection, such as difficulty in setting parameters and complex cooperation, and considers the features of distribution networks, such as changeable power flow because of high penetration of distributed generation sources and insufficient measuring quantities. The CBP scheme includes two aspects: coordinated substation protection and regional master substation protection, who also work as nearby backup protection and remote backup protection respectively. The two protections support each other by local information coordination and regional information sharing, in order to improve the reliability of fault identification. The configuration principles and performances of the proposed backup protection scheme are addressed in the paper. Different fault conditions in the IEEE 14 -node system have been used to illustrate and verify the feasibility of the CBP scheme.|$|E

In this paper the possibility and the potentiality of occurring mis-coordination between protection devices in radial distribution network is studied.

40|$|The {{recent changes}} in power network structure, {{development}} in green energy technologies and increased attention on environmental concerns have led to increase the installation of renewable energy based distributed generations (DG) in distribution networks. The increasing penetration of distributed generation in the distribution power system creates new technical and economical challenges; protection is one important topic of these challenges. High penetration of DG will have unfavorable impact on the traditional protection methods; the impact depends on the number, location and size of injected DG. To ensure safe and selective protection devices coordination, the impact of DG {{should be taken into}} account when planning DG interconnection. This paper focuses on investigating the impact of DG on the system protection coordination in radial distribution network; also restrictions of DG capacity is presented in this work in order to keep traditional protection <b>scheme</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> network unchanged; detailed simulations using MATLAB and PowerWorld simulator are conducted...|$|E

It presents both our theoretical contributions to those paradigms as well as alternative contributions that mainly apply to these paradigms. The deliverable contains 6 chapters; two on game theory and four on physics and related paradigms. The game theory part includes contributions to the fundamentals of game theory which we have developed for the context of decentralized non-cooperative decision making in large complex systems. The motivation is to adapt game theory to autonomous networks of which BIONETS is a representative. We describe in the deliverable a rich number of fundamental contributions as well as actual scenarios in wireless networks that make use of them.

40|$|The Electronically Steered Phased Array {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} antennas used in radars applications. Some of the advantages of electronic steering are faster scan, no moving parts and higher reliability. However, the cost of phased arrays has always been prohibitive - in the order of $ 1 M per square meter. The cost of a phased array is largely impacted by the cost of the high frequency electronics at each element and the cost of packaging. Advances in IC integration will allow incorporating multiple elements such as low noise amplifier, power amplifier, phase shifters and up/down-conversion into one or two ICs. Even though the cost for large quantities of ICs (both Silicon and GaAs) has lowered, the high cost of IC packaging and the array backplane still make the use of phase arrays for radar applications costly. The focus of this research is on techniques that reduce the packaging and the backplane cost of large electronically steered arrays. These techniques are based on simplified signal distributions schemes, reduction of layers in the backplane and use of inexpensive materials. Two architectures designed based on these techniques, as well as a novel BGA active antenna package for dual polarized phased arrays are presented. The first architecture, called the series fed row-column architecture, focuses on the reduction of phase shifters and control signals used in the backplane of the array. The second architecture, called the parallel plate feed architecture, is based on a simplified <b>scheme</b> <b>for</b> <b>distribution</b> of the local oscillator signal. A prototype making use of each one of these architectures is presented. Analysis of advantages and disadvantages of each of these architectures is described. The necessity of cost reduction is a factor that can possibly impact the polarization performance of the antenna. This factor is a motivation to study and develop calibration techniques that reduce the cross-polarization of electronically steered phased arrays. Advances on Interleaving Sparse Arrays, a beam forming technique for polarization improvement/correction in phased arrays, are also presented...|$|E
