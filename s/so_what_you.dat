During the recording process, Timberlake spoke cheerfully of the sessions and stated: [...] "I have always envisioned bringing {{the two worlds}} of film and music together for one epic event [...] couldn't be more excited that they will collide in DreamWork's Trolls." [...] Regarding the music itself, Stefani sings about standing out and remaining original as her verses lead up to the chorus; she leads, [...] "This is the moment when everybody's in the light / <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> working with?".|$|E

2500|$|Chibnall was {{determined}} {{to ensure that the}} identity of the killer did not leak until the final episode aired. One reason for the secrecy was obviously commercial, for it kept viewers watching. But Chibnall also believed it would enhance the acting. [...] "There was a number of reasons for it, one of which was obviously {{that a lot of the}} story was driven from characters in the show not knowing, so it enables those characters to behave truthfully in that situation. And also what I wanted was for every performer to slightly suspect their character, and to really think about that, and to suspect each other. ... <b>So</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> get is ambiguity, and what it also means is that any of the performer or performers who are responsible for what happened aren't flagging it or signaling it in any way whatsoever." [...] The producers discussed the need for secrecy at length during pre-production and agreed it was essential. Chibnall also discussed secrecy issues with directors James Strong and Euros Lyn, and they both agreed to its necessity before coming aboard the project. As roles were cast, Chibnall also explained to each actor that the killer's identity would be kept from them until near the end of the production.|$|E
2500|$|In candid {{remarks to}} high-value donors at a {{secretly}} recorded May 2012 private fundraiser, Romney {{said of the}} Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [...] "I look [...] at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political [...] purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and [...] these thorny issues, and I say, 'There's just no way.' And <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do [...] is you say, 'You move things along the best way you can.' You hope for some degree [...] of stability, but you recognize {{that this is going}} to remain an unsolved [...] problem. We live with that in China and Taiwan. All right, we have a [...] potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick [...] the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something [...] will happen and resolve it." [...] He also noted that he had recently received a call from a former U.S. Secretary of State who had suggested that there might be a prospect for accord after the Palestinian elections. Romney made clear in his remarks at the fundraiser that he was opposed to the U.S. exerting any pressure on Israel to help reach a compromise: [...] "The idea of pushing on the Israelis to give something up to [...] get the Palestinians to act is the worst idea in the world." ...|$|E

Shortly before resigning, she tweeted, [...] "RT style guide Rule 1: It is ALWAYS * Ukraine's fault (* add name as applicable)". She told the Guardian [...] "I walked into the newsroom {{and there was an}} eyewitness account making allegations [...] and analysis, if you can call it, from our correspondent in the studio. It was just appalling, {{in a situation like that}} where there are families waiting to be informed and a devastating loss of life." [...] She also noted that [...] "There is bias against Russia but you don’t counter wrong by doing even more wrong" [...] and stated [...] "I have always said it's better to have RT than to not have that perspective, but actually with a story like this and the way they misreport it, it's quite dangerous, I don’t want to be party to it." [...] In follow-up interview she said [...] "In Ukraine, you’re taking a very small part of a much wider story, totally omitted the context of the story, and <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wind up with on air is outright misinformation." [...] Calling RT [...] "mass information manipulation" [...] Firth said [...] "they have a very clear idea in their mind of what they’re trying to prove." [...] She also stated that [...] "The worst-kept secret is that RT is blatant propaganda. I’m one in a very long line of people who have left for the same reason." ...|$|E
