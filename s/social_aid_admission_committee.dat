40|$|This report {{discusses}} a {{multiphase project}} {{to develop a}} user-oriented survey of prior accomplishments of graduate student applicants to <b>aid</b> <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> and graduate departments in the selection process. The three phases included: (1) development of three prototype instruments based on a checklist approach, a semi-documented approach, and an open-ended portfolio approach; (2) development of an instrument with a simplified format that contained positive features of the prototypes; and (3) pilot-testing of the simplified version, on newly enrolled graduate students, in 26 university departments (representinq fields of English, biology and psychology). The third phase investigated the technical soundness and the feasibility of the instrussent's use in the admissions process. Descriptive and correlational analyses of {{the responses to the}} inventory were conducted to describe characteristics of the student...|$|R
40|$|The Supreme Court {{decision}} in the University of Michigan case in 2003 ruled the university's admissions procedures unconstitutional, giving minorities an unfair advantage of acceptance. The ruling stated race may still be used in admissions decisions to achieve diversity, but that race {{could not be used}} to give applicants preferential treatment in the admissions process. Motivated by this case, a researcher, Juan Gilbert, developed a computer based clustering method to <b>aid</b> <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> in choosing diverse entering classes. This method was evaluated using undergraduate admissions data sets from two public universities. Gilbert's method suggested diverse entering classes but did not select well based on merit. A method of improvement is introduced that maintains the academic characteristics of the university through classification, while suggesting diverse entering classes more academically similar to those actually accepted...|$|R
40|$|In {{the face}} of legal and social {{challenges}} to affirmative action, many schools and programs are withdrawing from their efforts to create or support initiatives that allow racial/ethnic consideration {{to be given to}} applicants. This shift may allay fears of bias against majority groups but it also has the potential to disenfranchise some students and programs and leave them without the programs that help create opportunities and diversity at institutions of higher learning. This study examines the use of a software package, Applications Quest, as a possible alternative to <b>aid</b> <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> in providing clear, equitable, and reproducible policies in admissions processes. Rather than focus exclusively on race, Applications Quest creates a measure of “holistic diversity ” that allows equal weight to many factors that contribute to a more diverse student population. A major research university in the South, Experiment University (EU) was enlisted to see if Applications Quest could produce a pool of applicants with the same academic achievement levels as the EU <b>admissions</b> selection <b>committee</b> while increasing holistic diversity using the requirements set forth by the committee. The results of the study show that Applications Quest was able to recommend a more diverse applicant pool than the EU <b>admissions</b> selection <b>committee</b> while meeting the same academic achievement levels in a fraction of the time using the same academic criteria...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The American Dental Education Association’s <b>Admissions</b> <b>Committee</b> Workshop (ADEA ACW) was {{designed}} to chal-lenge dental school administrators and <b>admissions</b> <b>committee</b> members to review their current admissions practices and to explore ways to attract a more diverse student body. Presented {{at the invitation of}} dental schools, this half-day interactive work-shop provides opportunities for a dental school’s administrators, staff, and <b>admissions</b> <b>committee</b> members to learn about the value of diversity in the educational environment and how to implement holistic admissions practices that take into consideration the experiences, attributes, and metrics of candidates for admission. This report explores the rationale {{for the development of the}} ADEA ACW, discusses lessons learned from presentation of the workshop at more than twenty-seven U. S. dental schools, and tracks enrollment trends of underrepresented minority students in dental schools where the workshop has been presented...|$|R

40|$|College of {{pharmacy}} <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> face an im-portant and difficult task in selecting candidates for their professional degree programs. This task {{has become more}} difficult {{as the number of}} applicants has continued to increase. 1 Because the admissions process is highly competitive, with more applicants than space available, it is incumbent upon the <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> to select candidates who will not only excel academically, but also will have the necessary characteristics to advance the profession {{of pharmacy}}. 2 To achieve this goal, <b>admissions</b> <b>committees</b> need to apply and continually evaluate high-ly predictive and valid selection methods that increase the likelihood of selecting students who can withstand the rigors of the curriculum and become successful prac-titioners and scientists. 3 Numerous reports have been published that addressed which prepharmacy admission variables are the best pre-dictors of academic performance in the professional pro-gram. Cognitive predictors have included undergraduate grade point average (GPA), Pharmacy College Admis-sions Test (PCAT) scores, Scholastic Assessment Tes...|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, several Community {{settlement}} in the Negev and the Galilee were accused of barring Arab applicants from moving in.
