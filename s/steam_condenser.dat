2500|$|Early {{capacitors}} {{were known}} as condensers, a term that is still occasionally used today, particularly in high power applications, such as automotive systems. The term was first {{used for this purpose}} by Alessandro Volta in 1782, with reference to the device's ability to store a higher density of electric charge than was possible with an isolated conductor. [...] The term became deprecated because of the ambiguous meaning of <b>steam</b> <b>condenser,</b> with capacitor becoming the recommended term from 1926.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} an experimental and numerical study of <b>steam</b> <b>condensing</b> flow in a linear cascade of turbine stator blades. The experimental research {{was performed on}} the facility of a small scale steam power plant located at Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland. The test rig of the facility allows us to perform the tests of steam transonic flows for the conditions corresponding to these which prevail in the low-pressure (LP) <b>condensing</b> <b>steam</b> turbine stages. The experimental data of <b>steam</b> <b>condensing</b> flow through the blade-to- blade stator channel were compared with numerical results obtained using the in-house CFD numerical code TraCoFlow. Obtained results confirmed a good quality of the performed experiment and numerical calculations...|$|R
50|$|Type EW2 tenders were rebuilt from Type CZ tenders {{which had}} entered service between 1953 and 1955 as <b>steam</b> <b>condensing</b> tenders to the Class 25 4-8-4 Northern type <b>condensing</b> <b>steam</b> locomotives.

2500|$|A {{fundamental}} change in working principles was brought about by Scotsman James Watt. With financial support from his business partner Englishman Matthew Boulton, he had succeeded by 1778 in perfecting his steam engine, which incorporated a series of radical improvements, notably the closing off of {{the upper part of}} the cylinder, thereby making the low-pressure steam drive the top of the piston instead of the atmosphere, use of a steam jacket and the celebrated separate <b>steam</b> <b>condenser</b> chamber. [...] The separate condenser did away with the cooling water that had been injected directly into the cylinder, which cooled the cylinder and wasted steam. [...] Likewise, the steam jacket kept steam from condensing in the cylinder, also improving efficiency. [...] These improvements increased engine efficiency so that Boulton & Watts engines used only 20–25% as much coal per horsepower-hour as Newcomen's. Boulton and Watt opened the Soho Foundry for the manufacture of such engines in 1795.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{designed}} to meet Air Ministry specification C.16/28, which required the ability to carry 30 troops and their equipment for 1,200 miles (1,930km) and was the same specification that produced the Handley Page H.P.43 and the Vickers Type 163. [...] The TC.33 was a large single bay biplane with no stagger and 7° sweepback. [...] Both wings had metal lattice spars and metal ribs with fabric covering. [...] The lower wing was unusual in that its centre section had marked anhedral so that the main spars met {{at the top of}} the fuselage, leaving the interior unobstructed. A similar arrangement, though with less anhedral was used by the slightly earlier Handley Page H.P.42 airliner. The outer end of this centre section was strut braced to the lower fuselage. The TC.33 was also unusual in having a lower wing of (slightly) greater span than the upper; most unequal span wings had a larger upper wing. The four evaporatively cooled Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines were mounted in two nacelles, each containing a tractor-pusher pair together with their <b>steam</b> <b>condenser</b> and mounted between the wings at the end of the centre section. They were each carried by two vertical struts above the nacelle, complicated strutting below and by further strutting to the lower wing roots. The wide (22ft 6 in (6.8 m)) split axle undercarriage had vertical legs from the front wing spar at the same point and bracing from the axles to the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|On 4 August 2017, unit 7 {{generator}} of {{the plant}} tripped at 9:25 a.m. due to low vacuity in its <b>steam</b> <b>condenser</b> system which triggered the safety protection system. The event caused a power reduction of 500 MW but it was quickly restored and restarted at 12:35 p.m.|$|E
40|$|When steam {{is used in}} fluid machinery, phase {{transition}} can occur that affects not only the flow fields but also machine performance. Therefore, to achieve an accurate prediction of <b>steam</b> <b>condensing</b> flow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), phase-transition phenomena should be considered and a non-equilibrium wet-steam model is required. Such a model is implemented in this study using the in-house code T-Flow, and the flow fields – including phase-transition phenomena – in various Laval nozzles are examined. The results for multi-phase flows can be obtained in relatively short time by using mixture assumption and an inner-iteration method. The calculated results reflect {{the characteristics of the}} condensing flows well and are comparable with those obtained experimentally. Also, {{it was found that the}} superheating level of incoming steam can explain the tendency of condensation in the nozzles considered in a simple way. In addition, <b>steam</b> <b>condensing</b> flows in the blade cascades were simulated. As a result, the predicted blade loading agreed well with the experimental data and the superheating level at inlet was responsible for the condensation trend not only in the nozzles but also in the cascades. In future work, the characteristics of <b>steam</b> <b>condensing</b> flow in a steam turbine where complex flows and {{phase transition}} occur can be investigated using the presented model...|$|R

50|$|With the {{appropriate}} salts, this can reduce, or even eliminate {{the consumption of}} cooling water in the power plant.

25|$|As {{speeds and}} {{distances}} increased, mechanisms were developed that injected thick mineral {{oil into the}} steam supply.
