5|$|Of the {{fin whale}} stomachs sampled off British Columbia between 1963 and 1967, euphausiids {{dominated}} the diet for {{four of the}} five years (82.3 to 100% of the diet), while copepods only formed a major portion of the diet in 1965 (35.7%). Miscellaneous fish, squid, and octopus played only a very minor part of the diet in two of the five years (3.6 to 4.8%). Fin whales caught off California between 1959 and 1970 fed on the pelagic euphausiid Euphausia pacifica (86% of sampled individuals), the more neritic euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera (9%), and the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) (7%); only trace amounts (<0.5% each) were found of Pacific <b>saury</b> (C. saira) and juvenile rockfish (Sebastes jordani). In the Gulf of California, they have been observed feeding on swarms of the euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex.|$|E
5|$|In the North Pacific, {{they feed}} on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia, Thysanoessa, and Nyctiphanes, large copepods in the genus Neocalanus, small {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Engraulis, Mallotus, Clupea, and Theragra), and squid. Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and Bering Sea from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern Bering Sea and off Kamchatka. In the northern Bering Sea (north of 58°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern Bering Sea. Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific <b>saury,</b> Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E
25|$|The highly {{migratory species}} include: tuna and tuna-like species (albacore, Atlantic bluefin, bigeye tuna, skipjack, yellowfin, blackfin, little tunny, Pacific bluefin, {{southern}} bluefin and bullet), pomfret, marlin, sailfish, swordfish, <b>saury</b> and oceangoing sharks, dolphins and other cetaceans.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sauries</b> are marine {{epipelagic fish}} which live in {{tropical}} and temperate waters. These fish often jump while swimming near the surface, skimming the water, {{which is similar}} to flying fish, a fellow member of the beloniformes order. The jaws of <b>sauries</b> are beak-like, ranging from long, slender beaks to relatively short ones with the lower jaw only slightly elongated. The mouth openings of <b>sauries,</b> however, are small and the jaws have weak teeth. The most distinctive feature of <b>sauries,</b> however, is the presence of a row of small finlets behind the dorsal and anal fins. They also lack swim bladders. <b>Sauries</b> grow to a maximum length of about 46 cm, but the group also includes the smallest of all epipelagic fish, Cololabis adocetus, with an adult length of just 7.5 cm.|$|R

60|$|The {{fishermen}} {{also helped}} him not a little, by giving him many rare kinds of fish or refuse from their nets, which he duly examined and classified. As a rule, the hardy men who {{go on the}} smacks have a profound contempt for natural history, {{and will not be}} tempted, even by offers of money, to assist those whom they consider as half-daft gentlefolk in what seems to them a perfectly useless and almost childish amusement. But it was different with Tam Edward, the strange shoemaker whom they all knew so well; if HE wanted fish or rubbish for his neat collection in the home-made glass cases, why, of course he could have them, and welcome. So they brought him rare sand-suckers, and blue-striped wrasse, and <b>saury</b> pike, and gigantic cuttle-fish, four feet long, to his heart's content. Edward's daughters were now also old enough to help him in his scientific studies. They used to watch for the clearing of the nets, and pick out of the refuse whatever they thought would interest or please their father. But the fish themselves were Edward's greatest helpers and assistants. As Dr. Smiles quaintly puts it, they were {{the best of all possible}} dredgers. His daughters used to secure him as many stomachs as possible, and from their contents he picked out an immense number of beautiful and valuable specimens. The bill of fare of the cod alone comprised an incredible variety of small crabs, shells, shrimps, sea-mice, star-fish, jelly-fish, sea anemones, eggs, and zoophytes. All these went to swell Edward's new collection of marine animals.|$|E
50|$|The <b>saury</b> (Cololabis adocetus) (not to be {{confused}} with the Pacific <b>saury,</b> another species in the *Cololabis* genus) is a member of the family Scomberesocidae, or the <b>saury</b> family. It is widespread in the Eastern Pacific in the surface waters, typically remaining in the top 50 centimeters of the water column - although it can be found at depths of up to 1 meter. It can grow to a length of about 5 centimeters. The <b>saury</b> generally lives in waters between 5 and 12 degrees Celsius. The <b>saury</b> is a highly migratory fish.|$|E
50|$|The {{contact was}} made by radar at about 22:25. <b>Saury</b> set a course to {{intercept}} the targets, two large warships and a destroyer. At 03:03 on 31 July, <b>Saury</b> submerged. At 03:25, she turned to attack; losing, regaining, losing, and then regaining depth control. By then, the targets had passed firing bearing. A few seconds later, at 03:38, the sound operator reported a bearing of 180 degrees relative. Almost simultaneously, the periscope revealed a destroyer with a zero degree angle on the bow. The commanding officer ordered <b>Saury</b> deep. A few seconds later, two jolts shook <b>Saury.</b> She took on a five-degree list to port. She continued to go deeper, then retired to the east. No depth charges were heard. <b>Saury</b> remained at 175 to 200 ft all day. At 20:20, she surfaced. Her periscope shears were bent 30 degrees from the vertical to starboard. All equipment mounted therein was damaged. Both periscopes and both radars were out of commission. <b>Saury</b> had been blinded.|$|E
