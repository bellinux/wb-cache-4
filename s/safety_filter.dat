50|$|The {{infrared}} light used in telecommunications cannot be seen, {{so there is}} a potential laser safety hazard to technicians. The eye's natural defense against sudden exposure to bright light is the blink reflex, which is not triggered by infrared sources. In some cases the power levels are high enough to damage eyes, particularly when lenses or microscopes are used to inspect fibers that are emitting invisible {{infrared light}}. Inspection microscopes with optical <b>safety</b> <b>filters</b> are available to guard against this. More recently indirect viewing aids are used, which can comprise a camera mounted within a handheld device, which has an opening for the connectorized fiber and a USB output for connection to a display device such as a laptop. This makes the activity of looking for damage or dirt on the connector face much safer.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{integrate}} a failsafe {{system and to}} improve the cleaning intensity a new cleaning method was recently developed, the CPP (coupled pressure pulse) cleaning (Heidenreich et al. 2001). For the CPP method the cleaning system is directly coupled with the filter candles. One feature of this new technique is that the cleaning gas pressure exceeds the system pressure only by 0. 05 to 0. 1 MPa, whereas in case of conventional jet pulse systems two times the system pressure (at least 0. 6 MPa) is standard. The key advantage of the coupled pressure pulse cleaning is that a <b>safety</b> <b>filter</b> for each filter candle can be integrated in the clean gas side of the filter. Thus, a candle failure is not longer a serious problem. The integrated <b>safety</b> <b>filter</b> enables {{the operation of the}} filter system also in case a filter candle breaks. This increases the availability of the filter and prevents an unscheduled costly shut-down of the system. In this paper the design of the ceramic filter wit h the failsafe system and the CPP cleaning will be described. The new developed <b>safety</b> <b>filter</b> elements, their pressure drop and their filtration and clogging behavior will be shown. Tests of single system components, of the whole filter system and first experiences of operating this system will be reported...|$|E
40|$|ROBOPuppet is {{a method}} to create inexpensive, tabletop-sized robot models to provide {{teleoperation}} input to full-sized robots.

This procedure is generalizable to variety of robots, and parts cost approximately seventeen dollars per link. We also present a simple software tool for fast calibration of the puppet-robot mapping, and a <b>safety</b> <b>filtering</b> procedure that sanitizes the noisy inputs so that the robot avoids collisions and satisfies dynamic constraints.

40|$|Abstract—This paper studies {{assisted}} teleoperation {{techniques for}} controlling a 6 DOF robot arm using click-and-drag input {{from a computer}} mouse. Experiments were conducted to investigate how task performance and user preferences are affected by low-level motion control strategies, which must deal with collision avoidance, dynamics constraints, and erroneous input. Five strategies were implemented and compared. As baseline strategies we study direct joint control and Cartesian positioning via inverse kinematics. We also implemented three obstacle avoidance strategies, including a predictive <b>safety</b> <b>filter,</b> a reactive potential field, and a real-time sample-based motion planner. Blind experimental trials assigned 22 novice subjects to five subgroups corresponding to each strategy {{and asked them to}} control the arm in simulation on a variety of reaching tasks in cluttered environments. Unsurprisingly, the obstacle avoidance strategies achieve major safety improvements, although subjects felt noticeably less in control of the robot than those using the baseline methods. The motion planning strategy shows the most promise; it completed tasks twice as fast as any other method and received high ratings for perceived safety, cooperativeness, and overall satisfaction.

40|$|Ferrihydrite in a {{suspension}} {{has been studied}} as a solution for purification of arsenic contaminated water. Many development countries, amongst them Burkina Faso, have arsenic in their groundwater and the current methods for purification are too expensive. Measurements have shown extremely high levels of arsenic in the groundwater in several places in Burkina Faso. Since the availability of surface water is limited, the groundwater is still used as drinking water.   A suspension of ferrihydrite has capacity to adsorb arsenic in water due to its chemical characteristics. Small-scale laboratory work with ferrihydrite suspensions has been performed in parallel in Uppsala, Sweden, and Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. To purify the water {{with regard to the}} economical and practical circumstances in Burkina Faso, a column with <b>safety</b> <b>filter</b> was made out of simple materials such as plastic bottles, plastic tubes and glass wool. The contaminated water was flowing upwards through the column to prevent the filter from clogging.   In Uppsala it was discovered that a 1 L ferrihydrite suspension containing 10 g ferrihydrite can adsorb 0. 7 g arsenic while it was shaken and centrifuged well. In Ouagadougou it was possible, in the setup, to clean 2 L arsenic contaminated water with the concentration of 100 µg/L. The conclusions from the experiments in this project are that ferrihydrite can adsorb arsenic in contaminated water but that the setup used needs to be further evaluated and develope...|$|E

40|$|Highly {{sensitive}} infrared detectors have to {{be protected}} against the impact of intense infrared radiation, for example from lasers or sun light. Conventional laser <b>safety</b> <b>filters</b> work only in a limited wavelength range, electro-optical shutters reduce the transmission significantly and micro-opto-mechanical systems (MOEMS) show problems with picture quality due to difficulties in aligning precisely all mirrors. As in many applications the IR illumination originates from a local spot in the image field, filters consisting of many segments that can be switched individually from ?transparent? to ?opaque? are therefore desirable. Individual switching requires a sophisticated combination of infrared materials and an optimized geometrical design, to achieve fast switching in combination with negligible crosstalk between neighbouring segments. We have realized fast switchable matrix-addressable infrared filters in the optical range between 2 and 12 ?m based on complex composite devices. Vanadium dioxide (VO 2) {{was used as a}} thermochromic layer, diamond as a heat-conducting layer, and chalcogenide glass as a heat insulating submount. Finite element calculations accompanied by an extensive series of experiments showed, that switching times less than 1 ms can be achieved if all materials are properly designed, prepared and matched together. A first prototype with a 10 x 10 pixel array has been realized at Fraunhofer IAF and successfully tested.

40|$|Abstract—We explore BGP safety, the {{question}} of whether a BGP system converges to a stable routing, in light of several BGP implementation features that have not been fully included in the previous theoretical analyses. We show that Route Flap Damping, MRAI timers, and other intra-router features can cause a router to briefly send “spurious ” announcements of less-preferred routes. We demonstrate that, even in simple configurations, this short-term spurious behavior may cause long-term divergence in global routing. We then present DPVP, a general model that unifies these sources of spurious announcements in order to examine their impact on BGP safety. In this new, more robust model of BGP behavior, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for safety, which furthermore admits an efficient algorithm for checking BGP safety in most practical circumstances — two complementary results that have been elusive in the past decade’s worth of classical studies of BGP convergence in more simple models. We also consider the implications of spurious updates for well-known results on dispute wheels and <b>safety</b> under <b>filtering.</b> I...|$|R

In this group placement is termed “truly prophylactic” to differentiate from {{placement in}} a patient with documented deep venous thrombosis which has not yet embolized. A retrospective review of Greenfield filter placement at five Dayton, Ohio, community hospitals over three years revealed 59 filters placed in 58 patients.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 In {{the wake}} of nuclear {{accidents}} such as Three Mile Island Unit 2 and Fukushima, the nuclear power industry’s safety record is scrutinized. Today the main concerns lies with hydrogen production in a nuclear reactor core when the zirconium fuel cladding reacts with the water coolant during an accident, creating combustible hydrogen gas. This concern is being addressed with new technologies for new nuclear power plants {{and the development of}} hydrogen mitigation techniques for currently operating plants. This study looks at a few potential safety upgrades including hydrogen mitigation upgrades such as hydrogen ignitors and Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners (PARs). As well as some radionuclide release mitigation <b>safety</b> upgrades, <b>filtered</b> vents and hardened vents. Using event tree/fault tree analysis to obtain probabilities and consequences of accidents and a newly developed “Economic Safety Factor (ESF) ” has been proposed. The ESF is a metric that is aimed at helping utilities and regulators decide whether a particular safety upgrade is beneficial for the cost. While the ESF is not the only mechanism a utility or regulator will consider when evaluating plant changes, it can give a good indication of whether or not a safety upgrade, or another type of upgrade is a good idea. It was found that hydrogen ignitors and PAR should be implemented. The addition of filtered vents is dependent on their cost {{based on the results of}} an ESF cost-benefit analysis method.

For experi-mental demonstration, a fourth-order AFSIW band pass filter operating in the 20. 88 to 21. 11 GHz band is designed and fabri-cated. Due to fabrication tolerances, it is shown that its perfor-mances are not in line with expected results. Using capacitive post tuning, characteristics are improved and agree with opti-mized results.

40|$|This thesis makes five {{important}} {{contributions to the}} development of an automotive <b>safety</b> system: <b>filtering</b> algorithms, three modelling frameworks concerning the usage of radar detections in tracking, vehicle motion, and decision-making for intervention decisions, and finally the implementation architecture. In the filtering context, we have developed a new sigma-point method for estimating the moments of a transformed Gaussian random variable. These estimates are derived from analytical expressions and are based on evaluations of the transforming function. The method is applied to the moment estimation task in a Gaussian filter and the resulting algorithm is denoted the marginalised Kalman filter (MKF). Compared to traditional radar models, ours is specifically designed for vehicle radars, which often yield several measurements from each object. These measurements can provide useful information, such as vehicle orientation, if they are accurately modelled. We introduce a tracking filter using such a sensor model, and show how the complex data association problem can be facilitated by merging similar hypotheses into groups. The presented vehicle motion model includes the control input from the driver. Uncertainties regarding, e. g., driver style, are formally treated with increased prediction accuracy as a result. Similar to this model, the third framework also takes the driver into consideration by allowing interventions only when the driver is believed to accept them. Our evaluations indicate an increased benefit in collision avoidance systems [...] - particularly in traffic situations where the future trajectory of another road user is hard for the driver to predict. Finally, we present a modular functional design for implementing a real-time data fusion system. We conclude that a tracking system, using modern estimation techniques, is well suited for sensor data fusion in an automotive environment...|$|R
