While {{recognising}} the need for <b>sub-delegation</b> <b>of</b> order-making <b>powers</b> in some situations, the report considered that the case for unlimited sub-delegation was sufficiently made out, and that some limits should be imposed, for example, by specifying categories of person (such as local authorities) to whom powers could be delegated. The report found that the <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> Parliamentary supervision in the amended bill were adequate, but the ability for a minister to change the law to implement recommendations of Law Commission or to consolidate and simplify legislation were thought to be inappropriate, saying that [...] "the statute law should be made by Parliament, not by Ministers".|$|R

25|$|The next such {{educational}} conference, held in 1969 in Congo (Kinshasa), {{would end}} in a relative win for the Canadian government. Congo (Kinshasa), which was a former colony of Belgium, was not as susceptible to French pressure as Gabon. At first it sent an invitation only to the federal government, which happily contacted the provinces concerned (Quebec, New Brunswick, Ontario, and Manitoba) about organizing a single delegation. Quebec, dismayed over the lack on an invitation, complained to the French, who then put pressure on Zaire, which then issued a second belated invitation to Quebec – offering as justification Quebec's attendance at the Gabon conference. Despite the last-minute offer, Canada and the provinces had already reached an agreement whereby the provinces would attend as <b>sub-delegations</b> <b>of</b> the main Canadian delegation.|$|R

It considers some problems with the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> Poland {{as well as some}} specific features <b>of</b> the <b>power</b> relations in East-Central Europe. Considering the idea <b>of</b> <b>power</b> present in Morgenthau’s political thought the author indicates the flexibility of this concept as well as some Morgenthau’s warnings against a narrow and single-factor understanding <b>of</b> <b>power.</b> Discussing the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> Poland the article underlines both material and some less tangible factors, including the social reception of the liberal reforms. The relations of Poland with Russia and Germany illustrate the relative character <b>of</b> <b>power</b> as both neigbours remain much more powerful countries in any aspects <b>of</b> <b>power</b> defined by Morgenthau. Besides, the Morgenthau’s concept <b>of</b> <b>power</b> helps to identify some regional problems that may destabilize the political relations in Europe. Thus the effective Polish foreign policy should be based on the proper evaluation <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and intentions <b>of</b> its two key neigbours as well as the understanding of mechanisms accompanying the power relations in the region...|$|R
