The aesthetic and constructional design of the bridges was also heavily criticised. Over the next 15 years, almost all of the original carriageway had to be replaced with asphalt.|$|E

A binding agent may be mixed in to form a base course for the new pavement, or it may be left unbound to form a <b>subbase</b> course. Common binding agents include asphalt emulsion, fly ash, Portland cement or calcium chloride. It can also be mixed with aggregate, recycled asphalt millings, or crushed Portland cement to improve the gradation of the material, and can provide a design life cycle of 30 years with proper lab testing and field verification.|$|E

500|$|To {{reconstruct}} No. 1's existing runway as an all-weather strip, {{the bomb}} craters {{had to have}} the water pumped out of them and then be filled in. Sandstone from a quarry on northern Labuan was placed over the clay and sand <b>subbase,</b> and the runway was topped with crushed coral from the west coast of the island, and sealed with bitumen. The [...] runway had 70 hardstandings for aircraft. With 70 also on the dry weather strip, the air base could accommodate 140 aircraft. The 9th Division's engineers also undertook a wide range of construction projects on Labuan. These included building [...] of storage, new port facilities, bridges and oil tanks as well as surfacing [...] of roads. A wharf for Liberty ships was begun on 18 June, allowing the first ship to berth on 10 July.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} level of {{strength}} provided by concrete pavements, uniformity trumps strength for subgrades and <b>subbases.</b> The primary objective for building a roadbed or foundation for concrete pavement is to obtain a condition of uniform support for the pavement that will prevail throughout its service life. This mindset is somewhat contrary to the traditional thought that thickness and/or strength are the key objectives for building a long-lasting roadbed. The reasoning for this change in mindset is {{a better understanding of how}} concrete pavements distribute loads and what this means for the subgrades and/or <b>subbases</b> below them. This publication details how uniformity is more important than strength for subgrades and <b>subbases</b> used in concrete pavement structures, what this means in regards to design and construction, how to obtain a uniform support condition, and the importance of long-lasting uniformity. More on these topics is available in ACPA’s EB 204 P, “Subgrades and <b>Subbases</b> for Concrete Pavements. ” Strength versus Uniformity Paving concrete typically has a specified 28 -day flexural strength ranging from 550 to 750 psi (3. 8 to 5. 2 MPa), or greater, and a modulus of elasticity ranging from 4 to 6 million psi (28, 000 to 41, 000 MPa), helping provide a high degree of rigidity. This rigidity enables concrete pavements to distribute loads over large areas of the supporting layers (Figure 1), resulting in very low pressures and deflections in those layers...|$|R
2500|$|Asphalt {{overlays}} {{are sometimes}} laid over distressed concrete {{to restore a}} smooth wearing surface. A disadvantage of this method is that movement in the joints between the underlying concrete slabs, whether from thermal expansion and contraction, or from deflection of the concrete slabs from truck axle loads, usually causes [...] reflective cracks in the asphalt. To decrease reflective cracking, concrete pavement is broken apart through a break and seat, crack and seat, or rubblization process. Geosynthetics {{can be used for}} reflective crack control. With break and seat and crack and seat processes, a heavy weight is dropped on the concrete to induce cracking, then a heavy roller is used to seat the resultant pieces into the <b>subbase.</b> The main difference between the two processes is the equipment used to break the concrete pavement {{and the size of the}} resulting pieces. The theory is frequent small cracks will spread thermal stress over a wider area than infrequent large joints, reducing the stress on the overlying asphalt pavement. Rubblization is a more complete fracturing of the old, worn-out concrete, effectively converting the old pavement into an aggregate base for a new asphalt road.|$|E
2500|$|Conversely, {{in order}} theory, one often {{makes use of}} topological results. There are various ways to define subsets of an order which can be {{considered}} as open sets of a topology. Especially, it is interesting to consider topologies on a poset (X, ≤) that in turn induce ≤ as their specialization order. The finest such topology is the Alexandrov topology, given by taking all upper sets as opens. Conversely, the coarsest topology that induces the specialization order is the upper topology, having the complements of principal ideals (i.e. sets of the form {y in X | y ≤ x} for some x) as a <b>subbase.</b> Additionally, a topology with specialization order ≤ may be order consistent, meaning that their open sets are [...] "inaccessible by directed suprema" [...] (with respect to ≤). The finest order consistent topology is the Scott topology, which is coarser than the Alexandrov topology. A third important topology in this spirit is the Lawson topology. There are close connections between these topologies and the concepts of order theory. For example, a function preserves directed suprema iff it is continuous with respect to the Scott topology (for this reason this order theoretic property is also called Scott-continuity).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Many coherence-based {{approaches}} to inconsistency handling within propositional belief bases {{have been proposed}} so far. They consist in selecting one or several preferred consistent <b>subbases</b> of the given (usually inconsistent) stratified belief base (SBB), then using classical inference {{from some of the}} selected <b>subbases.</b> Unfortunately, deciding the corresponding inference relations is typically hard from the computational complexity point of view. In this paper, we show how some knowledge compilation techniques for classical inference can be used to circumvent the intractability of such sophisticated inference relations. For several families of compiled SBBs and several selection policies, the complexity of skeptical inference is identified. Interestingly, some tractable restrictions are exhibited. ...|$|R
