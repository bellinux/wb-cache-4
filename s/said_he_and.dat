5|$|In {{the same}} interview, Earp claimed that George Hoyt had {{intended}} to kill him, although newspaper accounts from that time report differently. He also <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Bat Masterson had confronted Clay Allison when {{he was sent to}} Dodge City to finish George Hoyt's job, and that they had forced him to back down. Two other accounts contradicted Earp, crediting cattleman Dick McNulty and Long Branch Saloon owner Chalk Beeson with convincing Allison and his cowboys to surrender their guns. Cowboy Charlie Siringo witnessed the incident and left a written account.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the band}} had been offered {{large sums of money}} to reunite for concerts and tours, and had turned the offers down. Rumors of tension between de la Rocha and the other former band members {{subsequently}} circulated, but Commerford said that he and de la Rocha saw each other often and went surfing together, while Morello <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> de la Rocha communicated by phone, and had met up at a September 15, 2005 protest in support of the South Central Farm.|$|E

60|$|Bertie {{was sorry}} {{when he saw}} that she was hurt by what <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> came <b>and</b> squatted on the floor close before her face to make his peace with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure you}} aren't well. You {{must go to}} bed," [...] <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>And</b> <b>he</b> kneeled <b>and</b> unfastened his visitor's boots. Meanwhile the kettle began to boil, he put a hot-water bottle into the bed.|$|R
5|$|On September 7, Google Inc. {{helped the}} search for the aviator through its {{connections}} to contractors that provide satellite imagery for its Google Earth software. Richard Branson, a British billionaire and friend of Fossett, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> others were coordinating efforts with Google to see if any of the high-resolution images might include Fossett's aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, on 17 November 2009, Näslund {{announced he}} {{was coming out of}} retirement to join Forsberg with Modo {{for the remainder of the}} 2009–10 Elitserien season. He explained that while he did not miss playing, both he and Forsberg desired to help their former club out of financial troubles and a last-place standing in the league, facing potential relegation. The announcement crashed the Modo web server as a result of the heavy volume of people visiting the site. As a board member of the club, Näslund <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Forsberg would play without salary.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's exhortations to the Vietnamese {{officers}} to remove Khánh {{were not a}} secret, and it had an unwanted side-effect; it accelerated coup action from figures not favored by Washington. The likes of Kỳ, Thiệu, Có and Cang were {{not yet ready to}} stage a coup, and their preparations were well behind those of Thảo, an unstinting plotter. On February 14, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang reported to an American official that he was involved in plotting against Khánh but <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> the other Young Turks were not ready because the military was not sufficiently united. He said they had to wait for a time when a coup could be carried out without generating unspecified side-effects. Khang was aware Thảo was planning a move with some generals who were now on the outer. He anticipated trouble in trying to keep his subordinates from joining Thảo, as his men might not wait for the younger generals to launch their coup if they thought it would never come.|$|E

5|$|The band {{encountered}} several setbacks {{through the}} second half of 2014. The August concert in Tel Aviv was canceled due to an armed conflict between Israel and Gaza. Megadeth was scheduled to appear on Motörhead's Motörboat cruise in late September, but withdrew because of Mustaine's complications following his cervical spine surgery. In late November, Drover quit the band after ten years, wanting to pursue his own musical interests. This was quickly followed by the departure of Broderick, due to artistic and musical differences. Ellefson denied rumors that Megadeth would disband, and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Mustaine would continue working on new music. Mustaine said {{that one of the reasons}} for Broderick's and Drover's departure was the frustration caused by Megadeth's fan base demanding a reunion with Friedman and Menza. Tragically, former Megadeth drummer Nick Menza died from a heart attack on May 21, 2016 while performing with OHM at a jazz club in Los Angeles. Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Kiko Loureiro of Angra were brought in to perform on Megadeth's fifteenth studio album.|$|E

25|$|Although {{his parents}} did not divorce until 1999, their {{marriage}} was in serious trouble throughout Lindh's adolescence. His father often left their Marin residence for extended periods to live in San Francisco with a male lover, as he was an acknowledged homosexual. Frank Lindh <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Marilyn had been effectively separated since 1997.|$|E
25|$|However, in 2002 ufologist James W. Moseley {{revealed}} that the letter was a hoax.

25|$|In 1960 Barry {{was elected}} {{as the first}} {{chairman}} of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). He helped develop an organizing project in McComb, Mississippi. The project was both a voter registration and a direct action endeavor. Barry <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> other activists lived with the local people {{in order to stay}} safe, as well as to learn {{what it was like to}} live there. They could use that information to organize the members of the SNCC accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Nearly {{two weeks}} after the coup, TRT's deputy leader Sontaya Kunplome and his 20-member faction {{resigned}} from the party. Somsak Thepsuthin, another TRT's deputy leader <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his Wan Nam Yom faction which has about 80 members would also submit their resignation.

He complained that he had been forced into hiding because of harassment from the secret police, that he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his family were being followed, that his staff were being harassed, and that the SBU were spreading a rumor that he was wanted on a murder charge.|$|E

25|$|Shevardnadze was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of political reform in the Georgian SSR. He created agencies attached to the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party whose main task was studying, analysing and moulding public opinion. These agencies worked closely with Georgia's communications networks and media; government ministers and Shevardnadze were regularly interviewed live on television. Shevardnadze criticised flattery in Georgia and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his government's activities needed to be criticised more often, especially during party congresses. He showed himself, even before Mikhail Gorbachev's rise to power, to be a firm supporter of people's democracyi.e. power from below.|$|E
25|$|Gene Silverberg <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> {{his brother}} began feuding with Jordan in 1996, when Jordan {{reportedly}} attempted {{to change the}} restaurant from a family-oriented business to a more upscale establishment. In 1997, Jordan opened his own Chicago restaurant, the more formal One Sixtyblue, and generally stopped appearing at the other except for charity events. Jordan's namesake restaurant continued to draw crowds despite his absence, but after Jordan's second retirement in January 1999, the Silverbergs announced that they would remodel the site as Sammy Sosa's Restaurant, a family attraction named after the Chicago Cubs baseball player. They planned to reopen Michael Jordan's Restaurant in a smaller building.|$|E
