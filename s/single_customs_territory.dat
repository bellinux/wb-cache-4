5000|$|As of 2010, most customs unions rarely {{operate as}} a single entity and are {{represented}} in relations with other customs territories either jointly by their member states governments and the union institutions or by only the member states. Thus, in practice, they rarely appear as a <b>single</b> <b>customs</b> <b>territory</b> and instead they {{operate as a}} multiple separate customs territories that have the same or similar customs tariff. The European Union (EU) is the only trade bloc in which the union institutions have exclusive competence over the common external tariff and thus sign and ratify agreements with foreign states without direct participation of the EU member states. [...] The EU is also the only trade bloc member of the World Trade Organization, but the EU member states are continuing their own separate memberships, as {{not all of the}} WTO issues fall within the scope of exclusive EU competences.|$|E
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the customs policy of the Czech Republic as an EU Member State. The aim of the study is divided into three areas: The first {{objective}} is to characterize the changes that occurred in the Czech Republic after it became part of the <b>single</b> <b>customs</b> <b>territory</b> of the EU. Therefore to clearly describe the basic features of the EU customs policy - its principles, tools and techniques for customs proceedings, each customs procedures, Common Customs Tariff, etc. The second goal is to provide an overview of collecting customs duties in the territory of the Czech Republic just before and after joining the EU. The third objective of this diploma thesis is to characterize and analyze the revenues from customs duties throughout the EU, as the customs duties are one of the Traditional Own Resources (TOR) of the EU budget...|$|E

Since our last Annual Report, the Community has witnessed a number of important developments in our quest for greater and deeper integration for the people of East Africa. The signing of the East African Monetary Union Protocol by the Heads of State in November, 2013, and operationalisation of the <b>Single</b> <b>Customs</b> <b>Territory</b> is a clear testimony that the Community is moving forward.

50|$|A <b>customs</b> <b>territory</b> {{usually has}} {{inspection}} stations at its borders, {{but this is}} not always the case. For example, there are no border checks between the EU <b>customs</b> <b>territory</b> and the Switzerland—Liechtenstein <b>customs</b> <b>territory,</b> since both are part of the Schengen Area. There can also be border checks between two parts of the same <b>customs</b> <b>territory.</b> For example, there are border checks between the Schengen Area portions of the EU <b>customs</b> <b>territory</b> and those portions in the Common Travel Area formed by the United Kingdom, Crown Dependencies, and Ireland. Another example is the border checks between Israel and the Palestinian Territories, which are in a customs union. The European Union example is particularly complicated, since it also has different boundaries for EU VAT area, the EU excise duty area, the area where EU law applies, and the area considered by the EU statistics agency.|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{establishes}} the current regulatory and institutional framework for fair {{trade in the}} European Union, both in some of its Member States (part I) and {{at the level of}} the EU itself (part II). Enquiring into how fair trade products are marketed, regulated and indeed promoted in the EU is of interest from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Key stages in the development of the international fair trade movement throughout the 1970 s- 1990 s occurred on EU territory, and particularly in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and the majority of EU Member States have presently well-consolidated fair trade structures. In addition, and plausibly as a consequence, the EU (taken as a <b>single</b> <b>customs</b> <b>territory)</b> has long been the biggest market for fair trade products. Although fair trade was born as, and remains to date, a voluntary and private-based initiative, there has been over the past decade an increasing interest on the part of some EU Member States and EU institutions to support such a phenomenon through a variety of means, ranging from policy statements to concrete funding and procurement actions, and even the possible adoption of specific legislation or laws on fair trade. In part I of the chapter, we will consider how various private organisations determine through standard-setting and monitoring mechanisms the marketing of fair trade products in selected EU Member States, as well as the different approaches taken by public authorities in these countries towards promoting and regulating fair trade. Against this backdrop of national fair trade organisational structures and regulatory experiences, we will turn in part II of chapter to the involvement of the EU itself in fair trade issues. We will first explore the legal and policy framework underpinning EU action in this domain and then concrete measures taken by the EU to support fair trade (or its underlying principles) in a number of different policy fields, including notably external trade policy that is an exclusive competence of the Union. The chapter will conclude with an assessment of the desirability and feasibility of adopting a regulatory system for fair trade at EU level...|$|E
40|$|The Eurasian Economic Community (EurAsEC) is an {{international}} economic organization designed to effectively promote {{the formation of a}} customs union and a single economic space among six CIS countries : Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Moldova, Ukraine, and Armenia have observer status. As a newborn child, the EurAsEC has yet to overcome internal and external challenges. The main internal challenge is arguably a two tiered legal system that has emerged as a result of diverse speed integration in the EurAsEC. The external challenge would be posed by (1) other regional integration projects with similar purposes and subject matter, and (2) the membership of EurAsEC countries in the WTO. With respect to other regional projects such as the Single Economic Space between Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Russia, {{there is a need to}} coordinate them with the EurAsEC. As for the WTO membership issue, EurAsEC countries opted for WTO accession in parallel with the formation of the customs union. Considering the fact that Kyrgyzstan has already entered the WTO, and the remaining members are at different accession stages, the pursued parallelism is certainly very challenging for the affected EurAsEC countries. The formation of the EurAsEC customs union will have certain implications for third-party countries. First, products from third countries will be subject to the CCT and common non-tariff barriers at the EurAsEC external borders while they will be able to freely move inside the <b>single</b> <b>customs</b> <b>territory</b> with the biggest market in the CIS. Second, the EurAsEC customs union, once established, will be able to enter, on behalf of its members, into trade arrangements with third countries. Third, the coordinated WTO accession policy of EurAsEC countries may produce for WTO members similar market access opportunities to these countries. Fourth, the alteration of the bound duties of Kyrgyzstan and possibly other EurAsEC members that will have joined the WTO prior to the formation of the customs union will require them to negotiate compensatory adjustment with the WTO members concerned. Finally, in the future the EurAsEC customs union may become a WTO member with a new voice in WTO decision making.
