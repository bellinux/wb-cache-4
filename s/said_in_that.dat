2500|$|The early 1950s {{literature}} transformed blitzkrieg into {{a historical}} military doctrine, which carried {{the signature of}} Liddell Hart and Guderian. The main evidence of Liddell Hart's deceit and [...] "tendentious" [...] report of history {{can be found in}} his letters to Erich von Manstein, Heinz Guderian and the relatives and associates of Erwin Rommel. Liddell Hart, in letters to Guderian, [...] "imposed his own fabricated version of blitzkrieg on the latter and compelled him to proclaim it as original formula". Kenneth Macksey found Liddell Hart's original letters to Guderian in the General's papers, requesting that Guderian give him credit for [...] "impressing him" [...] with his ideas of armoured warfare. When Liddell Hart was questioned about this in 1968 and the discrepancy between the English and German editions of Guderian's memoirs, [...] "he gave a conveniently unhelpful though strictly truthful reply.

2500|$|In 1949, Dyson {{demonstrated}} the equivalence of two then-current formulations of quantum electrodynamics (QED): Richard Feynman's diagrams and the operator method developed by Julian Schwinger and Shin'ichirō Tomonaga. He {{was the first}} person after their creator to appreciate the power of Feynman diagrams, and his paper written in 1948 and published in 1949 was the first to make use of them. He <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> paper that Feynman diagrams were not just a computational tool, but a physical theory, and developed rules for the diagrams that completely solved the renormalization problem. Dyson's paper and also his lectures presented Feynman's theories of QED in a form that other physicists could understand, facilitating the physics community's acceptance of Feynman's work. Robert Oppenheimer, in particular, was persuaded by Dyson that Feynman's new theory was as valid as Schwinger's and Tomonaga's. Oppenheimer rewarded Dyson with a lifetime appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study, [...] "for proving me wrong", in Oppenheimer's words.|$|E

While its article 8, n.4, would establish the [...] "freedom of thought under any form", n.20 of the same article states that [...] "special laws will regulate the exercise {{of the freedom of}} expression". One article would also explain that the purpose of censorship is [...] "to prevent the perversion of public opinion in its function of social force and (censorship) should be exercised so as to defend (public opinion) from all factors that might make it stray from the truth, justice, morality, good administration and common good, and to avoid that the fundamental principles of organization of society are attacked". As would be expected, the government reserved for itself the definition of criteria for this truth, justice, and morality. In fact it would be António de Oliveira Salazar himself who <b>said</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> same year, [...] "Men, groups and classes see, observe things, study the events, under the light of their own interest.
