With several years practical operation experiences, {{a lot of}} news reports reveal the existing electrical <b>supplementary</b> <b>heating</b> can dramatically impact the driving range of EVs under cold weather in north China. The high efficient electric <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system has become the research hotspot, but previous research show the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> operation could supply adequate heating capacity only in mild weather conditions when the working fluid is R 134 a. Since the user canâ€™t change environment temperature, choose a high pressure working fluid to have better heating performance become a realistic choice. Now the aluminum scroll compressor is wildly used in EVs, but because of the material and structure, it canâ€™t endure the long term high pressure operation.

The <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> cycles using R 134 a, R 407 c and R 290 have been theoretically analyzed; the rotary compressor has been redesigned to respectively apply the R 134 a, R 407 c and R 290; the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> test rig has been build; three combinations (compressor, oil and working fluid) under the same cold weather conditions have been experimentally researched.

40|$|Based on {{the status}} quo that {{conventional}} energy sources {{are more and more}} reduced and environmental pollution is increasingly serious, this paper presents a new model system of conserving energy and environmental protection, namely, a Solar Assisted <b>Heat</b> <b>Pump</b> <b>Heating</b> System with Latent Heat Storage. In this system, solar energy is the major heat source for a <b>heat</b> <b>pump,</b> and the <b>supplementary</b> <b>heat</b> source is soil. The disagreement in time between the space heat load and heat collected by solar heat collector is solved by latent heat storage. In order to obtain such system running conditions and effects in different heating periods, an experiment has been carried out during the whole heating period in Harbin, China. The experimental results show that this system is much better for heating in initial and late periods than that in middle periods.

40|$|CO 2 capture is an {{alternative}} to decrease CO 2 emissions from industries. A {{large part of the}} cost for carbon capture is related to the heat supply to the capture plant. In this study four alternatives to supply the heat demand in the capture plant at five industries in the Skagerrak area are evaluated. These industries are Preem Göteborg, Preem Lysekil, Esso Slagentangen, Borealis Stenungsund and Yara Porsgrunn. The heat supply alternatives are; Natural Gas Combined Cycle, Natural Gas Boiler, Biomass Boiler and Excess heat from the process alone or in combination with a <b>Heat</b> <b>Pump.</b> The lowest specific capture costs are found when excess heat is utilized. In those plants where the available amount of excess heat is not large enough to cover the whole heat demand in the capture plant, via direct heat exchange, the lowest specific capture cost is found when a <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> also is used. Specific capture costs of 45 to 60 €/ton can be reached in such systems. The specific avoidance costs are the same for these systems since no fossil fuel is used.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{demonstrate}} and disseminate the economic, environmental and energy saving potential of <b>heat</b> <b>pumping</b> technology. The {{focus has been on}} available technology, and results from existing field measurements have been used to calculate energy savings and CO 2 reduction. The <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems included in this project are the best we have found in our field measurements. The SPF values for the studied <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems range from 2. 6 to 4. 7. Four ground-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> and five air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> ended up at SPF values above the limits we defined for systems to be regarded as good (2. 8 - 3. 2 for air-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> and 3. 3 - 3. 9 for ground-source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps).</b> </p...|$|R
