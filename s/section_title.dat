All Preuss teams compete in Division IV of the San Diego section of the California Interscholastic Federation.

Most Preuss teams are non-league and have yet to develop rivalries with other schools. Preuss has yet to win a <b>section</b> <b>title</b> game, although it appeared in one in boys' soccer in 2006–07. The game resulted in a 5–1 loss to repeat champion Francis Parker.|$|E

In 1992, he started racing late models part-time in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series and he competed there while still in high school. While in 5th grade Harvick gave a glimpse of his future career plans when he completed a class project poster listing his goals as competing in NASCAR and racing at the Indy 500. Harvick's father, a firefighter and fixture around the Bakersfield racing scene, built him his first car {{to compete in the}} lower NASCAR Series by using the money he earned to run his own garage, Harvick Motorsports. When Harvick could not race, such as in the winter, he competed on his high school wrestling team at North High School in Bakersfield winning a CIF Central <b>Section</b> <b>title</b> in his weight class his senior year.
