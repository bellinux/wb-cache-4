40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a traffic {{information sharing system}} based on Floating Car Data (FCD). FCD {{is one of the}} methods used to gather traffic information; it uses vehicles as sensor nodes that transmit their speed to the server. The traffic <b>information</b> sharing <b>system</b> <b>broadcasts</b> speed <b>information</b> updated by such transmission. Vehicles receiving <b>broadcasted</b> speed <b>information</b> can calculate travel time and select a minimum time route. The communication cost and the load of the server are issues, because such a traffic information sharing system can generate a lot of wireless communication between the vehicles and the server [2][3]. However, reducing the amount of communication lowers the accuracy of information provided by the server. In this paper we propose an Information Cost Model to quantify a trade-off relationship between the communication cost of the system and the accuracy of information. Additionally, we propose a randomized method {{to reduce the number of}} messages from clients to the server by avoiding redundant transmissions. We compared the performance of our proposed method with that of a conventional method, using real traffic data from Chicago highways. The result shows that our proposed method generally outperforms the conventional method. Categories and Subject Descriptors...|$|R
40|$|Satellite {{broadcast}} data delivery has inherent {{advantages in}} providing global {{access to information}} to everyone. However, users of satellite communications need expensive and cumbersome equipment to receive and transmit satellite signals. Furthermore, {{as the amount of}} <b>information</b> being <b>broadcast</b> increases, average user latency increases as well. In many situations, users in a locality may have similar interests and hence they can be better served by a local broadcast schedule. A two stage satellite-terrestrial wireless <b>broadcast</b> <b>system</b> can provide more efficient service. In such a <b>system,</b> main server <b>broadcasts</b> <b>information</b> via satellite to the geographically distributed local ground stations. Every station has limited buffer capacity to store the items broadcast by the satellite. According to their cache content, and the interests of their users, local stations deliver the information to their users via terrestrial wireless channel. We develop novel methods for the joint cache management and scheduling problem encountered in these systems. Our results demonstrate that two stage systems can provide more efficient data delivery compared to the single stage systems...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a data cell outage {{detection}} scheme for heterogeneous networks (HetNets) with separated control and data plane. We consider a HetNet where the Control Network Layer (CNL) provides ubiquitous network access while Data Network Layer (DNL) provides {{high data rate}} transmission to low mobility User Terminals (UTs). Furthermore, network functionalities such as paging and <b>system</b> <b>information</b> <b>broadcast</b> are provided by the CNL to all active UTs, hence, the CNL is aware of all active UTs association. Based on this observation, we categorize our data cell outage detection scheme into the trigger phase and detection phase. In the former, the CNL monitors all UT-data base station association and triggers detection when irregularities occurs in the association, while the later utilizes a grey prediction model on the UT's {{reference signal received power}} (RSRP) statistics to determine the existence of an outage. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme can detect the data cell outage problem in a reliable manner...|$|R

As a matter of fact, a not negligible amount of collisions in midair piloted flight are still avoided by means of Visual Flight aid. Anti-collision <b>systems</b> based on <b>broadcast</b> <b>information</b> such as TCAS and ADS-B are not mandatory for small aircrafts. Moreover they return poor or incomplete output in heavy traffic conditions, and at a low data rate. Many research teams are involved in this field [5 - 9]. The Italian Aerospace Research Center (CIRA) UAV program aims at realizing a High Altitude Long Endurance unmanned flying laboratory, with fully autonomous flight functions. Within this program the development of the technologies needed to support the flight autonomy is the target of the project entitled TECVOL. This project aims at performing flight tests of prototype hardware systems developed to assess UAV autonomy. These systems are installed onboard a Very Light Aircraft named Flight Laboratory for Aeronautical Research Experiments (FLARE) in order to be tested in flight. A hardware/software prototype integrating autonomous obstacle DS&A capability has been designed and realized in collaboration with the Department of Aerospace Engineering of the University of Naples “Federico II”...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{military}} {{command and control}} (C 2) systems provide much information to today's combatants, but because these legacy systems are disjointed, there exists an overload of poorly organized and incomplete data during operations. These systems tend to be "stovepiped," inflexible, difficult to integrate, and bard to use in building a common operational picture. The information exchange model for DoD C 2 systems is migrating away from dedicated point-to-point and <b>broadcast</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>information</b> push) toward a model based partly on Internet and World Wide Web technologies (publish and subscribe). The USAF Scientific Advisory Board has created a visionary combat information management concept called the Joint Battlespace Infosphere {{in response to this}} movement. The purpose of this thesis is to identify and evaluate emerging Internet/Web-based technologies that could be employed by the DoD to improve upon existing information exchange services. This survey will examine {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} technologies such as client-server architectures, search engines, middleware, intelligent software agents, and multicast delivery tools that could enhance the development of the Joint Battlespace Infosphere.

40|$|Large scale {{cloud-based}} services are built upon {{a multitude of}} hardware and software resources, disseminated in one or multiple data centers. Controlling and managing these resources requires the integration of several pieces of software that may yield a representative view of the data center status. Today’s both closed and open-source monitoring solutions fail in different ways, including the lack of scalability, scarce representativity of global state conditions, inability in guaranteeing persistence in service delivery, and the impossibility of monitoring multi-tenant applications. In this paper, we present a novel monitoring architecture that addresses the aforementioned issues. It integrates a hierarchical scheme to monitor the resources in a cluster with a distributed hash table (DHT) to <b>broadcast</b> <b>system</b> state <b>information</b> among different monitors. This architecture strives to obtain high scalability, effectiveness and resilience, {{as well as the}} possibility of monitoring services spanning across different clusters or even different data centers of the cloud provider. We evaluate the scalability of the proposed architecture through a bottleneck analysis achieved by experimental results...|$|R
