We can take heat if there's {{something}} wrong {{and people can}} review shows badly– that's {{something you have to}} live with– but to <b>say</b> <b>people</b> stormed out of the show was an absolute fabrication. Britney is aware of all this and she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being. I'm embarrassed, with such a big international entourage here with Britney, {{to be part of the}} Australian media when I see that kind of totally inaccurate reporting. It's been all over the internet for nine months, the inference is that we tried to hide this. It's been the opposite. This show is about an incredible spectacle, which it is".|$|E
500|$|Middleton rarely takes {{a singer}} or songwriter's role for Powderfinger, {{generally}} delegating those tasks to Bernard Fanning. However, the song [...] "Over My Head" [...] from Internationalist had Middleton performing vocals. This came about when Middleton did {{a recording of}} himself singing the song before Fanning {{had the chance to}} do so. Previously, Middleton had written the lyrics to [...] "JC", which was sung by Fanning. However, Middleton sung JC several times throughout the 2007 Upstairs at the Downstairs tour. Despite Middleton's minimal songwriting, he has been praised for it by his band mates; Jon Coghill told a 1999 interview that [...] "Darren (Middleton) and Bernie (Fanning) are extremely good at writing songs." [...] Middleton agrees with this analysis; telling Undercovers Paul Cashmere in 2003 that [...] "We are about writing good music." [...] He commented that the band used their position {{at the top of the}} Australian industry to comment and give people ideas to think about, rather than [...] "trying to <b>say</b> <b>people</b> should take it as gospel". Middleton has criticised the [...] "boy band" [...] phenomena, pointing out that [...] "A lot of them can sing well, but they have people writing all their lyrics for them." ...|$|E

In the cover article Aiken said, [...] "One thing I've found of people in the public eye, either you're a womanizer or you've got to be gay. Since I'm neither one of those, people are completely concerned about me." [...] In subsequent interviews he expressed frustration over continued questions about his sexual orientation, telling People magazine in 2006, [...] "It doesn't matter what I <b>say.</b> <b>People</b> are going to believe what they want." ...|$|E

Later, in January 2014 in an interview with BBC World, Gülen said [...] "If I were to say anything to people I may <b>say</b> <b>people</b> should vote for those who are respectful to democracy, rule of law, who get on well with people. Telling or encouraging people to vote for a party would be an insult to peoples' intellect. Everybody very clearly sees what is going on." ...|$|E
2500|$|By its {{geographical}} location, Valence {{is one of}} {{the points}} of compulsory passage between Paris and the Mediterranean Sea. Its position at the centre of the meridian axis of the [...] places the city {{at the mouth of the}} Valley of the Isère (path to the Alps), in the west of the historical province of Dauphiné, within the natural and historic region of the Valentinois, and the boundary of the department of Ardèche (from which it is separated by the Rhône). The city is surrounded by several mountain ranges, including the Massif Central and the Ardèche hills to the west, and the Vercors Massif in the French Prealps to the east.

2500|$|Currents {{appeared}} on several critics' {{lists of the}} best albums of 2015. Q named Currents the year's top album, saying that [...] "Parker added dancefloor pop to their kaleidoscopic sound" [...] while calling it [...] "sonically advanced and filled with great songs". Spin ranked it as the year's fourth-best, calling it the group's [...] "best because its soul actually lies in Motown". The magazine said the album finds Parker [...] "coming to the epiphany {{that no amount of}} pitch- and time-shifting will screw with your perception of reality as much as a lyric that's as direct and true as 'They <b>say</b> <b>people</b> never change but that's bulls**t / They do.'" [...] Mojo also ranked the record as fourth-best of the year. Pitchfork ranked the album as the year's fifth-best, saying, [...] "There's still a bit of Parker's elegant guitar here, but he's mostly rerouted his perfectionistic craftsmanship to synthesizer tones and drum programming." [...] Paste ranked Currents at number eight on its list of the year's best albums, calling it a [...] "near-perfect album" [...] and [...] "a superb progression from their last efforts, a study in internal consistency." [...] Rolling Stone placed the album at number 13 on its list of the [...] "50 Best Albums of 2015", writing that Parker's [...] "musical rethink... is expansive, resulting in wide-screen adventures like 'Let It Happen'" [...] and that the record is [...] "full of weightless vocals and synthesized funk, for a set that's both blissed-out and mournful, like a set of diary entries from an astronaut floating off into oblivion". The album was also ranked fifth-best of the year by Consequence of Sound and NME, 15th-best by Stereogum, and 22nd-best by PopMatters, while Exclaim! named it the eighth-best pop/rock album of the year.|$|E
