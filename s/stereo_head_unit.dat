The lamps were still composed of three vertical segments, reminiscent of the original. Minimal changes occurred from year-to-year, most noticeable was a redesigned center panel in the dashboard for 2001, which now allowed double-din <b>stereo</b> <b>head</b> <b>units,</b> including an in-dash six-CD player. The rear window defroster switch, previously mounted below the headlamp pull switch, was moved to the lower center stack below the stereo. When equipped, the fog lamp switch was relocated to the lower center stack as well, previously, it was on the center console adjacent to the cup holders. The third button on the lower switch panel was for the traction control system (on V8 models). On convertible models, the power roof switch remained on the center console - on coupe models, that switch was replaced with a small coin holder.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the self-calibration {{problem in the}} special context of a <b>stereo</b> <b>head,</b> where the two cameras are arranged on a lateral rig with coplanar optical axes, each camera being free to vary its angle of vergence. Under various constraints, we derive explicit forms for the epipolar equation, and show that a static <b>stereo</b> <b>head</b> constitutes a degenerate camera con guration for carrying out self-calibration {{in the sense of}} Hartley [4]. The situation is retrieved by consideration of a special kind of motion of the <b>stereo</b> <b>head</b> in which the baseline remains con ned to a plane. New closed-form solutions for self-calibration are thereby obtained, inspired by an earlier discrete motion analysis of Zhang et al. [11]. Key factors in our approach are the development of explicit, analytical forms of the fundamental matrix, {{and the use of the}} vergence angles in the parameterisation of the problem.

During an au-tomated procedure derived from this approach, the mobile robot can be loosely positioned in front of a calibration pattern. Through our procedure, both the camera calibration and the neck-eye calibration are ob-tained. With this set of calibration matrices, the XYZ coordinates of a landmark can be determined with re-spect to the robot coordinate frame. The so calculated XYZ coordinates are accurate regardless of the orien-tation of the <b>stereo</b> <b>head,</b> even for orientations that were not used for calibration. This paper validates our approach by presenting results as accurate as a few millimeters in the calculation of the XYZ coordi-nates of objects at 1. 5 m from the <b>stereo</b> <b>head.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an evaluation framework for multimodal stereo matching, which allows {{to compare the}} performance of four simi-larity functions. Additionally, it presents details of a multimodal <b>stereo</b> <b>head</b> that supply thermal infrared and color images, as well as, aspects of its calibration and rectification. The pipeline includes a novel method for the disparity selection, which is suitable for evaluating the similar-ity functions. Finally, a benchmark for comparing different initializations of the proposed framework is presented. Similarity functions are based on mutual information, gradient orientation and scale space represen-tations. Their evaluation is performed using two metrics: i) disparity error, and ii) number of correct matches on planar regions. In addition to the proposed evaluation, the current paper also shows that 3 D sparse representations can be recovered from such a multimodal <b>stereo</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceA non-metric pan-tilt <b>stereo</b> <b>head</b> {{consists}} of a weakly calibrated stereo rig mounted on a pan-tilt mechanism. It is called non-metric since neither the kinematics of the mechanism, nor the camera calibration are required. The Lie group of ?projective rotations?-homographies of projective space corresponding to rotational displacements is a new, formalism that is introduced in this article to model the geometry of such a pan-tilt system. A Rodrigues-like formula {{as well as a}} minimal parameterization of projective rotations are introduced. Based on this, the practical part of the article devises a numerical optimization technique for accurately estimating projective rotations from stereo point correspondences along trial motions. This procedure recovers sufficient geometry to operate the system. The experiments validate and evaluate the proposed approach on real image data. They evaluate weak calibration, image prediction, and homing of a non-metric pan-tilt <b>stereo</b> <b>head...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will show}} how {{rotation}} matrices obtained from image measurements, for instance via self-calibration of rotating cameras, {{may be used to}} self-align an active <b>stereo</b> <b>head</b> such that the optic axes of the cameras are parallel, horizontal and perpendicular to the elevation axis. Whereas general rotation matrices have three degrees of freedom, with robot heads we may generate motions with fewer degrees of freedom, and use prior knowledge of the kinematic chain to constrain the rotation matrices to have a particular form. We demonstrate how these constraints provide sufficient alignment information, and we provide fast, accurate and stable algorithms to achieve this task. Both a linear method, which minimizes an algebraic error, and two non-linear methods which minimize meaningful errors, are presented, and we show in theory and experiments that they give virtually identical results.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} extracting dense disparity maps from a multispectral <b>stereo</b> <b>head.</b> It {{is based on the}} assumption of a piecewise planar scene modeling. This assumption implies that the surfaces of the given scene can be fitted through a set of predominant planes. The multispectral <b>stereo</b> <b>head</b> is constructed with a thermal infrared and a color camera. It is intended to explore novel stereo matching approaches that will allow the fusion of information from different sensors. The proposed framework consists of three stages. Firstly, an initial sparse disparity map is extracted by using an adapted multimodal cost function. Then, a set of plane hypotheses that describe the surfaces of the scene is obtained. Finally, the information collected in pervious stages is combined through a Markov Random Field, which is solved by the graph-cuts algorithm. Experimental results in outdoor scenarios are provided showing the validity of the proposed framework. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a real-time vergence control mechanism {{developed for the}} <b>stereo</b> <b>head</b> MEDUSA [13], {{in the context of}} behavior based active control [3]. Realtime control architectures for active vision impose strong constraints on the computational complexity of image processing algorithms. In many applications, the image size is often drastically reduced in order to achieve fast and reactive routines, at the cost of precision in the output of the algorithms. Nonuniform sampling of the images, through the log-polar mapping, is an efficient way of reducing the amount of data to process [8, 17], while maintaining a good resolution {{in the center of the}} field of view. By using active vision devices, such as <b>stereo</b> <b>heads,</b> we are able to inspect a wide field of view with high resolution. Besides the image size reduction feature, the correlation index of log-polar images, as a function of the vergence angle, has major advantages over cartesian images, in the detection of correct vergence c [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{methods to}} solve the {{relative}} orientation of two disparity maps measured by a movable <b>stereo</b> <b>head</b> from distinct viewpoints are presented.

40|$|Abstract — For {{autonomous}} navigation of Micro Aerial Vehi-cles (MAVs) in cluttered environments, it {{is essential}} to detect potential obstacles not only in the direction of flight but in their entire local environment. While there exist systems that do vision based obstacle detection, most of them are limited to a single perception direction. Extending these systems to a multi-directional sensing approach would exhaust the payload limit in terms of weight and computational power. We present a novel light-weight sensor setup comprising of four <b>stereo</b> <b>heads</b> and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to perform FPGA-based dense reconstruction for obstacle detec-tion in all directions. As the data-rate scales up with the number of cameras we use an FPGA to perform streaming based tasks in real-time and show a light-weight polar-coordinate map to allow a companion computer to fully process the data of all the cameras and perform obstacle detection in real-time. The system is able to process up to 80 frames per second (fps) freely distributed on the four <b>stereo</b> <b>heads</b> while maintaining a low power budget. The perception system including FPGA, image sensors and stereo mounts is 235 g in weight. I...|$|R
