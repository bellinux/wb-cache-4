50|$|The H.P47 was a low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane. Forward of {{the single}} spar the wing {{was covered with a}} <b>stressed</b> <b>metal</b> skin, forming a torsion box. Behind the spar it was fabric-covered, the trailing edge carrying flaps inboard, from the wing fillet out to the ailerons, though the centre section was metal-skinned throughout. The leading edge carried slats in three sections to form slots across the whole span when extended. The inboard pair were opened when the flaps were lowered and the outer slots were automatic, with interceptors connected to the ailerons for lateral control at high angles of attack. Behind the radial Bristol Pegasus IM3 engine, producing 650 hp (485 kW) and enclosed in a Townend ring, the semi-monocoque, corrugated skinned fuselage grew in diameter to the pilot's midwing cockpit then remaining constant rearwards to the gunner's position. He sat facing rearwards below the upper fuselage line and out of the slipstream, at a point where the fuselage stepped to a slim and narrowing oval boom. There was usable space inside the fuselage between the cockpits, enough to carry three passengers or two stretcher cases. All the tail surfaces moved; the fin, mounted ahead of the tailplane, moved with the horn-balanced rudder but through smaller angles, changing the camber, and the tailplane and single elevator were similarly coupled. All these rear control surfaces were covered with corrugated stressed skin. Specification G.4/31 included the dropping of torpedoes, so the underside of the aircraft had to be clear, and with wing fuel tanks the main undercarriage was fixed. The legs were mounted {{at the end of the}} centre section, each with a rearward strut and a long bracing strut outwards to the main spar. These struts were faired and both main and tailwheels spatted. The mainwheels were fitted with brakes.|$|E

40|$|Delamination of residually {{stressed}} {{thin film}} strips is analyzed {{to expose the}} dependence on strip width and filmysubstrate elastic mismatch. Isotropic films and substrates are assumed. The residual stress in the film is tensile and assumed to originate from mismatch due to thermal expansion or epitaxial deposition. Full and partial delamination modes are explored. In full delamination, the interface crack extends across the entire width of the strip and releases all the elastic energy stored in the strip as the crack propagates along the interface. The energy release rate available to propagate the interface crack is a strong function of the strip width and the elastic modulus of the film relative {{to that of the}} substrate. The energy release rate associated with full delamination is determined {{as a function of the}} interface crack length from initiation to steady-state, revealing a progression of behavior depending in an essential way on the three dimensionality of the strip. The dependence of the energy release rate on the remaining ligament as the interface crack converges with the strip end has also been calculated, and the results provide an effective means for inferring interface toughness from crack arrest position. A partial delamination propagates along the strip leaving a narrow width of strip attached to the substrate. In this case, the entire elastic energy stored in the strip is not released because the strain component parallel to the strip is not relaxed.

40|$|Although {{transcriptional}} induction {{of stress}} genes constitutes a major cellular defense program against {{a variety of}} stressors, posttranslational control directly regulating the activities of preexisting stress proteins provides a faster-acting alternative response. We propose that posttranslational control is a general adaptive mechanism operating in many stress pathways. Here {{with the aid of}} computational models, we first show that posttranslational control fulfills two roles: (1) handling small, transient stresses quickly and (2) stabilizing the negative feedback transcriptional network. We then review the posttranslational control pathways for major <b>stress</b> responses—oxidative <b>stress,</b> <b>metal</b> <b>stress,</b> hyperosmotic stress, DNA damage, heat shock, and hypoxia. Posttranslational regulation of stress protein activities occurs by reversible covalent modifications, allosteric or non-allosteric enzymatic regulations, and physically induced protein structural changes.

Sub-threshold stresses are handled adequately by posttranslational control without invoking gene transcription. With supra-threshold stress levels, cellular homeostasis cannot be maintained and transcriptional induction of stress genes and other gene programs, eg, those regulating cell metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis, takes place. The loss of homeostasis with consequent changes in cellular function may lead to adverse cellular outcomes. Overall, posttranslational an...|$|R
40|$|Microdevice {{fabrication}} {{is done on}} {{the surface}} of polished flat semiconductor substrates with a series of material depositions, etches and lithography steps. These processes are inherently planar and well suited for the fabrication of billions of micrometer-thick transistors over 300 mm diameter substrates, but impractical for building vertically. This thesis presents a method of building three-dimensionally (3 D) with existing planar fabrication technology: fabricate on a thin membrane, and then fold the membrane into a 3 D structure. Material stresses patterned on a membrane will cause controlled bending. A simple demonstration is the bilayer, in which a <b>stressed</b> <b>metal</b> is deposited on a stress-free membrane. One challenge with this approach is to achieve very small fold radii for tight 3 D packing. The solution presented here is helium ion implantation into the membrane, which creates a large localized stress that is capable of bending a 100 nm thick membrane around a 1 [mu]m radius without fracturing it. The energy and dose of the helium ions control the direction and angle of the fold, which is explained within a theoretical framework, and shown to agree with experiment. One application of stress-folding is a chemical sensor. Built as a 3 D micro-switch, the stress that develops in a reactive polymer bends the switch closed. Results show that it operates with negligible power consumption and selectively responds to a target analyte with more than a million-fold electrical resistance change. Other applications discussed include a 3 D inductor and non-periodic artificial dielectrics made by membrane folding combined with new 3 D optical patterning and magnetic self-alignment techniques. These practical advances open the way to designing a variety of 3 D devices which may have broad applications in computing, communications and detection. by William J. Arora. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Radioactive {{material}} being processed {{as part of}} the DE 3013 {{program for}} HB-Line will result in the presence of chlorides, and in some cases fluorides, in the dissolver. Material Science and Technology developed an experimental plan to evaluate the impact of chloride on corrosion of the dissolver vessel ventilation system. The plan set test variables from the proposed operating parameters, previous test results, and a desired maximum chloride concentration for processing. The test variables included concentrations of nitric acid, fluorides and chlorides, and the presence of a welded and <b>stressed</b> <b>metal</b> coupon. Table 1 contains expected general corrosion rates in the HB-Line vessel vent system from dissolution of 3013 contents of varying nitric acid and chloride content. These general corrosion rates were measured upstream of the condenser in the experiment's offgas system near the entrance to the dissolver. However, they could apply elsewhere in the offgas system, depending on factors not simulated in the testing, including offgas system temperatures and airflow. Localized corrosion was significant in Tests One, Two, and Three. This corrosion is significant because it will probably be the first mode of penetration of the 304 L steel in several places in the system. See Table 2. For Tests One and Three, the penetration rate of localized corrosion was much higher than that for general corrosion. It was approximately four times higher in Test One and at least 45 times higher in Test Three, penetrating an entire coupon thickness of 54 mils in 186 hours or less. There {{was no significant difference in}} corrosion between welded areas and un-welded areas on coupons. There was also no significant attack on stressed portions of coupons. It is probable that the lack of corrosion was because the stressed areas were facing downwards and offered no place for condensation or deposits to form. Had deposits formed, pitting may have occurred and led to stress corrosion cracking. The significant localized corrosion observed was usually associated with deposits. General corrosion on the offgas coupons was extremely high for the test containing 10, 000 ppm chloride in the dissolver solution. Localized corrosion caused deep penetration of coupon surfaces with a solution of 2000 ppm chloride, both at 12 M and 8 M nitric acid. We recommend that when processing chloride-containing solutions, the pre-condenser side of the vessel vent system be inspected at a frequency calculated from acceptable material losses and expected general corrosion rate. The presence of deposits and heavy condensation during inspection should be taken as indicators of possibly severe localized corrosion...|$|E
40|$|Tunable Optical Sensor Arrays (TOSA) {{based on}} Fabry-Pérot (FP) filters, for high quality spectroscopic {{applications}} in the visible and near infrared spectral range are investigated within this work. The optical performance of the FP filters is improved by using ion beam sputtered niobium pentoxide (Nb 2 O 5) and silicon dioxide (SiO 2) Distributed Bragg Reflectors (DBRs) as mirrors. Due to their high refractive index contrast, only a few alternating pairs of Nb 2 O 5 and SiO 2 films can achieve DBRs with high reflectivity in a wide spectral range, while ion beam sputter deposition (IBSD) is utilized due to its ability to produce films with high optical purity. However, IBSD films are highly stressed; resulting in stress induced mirror curvature and suspension bending in the free standing filter suspensions of the MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) FP filters. Stress induced mirror curvature results in filter transmission line degradation, while suspension bending results in high required filter tuning voltages. Moreover, stress induced suspension bending results in higher order mode filter operation which in turn degrades the optical resolution of the filter. Therefore, the deposition process is optimized to achieve both near zero absorption and low residual stress. High energy ion bombardment during film deposition is utilized to reduce the film density, and hence the film compressive stress. Utilizing this technique, the compressive stress of Nb 2 O 5 is reduced by ~ 43 %, while that for SiO 2 is reduced by ~ 40 %. Filters fabricated with stress reduced films show curvatures as low as 100 nm for 70 μm mirrors. To reduce the stress induced bending in the free standing filter suspensions, a stress optimized multi-layer suspension design is presented; with a tensile <b>stressed</b> <b>metal</b> sandwiched between two compressively stressed films. The stress in Physical Vapor Deposited (PVD) metals is therefore characterized for use as filter top-electrode and stress compensating layer. Surface micromachining is used to fabricate tunable FP filters in the visible spectral range using the above mentioned design. The upward bending of the suspensions is reduced from several micrometers to less than 100 nm and 250 nm for two different suspension layer combinations. Mechanical tuning of up to 188 nm is obtained by applying 40 V of actuation voltage. Alternatively, a filter line with transmission of 65. 5 %, Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 10. 5 nm and a stopband of 170 nm (at an output wavelength of 594 nm) is achieved.

In this line, several studies have highlighted the protective role of annexins against various stresses such as oxidative <b>stress,</b> heavy <b>metal</b> <b>stress</b> and osmotic stress in plants (Jami et al. 2008; Konopka-Postupolska et al. 2009; Laohavisit et al. 2010).|$|R

The {{relationship between the}} development of disease and particular metal ions are very complicated and complex. Thus, comprehension of metal homeostasis, details of transport and interactions with biomolecules is essential for understanding of normal and pathological processes occurring in the living system. Homeostasis of metal ions usually involve huge set of proteins which regulate the proper metal biology. Disorder in metal homeostasis may result in serious pathologies including neurodegenerative diseases. Metals ions, especially copper, zinc and iron play very important roles in neurodegeneration having impact on both protein structure (misfolding) and oxidative <b>stress.</b> <b>Metal</b> ion binding to proteins involved in neurodegeneration is therefore an important factor for whole brain damage processes.
