50|$|Entry fee is 100 yuan {{per person}} for a day. This ticket gives you entry to the ancient city area and all the <b>sights</b> <b>noted</b> above. Without {{purchasing}} the ticket, you cannot enter the area.There is an organized boat ride down the narrow canal. It costs 40 yuan per head, or 100 yuan for a boat, {{which can be used}} by 1-6 people. The boat ride lasts 20 minutes. Note that the boat ride service lasts until 8pm, so you may consider a ride in the evening after the other attractions have closed. The day trip (before 4pm) and night trips (4-8pm) have different routes.|$|R
5000|$|McCarthy and Breen (1997) {{proposed}} an extract from an Irish chronicle {{as a possible}} European sighting of the supernova. This chronicle indicates the following for 1054: A round circle of fire was seen at Ros Ela on the Sunday of the feast day of Saint George over five hours during the day, and countless black birds passed before it, in the centre of which there was a larger bird ... The date of the event corresponds to 24 April: (Saint George's Day is 23 April and fell on a Saturday in 1054. Thus {{the mention of the}} [...] "Sunday of Saint George's Day" [...] corresponds to the next day, 24 April) long before the <b>sighting</b> <b>noted</b> by the Chinese. The astronomical nature of the account remains very uncertain, and interpretation as a solar halo or aurora seems at least as probable.|$|R

40|$|The world’s {{population}} is ageing {{and will continue}} to do so (World Health Organization, 2002). This means that more and more people will be diagnosed with age-related conditions such as dementia and sight loss. Previous research does not recognise the care and support needs of people who have both dementia and <b>sight</b> loss, <b>noting</b> only one empirical study (Lawrence, et al., 2009). Therefore, this study explores the care and support needs of people with both dementia and sight loss...|$|R
50|$|A March 2013 {{review of}} the Journal of Cryptozoology in Brazilian journal Revista Piau&iacute; was {{generally}} positive regarding Shuker's efforts at a scientific approach to documenting cryptozoological findings, noting an article which put forth a giant oarfish as the most likely candidate to explain a recent <b>sighting,</b> but <b>noted</b> the professional challenges that cryptozoological researchers seeking to document findings may face, suggesting some are met with ridicule from colleagues due to {{a large portion of}} the cryptozoological community not being scientifically regarded.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} an intricate cartography {{system based on}} triangulation techniques. Areas can only be mapped after using triangulation to determine exactly where the character is relative to other landmarks. While looking at the map, he can fill in everything within line of <b>sight</b> by <b>noting</b> the relative locations {{of at least two}} other man-made objects. Although it is possible to navigate the island from memory, spending time fleshing out the map will prevent the character from becoming completely lost.|$|R

50|$|The rear peep <b>sight</b> is a <b>noted</b> {{improvement}} over the standard Kalashnikov notch and post. The muzzle brake is intended to significantly reduce weapon report and muzzle flash. The AN-94 design is stated to be vastly more accurate than the AK-74M. And unlike the AK-74M, it can mount a GP-25 family grenade launcher and bayonet simultaneously.|$|R
60|$|The chakars, {{like the}} skylark, love to soar upwards when singing, and {{at such times}} when they have risen till their dark bulky bodies appear like {{floating}} specks on the blue sky, or until they disappear from <b>sight</b> altogether, the <b>notes</b> become wonderfully etherealized by distance to a soft silvery sound, and it is then very delightful to listen to them.|$|R

60|$|She much {{wished to}} see the note with which Mr. Kendal {{returned}} the unfortunate sketch, {{but one of the}} points on which he was sensitive, was the sacredness of his correspondence, and all that she heard was, that Ulick had answered 'not at all as Mr. Kendal had expected; he was nothing but an Irishman, after all.' But at last she obtained a <b>sight</b> of the <b>note.</b>|$|R
50|$|Paragone (paragone, meaning comparison), is {{a debate}} from the Italian Renaissance in which one form of art (architecture, {{sculpture}} or painting) is championed as superior to all others. Leonardo da Vinci's treatise on painting, noting the difficulty of painting and supremacy of <b>sight,</b> is a <b>noted</b> example. Giorgio Vasari argues that drawing {{is the father of}} all arts, and as such, the most important one.|$|R

They were annually paid 6000 Zloty {{for the maintenance of}} the church. Soon, the monks adjoined a two-story cell building to the Catholic Church and turned the complex into Dominican monastery. A cozy Italian courtyard was built between the church and the cells. Today it is a separate, worthy of <b>note</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{economy of}} Hakone is {{strongly}} {{dominated by the}} tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active Ōwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine {{on the shore of}} the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are <b>noted</b> <b>sights.</b>|$|R

It has three stone arch bridges: the Juji (...) and Mingyuan Bridges (...) built in the Song Dynasty (9601279), and the Jin'ao Bridge (...) , given building permission by the Kangxi Emperor during the Qing Dynasty (16441911). Ancient temples, shrines and houses abound amongst a network of rivers and streams. Due to comparisons of the local scenery with the <b>noted</b> <b>sights</b> of Zhouzhuang in Jiangsu province, the village is also known as the [...] "Zhouzhuang of Shunde" [...] (顺德周庄).|$|R
50|$|When James VI entered Edinburgh in 1579 the pageantry {{included}} a public posting of the genealogy of the Scottish kings; {{and when his}} son Charles I visited in 1633, portraits of 107 kings were displayed, some of which (by George Jamesone) survive. Another series of 110 imagined portraits of the monarchs from the list was painted for Charles II by Jacob de Wet II, and hung in Holyrood Palace. The de Wet portrait collection later became a <b>noted</b> <b>sight</b> for tourists, for example as written about by John Macky, A Journey through Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Brooke (<b>Sight</b> & Sound) <b>noted</b> {{that despite}} the DVD cover's {{comparison}} to David Lynch's Eraserhead, La Belle captive was [...] "Alain Robbe-Grillet's most explicit tribute to the original French Surrealist movement.", noting that [...] "Robbe-Grillet constantly undermines narrative, temporal and spatial expectations at every turn while teasing the viewer with iconography drawn from Magritte, American thrillers, Murnau's Nosferatu and much else. It's tempting {{to assume that the}} somewhat vacant lead performances are absolutely as intended, the better to offset Daniel Emilfork's grotesque police investigator, smirking at knowledge that he's withholding from everyone else." ...|$|R

50|$|If a pilot {{chose to}} flee a {{superior}} force, or {{was coming down}} with a damaged machine, it was critical to spend what little time he might have {{going in the right}} direction. This rule sounds as though it is stating the obvious, but Boelcke found it necessary to include it. More than a few pilots came down behind enemy lines because they got confused and lost their way. In World War I, aerial navigation was done mostly by <b>sight.</b> Taking regular <b>note</b> of landmarks helped a pilot get his bearings quickly, perhaps making the difference between safety and captivity.|$|R
5000|$|As {{he noted}} on the 1820 title page, Carden took special care to select tunes {{appropriate}} for [...] "all Christian churches, singing schools, and private societies." [...] The Missouri Harmony was {{most commonly used}} in singing schools where the singing master used the different shaped note heads as a solfège system to help those unschooled in <b>sight</b> singing. Shape <b>notes</b> were known by other names as well. They were also called patent notes because they were registered with the U.S. Patent Office {{in the absence of}} effective copyright protection and buckwheat notes, for their perceived resemblance to the angular grain.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sight</b> & Sound <b>noted</b> {{the film}} {{was similar to the}} gangster films of Kinji Fukasaku, while noting that [...] "scenes such as the one where sodomy is used as a police {{interrogation}} technique bear Miike's unmistakable signature." [...] Time Out London stated that [...] "Even viewers hardened to the perversities which tend to crop up in Japanese exploitation genres may find themselves rubbing their eyes at some of the images and incidents in Miike's extremist thriller" [...] and that [...] "Miike's stylish, gleeful direction establishes him as the most distinctive new 'voice' in the genre since Rokuro Mochizuki." ...|$|R
40|$|Vatakis, A. and Spence, C. (in press) [Crossmodal binding: Evaluating the 'unity assumption' using {{audiovisual}} speech stimuli. Perception andPsychophysics] recently {{demonstrated that}} when two briefly presented speech signals (one auditory {{and the other}} visual) refer to the same audiovisual speech event, people find it harder to judge their temporal order than when they refer to different speech events. Vatakis and Spence argued that the 'unity assumption' facilitated crossmodal binding on the former (matching) trials {{by means of a}} process of temporal ventriloquism. In the present study, we investigated whether the 'unity assumption' would also affect the binding of non-speech stimuli (video clips of object action or musical notes). The auditory and visual stimuli were presented at a range of stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) using the method of constant stimuli. Participants made unspeeded temporal order judgments (TOJs) regarding which modality stream had been presented first. The auditory and visual musical and object action stimuli were either matched (e. g., the <b>sight</b> of a <b>note</b> being played on a piano together with the corresponding sound) or else mismatched (e. g., the <b>sight</b> of a <b>note</b> being played on a piano together with the sound of a guitar string being plucked). However, in contrast to the results of Vatakis and Spence's recent speech study, {{no significant difference in the}} accuracy of temporal discrimination performance for the matched versus mismatched video clips was observed. Reasons for this discrepancy are discussed...|$|R
60|$|The Mexicans were leisurely cooking {{their morning}} meal. They had two fires, one for warmth, {{the other to}} cook over. Gale had an idea these raiders were {{familiar}} to him. It seemed all these border hawks resembled one another--being mostly small of build, wiry, angular, swarthy-faced, and black-haired, and they wore the oddly styled Mexican clothes and sombreros. A slow wrath stirred in Gale {{as he watched the}} trio. They showed not the slightest indication of breaking camp. One fellow, evidently the leader, packed a gun at his hip, the only weapon in <b>sight.</b> Gale <b>noted</b> this with speculative eyes. The raiders had slept inside the little adobe house, and had not yet brought out the carbines. Next Gale swept his gaze to the corral, in which he saw more than a dozen horses, some of them fine animals. They were stamping and whistling, fighting one another, and pawing the dirt. This was entirely natural behavior for desert horses penned in when they wanted to get at water and grass.|$|R
50|$|To measure {{an angle}} with a circumferentor, such as angle EKG (Figure 1), place the {{instrument}} at K, with the fleur-de-lis in the card towards you. Then direct the sights, until through them you see E; and note the degree pointed at {{by the south}} end of the needle, such as 296°. Then, turn the instrument around, with the fleur-de-lis still towards you, and direct the <b>sights</b> to G; <b>note</b> the degree at which {{the south end of}} the needle point, such as 182°. Finally, subtract the lesser number, 182, from the greater, 296°; the remainder, 114°, is the number of degrees in the angle EKG.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft sextants are {{now out of}} production, but {{had special}} features. Most had {{artificial}} horizons to permit taking a sight through a flush overhead window. Some also had mechanical averagers to make hundreds of measurements per sight for compensation of random accelerations in the artificial horizon's fluid. Older aircraft sextants had two visual paths, one standard and the other designed for use in open-cockpit aircraft that let one view from directly over the sextant in one's lap. More modern aircraft sextants were periscopic with only a small projection above the fuselage. With these, the navigator pre-computed his <b>sight</b> and then <b>noted</b> the difference in observed versus predicted height {{of the body to}} determine his position.|$|R
500|$|In contrast, Doug Buel of The Tampa Tribune {{considered}} Rufus {{a character}} the game {{could have done}} without, describing him as [...] "an obnoxious, overweight fighter with a big mouth", additionally citing the character as the game's worst feature. GameSpot described him as [...] "a bit of a <b>sight</b> gag", though <b>noting</b> his speed as [...] "deceptive". A reviewer for the New Straits Times felt that though the character stood out from the other newcomers, his play was too [...] "lethargic". Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann noted that the character was [...] "a bit out of place" [...] {{with the rest of}} the cast, describing him as a [...] "big, bobbing belly with appendages", though he added that Rufus was feasible as a playable character.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sight</b> & Sound <b>noted</b> of the {{definition}} of slow cinema that [...] "The length of a shot, on which much of the debate revolves, is a quite abstract measure if divorced from what takes place within it". The Guardian contrasted the long takes of the genre with the two-second average shot length in Hollywood action movies, and noted that [...] "they opt for ambient noises or field recordings rather than bombastic sound design, embrace subdued visual schemes that require the viewers eye to do more work, and evoke a sense of mystery that springs from the landscapes and local customs they depict more than it does from generic convention." [...] The genre has been described as an [...] "act of organized resistance" [...] similar to the Slow food movement.|$|R
25|$|The wicket {{proved to}} be helpful to the touring side too after a similar opening (the first and second wicket – a duck – falling cheaply on 28) and another duck leaving them at 68/4 however a well-paced strike rate from Mohammad Yousuf, making a double century {{in the nick of}} time as he stood until the last wicket, and a half century from skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq, keeping his record against England alive, proved the team would stand as strong as the home team. Stephen Harmison's bowling, which had been under {{scrutiny}} over the Winter months, improved greatly at his least favourite pitch as he took 4–94 but the next best, Matthew Hoggard at 3–117 proved the tourists had victory in their <b>sights.</b> A special <b>note</b> must go to Pietersen who made a rare attempt at bowling for two overs, taking wicket keeper Kamran Akmal for 58 at figures of 1–11.|$|R
500|$|Finally, on 14 September, {{what was}} thought to be Gillis Land was spotted several miles away. The Island was unable to sail close enough to confirm the <b>{{sighting}},</b> but Worsley <b>noted</b> that it was to the west of its charted position. If it was Gillis Land, it was the first sighting of the island for 200 years (Gillis Land no longer appears on modern charts). [...] The ship then sailed to North-East Land, circumnavigating it and while doing so reaching the expedition's farthest north, 81°15′N. Worsley ensured the New Zealand flag was flown at the spot. The expedition then set sail for Spitzbergen, reaching the island's Green Harbour in mid-October. The ship's engine could not be repaired before Green Harbour was closed for winter and Worsley accepted a tow to Tromsø, the conclusion of which marked the end of the expedition. [...] He later wrote a book of the voyage, Under Sail in the Frozen North, which was published in 1927.|$|R
40|$|Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) {{have been}} {{described}} variously as the most luminous normal X-ray binaries, as hypernovae, and as "intermediate-mass" black holes with masses of hundreds to thousands of solar masses. We present results on M 74 X- 1 (CXOU J 013651. 1 + 154547), a ULX in the nearby spiral galaxy M 74 (NGC 628), from observations by Chandra and XMM-Newton. M 74 X- 1 is a persistent source which exhibits extreme variability and changes in spectral state on timescales of several thousand seconds. Its variability timescales and behavior resemble some Galactic microquasars. This suggests that the emission mechanism {{may be related to}} relativistically beamed jets, and that M 74 X- 1 could be an extragalactic "microblazar" [...] a microquasar whose jet axis is aligned with our line of <b>sight.</b> We also <b>note</b> that its spectrum is consistent with the presence of a low-temperature disk blackbody component, which, assuming it is due to radiation from an accretion disk, could indicate that M 74 X- 1 contains an intermediate-mass black hole.
