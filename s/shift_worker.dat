40|$|OBJECTIVE: Shift work is {{associated}} with adverse health outcomes, and an unhealthy diet may be a contributing factor. We compared diet quantity and quality between day and <b>shift</b> <b>workers,</b> and studied exposure-response relationships regarding frequency of night shifts and years of shift work. METHODS: Cross-sectional general population data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Netherlands (EPIC-NL) cohort was used. Dietary intake was assessed in 1993 - 1997 among adults aged 20 - 70 years using a food frequency questionnaire. We calculated energy intake, the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and WHO-based Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI). In 2011 - 2014, we retrospectively identified 683 <b>shift</b> <b>workers</b> and 7173 day workers in 1993 - 1997. Using multivariable-adjusted linear regression analysis, we estimated regression coefficients (β) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) {{of the differences in}} dietary intake between day and <b>shift</b> <b>workers.</b> RESULTS: <b>Shift</b> <b>workers</b> had a higher energy intake than day workers (β: 56 kcal/d, 95 % CI 10 - 101), and a higher consumption of grains, dairy products, meat and fish (P< 0. 05). The difference in energy intake was largest for <b>shift</b> <b>workers</b> with ≥ 5 night shifts/month. They consumed 103 kcal/d (95 % CI 29 - 176) more than day workers. No associations were found with MDS and HDI. CONCLUSION: <b>Shift</b> <b>workers</b> and particularly those with a high frequency of night shifts had a higher energy intake than day workers. Regardless of number of night shifts and years of <b>shift</b> work, <b>shift</b> <b>workers</b> had similar diet quality as day workers. This suggests that increased energy intake among <b>shift</b> <b>workers</b> may contribute to shift work-induced adverse health outcomes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Shift</b> <b>workers</b> have {{a higher}} rate of {{negative}} health outcomes than day <b>shift</b> <b>workers.</b> Few studies however, have examined the role of difference in workplace environment between shifts itself on such health measures. This study investigated variation in organizational climate across different types of shift work and health outcomes in nurses. Participants (n = 142) were nursing staff from a metropolitan Melbourne hospital. Demographic items elicited the type of shift worked, while the Work Environment Scale and the General Health Questionnaire measured organizational climate and health respectively. Analysis supported the hypotheses that different organizational climates occurred across different shifts, and that different organizational climate factors predicted poor health outcomes. Shift work alone was not found to predict health outcomes. Specifically, permanent night <b>shift</b> <b>workers</b> had significantly lower coworker cohesion scores compared with rotating day and evening <b>shift</b> <b>workers</b> and significantly higher managerial control scores compared with day <b>shift</b> <b>workers.</b> Further, coworker cohesion and involvement were found to be significant predictors of somatic problems.

50|$|These {{practices}} and policies can include selecting an appropriate shift schedule or rota and using an employee scheduling software to maintain it, setting {{the length of}} shifts, managing overtime, increasing lighting levels, providing <b>shift</b> <b>worker</b> lifestyle training, retirement compensation based on salary {{in the last few}} years of employment (which can encourage excessive overtime among older workers who may be less able to obtain adequate sleep), or screening and hiring of new shift workers that assesses adaptability to a shift work schedule.

5000|$|Algorithmic {{scheduling}} of {{shift work}} {{can lead to}} what has been colloquially termed as [...] "clopening" [...] where the shift-worker has to work the closing shift of one day and the opening shift of the next day back-to-back resulting in short rest periods between shifts and fatigue. Co-opting employees to fill the shift roster helps to ensure that the human costs are taken into account in a way which is hard for an algorithm to do as it would involve knowing the constraints and considerations of each individual <b>shift</b> <b>worker</b> and assigning a cost metric to each of those factors. Shift based hiring which is a recruitment concept that hires people for individual shifts, rather than hiring employees before scheduling them into shifts enables shift workers to indicate their preferences and availabilities for unfilled shifts through a shift-bidding mechanism. Through this process, the shift hours are evened out by human-driven market mechanism rather than an algorithmic process. This openness can lead to work hours that are tailored to an individual's lifestyle and schedule while ensuring that shifts are optimally filled, in contrast to the generally poor human outcomes of fatigue, stress, estrangement with friends and family and health problems that have been reported with algorithm-based scheduling of work-shifts.|$|E

Though not ideal, the system works. However civil unrest is becoming rampant. [...] "Stasis Jumpers", workers that refuse to report to their stasis shifts are becoming a problem. A dissatisfaction with the government and the Stasis Initiative is running high and the new initiative to relocate the Alpha workers to a countryside perimeter has provided ample fodder for a growing underground resistance movement that could tear their way of life apart. Behind the daily routine of the Stasis shifts, two workers, Eric and Larissa, have fallen in love. Simple enough but for the fact that Eric is a Beta and Larissa is an Alpha. Their destiny is separated by stretches of time {{in and out of a}} stasis pod with the moment that they switch places as the only time they physically ever see each other. As they work their respective shifts, they communicate their love to each other with holographic messages, computer games, and secret messages. Dominic, a former <b>shift</b> <b>worker</b> now an Elite manager, is allowed to forgo the stasis that has constrained many in his society. He is eager to see that the workers have a better future but at the same time he believes in the Stasis Initiative. Even more, it seems he now has an attraction to Larissa. The rule of the Elites is also becoming strained under the stress of ending the Stasis Initiative and the Resistance rebellion. Elites that challenge the rule of authority they currently hold find themselves in contempt and jailed and the underclass of the Alphas and Betas seems destined to serve only as a slave class, to the elite managers, in and out of stasis. With the new initiative to [...] "relocate" [...] the Alpha workers looming on the horizon, Eric makes a startling discovery that could spell disaster not only for his beloved Larissa, but for millions of Alphas.
