40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} characterisation on Ypresian clays {{that are}} considered {{as one of the}} potential geological host formations for the radioactive waste disposal in Belgium has been carried out. Physical, microstructural, hydraulic and mechanical properties were investigated on the samples taken from a cored borehole at Kallo in the Northern Belgium at 290 - 400 m depth. Identification tests, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and oedometer tests were performed. The results obtained showed that Ypresian clays are highly plastic (large values of consistence limits, specific surface, blue ethylene value) and of relatively low density, in relation to their high swelling clay content. In addition, their physical and mineralogical properties present significant variations over depth. Two microstructural arrangements, matrix-type and aggregate-type respectively for the depths with higher and lower swelling content, were identified. The former exhibits bi-modal porosity while the latter shows a common deep sediment mono-modal porosity but with a larger dominant pore size. The permeability of the clays with matrix-type microstructure is significantly lower than that with aggregate-type despite their higher void ratio. Moreover, these microstructural features result in the initial unsaturated state of Ypresian clays sample. Typical hysteretic unloading-reloading loops are identified on both low- and high-pressure oedometer tests that can be explained by a microstructure-based <b>swelling</b> <b>stress</b> concept. The variation of this <b>swelling</b> <b>stress</b> with the corresponding initial void ratio over depth perfectly reflects the physical variations and is consistent with that of <b>swelling</b> <b>stress</b> determined from common swelling tests.

40|$|CO 2 geosequestration is {{currently}} {{considered to be}} the most effective and economical method to dispose of artificial greenhouse gases. There are a large number of coal mines that will be scrapped, {{and some of them are}} located in deep formations in China. CO 2 storage in abandoned coal mines will be a potential option for greenhouse gas disposal. However, CO 2 trapping in deep coal pillars would induce swelling effects of coal matrix. Adsorption-induced swelling not only modifies the volume and permeability of coal mass, but also causes the basic physical and mechanical properties changing, such as elastic modulus and Poisson ratio. It eventually results in some reduction in pillar strength. Based on the fractional swelling as a function of time and different loading pressure steps, the relationship between volumetric stress and adsorption pressure increment is acquired. Eventually, this paper presents a theory model to analyze the pillar strength reduction after CO 2 adsorption. The model provides a method to quantitatively describe the interrelation of volumetric strain, <b>swelling</b> <b>stress,</b> and mechanical strength reduction after gas adsorption under the condition of step-by-step pressure loading and the non-Langmuir isothermal model.

Tumors rich in hyaluronan exhibit a highly negative fixed charge density. Repulsive forces among these negative charges as well as swelling of cancer cells due to regulation of intracellular tonicity can cause tumor swelling and development of stress that might compress blood vessels, compromising tumor perfusion and drug delivery. Here, we designed an experimental strategy, using four orthotopic tumor models, to measure <b>swelling</b> <b>stress</b> and related swelling to extracellular matrix components, hyaluronan and collagen, {{as well as to}} tumor perfusion. Subsequently, interventions were performed to measure tumor swelling using matrix-modifying enzymes (hyaluronidase and collagenase) and by repurposing pirfenidone, an approved antifibrotic drug. Finally, in vitro experiments on cancer cell spheroids were performed to identify their contribution to tissue swelling. <b>Swelling</b> <b>stress</b> was measured in the range of 16 to 75 mm Hg, high enough to cause vessel collapse. Interestingly, while depletion of hyaluronan decreased swelling, collagen depletion had the opposite effect, whereas the contribution of cancer cells was negligible. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed the same linear correlation between tumor swelling and the ratio of hyaluronan to collagen content when data from all tumor models were combined. Our data further revealed an inverse relation between tumor perfusion and swelling, suggesting that reduction of swelling decompresses tumor vessels. These results provide guidelines for emerging therapeutic strategies that target the tumor microenvironment to alleviate intratumoral stresses and improve vessel functionality and drug delivery...|$|E

The first aim of the study was to compare the cupping sensitivity of heat-treated and non-heat-treated cladding boards during cyclic moisture conditions. The second aim was to investigate the progress of the moisture profile in wooden cladding board as a result of short-term single-sided water soaking. The third aim was to investigate the development of swelling stresses in the tangential direction in spruce (Picea abies) as a function of water soaking time in order to provide basic data. The cupping studies were conducted with full-scale test walls in laboratory conditions with specimens made of heat-treated and non-heat-treated timber. The moisture distribution study was based on a theoretical approach, after which the modeling results were compared to those of previously published studies. Experimental <b>swelling</b> <b>stress</b> results were compared to the theoretical calculations obtained from different models. On the basis of the cupping results, the thickness and heat-treatment of the board affected both the rate and the extent of curving during cyclic moisture conditions. The species of wood was also found to be an important consideration for selecting stable boards for the cladding.

CTH experiments reveal an abnormal sorption behavior: after an apparently fickian transient period, the water absorption continues at almost constant rate, no equilibrium is observed after more than 2500 h, whatever the temperature. DVS experiments reveal a very low Henry's solubility but the formation of clusters at water activities higher than 40 %. The water diffusivity is almost independent of activity below 50 % HR and decreases rapidly when activity increases above 50 %. Contrary to CTH experiments, equilibrium is reached in DVS and the difference is not simply linked to the well-known effect of sample thickness on diffusion rate. The results allow hypotheses such as hydrolysis or osmotic cracking to explain the abnormal sorption phenomenon to be rejected. It is suggested that clusters could be polymer-water complexes having a linear/branched structure able to grow without phase separation that could explain the reversibility of sorption-desorption cycles.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{performance}} of glassy polymer membranes plasticized by penetrant gases. Penetrant induced plasticization of gas separation membranes {{has been the subject of}} a number of recent investigations. Historically, plasticization can be attributed to the <b>swelling</b> <b>stresses</b> exerted by the penetrant molecules on the polymer network. It appears that carbon dioxide behaves as a plasticizing agent for many glassy polymers by expandng the polymer lattice and increasing the frequency of molecular motions. In glassy polymers, the permeability to carbon dioxide is pressure dependent. Permeability can either increase or decrease with increasing feed pressure. It was thought that the permeability of most glassy polymers to gases decreases with increasing pressure in accordance with the predictions of the dual-sorption theory. Presumably, the plasticizing action of CO 2 decreases the ability of the membrane to separate molecules thereby causing the reduction in selectivity. In gas separation membranes, plasticization effects are observed as anomalous sorption and permeation during measurements at elevated pressures. The alteration of a number of properties resulting from the polymer conditioning by the sorbed penetrant molecules was investigated. It has been demonstrated that high sorption of carbon dioxide results in a strong plasticizing effect on the properties of several polymers. Disentanglement of polymer chains at elevated pressure, the depression of the glass transition temperature by absorbed CO 2 molecules, the decreasing of activation energy for diffusion with increasing concentration visualize the plasticization effect of carbon dioxide on glassy polymers...|$|R
