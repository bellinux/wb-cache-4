25|$|A <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> is a large, firm, oxygen {{permeable}} contact lens that {{rests on}} the sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient whose cornea is too sensitive to support the lens directly. Scleral lenses {{may be used to}} improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome (Kerotanconjuctivis sicca), microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post-LASIK, high order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated with scleral lenses.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Scleral</b> <b>lenses</b> {{differ from}} corneal contact lenses {{in that they}} create a space between the cornea and the lens, which is filled with fluid. The {{prosthetic}} application of the lenses is to cover or [...] "bandage" [...] the ocular surface, providing a therapeutic environment for managing severe ocular surface disease. The outward bulge of <b>scleral</b> <b>lenses</b> and the liquid-filled space between the cornea and the lens also conforms to irregular corneas and may neutralize corneal surface irregularities.|$|R
25|$|Also in 1887, Louis J.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} that <b>scleral</b> contact <b>lens</b> wear may potentially elevate intraocular pressure (IOP) {{as a result}} of post-lens fluid forces exacerbated by eyelid tension, or ocular versions that alter the lens fit and result in corneal bearing or increased conjunctival and scleral tissue compression. A number of studies have investigated the influence of short-term <b>scleral</b> contact <b>lens</b> wear upon IOP, using a variety of experimental paradigms.

50|$|A <b>scleral</b> <b>lens,</b> {{also known}} as a scleral contact lens and ocular surface {{prostheses}} is a large contact lens that rests on the sclera and creates a tear-filled vault over the cornea.

5000|$|A <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> is a prototypical lens {{dating back}} to the early 1880s. Originally these lenses were {{designed}} by using a substance to take a mold of the eye. Lenses would then be shaped to conform to the mould, initially using blown glass and then ground glass in the 1920s and polymethyl methacrylate in the 1940s. [...] Early sclerals were not oxygen permeable, which severely restricted the amount of oxygen provided to the cornea of the wearer. As such, early lenses fell into disuse until the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Scleral rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lenses play an {{important}} and underappreciated role {{in the treatment of}} ocular surface disease. This review provides an update on <b>scleral</b> rigid gas-permeable <b>lenses</b> in the therapy of ocular surface disease (OSD). Several large cohort studies and case series have been published since 2008 that report on the use of <b>scleral</b> RGP <b>lenses</b> in the treatment of ocular surface disease as a sub-group of corneal disease, or in specific diseases such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and ocular chronic graft-versus-host disease. In addition, there are case reports detailing the treatment with <b>scleral</b> <b>lenses</b> in OSD of specific etiology such as herpes zoster, limbal stem cell deficiency or ocular ci-catricial pemphigoid. Two case series were published showing innovative utility of scle-ral RGP lenses in the management of OSD after glaucoma surgery and for drug delivery for corneal neovascularization. Reports continue to emerge on the impact of <b>scleral</b> RGP <b>lenses</b> in the treatment of patients with ocular surface disease. Advances in lens design and fitting techniques make <b>scleral</b> RGP <b>lenses</b> a practical option for a rising number and variety of patients with corneal disease.

50|$|Modern <b>scleral</b> <b>lenses</b> {{are made}} of a highly oxygen {{permeable}} polymer. They are unique in their design in that they fit onto and are supported by the sclera, the white portion of the eye. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient, whose cornea may be too sensitive to support the lens directly. In comparison to corneal contact <b>lenses,</b> <b>scleral</b> <b>lenses</b> bulge outward considerably more. The space between the cornea and the lens is filled with artificial tears. The liquid, which is contained in a thin elastic reservoir, conforms to the irregularities of the deformed cornea, allowing vision to be restored comfortably. This helps to give the patient BCVA, or Best Corrected Visual Acuity.|$|R
25|$|<b>Scleral</b> <b>lenses</b> are {{sometimes}} prescribed for cases of advanced or very irregular keratoconus; these lenses cover {{a greater proportion}} of the surface of the eye and hence can offer improved stability.

50|$|In the mid-1930s, Sato {{devised a}} glass <b>scleral</b> <b>lens,</b> {{but it never}} came into wide usage. Within a few years, higher-quality glass scleral lenses from Carl Zeiss were {{available}} in Japan. In 1939, Sato became the first physician to report the use of radial keratotomy for myopia. Sato knew that the cornea flattened out in patients with keratoconus who suffered corneal hydrops from the leakage of fluid through Descemet's membrane. His idea was to create numerous breaks in that membrane through anterior and posterior approaches. His initial patients were military pilots.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scleral</b> <b>lens</b> {{production}} increased {{again after}} oxygen permeable materials, originally used in rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, became available for other uses. The mold building approach was replaced {{the use of}} trial kits, in which a patient tests a series of stock lenses over a course of days, weeks, or months {{in order to find}} the best fit. The recent development of digital imaging techniques has allowed some providers to evaluate and correct fit with greater accuracy. A number of scleral manufactures have also made scleral lenses with customizable points of adjustment available, so that each lens can be adjusted via a lathe to better match the contours of a single eye.|$|E
5000|$|Scleral lenses may be {{inserted}} into the eye directly from the fingers, from a hand held plunger, or from a stationary lighted plunger on a stand. Prior to inserting the scleral, the lens is over-filled with a sterile saline or other prescribed solution mixture. Some fluid is allowed to drip from the lens as it is inserted {{in order to ensure}} no bubbles become trapped under the lens after it is seated on the eye. The lens can then be rotated to the correct orientation, often denoted by a mark at the [...] "top" [...] of the lens, with a finger. A [...] "left" [...] <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> is often marked with two dots, and a [...] "right" [...] is marked with one dot.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Subjective and {{objective}} evaluation of <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> tolerance and fitting {{before and after}} corneal cross-linking (CXL) for progressive keratoconus. Methods. In this prospective cohort, evaluations were made of 18 unilateral eyes in patients who underwent CXL and had been wearing scleral lenses before the procedure. All the patients gave informed consent; {{they were able to}} cooperate with the study, were eligible for CXL, had been wearing well-fitting scleral lenses for at least 3 months, and had no other active ocular disease. Data were collected before and 1 year after CXL. Outcome measures were changes in clinical and subjective <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> performance.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} full scleral lenses on corneal curvature and pachymetry in keratoconus patients. METHODS: In this intervention study, 20 eyes of 14 patients were measured by Scheimpflug imaging (Pentacam HR, Oculus) at two time points: directly and ≥ 1 week after <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> removal. Steep, flat and maximal keratometry (K(steep), K(flat) and K(max)) and optical pachymetry were analyzed. A generalized estimating equation analysis was performed to correct for paired eyes. RESULTS: Directly after <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> removal, all three curvature parameters were significantly flatter compared to ≥ 1 week after <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> removal. Average K(steep) was 0. 7 diopter (D) lower (P< 0. 001), average K(flat) was 0. 5 D lower (P= 0. 037) and average K(max) was 1. 1 D lower (P< 0. 001). Directly after <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> removal, average optical pachymetry was ± 2. 5 % higher (P< 0. 001) compared to ≥ 1 week after <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> removal.

[Revised edition posted 12. 04. 2013] This guide {{is based on an}} extended literature search on the subject of <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> fitting and provides an overview of the latest knowledge and understanding on this exciting vision correction method. This guide serves as an introduction to scleral shape, scleral topography and <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> design as well as a generic guide to fitting scleral lenses to help the practitioner get more comfortable with the concept of scleral lenses. It provides a general overview, supported by the main experienced <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> fitters worldwide. Its goal is to give practitioners a framework to oversee and integrate <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> fitting into their practices. Being a general overview, it can never cover all of the specific <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> designs available and cannot be a fitting guide for all lens types available. Modern <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> fitting still is in its infancy, which makes it a modality with great potential. However, fitting scleral lenses is not very black-and-white, and many differences exist among fitters, cultures, manufacturers and countries. This clinical guide tries to find “common ground” among the mentioned philosophies. For specific lens fitting rules and guidelines, the lens manufacturer and the laboratory’s consultant and specialists have the most knowledge regarding their specific lens design, which practitioners should take advantage of.

40|$|From the introduction] Large {{diameter}} {{contact lenses}} that have their resting point beyond the corneal borders {{are believed to}} be among the best vision correction options for irregular corneas; they can postpone or even prevent surgical intervention as well as decrease the risk of corneal scarring. For true clearance of the cornea, without any mechanical involvement, it seems advised to avoid contact between the lens and the cornea by bridging over it. A few years ago, only a handful of very specialized lens fitters around the world were capable of fitting scleral lenses successfully, and only a few manufacturers were making scleral lenses. Now many contact lens manufacturers have <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> designs in their arsenal. Improved manufacturing processes allow for better design, make lenses more reproducible and decrease costs, which combined with better lens materials has contributed to better ocular health, longer wearing time and ease of lens fit. This, in return, has broadened up the indication range for <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> fitting. But <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> fitting is still in its infancy, and this <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> case report series will share and discuss knowledge gained by practitioners who regularly work with these lenses.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the ocular surface temperature using an infrared thermography camera {{before and after}} wearing <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> in patients with keratoconus and correlate these results with the tear production and stability. Methods: A pilot, experimental, short-term study has been performed. Twenty-six patients with keratoconus (36. 95 +/- 8. 95 years) participated voluntarily in the study. The sample was divided into two groups: patients with intrastromal corneal ring (KC-ICRS group) and patients without ICRS (KC group). Schirmer test, tear breakup time (TBUT), and ocular surface temperature in the conjunctiva, limbus, and cornea were evaluated before and after wearing a <b>scleral</b> <b>lens.</b> Results: The patients wore the scleral lenses from 6 to 9 hours with average of 7. 59 +/- 0. 73 hours. No significant changes in Schirmer test and TBUT were found for both groups. No temperature {{differences were found between}} the KC-ICRS and the KC groups for all zones evaluated. There was a slight, but statistically significant, increase in the inferior cornea, temporal limbus, and nasal conjunctival temperature for KC-ICRS group and temporal limbus temperature decreasing for the KC group after wearing <b>scleral</b> <b>lens</b> (P 0. 05).

40|$|Purpose. The {{main goal}} of this current work is to use an updated {{calculation}} paradigm, and updated boundary conditions, to provide theoretical guidelines to assist the clinician whose goal is to improve his or her scleral gas permeable (GP) contact lens wearing patients’ anterior corneal oxygen supply. Methods. Our model uses a variable value of corneal oxygen consumption developed through Monod equations that disallows negative oxygen tensions within the stroma to predict oxygen tension at the anterior corneal surface of <b>scleral</b> GP contact <b>lens</b> wearing eyes, and to describe oxygen tension and flux profiles, for various boundary conditions, through the lens, tears, and cornea. We use several updated tissue and boundary parameters in our model. Tear exchange with GP <b>scleral</b> <b>lenses</b> is considered nonexistent in this model. Results. The majority of current <b>scleral</b> GP contact <b>lenses</b> should produce some levels of corneal hypoxia under open eye conditions. Only lenses producingthethinnest oftear vaults should resultin anterior corneal surface oxygen tensions greater than a presumed critical oxygen tension of 100 mmHg. We also find that corneal oxygen tension and flux are each more sensitive to modification in tear vault than to changes in lens oxygen permeability, within the ranges of current clinical manipulation. Conclusions. Our study suggests that clinicians would be prudent to prescribe <b>scleral</b> GP <b>lenses</b> manufactured from higher oxygen permeability materials and especially to fit without excessive corneal clearance.
