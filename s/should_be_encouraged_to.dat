25|$|A {{person who}} is troubled by {{experiencing}} situational anorgasmia <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> explore alone and {{with his or her}} partner those factors that may affect whether or not he or she is orgasmic, such as fatigue, emotional concerns, feeling pressured to have sex when he or she is not interested, or a partner's sexual dysfunction. In the relatively common case of female situational anorgasmia during penile-vaginal intercourse, some sex therapists recommend that couples incorporate manual or vibrator stimulation during intercourse, or using the female-above position as it may allow for greater stimulation of the clitoris by the penis or pubic symphysis or both, and it allows the woman better control of movement.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{the repercussions}} of gender in toys {{suggests}} that play <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> be more gender neutral {{in order to work}} towards a desegregation of the genders. Too, researcher Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach promote that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills. In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children. Even as this debate is evolving and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so than boys because of the societal value of masculinity.|$|E
25|$|Anosognosia {{is a lack}} of {{awareness}} or understanding of the loss of function caused by the brain injury and is common in individuals who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke. Because patients with anosognosia may be unaware of their deficits, they may be less likely to seek treatment once they are released from the hospital. The lack of proper treatment could lead to higher levels of dependency later on. In order to make functional recovery gains, right hemisphere stroke survivors should receive rehabilitation services, so patients with anosognosia <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> seek out additional treatment. However, due to the anosognosia, these patients often report a higher perceived quality of life than other right hemisphere stroke survivors because of the unawareness of the resulting deficits (Daia et al., 2014). Patients with smaller lesions often recover faster from anosognosia than patients with larger lesions resulting in anosognosia (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effect of spatial aggregation on the accuracy of regional economic forecasts. Literature in econometrics, business forecasting, regional economic forecasting, spatial econometrics, and spatial time series analysis suggests {{that the issue is}} far from settled at either the theoretical or empirical levels. Univariate time series analysis is used to generate both state-level and sub-state regional forecasts of monthly total employment in the State of Idaho and its economic sub-regions. All spatial aggregation methods provide accurate forecasts, but direct state-level forecasts, and disaggregation of state-level forecasts to the sub-state level are slightly more accurate than more directly disaggregated approaches. As state-level data are often subject to less measurement error, and are also more complete and timely, this result <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraging</b> <b>to</b> regional forecasting practitioners. ...|$|R

25|$|He {{resolved}} to remain Conservative leader, even {{after losing the}} October 1974 general election, and at first it appeared that by calling on the loyalty of his front-bench colleagues he might prevail. In the weeks following the second election defeat, Heath came under tremendous pressure to concede {{a review of the}} rules and agreed to establish a commission to propose changes and to seek re-election. There was no clear challenger after Enoch Powell had left the party and Keith Joseph had ruled himself out after controversial statements implying that the working classes <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> use more birth control. Joseph's close friend and ally Margaret Thatcher, who believed an adherent to CPS philosophy should stand, joined the leadership contest in his place alongside the outsider Hugh Fraser. Aided by Airey Neave's campaigning among backbench MPs—whose earlier approach to William Whitelaw had been rebuffed, out of loyalty to Heath—she emerged as the only serious challenger.|$|E
25|$|Other {{measures}} allowed certain {{reports on}} intelligence and intelligence-related matters to be deferred until either February 1, 2002 or a date after February 1, 2002 if the official involved certified that preparation and submission on February 1, 2002, would impede {{the work of}} officers or employees engaged in counterterrorism activities. Any such deferral required congressional notification before it was authorized. The Attorney General was charged with training officials in identifying and utilizing foreign intelligence information properly {{in the course of}} their duties. The government officials include those in the Federal Government who do not normally encounter or disseminate foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties, and State and local government officials who encounter, or potentially may encounter in the course of a terrorist event, foreign intelligence in the performance of their duties. A sense of Congress was expressed that officers and employees of the intelligence community <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> make every effort to establish and maintain intelligence relationships with any person, entity, or group while they conduct lawful intelligence activities.|$|E
500|$|When {{war broke}} out in August 1914, Lang {{concluded}} that the conflict was righteous, and that younger clergy <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> serve as military chaplains, {{although it was not}} their duty to fight. He thereafter was active in recruiting campaigns throughout his province. At a meeting in York in November 1914 he caused offence when he spoke out against excessive anti-German propaganda, and recalled a [...] "sacred memory" [...] of the Kaiser kneeling with King Edward VII at the bier of Queen Victoria. These remarks, perceived as pro-German, produced what Lang termed [...] "a perfect hail of denunciation". [...] The strain of this period, coupled with the onset of alopecia, drastically altered Lang's relatively youthful appearance to that of a bald and elderly-looking man. His friends were shocked; the king, meeting him on the Royal train, apparently burst into guffaws of laughter.|$|E

[...] The idea surfaced later in the 1981 book Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind, by Al Ries and Jack Trout. [...] More specifically in [...] "Chapter 23.

She supports the teaching of politics in schools, as well as lowering the voting age to 16. She also believes more women <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraged</b> <b>to</b> go into politics, and as a minister has spoken of her support for the idea of gender quotas as a way of increasing the number of female politicians. She favours the option of extending the Fair Deal scheme to include home care. Michael Brennan, of the Irish Independent has described McEntee's support of small food business as [...] "one of the brightest stories {{to come out of the}} recession". On the UK's Brexit process, McEntee has spoken of the importance of building certainty between the UK and EU: [...] "We must deal with the past and lay the foundations of a trusting relationship before we can build the future".|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} field modulated generator systems (FMGS) to dispersed solar-thermal-electric generation from a parabolic dish field with electric transport. Each solar generation unit is rated at 15 kWe and the power generated by an array of such units is electrically collected for insertion into an existing utility grid. Such an approach appears to be most suitable when the heat engine rotational speeds are high (greater than 6000 r/min) and, in particular, if they are operated in the variable speed mode and if utility-grade a. c. is required for direct insertion into the grid without an intermediate electric energy storage and reconversion system. Predictions of overall efficiencies based on conservative efficiency figures for the FMGS {{are in the range}} of 25 per cent and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>encouraging</b> <b>to</b> those involved in the development of cost-effective dispersed solar thermal power systems...|$|R
