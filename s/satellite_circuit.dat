50|$|Rune Massing (born August 18, 1980, Leeuwarden) is a Dutch {{professional}} badminton player. 2002 and 2003 {{he won the}} German team championships with SC Bayer 05 Uerdingen. In 2003 he was the <b>satellite</b> <b>circuit</b> winner.|$|E
50|$|He {{remained}} in the top 130 (with {{the exception of a}} couple of weeks) until August 1989. His singles highlights in 1988 included winning the Indian <b>Satellite</b> <b>Circuit,</b> making R2 of the ATP tour event in Schenectady (losing to Kriek in R2) and at the Seoul Olympics (where he lost to Hlasek in R2), making the finals of a Challenger in New Haven (losing to Vijay Amritraj) and the semifinal of a Challenger in Indonesia. Those performances had taken Zeeshan to 178 in the singles rankings in November 1988, but he then dominated a <b>Satellite</b> <b>circuit</b> in Japan to finish the year as 126 in singles.|$|E

He compiled an outstanding junior career, winning the Junior French Open in 2003 and reaching as high as No. 7 in the junior world rankings in June 2003. In 2002 Wawrinka became professional. In 2003 he had his first steps on the tour and ended the year as the world No. 169.|$|E
50|$|RSCS-compatible {{communications}} {{code was}} subsequently developed for MVT/HASP, MVT/ASP and MVS mainframe operating systems. By September 1979, the network {{had grown to}} include 285 mainframe nodes in Europe, Asia, and North America. Unlike the Internet, VNET switched files among mainframes using a store and forward technique. Many of the early connections operated over dial-up phone lines at speeds of 1200 to 2400 bits per second. The addition of a 19.2 kbit/s trans-Atlantic <b>satellite</b> <b>circuit</b> in late 1977 was considered a major step forward.|$|E
5000|$|ALOHAnet's primary {{importance}} was {{its use of}} {{a shared}} medium for client transmissions. Unlike the ARPANET where each node could only talk directly to a node {{at the other end}} of a wire or <b>satellite</b> <b>circuit,</b> in ALOHAnet all client nodes communicated with the hub on the same frequency. This meant that some sort of mechanism was needed to control who could talk at what time. The ALOHAnet solution was to allow each client to send its data without controlling when it was sent, with an acknowledgment/retransmission scheme used to deal with collisions. This approach radically reduced the complexity of the protocol and the networking hardware, since nodes do not need negotiate [...] "who" [...] is allowed to speak (see: Token Ring).|$|E
50|$|By default, network routers handle {{traffic on}} a first-come, first-served basis. Fixed delays cannot be {{controlled}} {{as they are}} caused by the physical distance the packets travel. They are especially problematic when <b>satellite</b> <b>circuits</b> are involved because of the long distance to a geostationary satellite and back; delays of 400-600 ms are typical. Latency can be minimized by marking voice packets as being delay-sensitive with QoS methods such as DiffServ.|$|R
50|$|Transpac 3 (TPC-3), {{which went}} into service April 18, 1989, {{increased}} capacity to 3780 channels. This {{was the first}} fiber-optic cable across the Pacific, and it replaced the two existing copper cables (Transpac 1 and Transpac2) as well as <b>satellite</b> <b>circuits</b> being used at the time. It was laid from Point Arena, California to Makaha, Hawaii, from which it goes to an undersea branching unit and splits to Chikura, Japan and Tanguisson, Guam.|$|R

50|$|After Manila he {{returned}} to Europe. In his first Grand Slam bid, Henman failed to qualify in the 1994 French Open, losing the first qualifier round to Australian Wayne Arthurs. His next tournament was the Annenheim Open in Austria, where he lost {{in the first round}} to Canadian Sébastien Lareau in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2. However, not all was bad, and Henman, ranked 161st at the time, received a wildcard to qualify for the Stella Artois Championship. In the first round Henman defeated Swedish Peter Lundgren, 7-5, 7-6, but in the second round he succumbed to the eventual champion American Todd Martin, 6-4, 6-4. Henman received a wildcard for the Manchester Open, where he lost in the first round to American Alex O'Brien, and the Wimbledon Championship, the first Grand Slam he had ever played (he failed to qualify to Wimbledon in 1993). At Wimbledon, Henman lost in the first round to German David Prinosil in four sets, 6-4, 3-6, 2-6, 2-6. His early defeat in Wimbledon forced Henman into short period of obscurity in the <b>satellite</b> <b>circuit.</b> Henman reached the semi-finals at the Bristol Open and the fourth round at the Winnetka Open (in Illinois).|$|E
50|$|He {{started the}} 1994 {{season with the}} four-legged Indian {{satellite}} circuit; there he won 18 singles matches in a row. Henman was fairly successful at the British Satellite Masters in Croydon, {{and by the end}} of the tournament he was ranked 222nd in the world. Encouraged by his success in the <b>satellite</b> <b>circuit,</b> Henman tried his luck at the ATP tour. Henman travelled to the Far East with Bates, and qualified for his first ATP tournament in April, at the Japan Tennis Championship. In his first round he defeated Kelly Jones, 6-2, 6-3, in the second round he defeated Darren Cahill, 6-2, 7-5 and in the third round Henman was defeated by Pete Sampras, 6-1, 6-2. From this performance Henman increased his ranking to 184th. His success in the Japan Open was followed by a failure to qualify at the Hong Kong Open. Because of this failure, he ended the Far East tour by entering a number of satellite tournaments. Henman entered the Nagoya Open, and defeated eighth seed Eyal Ran in the first round, but lost in the second round to Gouichi Motomura. At the Manila Open, another satellite tournament, Henman reached the final but was defeated by fifth seed Michael Tebbutt, 2-6, 2-6.|$|E

A description is given of an experiment which optimizes the simultaneous use of terrestrial and satellite circuits in a TCP/IP network. Traditionally, it has been difficult to use effectively the full capacity of high-bandwidth satellite circuits, due to long round-trip times coupled with TCP window-size limitations. The experiment significantly reduced the problem, and the result was effective use of all the available bandwidth and a <b>satellite</b> <b>circuit</b> for a single data transfer. This experiment also demonstrates the use of multiple T 1 communication lines and type of service networking over these lines...|$|E

A {{detailed analysis of}} file transfer protocol (FTP) file transfers reveals that both the TCP window size and the TCP 'slow starter' algorithm contribute to the observed limits in throughput. In this paper we summarize the experimental and and theoretical analysis of the throughput limit imposed by TCP on the <b>satellite</b> <b>circuit.</b> We then discuss in detail {{the implementation of a}} multi-socket FTP, XFTP client and server. XFTP has been tested using the ACTS system. Finally, we discuss a preliminary set of tests on a link with non-zero bit error rates. XFTP shows promising performance under these conditions, suggesting the possibility that a multi-socket application may be less effected by bit errors than a single, large-window TCP connection...|$|E
40|$|As {{the power}} level of Geostationary {{satellites}} increases, discharge phenomena on solar array are becoming {{serious threat to}} safe operation. Arcs on solar array can short-circuit the <b>satellite</b> <b>circuit,</b> decrease the satellite power, and then cause the satellite permanent failure. To prevent the failure caused by charging and arcing, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the mechanism of satellite charging and arcing phenomenon. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the occurrence condition of a secondary arc by measuring arc plasma characteristics in ground test. We measured the arc plasma temperature and identified the materials emitted using spectrometer at arbitrary time during arc occurring. We investigated the difference of secondary arcs occurrence condition during secondary arcs. From the spectroscopic measurement results, we found that it was necessary for shifting to the secondary arc that the metallic vapor same as the cathode material was emitted. In case of primary arc (PA) dimension changes, the probability of secondary arc and TSA occurrence became high. And plasma temperature was not affected by PA dimension, however the metallic vapor emission of silver was greatly affected. Thus, secondary arc occurrence greatly depends on metallic vapor emission from cathode.

40|$|Echoes {{present on}} {{telephone}} circuits {{are a significant}} problem on long circuits where the round trip delay is greater than 100 mS.

An echo canceller has been designed for New Zealand conditions which is less complex and, therefore, should be less expensive to produce than current overseas models. Although particularly applicable to New Zealand conditions, the techniques used have wider application. The general problems of echo canceller design are considered with some specific proposals being made. The two cancellers described here are non-adaptive and are based on a digital transversal filter. The later canceller employs Random Access Memory (RAM), uses pseudo random noise for system identification and compands the speech samples and filter coefficients in a true logarithmic format using multiplexing techniques for bulky and costly components...|$|R

40|$|Telephone calls routed via {{satellite}} involve long transmission paths which in rurn require significant trans-mission times {{even at the}} speed of light. This transmission time produces a delay in speech transmission of about 0. 3 seconds in each direction for a synchronous satellite. Although the delay itself is not usuaIIy noticed by the talkers, it significantly increases the disturbing effects of echo and mutilation of speech by the echo suppressors so that the overall quality of the circuit, as judged by the users, sufers. The advent of satellite telephoning has brought with it some interesting and challenging questions about the measurement of telephone transmission quality. The traditional measures of voice circuit quality of signal-to-noise ratio, bandwidth, dis-tortion, etc., are not adequate to fully evaluate this new type of circuit.

5000|$|ARQ {{was first}} used commercially in 1947 with a link from Amsterdam to New York with the master station in Amsterdam. In May 1950 the TEX (Overseas {{teleprinter}} exchange) service between New York and Amsterdam started. TEX was an early name for TELEX which is a system to allow automatic routing of private messages from a sender to a receiver on the TELEX network. Prior to the introduction or ARQ-M {{there were so many}} errors in the messages received that staff from the telecommunications companies had to manually check messages and conform correct receipt. Once ARQ-M was introduced, messages could be automatically and reliably sent over long distances via shortwave radio, and so was introduced into automatic systems. By 1956 ARQ radio circuits were running from New York to Amsterdam, Berne, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Paramaribo, Paris, Rome, and Wien, with plans for Copenhagen, Lisbon, Madrid, and Oslo. Amsterdam had radio links to Berne, Curaçao, Jakarta, Paramaribo and Rome. Brussels linked to Leopoldville. Frankfurt was connected to Madrid and Rome with plans for Buenos Aires. A link from Madrid to Canary Islands was planned. [...] By 1959 most radio circuits for Telex were using ARQ.
