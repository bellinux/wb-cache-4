Responses to the Leinster Society of Chartered Accountants (LSCA) annual salary survey in 1995 and 1996 were analysed. Employee-related and employer-related factors influencing remuneration were examined including Gender, Work experience, Level of responsibility, Employment contract and Size and Industry.  Gender was a significant explanatory variable in explaining differences in salaries paid to employees working in non-audit businesses. Gender, however, was not found to be significant in explaining differences in salaries paid in audit practices. As partners in auditing firms are not included in this research (because partners do not earn a salary) this finding must be interpreted cautiously...|$|R

Market clearing with heterogeneous quality yields geographically varying teacher salary levels that confound scarcity with unobserved differences in quality. The paper discusses identification and estimation of a model of quality-adjusted teacher salaries in local markets with unobserved market-clearing prices. Exogenous variables in the model include community and district characteristics, job characteristics and working conditions, and individual characteristics. We apply the model to estimate the relative cost of providing comparably qualified teachers for urban and rural public schools in the state of Alaska, which has high geographic variation in amenities and local financial resources.

40|$|Health worker {{salaries}} in Zambia are low by any standard. In recent times {{there have been}} real reductions in the salaries of health workers. This has resulted in significant attrition {{in the public sector}} as health workers are attracted to the private sector or leave Zambia entirely, leaving a large deficit in public sector health workers. In this study we examine the relationship between health worker incomes and their satisfaction and motivation. Cross-sectional data collection was undertaken using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A refined survey instrument was used for the quantitative data method. Document review (past and current records) was employed for the qualitative method. Data was collected in three regions that represent extremes in overall remuneration and benefits. Lusaka represented the favourable area while Monze and Nyimba represented less favourable areas for study in Zambia. There are hefty disparities between different health workers. There are also enormous <b>salary</b> <b>differentials</b> for the same workers between the public and private sectors. These <b>salary</b> <b>differentials</b> explain the experience of public to private “traffic” of health workers as well as casual private sector work by public sector health workers. In addition, there are negligible efforts by government to reduce the benefits gaps among key public health cadres. The low incomes received by public health workers in Zambia have many negative implications: it begets absenteeism, results in low output, poor quality health care, and the departure of health workers to the private sector and overseas. </p...|$|R

The authors examine the paychecks drawn by people in more than 14, 000 selling jobs and more than 4000 sales management jobs in five B 2 B industry sectors in five European countries. They show that pay levels and structures reflect an apparent balancing of two conflicting pressures: the economic imperative (to reward better performers by heightening pay dispersion) and the compensation differential compression resulting from high tax regimes. In particular, B 2 B firms appear to use variable pay as a way to lessen the <b>salary</b> <b>differential</b> compression impact of high tax regimes on salesperson motivation. Furthermore, similar to chief executive officers, sales managers can have an important multiplier effect that justifies paying them at increasing rates as job challenge rises...|$|E

Union representation had no effect on salaries compared to no formal representation. Special plans without binding arbitration led to lower salaries, while special plans with binding arbitration yielded higher salaries, but all of the estimated effects were small. Average salaries were lower the higher the proportion of female faculty in the 1970 s, but this effect became statistically insignificant by the early 1990 s. Finally, faculty salaries responded to the cost of living in the university’s city, and were higher, on average, in universities with higher average research productivity...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies optimal {{contracting}} under synergies. We define {{influence as}} {{the extent to}} which effort by one agent reduces a colleague's marginal cost of effort, and synergy to be the sum of the (unidimensional) influence parameters across a pair of agents. In a two-agent model, effort levels are equal even if influence is asymmetric. The optimal effort level depends only on total synergy and not individual influence parameters. An increase in synergy raises total effort and total pay, consistent with strong equity incentives in small firms, including among low-level employees. The influence parameters matter only for individual pay. Pay is asymmetric, with the more influential agent being paid more, even though the level and productivity of effort are both symmetric. With three agents, effort levels differ and are higher for more synergistic agents. An increase in the synergy between two agents can lead to the third agent being excluded from the team, even if his productivity is unchanged. This has implications for optimal team composition and firm boundaries. Agents that influence a greater number of colleagues receive higher wages, consistent with the <b>salary</b> <b>differential</b> between CEOs and divisional managers. ...|$|E
