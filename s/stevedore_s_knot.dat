To first order the luminosity function (LF) is a power law, with exponent α = - 2. 12 +/- 0. 04. However, after decoupling the cluster and stellar LFs, which overlap in the range - 9 < M_V < - 6, we find an apparent bend in the young cluster LF at approximately M_V = - 10. 4. The LF has a power law exponent - 2. 6 +/- 0. 2 in the brightward and - 1. 7 +/- 0. 2 in the faintward. The bend corresponds to a mass 10 ^ 5 M_, only slightly lower than the characteristic mass of globular clusters in the Milky Way (2 x 10 ^ 5 M_). The star clusters of the Antennae appear slightly resolved, with median effective radii of 4 +/- 1 pc, similar to or perhaps slightly larger than those of globular clusters in our Galaxy. However, the radial extents of some of the very young clusters (ages < 10 Myr) are much larger than those of old globular clusters. A combination of the UBVI colors, morphology, and GHRS spectra enables us to age-date the clusters in different regions of The Antennae. We find two groups of young star clusters with ages < 20 Myr and 100 Myr, as well as an intermediate-age group (500 Myr) and a handful of old globular clusters from the progenitor galaxies. Age estimates derived from GHRS spectroscopy yield 3 +/- 1 Myr for Knot K (just south of the nucleus of NGC 4038) and 7 +/- 1 Myr for <b>Knot</b> <b>S</b> in the Western Loop, in good agreement with ages derived from the UBVI colors.

Finally, we compute the Rasmussen invariant for quasipositive knots and show that most of our examples of non-slice knots are not quasipositive and were {{to the best of our}} knowledge unknown before. 1.

This invariant takes values in even integers. Its main properties are summarized as follows. 1. A. Theorem (Rasmussen [10, Theorems 1 – 4]). Let K be a <b>knot</b> in <b>S</b> 3. Then (1) s gives a lower bound on the slice (4 -dimensional) genus g 4 (K) of K: |s(K) | ≤ 2 g 4 (K); (1. 1) (2) s induces a homomorphism from Conc(S 3), the concordance group of <b>knots</b> in <b>S</b> 3, to Z; (3) If K is alternating, then s(K) = σ(K), where σ(K) is the classical knot signature of K. (4) If K can be represented by a positive diagram D, then s(K) = 2 g 4 (K) = 2 g(K) = n(D) − O(D) + 1, (1. 2) where n(D) and O(D) are the number of crossings and Seifert circles of D, respectively, and g(K) is the ordinary genus of K; 1. B. Corollary ([10, Corollary 4. 3]). Let K+ and K − be two knots that are different at a single crossing that is positive in K+ and negative in K−. Then s(K−) ≤ s(K+) ≤ s(K−) + 2.

It emphasizes the fact that ribbon torus-knots with a given filling are in one-to-one correspondence with welded knots before quo-tient under classical Reidemeister moves and reformulates these moves and the known sources of non-injectivity of the Tube map in terms of filling changes. This note investigates the already known connection between welded knots, that is a quotient of the virtual knot theory, and ribbon torus-knots, that is a restricted notion of <b>knotted</b> surfaces in <b>S</b> 4. Virtual <b>knots</b> are a completion of usual knots thought of as abstract circles with {{a finite number of}} ori-ented and signed pairs of merged points.

The near-infrared colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams are studied {{to discuss the}} nature of these sources. We have discovered the knots of molecular hydrogen emission at 2. 122 micron in the central region of <b>S</b> 201. These <b>knots</b> are clearly seen along the diffuse emission in north-west direction which are probably the obscured Herbig-Haro objects. High sensitivity and high resolution radio continuum images from GMRT observations at 610 and 1280 MHz show an interesting arc-shaped structure due to the interaction between the H II region and the adjacent molecular cloud. The ionization front at the interface between the H II region and the molecular cloud is clearly seen by comparing the radio, molecular hydrogen and Br Gamma images. The emission from the carriers of Unidentified Infrared Bands in the mid-infrared 6 - 9 micron (possibly due to PAHs) as extracted from the Midcourse Space Experiment survey (at 8, 12, 14 and 21 micron) is compared with the radio emission. The HIRES processed IRAS maps at 12, 25, 60, and 100 micron, have also been used for comparison. The spatial distribution of the temperature and the optical depth of the warm dust component around S 201 region, has been generated from the mid-infrared images.

40|$|Abstract. We {{characterize}} the Murasugi polynomial of an equivariant slice knot by proving a conjecture of J. Davis and <b>S.</b> Naik. A <b>knot</b> K in <b>S</b> 3 is called periodic of period p {{if there is}} an orientation preserving action of Z/p on S 3 which preserves K setwise and its fixed point set A is a circle disjoint to K. A is called the axis. Two periodic knots K 0 and K 1 of period p are called equivariantly concordant {{if there is an}} action of Z/p on S 3 × [0, 1] such that Ki × i is periodic via its restriction on S 3 ×i, i = 0, 1, and there is a locally flat submanifold in S 3 ×[0, 1] which is preserved by the action, homeomorphic to S 1 ×[0, 1], and bounded by (K 0 × 0) ∪−(K 1 × 1). The unknotted circle S 1 × 0 ⊂ ∂(D 2 ×D 2) = S 3 {{can be viewed as a}} periodic knot via the (2 π/p) -rotation on the first D 2 factor. If a periodic knot K is equivariantly concordant to it, K is called an equivariant slice knot. There are several known obstructions for a periodic knot K to being an equivariant slice knot. Some of them are obtained from invariants of K. In [7], Naik used the Alexander polynomial and metabolizers of the Seifert form of K. She also showed that certain Casson-Gordon invariants of K must vanish if K is equivariant slice. In [3], Choi...|$|R
40|$|These notes {{supplement}} my planned talk on Feb 19, 2004, at the First East Asian School of Knots and Related Topics, Seoul, South Korea. I {{will review}} {{aspects of the}} interconnections between braids, knots and contact structures on IR 3. I will discuss my recent work with William Menasco [7] and [8], where we prove that there are distinct transversal knot types in IR 3 having the same topological knot type and the same Bennequin invariant. A knot in oriented IR 3 is the image X of an oriented circle S 1 under a smooth embedding e: S 1 → IR 3. Viewing S 3 as IR 3 ∪ ∞, we also can think of X as being a <b>knot</b> in <b>S</b> 3. The <b>knot</b> type X of X is its equivalence class under smooth isotopy of the pair (X,S 3). Let A be the z axis in IR 3, with standard cylindrical coordinates (ρ,θ,z) and let H be the collection of all half-planes Hθ through A. The pair (A,H) defines the standard braid structure on IR 3. See the left sketch in Figure 1. Using the same cylindrical coordinates, let α be the 1 -form Figure 1 : (i) The standard braid structure in IR 3; (ii) The standard polar contact structure on IR 3 α = ρ 2 dθ + dz. The kernel ξ of α defines a contact structure on IR 3. The associated plane field is sketched on the right in Figure 1. The family of 2 -planes that define ξ twist anticlockwise a...|$|R
