40|$|Background and Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the abdominal muscle <b>structural</b> <b>adaptations</b> and functional capabilities during pregnancy and the postbirth period. Subjects. Six primigravid subjects, aged 28 to 33 years, participated in nine test sessions from 14 weeks of gestation to 8 weeks postbirth. Methods. At each test session, three-dimensional photography of abdominal skin markers was used to determine the gross morphology of a representative abdominal muscle, the rectus abdominis muscle. The functional capability of the abdominal muscle group was assessed on the ability of the muscle group to stabilize the pelvis against resistance. Results. Increases were found in rectus abdominis muscle separation width, length, and angles of insertion as pregnancy progressed. Reversal in rectus abdominis muscle separation was found by 4 weeks postbirth. The ability to stabilize the pelvis against resistance was shown to be decreased as pregnancy progressed and remained compromised postbirth. Decrements in abdominal muscle function paralleled in time the <b>structural</b> <b>adaptations,</b> as pregnancy progressed. Continued functional deficits were found in parallel with incomplete resolution of <b>structural</b> <b>adaptations</b> postbirth. Conclusion and Discussion. Abdominal muscle function is affected by <b>structural</b> <b>adaptations</b> that occur during pregnancy. Because our results showed that the ability to stabilize the pelvis against resistance is decreased during pregnancy and at least 8 weeks postbirth, abdominal muscle exercises should be chosen with care...|$|R

50|$|Leaf window, {{also known}} as {{epidermal}} window, is a specialized leaf structure consisting of a translucent area where sunlight can enter into the interior surfaces of the plant's modified leaf where photosynthesis can occur. This is {{also known as}} fenestration. The translucent structure may include epidermal tissue, and in some succulent plants it consists of several cell layers of parenchyma, which may also function as water-storage tissue. It can appear as a large continuous patch, a variegated or reticulated region, or as numerous small spots. This <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> is found in certain succulent plants native to arid climates, which allow much of the plant to remain beneath the soil surface where it is protected from desiccation of extreme winds and heat while optimizing the absorption of light by increasing the photosynthetic surface area.

5000|$|Commensalism, in biology, is a {{relation}} between individuals of two species {{in which one}} species obtains food or other benefits from the other without either harming or benefiting the latter. The commensal (the species that benefits from the association) may obtain nutrients, shelter, support, or locomotion from the host species, which is substantially unaffected. The commensal relation is often between a larger host and a smaller commensal; the host organism is unmodified, whereas the commensal species may show great <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> consonant with its habits, as in the remoras that ride attached to sharks and other fishes. Both remora and pilot fish feed on the leftovers of their hosts' meals. Numerous birds feed on the insects turned up by grazing mammals, while other birds obtain soil organisms stirred up by the plow.

50|$|A {{plastron}} {{is a type}} of <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> occurring {{among some}} aquatic arthropods (primarily insects), a form of inorganic gill which holds a thin film of atmospheric oxygen in an area with small openings called spiracles that connect to the tracheal system. The plastron typically consists of dense patches of hydrophobic setae on the body, which prevent water entry into the spiracles, but may also involve scales or microscopic ridges projecting from the cuticle. The physical properties of the interface between the trapped air film and surrounding water allow gas exchange through the spiracles, almost as if the insect were in atmospheric air. Carbon dioxide diffuses into the surrounding water due to its high solubility, while oxygen diffuses into the film as the concentration within the film has been reduced by respiration, and nitrogen also diffuses out as its tension has been increased. Oxygen diffuses into the air film at a higher rate than nitrogen diffuses out. However, water surrounding the insect can become oxygen-depleted if there is no water movement, so many such insects in still water actively direct a flow of water over their bodies.|$|E

40|$|When an {{incremental}} structural learning method gradually modifies a Bayesian network (BN) structure {{to fit a}} sequential stream of observations, we call the process <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation.</b> <b>Structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> is useful when the learner is set {{to work in an}} unknown environment, where a BN is gradually being constructed as observations of the environment are made. Existing algorithms for incremental learning assume that the samples in the database have been drawn from a single underlying distribution. In this paper we relax this assumption, so that the underlying distribution can change during the sampling of the database. The proposed method can thus be used in unknown environments, where it is not even known whether the dynamics of the environment are stable.

40|$|Arcades are {{blood vessels}} that form direct {{connections}} between two arteries or arterioles. Because they are supplied with blood from two sources, arcades can function as alternative flow pathways following obstruction of arteries or arterioles, as in coronary and peripheral vascular disease and stroke. In response {{to changes in}} blood flow or metabolic conditions, vascular networks undergo <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> or remodeling, which includes structural changes of the existing vessels and growth of new vessels. Following obstruction of a blood supply, arcade vessels may adjust their internal diameters chronically to convert the alternative pathways into main blood distribution vessels. The overall goal of this dissertation was to examine structural changes in the internal diameter of a single arcade artery and the arterioles of an arcade network following changes in blood flow, using experimental and theoretical approaches. Diameter changes of the mouse gracilis arcade artery were observed up to 56 days following resection {{of one of its}} two blood supplies. Overall, diameters increased to a maximum around day 21 and then declined. The diameter changes were spatially non-uniform, being largest towards the point of resection, providing transiently increased perfusion to the most affected regions. Observed diameter changes were compared with predictions of a theoretical model, in which diameter varies in response to stimuli derived from local metabolic and hemodynamic conditions. Good agreement was found when effects of a time-delayed growth stimulus in regions of reduced perfusion were included, with a delay of about 7 days. The effectiveness of arcades in maintaining perfusion both immediately following obstruction and after <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> in the arteriolar arcade network between two feed artery branches of the pig triceps brachii muscle was examined. Morphometric data from vascular casting and published data were used to develop a computational model for the hemodynamics and <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> of the network in response to local stimuli. The results show that the arcades provide alternative flow pathways to the region initially supplied by the obstructed branch and that <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> can lead to improved flow restoration following interruption of blood flow...|$|E

To ensure adequate flow distribution, metabolic responses are needed to increase diameters of vessels feeding poorly perfused regions. Possible modes of metabolic control include release of signaling substances from vessel walls, from the supplied tissue and from red blood cells (RBC). Here, a theoretical model {{was used to compare}} the abilities of these metabolic control modes to provide adequate tissue oxygenation, and to generate blood flow velocities in agreement with experimental observations. <b>Structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> of vessel diameters was simulated for an observed mesenteric network structure in the rat with 576 vessel segments. For each mode of metabolic control, resulting distributions of oxygen and deviations between simulated and experimentally observed flow velocities were analyzed. It was found that wall-derived and tissue-derived growth signals released {{in response to}} low oxygen levels could ensure adequate oxygen supply, but RBC-derived signals caused inefficient oxygenation. Closest agreement between predicted and observed flow velocities was obtained with wall-derived growth signals proportional to vessel length. Adaptation in response to oxygen-independent release of a metabolic signal substance from vessel walls or the supplied tissue was also shown to be effective for ensuring tissue oxygenation due to a dilution effect if growth signal substances are released into the blood. The present results suggest that metabolic signals responsible for <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> of microvessel diameters are derived from vessel walls or from perivascular tissue...|$|E

30|$|In general, {{adaptation}} is {{a biological}} {{process by which}} an organism becomes more competent {{to live in a}} given habitat [8]. Following adaptation, microorganisms exhibit different physiological and structural activities compared to their non-adapted counterparts [9]. Thus, adaptation provides a kind of biological insurance for an organism to encounter varying environments in a given ecological niche. The adaptive traits may be structural, behavioural or physiological. <b>Structural</b> <b>adaptation</b> includes variations in shape and size of the organism. The alteration of membrane fluidity, by both psychrophilic and thermophilic bacteria, is an example of <b>structural</b> <b>adaptation.</b> This type of modulation in membrane fluidity serves as a protection against harsh temperatures. While behavioural adaptations are composed of inherited behaviour chains, physiological adaptations allow the organism to perform special functions for the adjustment of cellular growth and development, regulation of temperature, etc. Bacterial secretion of exo-polysaccharides for their attachment to a solid surface is an example of physiological adaptation.|$|E

Perkins growing in two contiguous formations of restinga vegetation at Praia Virgem, in the municipality of Rio das Ostras, RJ. Both the Open Palmae (OPS) and the Sandy Strip Closed Shrub (SSCS) formations are found in coastal regions that receive between 1, 100 and 1, 300 mm of rainfall per year. Sapwood samples were collected in both formations. Typical anatomical features for this species include: solitary vessels, radial multiples or clusters elements, that are circular to angular in outline, 5 - 15 barred scalarifor perforation plates, ood parenchya scanty, septate fiber-tracheids, and wide multiseriate rays with prismatic crystals. Statistical analyses indicated {{a significant increase in}} the frequency of vessel elements and an increase in fiber-tracheid diameters in OPS individuals. These characteristics are considered <b>structural</b> <b>adaptations</b> to increased water needs caused by a greater exposure to sunlight.

Here, analysis of genomic sequences shows that mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases with <b>structural</b> <b>adaptations</b> similar to CYT- 18 's are uniquely characteristic of fungi belonging to the subphylum Pezizomycotina, and biochemical assays confirm group I intron splicing activity for the enzymes from several of these organisms, including Aspergillus nidulans and the human pathogens Coccidioides posadasii and Histoplasma capsulatum. By combining multiple sequence alignments with a previously determined cocrystal structure of a CYT- 18 /group I intron RNA complex, we identify conserved features of the Pezizomycotina enzymes related to group I intron and tRNA interactions. Our results suggest that mitochondrial tyrosyl-tRNA synthetases with group I intron splicing activity evolved during or after the divergence of the fungal subphyla Pezizomycotina and Saccharomycotina by a mechanism involving the concerted differentiation of preexisting protein loop regions.
