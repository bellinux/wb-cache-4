25|$|The {{first study}} {{concentrated}} on cesium-137. Around the nuclear plant, places were found containing up to 40.000 becquerels/kg, 8 times the governmental <b>safety</b> <b>limit</b> of 5.000 becquerels/kg. Places further away were just below this maximum. East and north-east {{from the plant}} the soil was contaminated the most. North-west and westwards the soil was less contaminated, because of mountain protection.|$|E
25|$|On 16 September 2011 {{the results}} were {{published}} of the measurements of radioactive cesium in rice. The results were known of around 60 percent of all test-locations. Radioactive materials were detected in 94 locations, or 4.3 percent of the total. But the highest level detected so far, in Fukushima prefecture, was 136 becquerels per kilogram, {{about a quarter of}} the government's <b>safety</b> <b>limit</b> of 500 Becquerel per kilogram. Tests were conducted in 17 prefectures, and were completed in more than half of them. In 22 locations radioactive materials were detected in harvested rice. The highest level measured was 101.6 becquerels per kilogram, or one fifth of the <b>safety</b> <b>limit.</b> Shipments of rice did start in 15 prefectures, including all 52 municipalities in the prefecture Chiba. In Fukushima shipments of ordinary rice did start in 2 municipalities, and those of early-harvested rice in 20 municipalities.|$|E

Undetected leaks could not be ruled out, because the reactor basements remained flooded. The company was building a 2,400-foot-long steel and concrete wall between the site and the ocean, reaching 100feet below ground, but it would not be finished before mid-2014. Around August 2012 two greenling were caught close to shore.

25|$|As {{a result}} of the panel's recommendations, the USFS and BLM {{declined}} to renew the leases on nine C-130A and PB4Y-2 airtankers, and ordered the 33 remaining large airtankers to undergo an improved inspection program before they returned to active service. The agencies contracted with the Sandia National Laboratories to analyze the safety of continuing use of three types of airtankers, the Douglas DC series (DC-4, DC-6 and DC-7), P-3 Orion and P-2 Neptune. In addition, 11 of 19 Beechcraft Baron 58P leadplanes were also retired, as they had exceeded the 6,000 flight hour airframe <b>safety</b> <b>limit.</b> To further reduce the risk to the fleet, the agencies directed their field managers to use airtankers primarily for initial attack only.|$|E
25|$|On 23 September 2011 {{radioactive}} caesium in concentrations above the governmental <b>safety</b> <b>limit</b> {{was found in}} rice samples collected in an area in the northeastern part of the prefecture Fukushima. Rice-samples taken before the harvest showed 500 becquerels per kilogram {{in the city of}} Nihonmatsu. The Japanese government ordered a two way testing procedure of samples taken before and after the harvest. Pre-harvest tests were carried out in nine prefectures in the regions of Tohoku and Kanto. After the find of this high level of cesium, the prefectural government dis increase the number of places to be tested within the city from 38 to about 300. The city of Nihonmatsu held an emergency meeting on 24 September with officials from the prefecture government. The farmers, that already had started harvesting, were ordered to store their crop until the post-harvest tests were available.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to predict the <b>Limiting</b> <b>Safety</b> System Settings and <b>Safety</b> <b>Limits</b> for the upgraded reactor (MITR-III). The MITR Multi-Channel Analysis Code was written to analyze the response of the MITR system to a series of anticipated transients in order to determine the <b>Limiting</b> <b>Safety</b> System Settings and <b>Safety</b> <b>Limits</b> under various operating conditions. The MIT Multi-Channel Analysis Code models the primary and secondary systems, with special emphasis placed on analyzing the thermal-hydraulic conditions in the core. The code models each MITR fuel element explicitly in order to predict the behavior of the system during flow instabilities. The results of the code are compared to experimental data from MITR-II and other sources. New definitions are suggested for the <b>Limiting</b> <b>Safety</b> System Settings and <b>Safety</b> <b>Limits.</b> MITR Limit Diagrams are included for three different heat removal system configurations.

At the end of October 2012 TEPCO admitted that it could not exclude radioactivity releases into the ocean, although the radiation levels were stabilised. Undetected leaks into the ocean from the reactors, could not be ruled out, because their basements remain flooded with cooling water, and the 2,400-foot-long steel and concrete wall between the site’s reactors and the ocean, that should reach 100feet underground, was still under construction, and would not be finished before mid-2014.

500|$|The {{physicists}} at Aldermaston {{had plenty}} of {{ideas about how to}} follow up Grapple X. Possibilities were discussed in September 1957. One was to tinker with the width of the shells in the Dick to find an optimal configuration. If they were too thick, they would slow the neutrons generated by the fusion reaction; if they were too thin, they would give rise to Taylor instability. Another was {{to do away with the}} shells entirely and use a mixture of uranium-235, uranium-238 and deuterium. Ken Allen had an idea, which Sam Curran supported, of a three-layer Dick that used lithium deuteride that was less enriched in lithium-6 (and therefore had more lithium-7), but more of it, reducing the amount of uranium-235 in the centre of the core.
