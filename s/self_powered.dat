40|$|The <b>self</b> <b>power</b> {{generation}} {{can be an}} alternative, to the industries, {{in view of the}} {{low quality}} of energy supply by conventional network, especially in industries that generate waste with energy potential. Thus, the objective {{of this study was to}} compare, economically, <b>self</b> <b>power</b> generating using wood waste as fuel, with the receipt of electricity by conventional network in a small timber industry. It was determined the values of energy consumption by each equipment that is a part of industry and, based on encountered values, it was determined the actual cost of its generation, comparing its values with the prices of energy by conventional network. Based on these results can be noted that the purchase of electricity by conventional network is the most economically advantageous when compared with <b>self</b> <b>power</b> generation under the conditions studied in this work, however, even with the economic advantage of obtaining energy from the network, the generation itself becomes a sustainable alternative from the environmental and social standpoint. </p...|$|R

40|$|Book synopsis: In this original, {{interdisciplinary}} {{approach to}} evil in French literature, Damian Catani links literary depictions of evil with cultural events to chart {{a history of}} the concept {{in some of the most}} important texts in modern literature. Beginning with Balzac and Baudelaire, Catani covers the restoration and the Second Empire before interpreting how Catholic stereotypes of the 'evil feminine' and new scientific theories impacted the work of Lautréamont and Zola. Moving into the twentieth century, evil is then explored in terms of the <b>Self,</b> <b>power,</b> knowledge and politics through readings of Proust, Céline, Sartre and Foucault. By seamlessly bringing together aesthetic, philosophical, historical and ideological concerns to read key French writers from the 18 th to the 21 st century, this study argues why a broader treatment of literary evils is vital to understanding our contemporary moral and political climate...|$|R
