We obtain a quantitative measure of â€˜stringency of labour regulationsâ€™ by applying majority rule on three different measures used in the literature. The results show that average labour productivity increases with the increase in the ratio of permanent workers to contractual workers, unless the industries are not operating in states having rigid/pro-worker labour regulationsâ€”which implies a negative impact of contractualization on labour productivity. Besides, the results show that the rigid/pro-worker labour regulations have negative impact on employment generation; it is especially discernible in labour-intensive industries.

40|$|Complexes of poly-L-tyrosine (PT) with dipalmitoyl{{lecithin}}, synthetic, (DPL) {{and with}} egg lecithin (EL) {{have been obtained}} by precipitation from methanol-water solutions. Chemical analysis indicates that both lecithins bind PT up to a limiting ratio of about 4 tyrosine residues/lecithin molecule. DPL-PT complexes have a lamellar structure closely resembling lecithin itself. In fact, DPL and DPL-PT lamellae have very nearly the same thickness as precipitated from methanol-water, although their swelling behavior on resuspension in pure water is different. The complexes crystallize {{in the form of}} hexagonal platelets, some monolayers and some with terraced <b>spiral</b> <b>growths,</b> with a thickness of 50 - 55 A.
