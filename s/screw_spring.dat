40|$|The spatial {{force-deflection}} {{behavior of}} an elastically suspended body {{is characterized by}} a 6 x 6 positive semidefinite matrix, the stiffness matrix. A better understanding of general compliant behavior is of general interest and is particularly important in understanding the behavior of robotic systems. The ability to specify and realize desired compliant behavior is an important issue in providing a robot the ability to react to contact forces in a prescribed beneficial way. The generation of procedures to realize an arbitrary stiffness matrix using springs with the simplest possible construction is the main component of this work. In the dissertation, the following issues are addressed. (1) The identification of the realizable space of spatial stiffnesses achieved with a parallel connection of 2 ̆ 2 simple springs 2 ̆ 2 (conventional line springs and conventional torsional springs). (2) The synthesis of a simple spring realizable stiffness matrix. An algorithm is developed based on the decomposition of the stiffness matrix into rank- 1 components with a specific form. This procedure requires no more than seven simple springs to realize an arbitrary simple spring realizable full-rank stiffness matrix. (3) The realization of an arbitrary stiffness matrix. To overcome the limitation of simple springs, a new type of elastic device that couples the spring force and torque along the same axis must be used. These devices are defined as 2 ̆ 2 <b>screw</b> <b>springs</b> 2 ̆ 2. Procedures to synthesize any stiffness matrix with a parallel connection of simple <b>springs</b> and <b>screw</b> <b>springs</b> are developed. (4) A physical interpretation of spatial stiffness behavior. Based on the stiffness eigen-screw problem, a new decomposition of a stiffness matrix is established. This decomposition is shown to be independent of coordinate frame and to have extremal properties. With this decomposition, some physical insight into the behavior associated with a general spatial stiffness matrix is provided. (5) A classification of spatial stiffness matrices. To evaluate the translational-rotational coupling aspects of a stiffness matrix, an invariant, referred to as the 2 ̆ 2 degree of translational-rotational coupling 2 ̆ 2 (DTRC), is defined. The DTRC is based on the minimum number of 2 ̆ 2 coupled 2 ̆ 2 components in all decompositions of a stiffness matrix. A classification of spatial stiffness matrices based on this number is established...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Mathematical {{modeling}} {{of the impact}} of a solid body upon a buffer positioned on a thin isotropic plate, whose dynamic behaviour is described by the Uflyand-Mindlin wave equations taking the rotary inertia and shear deformations into account, is investigated. Two types of the isotropic plate are considered in the present paper: elastic and viscoelastic. The buffer represents a steel <b>screw</b> cylindrical <b>spring</b> and a liquid damper connected with the spring consecutively. Wave equations allow to assume that in a plate the transient wave of transverse shear, because of which there is a deformation of a plate material outside of contact area, is generated with final velocity. As a method of the decision the ray method and method of splicing asymptotic expansion received for small times in a contact area and outside of it are used. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{next step}} up from the simple nut is a split nut, whose halves can be {{adjusted}} and locked with screws so that one side rides leftward thread faces, {{and the other side}} rides rightward faces. Notice the analogy here with the radio dial example using split gears, where the split halves are pushed in opposing directions. Unlike in the radio dial example, the spring tension idea is not useful here, because machine tools taking a cut put too much force against the <b>screw.</b> Any <b>spring</b> light enough to allow slide movement at all would allow cutter chatter at best and slide movement at worst. These screw-adjusted split-nut-on-an-Acme-leadscrew designs cannot eliminate all backlash on a machine slide unless they are adjusted so tight that the travel starts to bind. Therefore, this idea can't totally obviate the always-approach-from-the-same-direction concept; but backlash can be held to a small amount (1 or 2 thousandths of an inch), which is more convenient and in some non-precise work is enough to allow one to ignore the backlash (i.e., act as if there weren't any).|$|R

5000|$|Regardless of {{the collet}} design, the {{operating}} principle is the same: squeeze the collet radially against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction. Under correct conditions, it holds quite securely. Almost all collet chucks achieve the radial squeezing motion via moving one or more male-female pairs of tapered (conical) surfaces axially, which produces the radial squeezing in a highly concentric manner. Depending on the collet design, it can be either pulled (via a threaded section {{at the rear of}} the collet) or pushed (via a threaded cap with a second taper) into a matching conical socket to achieve the clamping action. As the collet is forced into the tapered socket, the collet will contract, gripping the contents of the inner cylinder. (The axial movement of cones is not mandatory, however; a split bushing squeezed radially with a linear force—e.g., set <b>screw,</b> solenoid, <b>spring</b> clamp, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder—achieves the same principle without the cones; but concentricity can only be had to the extent that the bushing's diameters are perfect for the particular object being held.

Suitable materials and appropriate manufacturing techniques for the construction of the actuator are discussed. Kinematics and working principle of the actuator are analyzed. The actuator model is simulated on the physical implementation for dynamics and control for different conditions. Simulation results prove satisfactory performances of the design.

The appliance includes two distal screws (one for each side) dividing the Nance button into two sections. The anterior part provides anchorage, while the posterior includes distal <b>screw</b> and TMA <b>springs,</b> which represent the active elements of the appliance. Differently to the Pendulum-K described by Kinzinger et al. [14], the TMA springs are not activated by opening the distal screw. Distal screw is already opened {{at the beginning of}} treatment in order to get TMA wires close to the lingual sheath {{of the second}} molar (Figure  1 a). The TMA springs are then activated intraorally by the clinician (300 g for each side) once or twice during the procedure adding uprighting bends {{to the end of the}} TMA wire in order to prevent excessive molar tipping [23]. Initially, the first molars are excluded from the anchorage unit, allowing them to partially follow the distal movement of the second molars. Once a ‘super class I’ molar relationship is achieved at the second molar (about 4 to 5 months), the distal screws are completely closed and the TMA springs disengaged from the second molar and inserted into the lingual sheaths of the first molar (Figure  1 b).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the modular design {{and control of}} a novel variable impedance compact compliant wearable ankle robot (powered Ankle-Foot Orthosis, AFO) for overground gait rehabilitation and assistance mainly for stroke patients. Design of AFO, its construction, kinematics, working principle, actuation, control etc. are described. A novel variable impedance compact compliant series elastic actuator (SEA) is designed to actuate the AFO with variable impedance and compliance. The actuator design consists of a servomotor, a ball <b>screw,</b> a torsional <b>spring</b> connecting the motor and the ball screw via a pair of spur gear, {{and a set of}} translational springs connecting the ball screw nut to the output link. Two types of springs of the actuator with different stiffness provide variable impedance and compliance to the AFO based on the range of operational force. The translational springs with low stiffness are used to handle the low force operation that reduces friction, impedance and impact. The torsional spring, being in the high speed range, has high effective stiffness and improves bandwidth in large force operation when the translational springs are fully compressed. Application of the variable impedance compact compliant actuator makes the AFO compact, and it may enhance user-friendliness. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the AFO design. Competitive advantages of AFO over its existing counterparts are described and its future extensions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Cold forming {{generally}} {{allows the}} reproduction of parts with a high production rate and low waste of material. For this reason, many small parts for example {{of the body of}} a smartphone undergo at least one forming operation during their fabrication, e. g. <b>screws,</b> brackets or <b>springs.</b> However, when the size of forming products is reduced to the micro range, size effects appear and affect the forming process. One size effect leads to the fact that conventional multi stage upsetting processes cannot be scaled to micro range accordingly. As a consequence, the maximum achievable upset ratio decreases from 2. 3 in macro range to values below 2 in micro range. This reduces the efficiency of the upsetting process significantly as more upsetting stages have to be carried out to reach the desired shape of the forming product. A very promising approach to reduce required forming stages is the laser rod end melting process which takes advantage of a size effect. Herein, the lower end of a rod is melted by the energy of a laser beam. The molten part of the rod automatically forms spherical due to surface tension. This droplet-shaped part is called “preform”. After total cooling, the preform is upset within a single stage cold forming operation to achieve the desired shape. In this paper, results of the upsetting operation with regard to surface accuracy of the forming product are presented. It is shown that surface characteristics with dimensions as small as 500 [*]nm can be reasonably reproduced...|$|R
