By 1906 Germany was already spending 60% of revenue upon the army. Either an enormous sum now had to be found to develop the navy further, or naval expansion had to be abandoned. The decision to continue was taken by Tirpitz in September 1905 and agreed by Chancellor Bernhard von Bülow and the Kaiser, while Dreadnought was still at the planning stage. The larger ships would naturally be more expensive, but also would require enlargement of harbours, locks and the Kiel canal, all of which would be enormously expensive. Estimated cost for new dreadnoughts was placed at 36.5 million marks for 19,000 tons displacement ships (larger than Dreadnought at 17,900 tons), and 27.5 million marks for battle-cruisers. 60 million mark was allocated for dredging the canal. The Reichstag was persuaded to agree to the program and passed a Novelle (a <b>supplementary</b> <b>law)</b> amending the navy bills and allocating 940 million marks for a dreadnought program and the necessary infrastructure.

40|$|O objetivo da presente dissertação é contribuir para o aprimoramento do debate que se trava, desde a promulgação da Constituição de 1988, sobre a cooperação preconizada pelo parágrafo único do artigo 23, como forma de se realizar as tarefas administrativas comuns a todos os quatro entes federados. Com efeito, avaliamos não só as competências contidas na atual Constituição - demonstrando que a competência comum é autônoma e, portanto, ao lado das demais, estabelece o regime atual de repartição constitucional de competências - como, também, as principais normas constitucionais relacionadas com as Cartas Políticas anteriores, com o intuito de construir um raciocínio que nos conduza ao modelo atual de cooperação advindo do acima mencionado parágrafo único do artigo 23. A partir daquela metodologia, constatamos que esse agir estatal cooperado estabelecido pela Constituição de 1988, não obstante possuir raízes nas Constituições anteriores, é inovador e contemporâneo, refletindo o regime cooperativo estatal de agir previsto nos artigos 91 a e 91 b da Lei Fundamental de Bonn, com a redação que lhes conferiu a reforma de 1969. A cooperação será voluntária até a edição da lei complementar anunciada pelo parágrafo único do artigo 23 da Carta de 1988. Após, será ela obrigatória, mas esta obrigatoriedade somente surtirá efeitos a partir do momento em que os entes federados façam a opção pelo agir integrado, ou seja, desde que optem por realizar as tarefas administrativas comuns de forma cooperada, pois aquela lei complementar não tem autorização constitucional para estabelecer normas que reflitam qualquer tipo de subordinação, já que isso violaria a autonomia política a eles constitucionalmente assegurada. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to present a contribution to the juridical debate over the issue of cooperation, between the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities, to carry out common administrative functions assigned to federal, state and local governments. This legal discussion has been troublesome since the promulgation of the Federal Constitution of 1988, which introduced a provision, in the sole paragraph of article 23, to regulate the matter of cooperation between the four public entities comprised in the Federative Republic of Brazil. As a matter of fact, this study not only analyzes the power (or authority) granted by the Constitution of 1988, in common, to the four above mentioned public entities, but also evaluates provisions of former Brazilian Constitutions dealing with that subject to devise a legal perspective on the cooperative model introduced under the rule of the sole paragraph of article 23. Hence, it demonstrates that common power (or authority) is autonomous and constitutes, with other forms of governmental authority, part of the constitutional framework of separation of powers. Based on such premises the conclusion of this essay purports that, notwithstanding the fact that cooperation between public entities has its roots in past Brazilian constitutional regulations, the form of cooperative action designed by the Constitution of 1988 is innovative and up- to-date, reflecting the model of state cooperative form of action introduced in Germany, during the constitutional reform of 1969, through the discipline of articles 91 a and 91 b of the German Constitution. Cooperation between the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities shall be voluntary until the enactment of a <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Law</b> prescribed in the rule of the sole paragraph of article 23 of the Brazilian Constitution. After the passing of such legislation cooperation shall became mandatory, if the public entities involved decide to carry out common administrative tasks in a combined fashion. It is to be noticed, however, that the <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Law</b> referred in the sole paragraph of article 23 shall not establish any kind of subordination or hierarchy between the Union, the states, the Federal District and the municipalities due to constitutional provisions granting political autonomy to each of those entities...|$|E
40|$|Trata-se o presente trabalho do instituto da imunidade tributária referente ao disposto no art. 150, VI, b e c da Constituição Federal de 1988. É analisada cada forma de imunidade das entidades do elenco da norma constitucional, bem como traz a lume as polêmicas quanto à tributação das atividades de cada tipo associativo homenageado pelo constituinte originário na Carta Maior. A imunidade tributária somente é possível de ser tratada diante da Competência Tributária Impositiva ao limitar os poderes da União Federal, dos Municípios, dos Estados e do Distrito Federal em criar tributos. O tratamento tributário dado à exploração {{comercial}} e às propriedades pertencentes à Igreja (alínea "b" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988), ou seja, àquelas receitas que são provenientes de atividades atípicas, sempre causaram dúvidas na jurisprudência e dividem a doutrina até hoje. Não diferente é o tratamento tributário dado à produção e circulação de bens das entidades do elenco da alínea "c" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988, cujas atividades atípicas, por muitos são entendidas como tributáveis. As atividades típicas, por sua vez, quando inerentes aos templos de qualquer culto, devem ser qualificadas pela imunidade plena, enquanto as entidades da alínea "c" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988, são deparadas com a norma de imunidade de eficácia contida, da qual depende de lei complementar, cuja discussão no presente trabalho traz a polêmica acerca da aplicação da lei ordinária ou da lei complementar; a posição maciça dos tribunais é no sentido da ratificação do art. 14 do Código Tributário Nacional, como requisito para qualificar quais entidades devem ser brindadas com a imunidade. Por fim, para não ficar somente no campo teórico, o presente trabalho analisa a aplicação da imunidade aos tipos associativos do elenco das alíneas "b" e "c" do art. 150, VI da Constituição Federal de 1988 sob a ótica dos Tribunais pátriosThis study {{seeks to}} bring the understanding of tax immunity system according to article 150, VI, "b" and "c" of the Federal Constitution of 1988. Each type of immunity from the constitutional law is analyzed. It is also brought to light the controversy regarding the taxation of the activities of each associative type embraced by the constituent present in the Federal Constitution. Tax exemption is only possible {{to be dealt with}} before the mandatory tax jurisdiction that limits the powers of the Federal Government, the Municipalities, the States and the Federal District to create taxes. The tax treatment given to commercial exploitation and to the properties owned by the Church ("b" of article 150, VI of the Constitution of 1988), that is, revenue originating from atypical activities, has always raised doubts in jurisprudence and caused doctrine to have different views, today. It is no different the tax treatment given to production and circulation of goods from entities mentioned in article 150, VI, "c" of 1988 Federal Constitution, since the atypical activities are regarded by many as taxable. Typical activities, in turn, when related to temples of any cult, must be qualified for full immunity while entities of article 150, VI, "c" of the 1988 Federal Constitution, have to face the immunity rules of limited discretionary accountability which depends on the <b>supplementary</b> <b>law.</b> The present investigation discusses the controversy on the adoption of either ordinary or <b>supplementary</b> <b>law.</b> Courts major position is towards ratification of article 14 of the National Tax Code, as a requirement to qualify which entities should be entitled to immunity.

30|$|The Federal Republic of Germany {{refused to}} pay reparations not only to top KPD officials, {{but in some cases}} also to less {{prominent}} communists. The legal basis for this was the 1953 Federal <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Law</b> (Bundesergänzungsgesetz, BErG), which stipulated, amongst other things, that claimants who ‘oppose[d] the free democratic order’ (Quoted in Spernol, 2014 : p. 252) had no legal claim to reparation. The Federal Reparations Act (Bundesentschädigungsgesetz, BEG) of 1956 clarified the ruling and backdated it to 23 May 1949, the commencement of the Bonn Constitution. Since legislation on reparations (For a general discussion see Goschler, 2005; Hockerts, 2001) had initially been dominated to a high degree by victims of National Socialist persecution, this inevitably changed the relationship between communist and non-communist NS victims. The trajectory of the ‘Victims of the Nazi Regime’ (Verfolgte des Nazi-Regimes, VVN) – initially a cross-party association – is an example for this sort of development. The ‘Königstein Circle’ (Königsteiner Kreis), a group of lawyers and civil servants who had fled the GDR, lobbied forcefully against the payment of reparations to former Nazi victims who were communists, and found ready agreement among members of the Bonn government, which eventually advocated access restrictions. The result was a ‘communist clause’ in West German legislation on reparations, for which there was no predecessor in the reparation legislation of the American-occupied zone of August 1949. It would have considerable repercussions for compensation practice from 1956 onwards. Disputed cases went to the federal courts, which had to define the difference ‘between mere membership and particular activities’ (Spernol, 2014 : p. 273) of the individuals concerned. In the early years such court rulings could vary widely. Not until 1961 did the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) provide clarification with its ruling that work for the KPD prior to 1956 – the year the party was banned – did not count as unconstitutional. Although we have no regional or national statistics, Boris Spernol has found a number of indicators that show that ‘a general problem in terms distribution justice [was] inherent’(Ibid.) in reparation procedures. Patterns of definite discrimination – i.e. the specific exclusion of communists – can be shown only to some extent. But this example illustrates how official and societal agents ‘reacted off each other in their excessive anticommunism’, (Ibid., p. 272) creating a bogeyman in order to exclude communists from reparation payments.|$|E
40|$|Given the {{importance}} of micro and small enterprises for {{the economy and the}} Brazilian society, the government issued a <b>supplementary</b> <b>law</b> 123 / 2009, known as Single National (SN). One of his goals is to relieve companies of State, Federal and Local government taxes, unifying the collection of eight charges in only one document collection, the other goal is to include businesses in the formal sector, since the law has facilitated the registration process of companies more agile and without bureaucracy. Analyzing the main state tax (ICMS), our research has centered on discussion of the effect of implementing the National Single on the amount of business in CearÃ, in relation to tax collection, and noted that the statewide impact of this new rule brought in regard to starting a business in the state of CearÃ. The result suggests that after the implementation of SN the number of registered companies has increased considerably compared to the number of companies registered before the implementation of SN. Moreover, the impact of the implementation of SN {{in the collection of the}} companies investigated is neutral, statistically, except only for those in the food sector, where the deployment of SN led to the increase in the collection of ICMS. Diante da importÃncia das Micro e Pequenas Empresas para a economia e para sociedade brasileira, o poder publico editou a Lei Complementar 123 / 2009, conhecida como Simples Nacional (SN). Um de seus objetivos Ã desonerar as empresas de Tributos Federais, Estaduais e Municipais, unificando o recolhimento de oito tributos em apenas um documento de arrecadaÃÃo, outro objetivo Ã incluir empresas na formalidade, uma vez que a Lei facilitou e tornou o processo de cadastramento de empresas mais Ãgil e sem burocracia.

O critério espacial enseja a análise das vicissitudes acerca da definição de zona urbana e rural e, portanto, das controvérsias entre IPTU e ITR, haja vista a incidência de ambos sobre a propriedade territorial. A determinação de zona urbana e rural cabe à norma geral, ao CTN já que foi recepcionado pela CF, como lei complementar, todavia, nada impede ao Município traçar algumas diretrizes neste sentido. Quanto à característica escolhida para definir se o imóvel tem natureza urbana ou rural, o CTN elegeu o critério da localização e o Decreto n. 57, o da destinação que segundo o STF é o aplicável em virtude de lei posterior. Ocorre que, o critério do CTN compatibiliza-se aos mandamentos constitucionais e prima pela autonomia do Município impedindo que o contribuinte escolha o imposto a ser pago a título de tributo. Based on {{a detailed}} study of the rule array of tax incidence {{it was possible to}} develop the one which refers to urban property tax for that considering the article 156, R of the Federal Constitution and articles 32 and 34 of the National Tax Code. In the antecedent of the rule is the tax hypothesis which is formed of criteria within which the criterion of incidence is the fact’s location. The fact’s location is the material criterion that can be the location in which takes place the property, the useful domain or the possession with a definitive intent. The spatial criterion gives rise to the analysis of events about the definition of urban and rural areas and therefore the controversies between urban property tax and rural property tax, considering the impact of both on land property.
