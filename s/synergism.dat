40|$|Environmental <b>synergisms</b> {{may pose}} the {{greatest}} threat to tropical biodiversity. Using recently updated data sets from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, we evaluated the incidence of perceived threats to all known mammal, bird, and amphibian species in tropical forests. Vulnerable, endangered, and extinct species were collectively far more likely to be imperiled by combinations of threats than expected by chance. Among 45 possible pairwise combinations of 10 different threats, 69 %, 93 %, and 71 % were significantly more frequent than expected for threatened mammals, birds, and amphibians, respectively, even with a stringent Bonferroni-corrected probability value (p = 0. 003). Based on this analysis, we identified five key environmental <b>synergisms</b> in the tropics and speculate on the existence of others. The most important involve interactions between habitat loss or alteration (from agriculture, urban sprawl, infrastructure, or logging) and other anthropogenic disturbances such as hunting, fire, exotic-species invasions, or pollution. Climatic change and emerging pathogens also can interact with other threats. We assert that environmental <b>synergisms</b> are more likely the norm than the exception for threatened species and ecosystems, can vary markedly in nature among geographic regions and taxa, and may be exceedingly difficult to predict in terms of their ultimate impacts. The perils posed by environmental <b>synergisms</b> highlight the need for a precautionary approach to tropical biodiversity conservation...|$|R

25|$|After the Reformation, Protestant groups {{continued}} to splinter, {{leading to a}} range of new theologies. The Enthusiasts were so named because of their emotional zeal. These included the Methodists, the Quakers, and the Baptists. Another group sought to reconcile Christian faith with modernist ideas, sometimes causing them to reject beliefs they considered to be illogical, including the Nicene creed and Chalcedonian Creed. These included Unitarians and Universalists. A major issue for Protestants became the degree to which people contribute to their salvation. The debate is often viewed as <b>synergism</b> versus monergism, though the labels Calvinist and Arminian are more frequently used, referring to the conclusion of the Synod of Dort.|$|E

[...] Novelist Arthur Koestler used the metaphor of Janus (a symbol of the unity underlying complements like open/shut, peace/war) to illustrate how the two perspectives (strong vs. weak or holistic vs. reductionistic) should be treated as non-exclusive, and should work together to address the issues of emergence.

2500|$|When {{activated}} macrophages {{start to}} secrete IL-1, which synergistically with CRH increases ACTH, T-cells also secrete glucosteroid response modifying factor (GRMF), {{as well as}} IL-1; both {{increase the amount of}} cortisol required to inhibit almost all the immune cells. [...] Immune cells then assume their own regulation, but at a higher cortisol setpoint. The increase in cortisol in diarrheic calves is minimal over healthy calves, however, and falls over time. The cells do not lose all their fight-or-flight override because of interleukin-1's <b>synergism</b> with CRH. Cortisol even has a negative feedback effect on interleukin-1—especially useful to treat diseases that force the hypothalamus to secrete too much CRH, such as those caused by endotoxic bacteria. The suppressor immune cells are not affected by GRMF, so the immune cells' effective setpoint may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes. GRMF [...] affects primarily the liver (rather than the kidneys) for some physiological processes.|$|E

40|$|Occurrence of {{resistance}} to anthelmintics and increased awareness about drug residues entering the food chain and harming the environment, {{have called for a}} reduction in the regular, preventive use of anthelmintics and an increase in the use of non-chemical means to control parasitic infections in small ruminants. In the present paper, we focus on the consequences of the nutritional interventions, in the form of nutritional supplementation and/or the consumption of bioactive plants, on host resistance to parasitism. We also consider possible <b>synergisms</b> between the various nutritional options for parasite control, as well as their interaction with other chemical and non-chemical control measures. The chemical control measures include the targeted, selective use of anthelmintics, which is achieved either by monitoring and treating individual animals, or by targeting specific nematode species and consequently minimising the use of anthelmintics. We believe that it is timely to look at these <b>synergisms,</b> as it becomes evident that future parasite control will be achieved with the combined use of more than one strategy. We elaborate on the feasibility of their combined, simultaneous or consecutive use and conclude with suggestions for future research directions to fully explore these <b>synergisms</b> and their potential use for helminth control in sheep production.

2500|$|Of Welsh descent, Owen {{was born}} at Stadhampton in Oxfordshire, and was educated at Queen's College, Oxford (B.A. 1632, M.A. 1635); {{at the time the}} college was noted, {{according}} to Thomas Fuller, for its metaphysicians. A Puritan by upbringing, in 1637 Owen was driven from Oxford by Laud's new statutes, and became chaplain and tutor in the family of Sir Robert Dormer and then in that of Lord Lovelace. At the outbreak of the English Civil War he sided with the parliament, and thus lost both his place and the prospects of succeeding to his Welsh Royalist uncle's fortune. For a while he lived in Charterhouse Yard, troubled by religious questions. [...] His doubts were removed by a sermon preached by a stranger in the church of St Mary Aldermanbury where he had gone intending to hear Edmund Calamy the Elder. His first publication, The Display of Arminianism (<b>synergism)</b> (1642), was a spirited defence of Calvinism (monergism). It was dedicated to the committee of religion, and gained him the living of Fordham in Essex, from which a [...] "scandalous minister" [...] had been ejected. At Fordham he remained engrossed in the work of his parish and writing only The Duty of Pastors and People Distinguished until 1646, when, the old incumbent dying, the presentation lapsed to the patron, who gave it to someone else.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSweet {{enhancing}} {{effect of}} neohesperidin dihydrochalcone (NHDC) or cyclamate {{has been reported}} to be synergistic in human sensory tests. However, little is known about whether these <b>synergisms</b> are caused by the mechanism mediated by the human sweet-taste receptor. Here, we examined the sweetness intensity of sweet tastant mixtures by measuring the responses of cultured cells stably expressing the human sweet-taste receptor. The results showed that the cell response to sucrose was synergistically potentiated by the addition of NHDC or cyclamate. Moreover, a point mutation in the transmembrane domain of hT 1 R 3 almost completely eliminated the enhancing effects of NHDC and cyclamate. These results suggest that ligand–receptor interactions in the transmembrane domain of hT 1 R 3 are necessary for NHDC and cyclamate to elicit the synergistic potentiation of the receptor activation. Our results may provide the foundation of a molecular basis for receptor-based <b>synergisms</b> of sweet tastes in mixtures of diverse sweet substances...|$|R
40|$|<b>Synergisms</b> between {{pharmacological}} agents and endogenous neurotransmitters are familiar and frequent. The present review describes the experimental evidence for interactions between neuropharmacological compounds and the classes of weak magnetic fields {{that might be}} encountered in our daily environments. Whereas drugs mediate their effects through specific spatial (molecular) structures, magnetic fields mediate their effects through specific temporal patterns. Very weak (microT range) physiologically-patterned magnetic fields synergistically interact with drugs to strongly potentiate effects that have classically involved opiate, cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and nitric oxide pathways. The combinations of the appropriately patterned magnetic fields and specific drugs can evoke changes that are several times larger than those evoked by the drugs alone. These novel <b>synergisms</b> provide a challenge for a future within an electromagnetic, technological world. They may also reveal fundamental, common physical mechanisms by which magnetic fields and chemical reactions affect the organism from the level of fundamental particles to the entire living system...|$|R

40|$|Global stressors, {{including}} climate change, are a {{major threat}} to ecosystems, but they cannot be halted by local actions. Ecosystem management is thus attempting to compensate for the impacts of global stressors by reducing local stressors, such as overfishing. This approach assumes that stressors interact additively or synergistically, whereby the combined effect of two stressors is at least the sum of their isolated effects. It is not clear, however, how management should proceed for antagonistic interactions among stressors, where multiple stressors do not have an additive or greater impact. Research to date has focussed on identifying <b>synergisms</b> among stressors, but antagonisms may be just as common. We examined the effectiveness of management when faced with different types of interactions in two systems – seagrass and fish communities – where the global stressor was climate change but the local stressors were different. When there were <b>synergisms,</b> mitigating local stressors delivered greater gains, whereas when there were antagonisms, management of local stressors was ineffective or even degraded ecosystems. These results suggest that reducing a local stressor can compensate for climate change impacts if there is a synergistic interaction. Conversely, if there is an antagonistic interaction, management of local stressors will have the greatest benefits in areas of refuge from climate change. A balanced researc...|$|R
