50|$|<b>Sameridine</b> is a 4-phenylpiperidine {{derivative}} that {{is related}} to the opioid analgesic drug pethidine (meperidine).|$|E
50|$|<b>Sameridine</b> has {{an unusual}} {{pharmacological}} profile, being both a local anaesthetic and a μ-opioid partial agonist. It is currently under development {{for use in}} surgical anasthesia, mainly administered by intrathecal infusion. It produces less respiratory depression than morphine, even at a high dose, and produces no respiratory depression at a low dose.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sameridine</b> is not {{currently}} a controlled drug, although if approved {{for medical use}} it will certainly be a prescription medicine, and {{it would probably be}} assigned to one of the controlled drug schedules in more restrictive jurisdictions such as Australia and the United States, especially if it were found to be addictive in animals.|$|E
40|$|A most {{important}} challenge even in modern medicine is effective treatment of pain. Respiratory depression {{is the most}} feared side effect of analgesic treatment in the clinical situation. The serious effect of opioid induced respiratory depression and our incomplete understanding of this phenomenon are reasons why clinicians continue to hesitate to prescribe opioid analgesics. It {{is well known that}} opioids depress minute ventilation, tidalvolume and respiratory rate and that the responsiveness to hypercarbia is diminished. The search for analgesics without serious side effects is an important target. In line with this, new molecules have been developed, including <b>sameridine,</b> a partial µ-opioid receptor agonist with local anesthetic properties, and frakefamide, a peripherally active µ-opioid receptor agonist. The general aim of these studies was to extensively examine if these drugs depress ventilation. In study I, we investigated the effects on resting ventilation of two doses of <b>sameridine</b> 0. 15 mg/kg (S-Small) and 0. 73 mg/kg (S-Large) in comparison with 0. 10 mg/kg of morphine. Plasma was collected and analysed for <b>sameridine</b> and morphine. In study II, two doses of <b>sameridine</b> 0. 15 mg/kg (S-Small) and 0. 73 mg/kg (S-Large) were compared to 0. 10 mg/kg of morphine and placebo was investigated after hypercarbic challenge. In study III, intrathecal <b>sameridine</b> and bupivacaine were compared at resting ventilation and at ventilatory challenges during hypercarbia and hypoxia. In studies IV and V frakefamide was investigated during resting ventilation (study IV) and after hypercarbic and hypoxic ventilatory challenges (study V) at steady state. The effect was compared with two clinical doses of morphine (M-low and M-high) and placebo. The subjects received in total 1. 22 mg/kg FF, 0. 44 mg/kg M-high and 0. 11 mg/kg M-low. Sodium chloride 9 mg/ml was used as placebo. Blood was collected and plasma concentration analysed for frakefamide, morphine and its metabolites. All studies were performed in healthy volunteers breathing air through a transparent facemask. Minute ventilation (VE) and respiratory rate (RR) were measured by integration of the flow signal from a pneumotachograph. Flow (V), tidal volume (VT), and in-line end-tidal C 02 (ETC 02) were recorded on an ink-jet recorder and stored in a computer. Inspired and expired concentrations Of 02 were continuously recorded. The {{most important}} findings in this series were that the combined molecule with both local anesthetic and partial µ-opioid receptor agonist effects caused a depression of respiratory motor function while respiratory rate was unchanged. Intrathecal <b>sameridine</b> reduced the tidal volume response to C 02 stimulation of breathing, wheras intrathecal bupivacaine allowed tidal volumes to increase during hypercarbia. Clinical doses of <b>sameridine</b> did not impair resting ventilation. It was demonstrated that drug design of opioid agonists with peripheral action is feasible and that frakefamide do not interfere with regulation of breathing...|$|E
40|$|Research {{into local}} {{anaesthetic}} mechanisms {{over the past}} few years has focused on two main issues. First, attention has focused on development of compounds with fewer side effects, better sensory/motor separation and longer duration of action; this has resulted in the introduction of ropivacaine and levobupivacaine into clinical practice. These agents have a lesser cardiotoxic effect than older compounds, and ropivacaine may in addition offer better sensory/motor separation. Several other compounds, including tonicaine and <b>sameridine,</b> are under investigation. In addition, the local anaesthetic properties of amitryptiline are being studied, and liposome encapsulation of local anaesthetics appears able to confer new pharmacokinetic properties on common drugs. Second, the molecular basis for several local anaesthetic actions that are not mediated by sodium channels has become a topic of interest. The mechanisms that underlie anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic actions are at present being unravelled. How local anaesthetics potentiate antitumour agents, protect neuronal tissue and prevent bronchial reactivity is less clear, but the potential clinical benefits of these effects deserve further exploratio...|$|E
