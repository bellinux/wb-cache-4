500|$|As {{the player}} {{representative}} for the Washington Capitals during the 2012 NHL-NHLPA CBA negotiations, Laich stated {{in support of the}} National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) that, [...] "At <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> have to dig your heels in and fight. If we don’t this time, then what happens next? Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive, and the players really understand that.

500|$|Despite Kariya's {{success with}} Canada at the 2002 Olympics, {{he had come}} off the worst {{statistical}} season of his career prior to the national team's summer development camp {{in preparation for the}} 2006 Winter Olympics. His omission was singled out by the media; General Manager Wayne Gretzky, who selected the camp's participants, explained publicly, [...] "Paul is a great player, but at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> have to have a cutoff," [...] while also asserting that he had spoken to Kariya personally regarding the situation. After a strong start to the 2005–06 NHL season, Kariya was one of 49 forwards chosen in October 2005 to Canada's preliminary list of players to be selected from for the final roster. When the team was announced in December 2005, however, he was not chosen.|$|E

Bale {{said he was}} confident in his choice to return in the role because of the positive response to his portrayal in Batman Begins. He continued training in the Keysi Fighting Method and performed many of his own stunts, but did not gain as much muscle {{as in the previous}} film because the new Batsuit allowed him to move with greater agility. Bale described Batman's dilemma as whether [...] " [...] something that has an end. Can he quit and have an ordinary life? The kind of manic intensity someone has to have to maintain the passion and the anger that they felt as a child, takes an effort after a while, to keep doing that. At <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>you</b> have to exorcise your demons." [...] He added, [...] "Now you have not just a young man in pain attempting to find some kind of an answer, you have somebody who actually has power, who is burdened by that power, and is having to recognize the difference between attaining that power and holding on to it." [...] Bale felt Batman's personality had been strongly established in the first film, so it was unlikely his character would be overshadowed by the villains, stating: [...] "I have no problem with competing with someone else. And that's going to make a better movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|Production on {{the album}} was difficult. A.C. Newman stated, [...] "I {{remember}} 'Letter From an Occupant' was a pretty belabored song. It ended up being almost minimal, but I remember there's so much shit we put on it. There's a psychedelic 12-string guitar solo, a backwards guitar, there's a kind of really cool synth that's in there but buried. At <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>you</b> have to choose. That was the hardest part about mixing the thing: just making that judgment call. I only feel at peace with the record now because people seem to like it." ...|$|E

From this, Mr. Jacobovici deduced that they were a couple, because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb. In an interview, Mr. Jacobovici was asked why the filmmakers did not conduct DNA testing on the other ossuaries to determine whether the one inscribed Judah, son of Jesus was genetically related to either the Jesus or Mary Magdalene boxes; or whether the Jesus remains were actually the offspring of Mary. [...] "We're not scientists. At {{the end of the day}} we can't wait till every ossuary is tested for DNA," [...] he said. [...] "We took the story that far.

Lisa states [...] "Yeah, there's a sexual {{undertone}} to that song, {{but when we}} were writing it we were thinking about having fun, going to a club, being on the dancefloor. You can interpret it how you like." [...] Jessica stated: It {{would have been so}} easy to have made a record just like the first, with unison voices on the verse and chorus. It worked for us on the first record; it became a trademark sound. Not degrading it, we loved it, but at <b>some</b> <b>point</b> <b>you</b> have to grow as an artist or you get stuck. According to Lisa: We made that record [...] two years ago. It would be so dated to do it again. I feel we're staying current but staying ourselves. It was a natural progression. We wanted a challenge, to take it somewhere new. People had become used to our sound. Other artists released that sound using songs we'd written. We get asked, [...] "Did you get pushed into this sound?" [...] We were doing the pushing! ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} verses {{are commonly}} referred to as the V'ahavta according to the first word of the verse immediately following the Shema, or in Classical Hebrew V'ahav'ta meaning [...] "and you shall love...".

But at <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>you</b> realise it takes more energy to shut it out than it does to let it happen and be a part of 'it'." [...] At one point, the song begins to skip, reminiscent of a skipping compact disc. Parker included this as an extension of his fascination with glitches in playback. [...] "Nangs" [...] has been noted for its interlude-like composition and its woozy, psychedelic sound. [...] "Yes I'm Changing" [...] is a song Parker claims he does not remember making: [...] "A weird experience, because it was like it was someone else made the song. I had no memory of imagining it." [...] "Eventually" [...] concerns [...] "knowing that you're about to damage someone almost irreparably, and the only consolation you get is this distant hope that they’ll be alright eventually, because you know they aren't going to be now or soon." [...] Parker conceded that he [...] "can't really deny" [...] it is a breakup song.|$|E

Reid {{added in}} 2013, [...] "Imagine, if you will, {{a world in}} which the Beatles were known only for their early hits whilst The White Album or Abbey Road were of interest, or even known, only to the group’s biggest fans, and you will have some grasp of how the Beach Boys’ {{distorted}} public image has helped to bury their most important artistic works." [...] In 1967, Lou Reed famously wrote, [...] "Will none of the powers that be realize what Brian Wilson did with the chords?" [...] Pitchfork Media posited, [...] "At <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>you</b> learn that the Beach Boys weren't just a fun 1960s surf band with a run of singles that later came to be used in commercials; at their best, they were making capital-A Art. … Once you've absorbed [...] , you find yourself going back through songs like [...] "Don't Worry Baby", [...] "The Warmth of the Sun", and [...] "I Get Around", finding a deeper brilliance where you once heard only pop craftsmanship." [...] Discussing the 2011 release of The Smile Sessions, The Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "certainly every library of American recording history needs this; university composition departments, music professors, budding recording engineers and composers should study it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong has {{identified}} himself as bisexual, saying in a 1995 interview with The Advocate, [...] "I think I've always been bisexual. I mean, it's something that I've always been interested in. I think people are born bisexual, and it's just that our parents and society kind of veer us off into this feeling of 'Oh, I can't.' They say it's taboo. It's ingrained in our heads that it's bad, when it's not bad at all. It's a very beautiful thing." [...] In a later interview for Out magazine's April 2010 issue, Armstrong stated: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people who didn't accept it, who were homophobic." [...] Armstrong continued, saying, [...] "The fact that it's an issue is kind of phobic within itself. At <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> <b>you</b> gotta think, this should be something that's just accepted." [...] Armstrong added: [...] "I don't really classify myself as anything. And when it comes to sex, there are parts of me that are very shy and conservative." [...] In February 2014, Armstrong again discussed his bisexuality in a Rolling Stone article about Dookie, a record which Armstrong described as [...] "touch on bisexuality a lot." [...] Armstrong discussed the song [...] "Coming Clean" [...] stating, [...] "It was a song about questioning myself. There are these other feelings you may have about the same sex, the opposite sex, especially being in Berkeley and San Francisco then. People are acting out what they're feeling: gay, bisexual, transgender, whatever. And that opens up something in society that becomes more acceptable. Now we have gay marriage becoming recognized... I think it's a process of discovery. I was willing to try anything." ...|$|E

Hosny also stated that he tried to underemphasize Waylon Smithers's homosexual attraction for Mr. Burns.
