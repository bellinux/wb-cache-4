40|$|Sprinkler {{irrigation}} {{has been}} an important part of Utah’s agricultural production since the early 1950 s. About 40 % of Utah’s 1. 3 million irrigated acres are watered with sprinklers, including hand move, wheel move, center pivot and other types. In Sanpete County, the percent of sprinkler irrigated cropland is higher than the state average at about 45 %. Of the 94, 000 acres of irrigated cropland in the county, approximately 42, 000 acres are irrigated by sprinklers. Sprinklers can be a good investment when properly designed, installed, maintained and managed. For every acre-foot of water supplied to an efficient sprinkler system a farmer can expect to harvest about 1 3 / 4 tons of alfalfa and 46 bushels of wheat. In contrast, the expected harvest with a typical <b>surface</b> <b>irrigation</b> system (<b>flood</b> or <b>furrow)</b> is less than 1 1 / 4 tons of alfalfa or about 30 bushels of wheat for each acre-foot of water applied.

In Utah a typical sprinkler system has an Ea of 70 % which means that 70 % of the water applied by the sprinkler heads is actually stored in the soil for crop use. The actual Ea depends upon how evenly the sprinklers distribute water and other factors such as operating pressure, nozzle size and spacing, wind, air temperature and humidity (day versus night), irrigation scheduling and maintenance condition. The average efficiency of <b>surface</b> <b>irrigation</b> in Utah is about 50 % as compared to the higher sprinkler efficiency of 70 %.

25|$|Sprinkler {{irrigation}} {{involves the}} installation {{of a series of}} sprinkler units throughout the vineyard, often spaced as several rows about 65 feet (20m) apart. The sprinklers can be set on an electronic timer and release predetermined amount of water for a set period of time. While this provides more control and uses less water than <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation,</b> like <b>furrow</b> irrigation the amount that each individual wine receives can be sporadic. The irrigation system that provides the most control over water management, though conversely the most expensive to install, is drip irrigation. This system involved long plastic water supply lines that run down each row of vines in the vineyard with each individual grape vine having its own individual dripper. With this system, a viticulturist can control the precise amount of water that each grapevine gets down to the drop. An adaption of this system, potentially useful in areas where irrigation may be banned, is underground subirrigation where precise measurements of water is delivered directly to the root system.|$|R

40|$|Irrigation is the {{application}} of water to soil {{for the purpose of}} supplying moisture necessary for the growth of a crop. Irrigation has been practiced since the beginning of civilization and its importance in the present world is well recognized as a means of developing a profitable agriculture. The rapid growth in the world population and the consequent need for additional food supplies are making irrigation absolutely necessary in the world today. In <b>surface</b> <b>irrigation</b> by <b>flooding,</b> two general methods are used; uncontrolled flooding or controlled flooding. In irrigating by uncontrolled flooding, or wild flooding, water is applied to an area which has undergone no prior land preparation. In most cases, this unsystematic method produces inefficient irrigation. Low spots in the field are over-irrigated whereas high areas are under-irrigated. In the controlled flooding method, predetermined rates and quantities of water are applied to areas which have been prepared for irrigation. This method of irrigation includes border dyke, border ditch, and border check systems. For proper design of these systems, the size of stream is balanced against the intake rate of the soil, the total depth of water to be stored in the root zone, and the area to be covered by the stream. With the completion of the South Saskatchewan Dam, it is expected that the irrigated acreage of the province will increase substantially. Further, it is expected that most of the new area coming under irrigation will be irrigated by some <b>surface</b> <b>irrigation</b> method. One of the most common and diversified of the <b>surface</b> <b>irrigation</b> methods, which is adaptable to both close growing and row crops, is the border dyke or border strip method. In this method, water is introduced to land which is bounded by low, flat levees or dykes which extend {{in the direction of the}} steepest slope. The present procedures used in design of border dyke systems 2. are empirical. The experimental data reported in the literature were obtained from systems whose soils, topography and other conditions differ widely from those which will be encountered in the South Saskatchewan River Development Project. Thus, it is questionable whether these data can be applied directly to the design of systems in Saskatchewan. There is a great need for experimental data from systems installed on areas which are similar to those that will be encountered under the proposed project. The study reported in this thesis was undertaken in an attempt to satisfy some of these needs. Experimental data collected from existing border dyke systems located in Saskatchewan are presented. In addition, a rational approach for evaluating several factors affecting the design of these systems for example, soil intake rate, is given...|$|R

40|$|Slumping of hardsetting seedbeds upon wetting {{is likely}} to {{determine}} the shrinking and development of strength on drying. Different processes have been invoked, including aggregate disruption, material relocation, and compaction. To {{gain a better understanding}} of the role played by compaction compared with aggregate disruption in seedbed slumping and shrinking, mechanical analysis was combined with previous morphogenetical description. The global structural behavior of repacked seedbeds of a hardsetting sandy loam soil was studied after wetting and again after subsequent drying. Bulk density was measured in 5 -mm-depth increments using gamma attenuation, and water content was determined at 10 -mm-depth increments. Various wetting conditions were used to simulate a range of climatic and management conditions, including <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation,</b> <b>furrow</b> irrigation of a formed seedbed, drip irrigation, and rainfall. Aggregate coalescence under overburden pressure played the main role in slumping, even though microcracking enhanced coalescence. Most of the slumping occurred at calculated effective stress > 1. 1 kPa. Intense aggregate breakdown at the top of seedbeds under fast wetting led to slight slumping because the resulting clogging of the initial interaggregate packing voids was balanced, in part, by the increase in microporosity resulting from aggregate disruption. However, aggregate coalescence induced by overburden pressure developing at the seedbed bottom often resulted in a strong decrease in total porosity. The effect of rainfall kinetic energy on crust bulk density was strong compared with the effect of fast wetting (bulk density increase of about 0. 07 Mg m(- 3) and 0. 03 Mg m(- 3), respectively) and could be ascribed to compaction rather than to aggregate breakdown. Shrinking on drying was related to the continuity of the microstructure resulting from wetting rather than to the intensity of slumping.

A total of nine farmers who were practicing <b>surface</b> <b>irrigation</b> were chosen {{to participate in the}} study. The vegetable English giant rape (Brassica napus) was grown under the two irrigation systems with three fertilizer treatments in each system: ordinary granular fertilizer, liquid fertilizer (fertigation) and the last treatment with no fertilizer. These trials were replicated three times in a randomized block design. Biometric parameters of leaf area index (LAI) and fresh weight of the produce, water use efficiency (WUE) were used to compare the performance of the two irrigation systems. A water balance of the inflows and outflows was kept for analysis of WUE. The economic profitability and the operation, maintenance and management requirements of the different systems were also evaluated. There {{was no significant difference in}} vegetable yield between the irrigation systems at 8. 5 ton/ha for drip compared to 7. 8 ton/ha in <b>surface</b> <b>irrigation.</b> There were significant increases in yields due to use of fertilizers. Drip irrigation used about 35 % of the water used by the <b>surface</b> <b>irrigation</b> systems thus giving much higher water use efficiencies. The leaf area indices were comparable in both systems with the same fertilizer treatment ranging between 0. 05 for surface without fertilizer to 6. 8 for low cost drip with fertigation.
