5|$|After the {{announcement}} of the device, a lack of supply was evident. This was due to a shortage of components such as the screen.

As a result, the number of pre-orders rose due to the uncertainty of <b>stock</b> <b>at</b> retail stores, and the delivery dates for pre-orders were postponed to dates that were after the initial release date of the device.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his <b>stock</b> <b>at</b> a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E

5|$|No-one had {{questioned}} Calvert's conformity at the time, {{and if he}} {{had been}} secretly Catholic, he had hidden it well. It seems more likely Calvert converted in late 1624. At the time, Simon Stock, a Discalced Carmelite priest reported to the Congregation Propaganda Fide in Rome on 15 November that he had converted two Privy Councillors to Catholicism, one of whom historians are certain was Calvert. Calvert, who had probably met <b>Stock</b> <b>at</b> the Spanish embassy in London, later worked with the priest on a plan for a Catholic mission in his new first Newfoundland Colony (off modern Canada).|$|E

5|$|Rockefeller {{and his son}} {{continued}} to consolidate their oil interests {{as best they could}} until New Jersey, in 1909, changed its incorporation laws to effectively allow a re-creation of the trust {{in the form of a}} single holding company. Rockefeller retained his nominal title as president until 1911 and he kept his <b>stock.</b> <b>At</b> last in 1911, the Supreme Court of the United States found Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. By then the trust still had a 70% market share of the refined oil market but only 14% of the U.S. crude oil supply. The court ruled that the trust originated in illegal monopoly practices and ordered it to be broken up into 34 new companies. These included, among many others, Continental Oil, which became Conoco, now part of ConocoPhillips; Standard of Indiana, which became Amoco, now part of BP; Standard of California, which became Chevron; Standard of New Jersey, which became Esso (and later, Exxon), now part of ExxonMobil; Standard of New York, which became Mobil, now part of ExxonMobil; and Standard of Ohio, which became Sohio, now part of BP. Pennzoil and Chevron have remained separate companies.|$|E
5|$|The Crédit Mobilier of America scandal {{involved}} {{corruption in}} the financing of the Union Pacific Railroad, part of the transcontinental railroad that was completed in 1869. Union Pacific officers and directors secretly purchased control of the Crédit Mobilier of America company, then contracted with the firm to have it undertake {{the construction of the}} railroad. The grossly inflated invoices submitted by the company were paid by the railroad, using federal funds appropriated to subsidize the project, and the company was allowed to purchase Union Pacific securities at par value, well below the market rate. Crédit Mobilier showed large profits and stock gains, and distributed substantial dividends. The high expenses meant that Congress was called upon to appropriate more funds. One of the railroad officials who controlled Crédit Mobilier was also a congressman, Oakes Ames of Massachusetts. He offered some of his colleagues the opportunity to buy Crédit Mobilier <b>stock</b> <b>at</b> par value, well below what it sold for on the market, and the railroad got its additional appropriations.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Civil War and World War II {{also had}} a devastating impact on horse {{breeding}} throughout Europe. The Veragua stud was destroyed, and its records lost, with the only survivors being the broodmares and the younger horses, who were rescued by Francisco Franco. Crabbet Park, Tersk, and Janów Podlaski survived. Both the Soviet Union and the United States obtained valuable Arabian bloodlines as spoils of war, which they used to strengthen their breeding programs. The Soviets had taken steps to protect their breeding <b>stock</b> <b>at</b> Tersk Stud, and by utilizing horses captured in Poland {{they were able to}} re-establish their breeding program soon after the end of World War II. The Americans brought Arabian horses captured in Europe to the United States, mostly to the Pomona U.S. Army Remount station, the former W.K. Kellogg Ranch in California.|$|E

40|$|Feeding, {{growth and}} {{survival}} of hatchery-bred juvenile abalone, Haliotis asinina (mean initial shell lengths: 32 mm) <b>stocked</b> <b>at</b> 25, 50 and 100 m - 2 of shelter surface area in mesh cages suspended in indoor tanks were determined. Animals were fed the seaweed, Gracilariopsis bailinae, to excess given at weekly intervals. After 250 d, avereage daily growth rate (mean: 122 Âµm d - 1 shell length, 156 mg d - 1 body weight) was highest in abalone reared <b>at</b> the lowest <b>stocking</b> density (25 m - 2). Abalone <b>stocked</b> <b>at</b> 50 and 100 m - 2 had similar growth rates that ranged from 96 to 98 Âµm d - 1 SL and 123 to 131 mg d - 1 BW). Daily feeding rates of 29 and 30 % {{were not significantly different}} for abalone <b>stocked</b> <b>at</b> 25 and 50 m - 2, respectively, but were higher than abalone <b>stocked</b> <b>at</b> 100 m - 2. The higher feeding rates of 24 - 28 % day - 1 of abalone in all treatments starting day- 129 until day- 160 could be due to the onset of sexual maturation as most abalone are already mature at this size. Survival rates were generally high (91 - 98 %) and were not significantly different among treatments. However, body size (range: 59. 3 mm SL, 57 - 58. 4 g BW) at harvest was bigger in animal <b>stocked</b> <b>at</b> 25 m - 2 than those <b>stocked</b> <b>at</b> 100 m - 2. Sexual maturation during culture did not hamper growth of abalone. G. bailinae proved to be a sufficient food source for abalone grow-out. A stocking density between 50 - 100 m - 2 is recommended for tank grow-out of H. asinina...|$|R

5|$|The {{price of}} the {{imported}} ice varied according {{to the amount of}} economic competition; in Havana, Tudor's ice sold for 25 cents ($3.70 in 2010 terms) per pound, while in Georgia it reached only six to eight cents ($0.90–$1.20 in 2010 terms). Where Tudor had a strong market share, he would respond to competition from passing traders by lowering his prices considerably, selling his ice at the unprofitable rate of one cent ($0.20) per pound (0.5kg); at this price, competitors would typically be unable to sell their own <b>stock</b> <b>at</b> a profit: they would either be driven into debt or if they declined to sell, their ice would melt away in the heat. Tudor, relying on his local storage depots, could then increase his prices once again. By the middle of the 1820s, around 3,000 tons (3 million kg) of ice was being shipped from Boston annually, two thirds by Tudor.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{used the}} {{opportunity}} of travelling around England to pursue his business interests, cutting many deals. When he was rested from the first match against Yorkshire, {{he stayed in the}} capital and made deals at the London Exhibition. During breaks in play, or when Australia was batting and he had already been dismissed, he often spent the time inspecting local factories and talking to other businesspeople. An important concern for Barnes, when returning to Australia by boat after the tour, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included fine English cloth, which was in very short supply in Australia. Hearing a rumour that customs officers were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his <b>stock</b> <b>at</b> a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee. Upon returning to Australia, Barnes opted out of first-class cricket to focus on business interests. He wrote a newspaper column, in which he often criticised cricket administrators and the small share of revenue they gave to players. Barnes wrote in a confrontational manner, often lampooning and angering the authorities.|$|E
5|$|When {{delivery}} of C67 stock began in 1977, {{two pairs of}} CO/CP stock motor cars were used as pilot motor cars to shunt the new <b>stock</b> <b>at</b> Ruislip Depot, and to marshall the scrap stock displaced by the new units. The C77 stock could be driven under its own power to Hammersmith Depot, as it was commissioned at Ruislip. The D78 stock was different, in that delivery was still to Ruislip, but the commissioning took place at Ealing Common Depot, and therefore pilot motor cars were needed to transfer the stock. Two pairs of CO/CP stock motor cars were allocated {{to do this in}} 1979, with a further three pairs joining them in 1980. New trains were transferred with a pilot motor car at each end, as were trains that were withdrawn for scrapping. The pilot motor cars carried large stencils at both ends, so that they would not accidentally be scrapped until their duties were complete. Three pairs of R stock motor cars were used as pilot motor cars after the R stock was scrapped. Most of the surface stock pilot motor cars were scrapped when the deliveries were complete, although one each of the CO/CP and R stock cars have been privately preserved.|$|E
