5|$|The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain is sited on the {{southern}} shore of the <b>Serpentine</b> near West Carriage Drive. Although it was beset by early problems {{and had to be}} closed for a month three weeks after it opened, it {{has become one of the}} UK's most popular attractions, with 800,000 visitors a year. The <b>Serpentine</b> Gallery nearby is also on the south bank and the <b>Serpentine</b> Sackler Gallery opened in 2013 is located in a former 1805 gunpowder store, five minutes walk from the <b>Serpentine</b> Gallery across the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The eastern <b>serpentine</b> {{outcrops}} where A.viridimontanum thrives {{have relatively}} few endemics, compared to <b>serpentine</b> exposures globally. A.viridimontanum {{is one of}} only five taxa (four species and a variety) that are strictly endemic to <b>serpentine</b> in eastern North America, and two of these, A.aleuticum and Aspidotis densa, grow on non-serpentine substrates elsewhere in North America.|$|E

5|$|From 1983 to 1985, Cathy A. Paris, then a {{graduate}} student, gathered specimens of A.pedatum from non-serpentine soils in the Midwest and Vermont, and from <b>serpentine</b> soils in New England and Canada, for biosystematic analysis. In 1988, Paris and Michael D. Windham published {{the results of}} this analysis, revealing A.pedatum in North America to be a cryptic species complex. They showed that A.pedatum sensu lato included two well-distinguished diploid taxa, one found in the Eastern woodlands, and the other found both in the Western mountains and as a disjunct on <b>serpentine</b> in the East. However, not all of the <b>serpentine</b> disjuncts proved to belong to the Western taxon. Several of them, including most of the specimens in Vermont, were found to be tetraploid, forming a taxon distinguishable from the two diploids. Isozyme banding patterns suggested that the tetraploid had arisen by hybridization between the eastern subspecies of non-serpentine woodlands and the western and <b>serpentine</b> taxon, followed by a duplication of the hybrid genome through polyploidy (allowing the chromosomes to pair and restoring sexual fertility). This allotetraploid was also morphologically intermediate between the two taxa, although it more closely resembled the <b>serpentine</b> taxon (hence its referral to var.aleuticum before Paris's work). Paris formally described the tetraploid as a new species, A.viridimontanum, in 1991, and also separated the western and <b>serpentine</b> taxon from A.pedatum as the species A.aleuticum. The type specimen of A.viridimontanum was collected from a talus slope at the old asbestos mine on Belvidere Mountain on August 28, 1985. The sequencing of several chloroplast DNA loci has revealed that the A.viridimontanum chloroplast genome most closely resembles that of A.aleuticum, suggesting that A.aleuticum was the maternal parent of A.viridimontanum.|$|E
5|$|In the 1820s, {{the park}} was {{extensively}} redesigned by Decimus Burton. At the same time, John Rennie built the <b>Serpentine</b> Bridge to carry the newly built West Carriage Drive along the boundary between Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, dividing the lake into the <b>Serpentine</b> (east) and the Long Water (west).|$|E
5|$|Since 1864, the <b>Serpentine</b> {{has hosted}} a 100-yard (91.4m) {{swimming}} competition every Christmas morning at 9am. In 1904, author J. M. Barrie awarded the Peter Pan Cup {{to the winner}} of the race, a tradition which has continued ever since. Owing to the hazards of swimming in freezing water, the race is open only to members of the <b>Serpentine</b> Swimming Club.|$|E

5|$|Conservation of A.viridimontanum is {{primarily}} limited by its restricted habitat on <b>serpentine</b> cliffs and talus slopes. However, these sites are also of little value to humans. The most likely {{threat to the}} species is expansion of asbestos mining, which often occurs near populations of the fern, or other reuse of abandoned asbestos mines. Road construction might also threaten some sites, although this is mitigated by the fern's ability to flourish on disturbed <b>serpentine.</b> None of the sites are as yet known to be invaded by non-native plants. The species is considered more difficult to cultivate than either of its parent species.|$|E

Hyde Park covers 142 hectares (350 acres), and Kensington Gardens covers 111 hectares (275 acres), giving a total area of 253 hectares (625 acres). During daylight, the two parks merge seamlessly into each other, but Kensington Gardens closes at dusk, and Hyde Park remains open throughout the year from 5 a.m. until midnight.|$|E
