25|$|The present Mrs Bland is {{the second}} Mrs Bland. Mr Bland <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> was the sole living {{relative}} for her family inheritance but she cannot both be sole heir and have a sister. Mr Bland's first wife died in the Second World War; he remarried soon after, to another Canadian woman. The family of his first wife had cut off communication with their daughter so thoroughly {{they did not know}} she had died. Sixteen years later, the first wife was announced to be the heiress to an overseas fortune as the last-known living relative. When this news reached the Blands, they decided the second Mrs Bland must pose as the first Mrs Bland. They fool a British firm of solicitors that sought the heir. When Quentin Duguesclin, who knew the first wife and her family, looked her up in England, a plan was laid to murder him. The plan was simple, with additions like the clocks taken from an unpublished mystery story that Miss Martindale had read in manuscript.|$|E

500|$|On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons {{appeared}} {{naked in}} his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old into his bedroom along with Clemmons' wife. Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family {{back into the living room}} and demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world was coming to an end and that he was [...] "going to fly to heaven". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. Child Protective Services investigated and substantiated the sexual abuse complaint. Latanya Clemmons, Clemmons's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was [...] "not in his right mind".|$|E

500|$|Elliott {{was known}} as [...] "a coach's AD." [...] "He hired coaches he trusted, then gave them the resources, {{latitude}} and support they needed to operate as they saw fit – providing they played by the rules." [...] Iowa wrestling coach Dan Gable <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> cried on learning that Elliott had retired. [...] In 1999, Gable wrote: [...] "Right after I came to coach at the University of Iowa, I {{had a meeting with}} Bump Elliott, who was the Athletic Director. I’ll never forget what Bump said to me: ‘Don’t ask for the moon. Strive to get there, sure, but do it wisely through continuing to build upon what you already have. As you build, come see me, and we’ll see how I can help you out.’ I now call that bit of wisdom the Bump Elliott Rule, and it serves a good reminder to keep things in perspective. Gradual, solid growth is better than any quick fix.""The one thing we emphasized from the start was that our staff had to make sure we were 100 percent loyal to each other and the university," [...] Elliott said {{at the time of his}} retirement. [...] "There could be no jealousy between the coaches and various programs. [...] I wanted no one talking behind anyone's backs. [...] I wanted absolute loyalty. [...] If not, then that person could leave any time." ...|$|E

He later <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> had [...] "vetoed" [...] this plan. Then Corsi stated: [...] "Howard Phillips of the Constitution Party asked me to {{consider}} seriously running for president in 2008 and I am doing so." [...] He then agreed to be nominated at the Constitution Party National Convention, but he dropped out in July 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Both in {{his works}} and direct overtures to the press, Friedrich Christian gave {{detailed}} accounts {{of his time}} in the Nazi party. In 1963 for instance, he claimed that Hitler refused to shave his famous mustache because people would think he was [...] "sick". He <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Alexandra commented to Hitler that [...] "his haircut and little mustache were always openings for cartoonists", but that Hitler replied [...] "one shouldn't change a company's trademark, even if one doesn't like it any longer. The public has become so used to it over the years that it would rebel if he suddenly looked completely different." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ship was}} named after Queen Mary, consort of King George V. Until her launch, the name {{she was to be}} given was kept a closely guarded secret. Legend has it that Cunard {{intended}} to name the ship Victoria, in keeping with company tradition of giving its ships names ending in [...] "ia", but when company representatives asked the king's permission to name the ocean liner after Britain's [...] "greatest queen", he <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Queen Mary, would be delighted. And so, the legend goes, the delegation had of course no other choice but to report that No. 534 would be called Queen Mary.|$|E
2500|$|Citizen Kane was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award in every possible category, including Best Original Screenplay. Meryman writes, [...] "Herman insisted he had no chance to win, though The Hollywood Reporter had given the film first place in ten of its twelve divisions. The fear of Hearst, he felt, was still alive. And Hollywood's resentment and distrust of Welles, the nonconformist upstart, were even greater since he had lived up to his wonderboy ballyhoo." [...] Neither Welles nor Mankiewicz attended the dinner, which was broadcast on radio. Welles was in South America filming It's All True, and Herman refused to attend. [...] "He {{did not want to}} be humiliated," [...] <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Sara.|$|E

2500|$|When {{war crime}} {{prosecutors}} later sought Avey's testimony for the Nuremberg Trials, {{they were unable}} to locate him. He kept the traumatic events about his wartime past a complete secret from everyone, including his first and second wives, along with his daughter. [...] "I knew there was something," [...] <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Audrey. [...] "Naturally, you ask questions. But I never got an answer." [...] Avey explains: [...] "The sad irony was that I went in there to find out the truth, so I could tell everybody about the horrors of the Nazi regime. But I was so traumatised at my whole experience of the Auschwitz camps it took me 60 years to be able to recount the horrors I saw." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fulci's films had {{remained}} generally ignored or dismissed {{for many years}} by the mainstream critics, who regarded his work as exploitation. However, genre fans appreciated his films as being stylish exercises in extreme gore. At least one of his films, The Beyond, has [...] "amassed a large and dedicated following". In 1998, The Beyond was re-released to theaters by Quentin Tarantino, who has often cited the film, and Fulci himself, as {{a major source of}} inspiration. Fulci's earlier, lesser-known giallo Don't Torture a Duckling (1972) received some critical acclaim as well. Fulci regarded two of his films, Don't Torture a Duckling and Beatrice Cenci, as his best work (the latter which he <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> had liked the best of all his films), and considered both Zombi 2 and The Beyond as the two films that forever catapulted him to cult film stardom. His daughter Camilla Fulci served as an assistant director on his last five films (from 1989-1991) and has gone on to become an assistant director in the Italian film industry.|$|E
2500|$|After much {{personal}} {{struggle and}} a turbulent on-off engagement, he married the Chilean-born American actress Felicia Cohn Montealegre on September 10, 1951. One {{suggestion is that}} he chose to marry partly to dispel rumors about his private life to help secure a major conducting appointment, following advice from his mentor Dimitri Mitropoulos about the conservative nature of orchestra boards. In a book released in October 2013, The Leonard Bernstein Letters, his wife reveals his homosexuality. Felicia writes: [...] "you are a homosexual and may never change—you don’t admit {{to the possibility of}} a double life, but if your peace of mind, your health, your whole nervous system depend on a certain sexual pattern what can you do?" [...] Arthur Laurents (Bernstein's collaborator in West Side Story) said that Bernstein was [...] "a gay man who got married. He wasn't conflicted about it at all. He was just gay." [...] Shirley Rhoades Perle, another friend of Bernstein, said that she thought [...] "he required men sexually and women emotionally." [...] But the early years of his marriage seem to have been happy, and no one has suggested Bernstein and his wife didn't love each other. They had three children, Jamie, Alexander, and later Nina. There are reports, though, that Bernstein did sometimes have brief extramarital liaisons with young men, which several family friends have <b>said</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> knew about.|$|E
