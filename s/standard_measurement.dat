5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions {{that are consistent with}} direct observations and compared to a <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultraviolet}} index or UV Index is {{an international}} <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> {{of the strength of}} sunburn-producing ultraviolet (UV) radiation at a particular place and time. The scale was developed by Canadian scientists in 1992, then adopted and standardized by the UN's World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization in 1994. It is primarily used in daily forecasts aimed at the general public, and is increasingly available as an hourly forecast as well.|$|E

25|$|To take a {{scientific}} measurement with a microphone, its precise sensitivity must be known (in volts per pascal). Since this may {{change over the}} lifetime of the device, {{it is necessary to}} regularly calibrate measurement microphones. This service is offered by some microphone manufacturers and by independent certified testing labs. All microphone calibration is ultimately traceable to primary standards at a national measurement institute such as NPL in the UK, PTB in Germany and NIST in the United States, which most commonly calibrate using the reciprocity primary <b>standard.</b> <b>Measurement</b> microphones calibrated using this method can then be used to calibrate other microphones using comparison calibration techniques.|$|E
25|$|Many {{theories}} for {{the skill}} of Tiwanaku's architectural construction have been proposed. One is that they used a luk’a, which is a <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> of about sixty centimeters. Another argument is for the Pythagorean Ratio. This idea calls for right triangles {{at a ratio of}} five to four to three used in the gateways to measure all parts. Lastly Protzen and Nair argue that Tiwanaku had a system set for individual elements dependent on context and composition. This is shown in the construction of similar gateways ranging from diminutive to monumental size, proving that scaling factors did not affect proportion. With each added element, the individual pieces were shifted to fit together.|$|E
25|$|VEP {{testing of}} acuity is {{somewhat}} similar to preferential looking in using {{a series of}} black and white stripes (sine wave gratings) or checkerboard patterns (which produce larger responses than stripes). Behavioral responses are not required and brain waves created by the presentation of the patterns are recorded instead. The patterns become finer and finer until the evoked brain wave just disappears, which is considered to be the endpoint measure of visual acuity. In adults and older, verbal children capable of paying attention and following instructions, the endpoint provided by the VEP corresponds very well to the psychophysical measure in the <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> (i.e. the perceptual endpoint determined by asking the subject when they can no longer see the pattern). There is an assumption that this correspondence also applies to much younger children and infants, though this does not necessarily have to be the case. Studies do show the evoked brain waves, as well as derived acuities, are very adult-like by one year of age.|$|E

40|$|Several recent new {{measurements}} of the top-quark mass that use alternative observables and reconstruction techniques are presented, performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the CERN LHC. Alternative observables can help provide insight by presenting different systematic sensitivities and by constraining prevailing systematic uncertainties of <b>standard</b> <b>measurements,</b> such as jet energy calibrations. Furthermore, the top-quark mass is extracted from theoretically well-defined observables, such as the inclusive production cross section for top quark pairs. Finally, the mass is measured in event topologies dominated by electroweak-mediated single top production by both experiments. The results of different techniques and production modes {{are found to be}} consistent with what is obtained in <b>standard</b> <b>measurements.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, proceedings for Moriond EW 2016 conferenc...|$|R
