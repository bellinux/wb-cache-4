5|$|The vessel's only passenger, Robert Stubbs, was {{a former}} captain of slave ships. In early 1780 he was {{appointed}} by the African Committee of the Royal African Company, as the governor of Anomabu, a British fortification near Cape Coast Castle in Ghana. This position made him also vice-president of the RAC Council of the Castle. Due to his ineptitude and enmity incurred with John Roberts, governor of the Castle, Stubbs was {{forced out of the}} governorship of Anomabu by the RAC Council after nine months. Witness statements gathered by the African Committee of the RAC, accused him of being a <b>semi-literate</b> drunkard who mismanaged the slave-trading activities of the fort. Stubbs was aboard to return to Britain; Collingwood may have thought his earlier experience on slave ships would be useful.|$|E
25|$|Between 1880 and 1910, Argentina and Uruguay {{received}} {{a large number}} of Italian immigrants, mostly poor country folk who arrived with little or no schooling in the Spanish language and often were only <b>semi-literate</b> or totally illiterate in their Italian languages.|$|E
25|$|He {{entered the}} Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1966 with a grade of 5.33 (out of 10). He {{repeated}} {{his second year}} there. At {{the time of his}} arrest, Rîmaru was in the course of repeating his third year. Although he entered a university, one of his professors described him as shy and <b>semi-literate,</b> with a very poor vocabulary and an extremely narrow set of interests.|$|E
50|$|Protestants in {{the early}} twenty-first century, {{including}} both official and unofficial churches, had between 25 and 35 million adherents. Catholics were not more than 10 million. Other demographic analyses found that an average 2-4% {{of the population of}} China claims a Christian affiliation. Christians were unevenly distributed geographically. The only provinces in which they constituted a population significantly larger than 1 million persons are Henan, Anhui and Zhejiang. Protestants are characterised by a prevalence of people living in the countryside, women, illiterates and <b>semi-literates,</b> and elderly people.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} factors {{responsible}} for the gradual loss of the three languages. The contact between the three languages on the one hand, and with other neighbouring languages on the other, have greatly impacted the trio, especially Uvwie. Generally, the language of communication is English among literate people and Nigerian Pidgin among illiterates and <b>semi-literates</b> of Urhobo and neighbouring communities. This {{is the case in}} all spheres of activities, except in annual or periodical traditional religious rites or elders' and chiefs' meetings, especially in rural areas. Okpe, Urhobo and Uvwie are also spoken in some rural homes, markets and Orthodox Church services.|$|R
40|$|Since the Registrar General {{began to}} count the {{signatures}} and marks made by brides and grooms in parish registers across England in 1839, contemporaries and later historians have used this data to describe rates of literacy during the Victorian period. Evidence from the marriage registers only tells us about the literacy of the marrying population at any given point in time. Moreover, by distinguishing between those who could read and write and those who could not, the marriage registers have helped to draw an artificial line between those who were literate {{and the rest of}} the population, ignoring the large number of <b>semi-literates</b> who played an important role in a society progressing towards mass literacy. This article uses data collected on the separate skills of literacy and the experience of schooling of those men, women and children who passed through the criminal justice system between c. 1840 and c. 1870 in an attempt to reconstruct patterns of skills acquisition among the lower classes during the Victorian period. Not only does this evidence further dispel myths about the existence of a so-called 'criminal class' with specific characteristics in Victorian England, but, even more importantly, it shows that the path towards mass literacy was uneven, far less predictable than previously allowed, and often only loosely tied to developments in formal schooling...|$|R
25|$|John Roach {{began his}} career in the United States in 1832 as a <b>semi-literate</b> Irish {{immigrant}} laborer, eventually establishing his own small business with the purchase of the Etna Iron Works. Roach took advantage of the American Civil War to transform the Etna Iron Works into a major manufacturer of marine steam engines, and after the war, with the purchase in 1867 of the Morgan Iron Works, secured a near-monopoly on marine engine building in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Tauler was {{a famous}} Spanish target shooter and Olympic {{medalist}} who became a gunsmith, opening a shop in Madrid and he eventually began exporting weapons. He had {{the full range of}} Llama pistols manufactured bearing his trademark and name, with a variety of minor improvements of his own design. Markings on the pistols were in English, suggesting he had the British Commonwealth and North American markets in mind, although in the past other firms had also used these in an attempt to mislead <b>semi-literate</b> customers that they were buying American made weapons. He was also an agent of the Spanish secret service, and used his connections to encourage sales to his fellow agents, government departments and police authorities. Tauler pistols were only manufactured between 1933 and 1936.|$|E
25|$|In 1868 Shetra's coup organiser, a <b>semi-literate</b> Ganden monk named Palden Dondrup, {{seized power}} by another coup and ruled as a cruel despot for three years, putting opponents {{to death by}} having them 'sewn into fresh animal skins and thrown in the river'. In 1871, {{at the request of}} {{officials}} outraged after Dondrup had done just that with one minister and imprisoned several others, he in turn was ousted and committed suicide after a counter-coup coordinated by the supposedly powerless 'Regent' Khyenrab Wangchuk. As a result of this action this venerable old Regent, who died the next year, is fondly remembered by Tibetans as saviour of the Dalai Lama and the nation. The Kashag and the Tsongdu or National Assembly were re-instated, and, presided over by a Dalai Lama or his Regent, ruled without further interruption until 1959.|$|E
25|$|The cunning folk of Britain {{were often}} from the {{societal}} class that included artisans, tradesmen, and farmers, {{and as such}} were commonly at least <b>semi-literate</b> and of a higher social position than common labourers. In many cases they continued in their ordinary line of work alongside earning money as a professional cunning man or woman {{in order to gain}} the maximum possible income. In almost all cases, cunning folk worked either alone, as a solitary magical practitioner, or with one other person, such as a spouse or sibling. The only known exception was in early nineteenth-century Manchester, where a group of cunning men used to meet in a group centred around the most prominent of their members, a cunning fellow called Rawlinson. This method of working alone was one factor that separated the cunning folk from the stereotype of witches then prevalent in Britain, which often held that these witches met together in groups, sometimes known as covens, and at times flew through the air {{in order to get to}} their meeting points.|$|E
25|$|Charismatic Andrew Jackson, by contrast, in {{collaboration}} with strategist Martin Van Buren rallied his followers in the newly emerging Democratic Party. In the election of 1828, Jackson defeated Adams by an overwhelming electoral majority in the first presidential election since 1800 to mark a wholesale voter rejection of the previous administration's policies. The electoral campaign was correspondingly as vicious as the one 28 years earlier, with Jackson and Adams's camps hurtling the worst mudslinging accusations at one another. The former painted himself as a war hero and the champion of the masses against Northeastern elites while the latter argued {{that he was a}} man of education and social grace against an uncouth, <b>semi-literate</b> backwoodsman. This belied the fact that Andrew Jackson was a societal elite by any definition, owning a large plantation with dozens of slaves and mostly surrounding himself with men of wealth and property. The election saw the coming to power of Jacksonian Democracy, thus marking the transition from the First Party System (which reflected Jeffersonian Democracy) to the Second Party System. Historians debate the significance of the election, with many arguing that it marked the beginning of modern American politics, with the decisive establishment of democracy and the formation of the two party system.|$|E
25|$|The Bahá'í-inspired Tahirih Justice Center and the Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women in Indore in India are {{projects}} that have received particular attention. Layli Miller-Muro founded the Tahirih Justice Center in 1997 following a well-publicized asylum {{case in which}} she was involved as a student attorney. Miller-Muro later co-wrote a book with the client she had aided and used her portion of the proceeds for the initial funding of Tahirih. As of 2003, the organization had assisted more than 4,000 women and children fleeing {{from a wide variety of}} abuses. The Barli Vocational Institute for Rural Women was founded in 1985 in India and offers a six-month program for tribal women at its facilities in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Through June 1996, a total of 769 rural tribal women have been trained at the Institute; the women came from 119 villages, and after returning home to their cities or villages 45% of them established small businesses, 62% are functionally literate or <b>semi-literate</b> (which has motivated people to send their children to school), 42% have started growing vegetables, 97% are using safe drinking water, all the former trainees and many of their male relatives have given up drinking alcohol, and caste prejudices have been eliminated.|$|E
500|$|Molly Brant {{was raised}} in a Mohawk culture that had become highly {{influenced}} by their English trading partners. [...] In Canajoharie, the Brants lived in a substantial colonial-style frame house and used many European household goods. The family attended the Church of England. Molly was fluent in Mohawk and English. It is not clear whether she was formally educated or whether she could read and write. There are several letters signed [...] "Mary Brant", but these may have been dictated by Molly and written by someone else. A letter from 1782 is signed with [...] "her mark", indicating that she may have been only <b>semi-literate.</b>|$|E
500|$|Vizzini {{was born}} in Villalba, a village in the Province of Caltanissetta, with a {{population}} of approximately 4,000 people at the time. This area in the middle of Sicily, known as the [...] "Vallone", was a poor region where most people lived off subsistence agriculture. His father, Beniamino Vizzini, was a peasant, but managed to marry into a slightly more well-off family that owned some land. A member of his mother’s family, Giuseppe Scarlata, had risen to high eminence in the Catholic Church. Calogero’s brothers, Giovanni and Giuseppe (not {{to be confused with the}} bishop of Noto of the same name), both became priests in Villalba. Calogero Vizzini, however, was <b>semi-literate</b> and did not finish elementary school.|$|E
500|$|Shahin's rise {{generally}} confused the Ottoman {{government because}} Shahin used the Tanzimat to legitimize his revolt. The Ottomans {{did not consider}} the religious equality called for by the Tanzimat reforms to translate into class equality, which is how Shahin interpreted it. Moreover, the Ottomans did not countenance that a <b>semi-literate</b> Arabic-speaking peasant from a rural region such as Keserwan {{would serve as a}} representative of the Tanzimat. They reacted to Shahin's revolt negatively, although the provincial Ottoman authorities of Beirut generally felt powerless to act against the peasant rebels due to a lack of funds and forces on the ground. Khurshid Pasha sympathized more with the Khazen sheikhs and in a letter to the Patriarchate accused Shahin of using [...] "deceit to lead astray the minds of the people and to seduce them into following his evil ways". The principal focus of the Ottoman authorities in Lebanon was containing Shahin's revolt. However, later historians of Lebanon accused Khurshid Pasha of at least tacitly supporting Shahin in order to break communal solidarity.|$|E

2500|$|The title {{became a}} New York Times #2 best-seller, {{with more than}} a million copies in print, but overall {{critical}} reception was negative.

2500|$|Genco Russo, {{also known}} as [...] "Zi Peppi Jencu", was an uncouth, sly, <b>semi-literate</b> thug with {{excellent}} political connections. A vulgar man – he used to spit on the floor no matter who was present – he was often photographed with bishops, bankers, civil servants and politicians. As such he {{was considered to be}} the arbiter of Mafia politics, and was regarded as the successor of Calogero Vizzini, who had died in 1954.|$|E
2500|$|In her {{review in}} The New York Times Book Review, Vivian Gornick notes: [...] " [...] the less said the better. ... In short: Frederick's {{book is a}} <b>semi-literate</b> rehash of Erhard-speak as it is practiced by Erhard, his 'trainers,' and his 'graduates.'" [...] A review of the book in Kirkus Reviews was negative; the review writes {{critically}} of the author, [...] "Now we have priests like Carl Frederick, EST graduate, ad man and 'simply another human being,' who addresses his reader as 'baby' when not calling him 'asshole.' The original EST marathon entails four days {{of this kind of}} insult." [...] Kirkus Reviews concludes, characterizing the book as, [...] "Low blows at high decibels." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{governor}} of the Banca Romana {{at the time of}} the scandal, Bernardo Tanlongo, was a peculiar man, <b>semi-literate</b> but with a genius for accounts and finance. [...] "He was not a womanizer, he never played, he is the antithesis of all elegance, his frugality resembles avarice," [...] was how the Corriere della Sera once described him. A former farm hand and former spy during the short-lived Roman Republic in 1849, he made his career in the bank in the Papal State, providing illicit entertainment to Vatican officials. Tanlongo remained at his post in the Banca Romana after the unification of Italy and was promoted governor in 1881. He had a remarkable ability to secure friendships and protection by providing loans to cover up secrets.|$|E
2500|$|In his 1996 book, Harlan Ellison's The City On the Edge of Forever, Ellison {{claimed to}} have never {{received}} more than a [...] "pittance" [...] from working on the episode. He said that [...] "every thug and studio putz and <b>semi-literate</b> bandwagon-jumper and merchandiser has grown fat as a maggot in a corpse off what I created." [...] He said {{that was the reason}} why he wrote the book. On March 13, 2009, Ellison filed a lawsuit against CBS Television Studios, seeking 25% of net receipts from merchandising, publishing, and other income from the episode since 1967; the suit also names the Writers Guild of America for failing repeatedly to act on Ellison's behalf in the matter. In a press statement, Ellison said [...] "It ain't about the 'principle,' friend, it's about the money! Pay me! I'm doing it for the 35-year-long disrespect and the money!" [...] On October 22, 2009, the lawsuit was settled with Ellison claiming he was satisfied with the outcome.|$|E
2500|$|Joe Maplin (Camp Owner) – The greedy and philandering {{owner of}} the six Maplins holiday camps. It was {{intended}} {{that he would be}} played by Bob Monkhouse, but he was unavailable for filming. Joe Maplin communicated with the entertainments staff through [...] sarcastic, hectoring, <b>semi-literate</b> letters which Jeffrey Fairbrother would have to read to the staff. Throughout the series it is revealed that Maplin owns a large string of camps all over the country. As well as the sitcom's Crimpton-on-Sea camp, Maplin also owned camps at locations such as Camber Sands, and the Isle of Wight. Maplin claimed to be the person who invented the catchphrase [...] "Hi-de-Hi!", although according to Mr Partridge, it was not Maplin's idea, but that of a mad colonel in the army during the Second World War. Maplin had a habit of covertly inspecting the staff at his camps by disguising himself as a camper, leaving his chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce several streets away and entering the camp in a taxi.|$|E
