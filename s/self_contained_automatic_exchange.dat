40|$|A {{need was}} {{identified}} {{to develop an}} build a completely self-contained experimental apparatus to investigate the cardiovascular response to the weightlessness of spaceflight. This experiment would fly aboard a NASA Get Away Special (G. A. S.) canister, which would require that the apparatus be fully <b>self</b> <b>contained</b> and <b>automatic.</b> This apparatus would need to include an artificial heart and heart driver, a compact integrated Mock Circulation System (MCS), an automated control system, a data acquisition system, and a self-contained power supply. The development of the MCS required the modification of a Penn State-type MCS to {{include the use of}} a coil spring in the compliance elements, an automatically controlled variable systemic resistance unit, and the integration of all elements of the MCS into a compact and lightweight package which could function effectively in microgravity. Testing showed that this MCS improved upon the functionality of the original Penn State design, since it incorporates automatic systemic resistance adjustment, and a reduction in fluid inertance with a corresponding improvement in pressure and flow waveforms. This MCS was successfully incorporated into an experiment package which fit into a cylinder 19 inches in diameter and 27 inches high, with a weight limit of 200 lb...|$|R

5000|$|The use {{of letters}} on dials was {{proposed}} in 1917 by W. G. Blauvelt of AT&T. Large cities like New York would ultimately require a seven-digit number, but some {{tests in the}} early 1900s indicated that the short-term memory span of many people could not handle seven digits and many dialling errors due to memory lapse might occur (the documentation for these tests is lost). Hence the first Panel <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> cutover in 1915 in Newark, New Jersey used [...] "semiautomatic" [...] operation with the local operator keying the number for the caller. And as large cities would have both manual and <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> for some years, the numbers for manual or <b>automatic</b> <b>exchanges</b> {{would have the same}} format (originally MULberry 3456, with three letters then four numbers), which could be either spoken or dialled.|$|R

40|$|Tax {{authorities}} are increasingly relying on mutual cooperation with their foreign peers to enforce more effectively their internal tax laws. After the banking scandals of 2008 {{and the subsequent}} global financial crisis, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for TaxPurposes has proposed the exchange of information upon request as the fiscal transparency standard. However, some measures adopted by the European Union, previous initiatives from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and, above all, {{the introduction of the}} Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (Fatca) by the United States in 2010 have promoted the need to adopt the <b>automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information as the new fiscal transparency standard. <b>Automatic</b> <b>exchange</b> of information allows home countries to verify whether their taxpayers have correctly included foreign income, allowing tax authorities to have early warning of possible noncompliance cases.
