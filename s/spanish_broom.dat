50|$|In {{the whole}} of Turkey there are about 11,000 species of {{flowering}} plant, {{about a third of}} which are endemic to the country.

The country is divided into three main floristic areas; the Mediterranean area; the Euro-Siberian area; and the Irano-Tranian area. The flora of the European part of Turkey is similar to that of adjoining Greece. The ecoregions here include Balkan mixed forests dominated by oaks and containing Scots pine, Bosnian pine, Macedonian pine, silver fir and Norway spruce, and Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests where some of the main species are oaks, strawberry tree, Greek strawberry tree, <b>Spanish</b> <b>broom</b> and laurel.|$|E
50|$|On {{the east}} and west coasts of North America, common broom was {{introduced}} as an ornamental plant (i.e.:California since the 1860s). It is known in much of the pacific northwest as Scotch broom. It has become a naturalised invasive weed, and due to its aggressive seed dispersal broom removal has proved very difficult. Similarly, it is a major problem species in the cooler and wetter areas of southern Australia and New Zealand. Biological control for broom in New Zealand has been investigated since the mid-1980s. On the west coast of the United States, French broom (Genista monspessulana), Mediterranean broom (Genista linifolia) and <b>Spanish</b> <b>broom</b> (Spartium junceum) are also considered noxious invasives, as broom quickly crowds out native vegetation, and grow most prolifically in the least accessible areas.|$|E

40|$|Montane regions {{worldwide}} {{have experienced}} relatively low plant invasion rates, a trend attributed to increased cli-matic severity, {{low rates of}} disturbance, and reduced propagule pressure relative to lowlands. Manipulative experi-ments at elevations above the invasive range of non-native species can clarify the relative contributions of these mechanisms to montane invasion resistance, yet such experiments are rare. Furthermore, global climate change and land use changes are expected to cause decreases in snowpack and increases in disturbance by fire and forest thin-ning in montane forests. We examined {{the importance of these}} factors in limiting montane invasions using a field transplant experiment above the invasive range of two non-native lowland shrubs, Scotch broom (Cytisus scoparius) and <b>Spanish</b> <b>broom</b> (Spartium junceum), in the rain–snow transition zone of the Sierra Nevada of California. We tested the effects of canopy closure, prescribed fire, and winter snow depth on demographic transitions of each species. Establishment of both species was most likely at intermediate levels of canopy disturbance, but at this intermediate canopy level, snow depth had negative effects on winter survival of seedlings.

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the {{characteristics}} of the root system of <b>Spanish</b> <b>Broom</b> (Spartium junceum L.), a species that is worth taking into consideration for its capacity for adaptation and resistance to drought. In particular, the aims of the study were 1) to investigate the plant's bio-mechanical aspects and 2) to verify whether root reinforcement and the field rooting ability of stem cuttings enhance its potential for use in slope stabilization and soil bio-engineering techniques, particularly in Mediterranean areas. Single root specimens were sampled and tested for tensile strength, obtaining classical tensile strength-diameter relationships. Analyses were performed on the root systems in order to assess root density distribution. The Root Area Ratio (RAR) was analyzed by taking both direct and indirect measurements, the latter relying on image processing. The data obtained were used to analyze the stability of an artificial slope (landfill) and root reinforcement. The measurement and calculation of mean root number, mean root diameter, RAR, root cohesion and Factor of safety are presented in order to distinguish the effect of plant origin and propagation. Furthermore, tests were performed to assess the possibility of agamic propagation (survival rate of root-ball endowed plants, rooting from stem cuttings). These tests confirmed that agamic propagation is difficult, even though roots were produced from some buried stems, and for practical purposes it has to be ruled out.
