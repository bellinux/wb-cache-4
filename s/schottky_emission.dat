Then by covering both slits {{with a layer of}} amorphous material and carrying out the experiment in a conventional transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy filter we can demonstrate that the diffraction pattern, taken by selecting the elastically scattered electrons, shows the presence of interference fringes, but with a bimodal envelope which can be accounted for by taking into account the non-constant thickness of the deposited layer. However, the intensity of the inelastically scattered electrons in the diffraction plane is very broad and at the limit of detectability. Therefore the experiment was repeated using an aluminum film and a microscope also equipped with a <b>Schottky</b> field <b>emission</b> gun. It was thus possible to observe also the image due to the inelastically scattered electron, which does not show interference phenomena both in the Fraunhofer or Fresnel regimes.

40|$|New {{concept of}} radiation-induced <b>emission</b> of <b>Schottky</b> defects from {{extended}} defects is proposed, which {{acts in the}} opposite direction compared with Frenkel pair production, and it results in the radiation-induced recovery processes. The vacancy emission from a void surface results in a shrinkage of the void which is analogous to the thermal void shrinkage at high temperatures, but it is expected to operate at low and medium temperatures and high sink densities, when the radiation-induced vacancy emission from sinks becomes comparable with the absorption of Frenkel defects produced in the bulk. As a result, the void growth becomes negative below a threshold temperature (or above a threshold flux), and saturates after a threshold irradiation dose, at a level, which depends on the type of material. These effects have been observed experimentally for a long time but could not be explained by the conventional theory. One of the technologically important consequences of the new concept is a mechanism of irradiation creep, based on the radiation and stress induced preference emission, which is essentially temperature independent in contrast to the well-known SIPA or elastodiffusion mechanisms that can yield a significant irradiation creep only when recombination is negligible. The efficiency of the radiation-induced <b>Schottky</b> defect <b>emission</b> is different for different types of materials, which is shown {{to be one of the}} major causes of their different responses to irradiation.

We consider a model that takes into account excitonic mechanisms for the creation of both Frenkel and Schottky defects, and which shows that although the contribution of the latter mechanism to the production of primary defects may be small, its role in the radiation-induced evolution of microstructure can be very significant. The model is applied to describe the evolution of sodium colloids and the formation of voids in NaCl, which is followed by a sudden fracture of the material, presenting a potential problem in rock salt-based nuclear waste repositories. The temperature, dose rate and dose dependence of colloid growth in NaCl doped with different types of impurities is analyzed. We have found that colloid growth may become negative below a threshold temperature (or above a threshold dose rate), or below a certain impurity concentration, which is determined by the RSDE, that depends strongly on the type and concentration of the impurities.
