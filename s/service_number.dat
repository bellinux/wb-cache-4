He was allocated the AIF <b>service</b> <b>number</b> VX79, and assumed command of the Australian Corps Signals.

5|$|Aged 17, Braham {{applied for}} a short service {{commission}} in the RAF, a course that lasted for five years. The commission was designed to find young aviation enthusiasts with the right physical and academic qualities to become flying officers. To Braham's surprise, his application was accepted. His commission was dated 7 March 1937. His <b>service</b> <b>number</b> was 40667. The commission enabled Braham to enter at the rank of pilot officer. His training mainly consisted of an introduction to flying by civilian organisations contracted {{to do so by}} the RAF. Successful candidates advanced to military training.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 he {{made the}} {{decision}} that if {{there was going to be}} a war, he wanted to be a fighter pilot, and so immediately joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Within three months Lock had been called up and began flight training. On the outbreak of War in September 1939, as a trained pilot Lock joined the RAF as a sergeant pilot. After further training at No. 6 Flying School RAF Little Rissington, he was commissioned as a pilot officer (<b>service</b> <b>number</b> 81642) and posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick, North Yorkshire, flying Spitfires.|$|E

50|$|In 1940, {{when the}} United States Army {{expanded}} its <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> beyond ten million, {{the range of}} 10 000 000 to 10 999 999 was reserved for Regular Army enlisted personnel who joined from recruiting stations outside the United States. With 999,999 <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> available in this range, the Regular Army was able to issue <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> to extra-US enlistees, without repeating numbers, until the disestablishment of <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> in 1969.|$|R
50|$|Navy enlisted <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> were {{slightly}} {{more complicated than}} the officers’ version, with enlisted <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> being created in 1920 {{with a range of}} 1,000,000 to 9,999,999. Originally, there were no Navy enlisted numbers below one million to avoid enlisted personnel having the same <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> as officers.|$|R
5|$|In 1943, Elizabeth {{undertook}} {{her first}} solo public appearance {{on a visit}} to the Grenadier Guards, of which she had been appointed colonel the previous year. As she approached her 18th birthday, parliament changed the law so that she could act as one of five Counsellors of State in the event of her father's incapacity or absence abroad, such as his visit to Italy in July 1944. In February 1945, she was appointed as an honorary second subaltern in the Auxiliary Territorial Service with the <b>service</b> <b>number</b> of 230873. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was awarded the rank of honorary junior commander five months later.|$|E
5|$|In June 1940, in {{the early}} months of the Second World War, Ford volunteered for service with the Second Australian Imperial Force and was {{commissioned}} as a major in the Australian Army Medical Corps, receiving the <b>service</b> <b>number</b> NX445. In March 1941 he was sent to the Middle East as commanding officer of the 1st Australian Mobile Bacteriological Laboratory, and was soon engaged in the diagnosis of a variety of hitherto uncertain diseases. In July 1941, Ford's unit moved to Syria, where it was attached to the 2/3rd Casualty Clearing Station, providing the latter with the diagnostic capabilities of a larger general hospital, of which none were available.|$|E
5|$|Alfred John Shout {{was born}} in Wellington, New Zealand, on 8 August 1882. He was the eldest of nine {{children}} to an English-born father, John Richard Shout, and Irish mother, Agnes Mary (née Kelly, formerly McGovern). Information on Alfred Shout's early life is rather scant and the details differ between sources, but according to his First World War attestation form he was privately educated. In early 1900, Shout travelled to South Africa with his elder half-brother, William McGovern. The brothers sought to join one of the colonial contingents then engaged in the Second Boer War; Alfred enlisted in the newly raised Border Horse on 17 February 1900, while William (using the surname Shout) found a place in Bethune's Mounted Infantry. The Border Horse was an irregular colonial force formed in eastern Cape Colony, and Shout was allotted to the unit's No.1 Company with the <b>service</b> <b>number</b> 9216.|$|E

50|$|Coast Guard officer <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> were unique {{amongst the}} {{military}} branches {{in that the}} entire range of officer numbers was declared upon the initial creation of the <b>service</b> <b>numbers.</b> The officer range extended from #1 to 100,000 and these numbers had yet to be exhausted by the discontinuation of Coast Guard <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> in 1974.|$|R
50|$|After {{the initial}} {{issuance}} {{of the first}} Air Force officer <b>service</b> <b>numbers,</b> the <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> were increased with the second range extending from 20 000 to 99 999. These numbers were set aside for past, present, and future Regular Air Force officers with this range being used from 1948 until the discontinuation of Air Force <b>service</b> <b>numbers</b> in 1969.|$|R
5|$|Finucane {{moved on}} to the Hawker Fury on 21 March 1939. On 23 June, he was classed as average again, but with low marks—2,010 out of 3,400—just 59 percent. Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; and in the written exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 percent. At this time, he flew radio-controlled aircraft for the Targeting Section. On 10 July, he crashed a Queen bee on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which did not improve his standing as a pilot. He escaped with a cut thumb. On 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the <b>service</b> <b>number</b> 41276.|$|E
5|$|On 4 April 1940, Robertson {{joined the}} Second AIF himself, with {{the rank of}} brigadier, and was {{allocated}} the AIF <b>service</b> <b>number</b> VX20321. He was appointed to command the 19th Infantry Brigade, which was then being formed from units made surplus by {{the reduction of the}} 6th Division from 12 infantry battalions to nine. All three of its battalions, the 2/4th, 2/8th and 2/11th Infantry Battalions, were initially commanded by over-age officers, but the commander of the 2/4th was replaced by Ivan Dougherty in August. Initially, Dougherty received a cool reception from Robertson, who was disappointed at being unable to select his own battalion commanders, but Dougherty soon made such a good impression that when Robertson went on leave in October 1940 he recommended that Dougherty act as brigade commander, {{despite the fact that he}} was the youngest and most junior of Robertson's battalion chiefs.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} connected to Egertorget via Stortorvet. After {{the line was}} taken over by KSS, it was given <b>service</b> <b>number</b> 9 and operated with a twelve-minute headway, connecting via the city center to Skøyen on the Skøyen Line. When the Sinsen Line opened, the souther part of the Rodeløkka was also served by Line 13, which gave a six-minute headway south of Helgesens gate. From 29 June 1924, after the takeover of Oslo Sporveier, the headway was changed to fifteen minutes. From 29 May 1927, Line 13 was replaced with Line 12, and from 19 June, Line 9 became Line 17, which continued along the Ullevål Hageby Line {{on the other side of}} the city center. From 19 January 1937, the Sinsen service was also operated by Line 3. From 10 December 1939, Gullfisk trams were put into service on the Sinsen services. With the reopening of the Rodeløkka Line in 1955, the service {{was taken over by}} Line 13, which used SM53 trams. Ridership on the new line was less than predicted, and from 1959, the line was only served during rush-hour and started to turn at the Eastern Railway Station in the city center.|$|E
