500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1947, Bakshi's father and uncle {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C., in search of business opportunities, and soon moved the family to the black neighborhood of Foggy Bottom. Bakshi recalled, [...] "All my friends were black, everyone we did business with was black, the school across the street was black. It was segregated, so everything was black. I went to see black movies; black girls <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lap. I went to black parties. I was another black kid on the block. No problem!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{her book}} Bouncing Back, Rivers {{described}} how she developed bulimia nervosa after the 1987 suicide of Rosenberg, {{and the subsequent}} death of her psychologist, with whom she'd developed a close friendship, of AIDS. Additionally, Rivers' relationship with her daughter had been strained at the time; according to Rivers, the confluence of events resulted in her contemplating suicide in her California home. [...] "I got the gun out, the whole thing," [...] she recalled in a 2008 interview. [...] "And [...] my dog came and sat in my lap... {{and that was a}} big turning point in my life. My little, stupid dog, a Yorkie, who I adored, literally came and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> lap....and literally, he saved my life. Truly saved my life." [...] Rivers eventually recovered with counseling and the support of her family.|$|E
6000|$|... "Does he know that?" [...] said Grish Chunder, quietly, {{swinging}} his legs as he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> table. He was speaking in English now.|$|E
60|$|On this {{particular}} occasion I made my barricade stronger than usual; <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed {{and opened the}} packet from home.|$|R
2500|$|Indian bantamweight boxer Akhil Kumar's {{bed in the}} Games village {{collapsed}} when he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> it. [...] "I <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed to rest {{but suddenly}} it gave way. After that I noticed {{that part of it}} has no plywood", he said ...|$|R
60|$|I left Jacky peeking {{still and}} I went to bed. After {{a long time}} Aunt Tommy came {{up to my room}} and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed in the moonlight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Rather! It was my {{introduction}} to your uncle's household. Selina <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> left, and Louise on my right. You sat opposite, tired and disagreeable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somebody {{jumped at}} me and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head in the ditch. I couldn't get up. And then some blackguard cut the ropes of the guard-tent. I couldn't see who it was. He cut off {{directly}} the tent went down." ...|$|E
60|$|The other guest, who <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> young lady's right hand, was an eminent public character--being {{no other}} than the celebrated Indian traveller, Mr. Murthwaite, who, at risk of his life, had {{penetrated}} in disguise where no European had ever set foot before.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> camp {{stool and}} reflected. Really I {{was waiting for}} the sun to rise, since it was useless to attempt an {{operation}} in that light. The man, Kalubi, thought that I had refused his petition and became terribly agitated.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>sat</b> her <b>on</b> <b>my</b> pacing steed, [...] And {{nothing else}} saw all day long, [...] For sidelong would she bend, and sing [...] A fairy's song, [...] She found me roots of relish sweet, [...] And honey wild, and manna dew;" ...|$|R
6000|$|I meekly {{followed}} my grim guardians {{to the shore}} and <b>sat</b> dejectedly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> rug while they paced the sand. Francis was on the rocks. As soon as Aunt Martha and Mrs. Saxby were at a safe distance, I began my message: [...] "All discovered. Aunt is very angry. We go home today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It was a blythe bit ance!' said Meg, {{speaking}} to herself. 'Did ye notice {{if there was}} an auld saugh tree that's maist blawn down, but yet its roots are in the earth, and it hangs ower the bit burn? Mony a day hae I wrought my stocking and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> sunkie under that saugh.' ...|$|E
60|$|I dried my sobbing darling's {{eyes and}} {{sat beside her}} on the sofa, and Richard <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> other side; and while I was {{reminded}} of that so different night when they had first taken me into their confidence and had gone on in their own wild happy way, they told me between them how it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "To-day I have stroked {{him once}} {{and he has}} bitten me three times," [...] Herr Heinrich reported. [...] "Soon I will stroke him three times and he shall not bite me at all.... Also {{yesterday}} he climbed up me and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, and suddenly bit my ear. It was not hard he bit, but sudden.|$|E
60|$|His voice ceased. I {{reflected}} {{upon the}} spirit of his words. Suddenly I kicked my feet in the air, rolled <b>on</b> <b>my</b> side and <b>sat</b> up suddenly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> deck chair with my legs down.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{opened the}} street door {{and went up}} stairs, and heard him {{sleeping}} his heavy sleep, exactly as I had heard him when I went out. I <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed and took off my bonnet, quite quiet in myself, because I knew it was to be. I damped the towel, and put it ready, and took a turn in the room.|$|R
60|$|Nothing {{less than}} two fat sweltering one-pound notes {{that seemed to have}} been on terms of the warmest {{intimacy}} with all the cattle-markets in the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there.|$|R
6000|$|This {{was what}} {{happened}} to us, among whom were men of the 24th, Natal Carabineers and Mounted Police. Some had dismounted, but I <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> horse, which stood quite still, I think from fright, and fired away so long as I had any ammunition. With my very last cartridge I killed the Captain Indudu {{who had been in}} charge of the escort that conducted me to the Tugela. He had caught sight of me and called out-- ...|$|E
60|$|Still {{resting in}} my arms, as if glad to rest there, still gazing into my face, {{it was clear}} to me that she {{understood}} my every word. And then, with no trace of doubt or fear left, I stooped again, until my lips were on hers; and when I drew back once more, hardly knowing which bliss was greatest--kissing her delicate mouth or gazing into her face--she all at once put her arms about my neck and drew herself up until she <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee.|$|E
6000|$|Eunice {{passed me}} with the suddenness almost of a flash of light. When I turned toward the bed, her arms were round her father's neck. [...] "Oh, poor papa, how ill you look!" [...] Commonplace {{expressions}} of fondness, and no more; but the tone gave them a charm that subdued me. Never had I felt so indulgent toward Mr. Gracedieu's unreasonable fears as when I {{saw him in the}} embrace of his adopted daughter. She had already reminded me of the bygone day when a bright little child had <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee and listened to the ticking of my watch.|$|E
6000|$|... "A dreadful business," [...] {{continued}} Simek; [...] "but I {{got over}} it, as you shall hear. I too have a torngak. You need not laugh, my friends. It is true. He {{is only a}} little one, however--about so high, (holding up his thumb), and he never visits me except at night. One night he came to me, as I was lying <b>on</b> <b>my</b> back, gazing {{through a hole in}} the roof at our departed friends dancing in the sky. [See note.] He <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> the bridge of my nose, and looked at me. I looked at him. Then he changed his position, <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> chin, and looked at me over my nose. Then he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, I was all right,' he {{answered}} smiling, 'the [...] "somethings" [...] didn't worry me, as yet. Only the rats; {{and they had}} a circus, I tell you, all over the place. There was one wicked looking old devil that <b>sat</b> up <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own chair by the fire, and wouldn't go till I took the poker to him, and then he ran up the rope of the alarm bell and got to somewhere up the wall or the ceiling--I couldn't see where, it was so dark.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is strange," [...] {{said the}} knight; [...] "for forty years I have dwelt in this house, man and boy, {{and the point}} only was {{how to make the}} day pass over our heads; for if I did not scheme out some hunting match or hawking, or the like, I might have <b>sat</b> here <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arm-chair, as {{undisturbed}} as a sleeping dormouse, {{from one end of the}} year to the other; and now I am more like a hare on her form, that dare not sleep unless with her eyes open, and scuds off when the wind rustles among the fern." ...|$|R
60|$|Jasper Nettlepoint <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{left hand}} {{when he was}} not upstairs seeing that Miss Mavis had her repast comfortably on deck. His mother's place would have been next mine had she shown herself, and then that of the young lady under her care. The two ladies, in other words, would have been between us, Jasper marking the limit of the party on that side. Miss Mavis was present at luncheon the first day, but dinner passed without her coming in, and when it was half over Jasper remarked that he would go up and look after her.|$|E
6000|$|When I remind you, dear Mr. Governor, that {{my letter}} had {{carefully}} concealed from her the horrible discovery {{made by the}} doctor, your imagination will picture my state of mind. She saw that I was overpowered. Her sweet nature, so strangely frozen up thus far, melted at last. [...] "You don't know what I have heard," [...] she said, [...] "you don't know what thoughts have been roused in me." [...] She left her chair, and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee with the familiarity of the dear old times, and took the letter that I had written to her from her pocket.|$|E
6000|$|I put the rouleau on my dressing-table, <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed, {{and began}} to take off my boots. It {{was as if the}} picture of my present sensations was painted over some other picture that was trying to show through. [...] "Curse it!" [...] said I; [...] "my wits are going, or am I in two places at once?" [...] Half-undressed, I tossed the powder into a glass and drank it off. It effervesced, and became a {{fluorescent}} amber colour. Before I was in bed my mind was already tranquillised. I felt the pillow at my cheek, and thereupon I must have fallen asleep.|$|E
6000|$|He {{answered}} not a word, but {{worked his}} hardest. So did I. He bent forward: I <b>sat</b> erect <b>on</b> <b>my</b> Manitou, pulling hard at my handles. Now, my front wheel was upon him. It reached his pedal. We were abreast. He had a narrow thread of solid path, and he forced {{me into a}} runnel. Still I gained. He swerved: I think he tried to foul me. But the slope was too steep; his attempt recoiled on himself; he ran against the rock at the side and almost overbalanced. That second lost him. I waved my hand as I sailed ahead. 'Good morning,' I cried, gaily. 'See you again at Limburg!' ...|$|R
2500|$|Blue Horse came to Burbank's studio one hot day, fanning {{himself with}} a big turkey wing. [...] "He <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed and, not noticing, put his hat down {{on a sheet of}} sticky flypaper I had placed there. To pull it loose, he grabbed {{the other end of the}} flypaper with his other hand, and soon he was tangled up gloriously. Before I could come to his rescue, he had managed to stick the flypaper on his little dog’s back. In no time at all, the pup had dashed around the room, {{attaching}} himself to first one object, then another. The situation was funny to everybody but Blue Horse. 'Bad Medicine,' he said in disgust.” ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{the half-hour}} was out, I had got <b>my</b> dry clothes <b>on,</b> and had lent Sergeant Cuff such change of dress as he required. Penelope {{came in to}} us {{to hear what the}} Sergeant wanted with her. I don't think I ever felt what a good dutiful {{daughter}} I had, so strongly as I felt it at that moment. I took her and <b>sat</b> her <b>on</b> <b>my</b> knee and I prayed God bless her. She hid her head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom, and put her arms round my neck--and we waited a little while in silence. The poor dead girl must have been at the bottom of it, I think, with my daughter and with me. The Sergeant went to the window, and stood there looking out. I thought it right to thank him for considering us both in this way--and I did.|$|R
6000|$|To every one, I think, came some {{parallel}} to the mental states I have already sought to describe--a wonder, an impression of joyful novelty. There was also very commonly a certain confusion of the intelligence, a difficulty in self-recognition. I remember clearly as I <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> stile that presently I had the clearest doubts of my own identity and fell into the oddest metaphysical questionings. [...] "If this be I," [...] I said, [...] "then how is it I am no longer madly seeking Nettie? Nettie is now the remotest thing--and all my wrongs. Why have I suddenly passed out of all that passion? Why does not the thought of Verrall quicken my pulses?" [...] .|$|E
6000|$|... 'His little, motherly witch {{of a wife}} <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> other hand, {{with her}} head covered and her feet tucked up, gazing through the great shutter-hole. I could only see a straying lock of grey hair, a high cheek-bone, the slight masticating motion of the sharp chin. Without {{removing}} {{her eyes from the}} vast prospect of forests stretching as far as the hills, she asked me in a pitying voice why was it that he so young had wandered from his home, coming so far, through so many dangers? Had he no household there, no kinsmen in his own country? Had he no old mother, who would always remember his face? [...] .|$|E
60|$|As he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> sofa, {{with his}} long knees drawn up under his coffee-cup, his hat and gloves upon the ground close to him, his spoon going softly round and round, his shadowless red eyes, which {{looked as if they}} had {{scorched}} their lashes off, turned towards me without looking at me, the disagreeable dints I have formerly described in his nostrils coming and going with his breath, and a snaky undulation pervading his frame from his chin to his boots, I decided in my own mind that I disliked him intensely. It made me very uncomfortable to have him for a guest, for I was young then, and unused to disguise what I so strongly felt.|$|E
25|$|I congratulated Michel {{and then}} <b>sat</b> down. <b>On</b> <b>my</b> left was Guttierez, {{trying to provide}} a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had {{difficulty}} in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Guttierez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm glad he isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{starting}} from my inn, I <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed {{and began to}} sob bitterly. My servant, who had acted as my nurse, asked what ailed me. I could only answer, [...] "I have a work to do in England." [...] I was aching to get home, yet {{for want of a}} vessel I was kept at Palermo for three weeks. I began to visit the churches, and they calmed my impatience, though I did not attend any services. At last I got off in an orange boat, bound for Marseilles. We were becalmed for whole week in the Straits of Bonifacio, and it was there that I wrote the lines, Lead, Kindly Light, which have since become so well known.|$|R
60|$|On {{that night}} I slept soft, and woke oft, being utterly foredone. In the grey dawn I awoke, {{and gave a}} little cough, when, lo! there came a hot sweet gush into my mouth, {{and going to the}} window, I saw that I was {{spitting}} of blood, belike from my old wound. It is a strange thing that, therewith, a sickness came over me, and a cold fit as of fear, though fear I had felt none where men met in heat of arms. None the less, seeing that to-day, or never, I was to be made or marred, I spoke of the matter neither to man nor woman, but drinking a long draught of very cold water, I spat some deal more, and then it stanched, and I armed me and <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bed.|$|R
