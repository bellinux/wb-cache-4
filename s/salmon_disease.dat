50|$|Infectious hematopoietic {{necrosis}} virus (IHNV), is a negative-sense single-stranded, bullet-shaped RNA {{virus that}} {{is a member of}} the Rhabdoviridae family, and from the genus Novirhabdovirus. It causes the disease known as infectious hematopoietic necrosis in salmonid fish such as trout and salmon. The disease may be referred to by a number of other names such as Chinook <b>salmon</b> <b>disease,</b> Coleman disease, Columbia River sockeye disease, Cultus Lake virus disease, Oregon sockeye disease, Sacramento River Chinook disease and sockeye salmon viral disease. IHNV is commonly found in the Pacific Coast of Canada and the United States, and has also been found in Europe and Japan. The first reported epidemics of IHNV occurred in the United States at the Washington and the Oregon fish hatcheries during the 1950s.IHNV is transmitted following shedding of the virus in the feces, urine, sexual fluids, and external mucus and by direct contact or close contact with surrounding water. The virus gains entry into fish at the base of the fins.|$|E

40|$|<b>Salmon</b> {{poisoning}} <b>disease</b> in dogs {{has previously}} been reported in North America only along the western coast of the U. S. A. This paper presents the findings from eight affected dogs recently diagnosed on Vancouver Island, Canada. The clinical signs shown by these dogs were lethargy, anorexia, pyrexia and lymph node enlargement. The causative agent, Neorickettsia helminthoeca was observed in macrophages obtained from lymph node aspirates. This organism is transmitted to dogs in cysts of the fluke Nanophyetus salmincola salmincola within the tissues of the salmon or trout. The presence of fluke eggs in the feces of dogs showing typical signs is very suggestive of a diagnosis of <b>salmon</b> poisoning <b>disease.</b> Appropriate treatment, including chloramphenicol or oxytetracycline and fluid therapy, resulted in recovery.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{etiologic}} agent of <b>salmon</b> poisoning <b>disease</b> {{was found to}} be Neorickettsia helminthoeca, although a second organism, the Elokomin fluke fever agent, may also be involved in other areas. Primary cultures of dog leucocytes were found to support the in vitro cultivation of Neorickettsia helminthoeca as were canine sarcoma 503 cells and mouse lymphoblasts MB III. Quantitative methods were not applied to in vitro studies of multiplication of the rickettsia because it failed to grow sufficiently in laboratory animals or in chicken embryo yolk sacs to do so. By ultrastructural analysis it was learned that Neorickettsia helminthoeca was structurally similar to other rickettsiae. Rickettsial cells were seen as circular profiles or rod-shaped cells 0. 5 μ wide and up to 0. 7 μ. long. They were bounded by a cell wall and an underlying cytoplasmic membrane. Each of the membranes was a trilayered structure and showed the unit membrane structure. Koch's postulates were fulfilled as completely as possible for an organism that is an obligate intracellular parasite. Neorickettsia helminthoeca was found in all cases of <b>salmon</b> poisoning <b>disease.</b> The rickettsia was isolated and grown in culture. The isolated culture was found to reproduce the disease when inoculated into susceptible dogs. The rickettsia was observed in and recovered from the inoculated dog.

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} is presented supporting {{the development of}} a system for the isolation and propagation of a Neorickettsia sp. in a continuous canine macrophage cell line (DH 82). To isolate a Neorickettsia sp. pathogenic to the canine species, three naive dogs were fed metacercaria-encysted kidneys of salmon caught in a river where infection of metacercariae with Neorickettsia helminthoeca has been circumstantially known for decades. Clinically, the classic course of <b>salmon</b> poisoning <b>disease</b> developed in all of the dogs. Parasitemia began on day 8 to 11 postinfection, when the dogs developed a febrile peak, and continued until euthanasia. At necropsy, characteristic gross and microscopic lesions of the disease were present. A Neorickettsia sp. was also isolated from liver and spleen samples of these animals. The isolates have been continuously propagated and passed in DH 82 cells for more than 6 months. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that the rickettsial organisms multiplied in the membrane-bound compartment of DH 82 cells and that they morphologically closely resembled rickettsia belonging to the genus Ehrlichia. An indirect fluorescent antibody test using Neorickettsia organisms cultured in DH 82 cells showed that all dogs seroconverted 13 to 15 days postinfection. Finally, inoculation of the cell-cultured Neorickettsia organisms into a naive dog reproduced clinically typical <b>salmon</b> poisoning <b>disease</b> which was of greater severity and had a more rapid time course than that in the dogs from which the original isolation was made. On the basis of the clinical and pathologic responses of the dogs in our study, we believe that virulent N. helminthoeca was isolated and cultured in a continuous cell line...|$|R

40|$|Cell culture {{isolates}} of <b>salmon</b> pancreas <b>disease</b> virus (SPDV) of farmed Atlantic <b>salmon</b> {{and sleeping}} <b>disease</b> virus (SDV) of rainbow trout were compared. Excluding the poly(A) tracts, the genomic nucleotide sequences of SPDV and SDV RNAs include 11, 919 and 11, 900 nucleotides, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis places SPDV and SDV between the New World viruses of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Eastern equine encephalitis virus and the Old World viruses of Aura virus and Sindbis virus. When compared to each other, SPDV and SDV show 91. 1 % nucleotide sequence identity over their complete genomes, with 95 and 93. 6 % amino acid identities over their nonstructural and structural proteins, respectively. Notable {{differences between the}} two viruses include a 24 -nucleotide insertion in the C terminus of nsP 3 protein of SPDV and amino acid sequence variation at the C termini of the capsid and E 1 proteins. Experimental infections of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout with SPDV and SDV confirmed that the disease lesions induced by SPDV and SDV were similar in nature. Although infections with SPDV and SDV produced similar levels of histopathology in rainbow trout, SDV induced significantly less severe lesions in salmon than did SPDV. Virus neutralization tests performed with sera from experimentally infected salmon indicated that SPDV and SDV belonged to the same serotype; however, antigenic variation was detected among SDV and geographically different SPDV isolates by using monoclonal antibodies. Although SPDV and SDV exhibit minor biological differences, we conclude {{on the basis of the}} close genetic similarity that SPDV and SDV are closely related isolates of the same virus species for which the name Salmonid alphavirus is proposed...|$|R

40|$|Salmon are farmed {{in great}} numbers due to the {{relative}} ease of culturing and high market demands. Mainly the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is being cultured and mostly in Norway. One might think that salmon culture relieves wild salmon populations, but the opposite seems true. Salmon farming pressures wild salmon populations even further, both directly and indirectly. In this review I explore the effect of salmon farming on wild salmon populations. Some factors that negatively affect wild salmon populations are; fish feed and pollution created by high stock densities, escaped salmon that dilute the gene pool of wild <b>salmon</b> populations, <b>diseases</b> and parasites such as sea lice that spread from salmon farms to wild salmon {{and the fact that}} the high amount of cultured salmon lower the price for all salmon, threatening wild salmon stocks economically. Effort is being done to minimize these negative effects. For example partial replacement of fish based oil and proteins with plant based products, better and stronger cages reducing the chance of escapes, better understanding of sea lice and other diseases but also new techniques such as the use of cleaner fish to reduce the risk of spreading and lastly marketing wild salmon differently to get a better price for wild salmon.

These fish were fed two diets with different n- 3 /n- 6 PUFA ratio (high omega 3, 3. 08, and high omega 6, 0. 87). We assessed the influence of the diets on the fatty acid composition of the heart at 0 days post infection (d. p. i.)

In order to set a foundation for the infection studies in vivo, cold-water Zebrafish and Medaka systems were established and the fish injection protocol was optimized. We proved the efficiency of the injection protocol by injecting adult Zebrafish and Medaka at 28 °C with Francisella orientalis which resulted in death of all the injected fish within one week. However, efforts to establish cold-water fish pathogen infection model in Zebrafish or Medaka in which the infected fish could be distinguished from uninfected fish were not successful.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the presence of PRV antigens in heart tissue of Atlantic salmon and monitor the virus distribution in the heart during the disease development. This included target cell specificity, viral load and tissue location during an HSMI outbreak. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against putative PRV capsid proteins μ 1 C and σ 1 and used in immunohistochemical analysis of archived salmon heart tissue from an experimental infection. The results are consistent with the histopathological changes of HSMI and showed a sequential staining pattern with PRV antigens initially present in leukocyte-like cells and subsequently in cardiomyocytes in the heart ventricle. Our results confirm the association between PRV and HSMI, and strengthen the hypothesis of PRV being the causative agent of HSMI. Immunohistochemical detection of PRV antigens will be beneficial for the understanding of the pathogenesis of HSMI as well as for diagnostic purposes...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} Cytophaga psychrophila isolates obtained from coho fingerlings with low temperature disease collected at selected hatcheries in Oregon. In addition, cultures thought to be related to this bacterium were isolated from Siletz Hatchery water, deformed juvenile and spawning adult coho salmon, rainbow and brook trout and chinook salmon. These isolates some of which were believed to be epidemiologically significant were included in the study and their characteristics compared to those of the low temperature disease cultures. A total of 24 myxobacterial isolates were studied by examination of morphological, cultural, biochemical and serological characteristics. Results of these tests revealed all to be very closely related cultures of C. psychrophila. The cells were gram negative, flexible rods exhibiting gliding motility with no microcysts and fruiting structures formed. These aerobic psychropiles had an optimum growth temperature between 15 - 18 °C and did not grow above 25 °C. All cultures were proteolytic, lipolytic and shared at least one common antigen. A low temperature <b>disease,</b> adult coho <b>salmon,</b> deformed juvenile coho <b>salmon,</b> peduncle <b>disease,</b> and rainbow trout isolate were shown to have the ability to produce death in fingerling coho salmon when injected intramuscularly. A serological typing study of six selected isolates revealed no antigenic differences among those collected from fish in Oregon. A peduncle disease isolate from brook trout collected in the Eastern United States shared at least one common antigen with the Oregon cultures and in addition antigens unique to each were demonstrated. To determine if spawning adult coho salmon carry C. psychrophila, bacteriological cultures were prepared from the kidneys of adult fish collected at Siletz and Alsea Hatcheries. Approximarely 50...|$|R
40|$|Development of Salmon Cardiac Primary Cultures (SCPCs) from Atlantic salmon pre-hatch embryos {{and their}} {{application}} as in vitro model for cardiotropic viral infection research are described. Producing SCPCs requires plating of trypsin dissociated embryos with subsequent targeted harvest from 24 h up to 3 weeks, of relevant tissues after visual identification. SCPCs are then transferred individually to chambered wells for culture in isolation, with incubation at 15 - 22 °. SCPCs production efficiency was not influenced by embryo's origin (0. 75 / farmed or wild embryo), but mildly influenced by embryonic developmental stage (0. 3 decline between 380 and 445 accumulated thermal units), and {{strongly influenced by}} time of harvest post-plating (0. 6 decline if harvested after 72 hours). Beating rate was not significantly influenced by temperature (15 - 22 °) or age (2 - 4 weeks), but was significantly lower on SCPCs originated from farmed embryos with a disease resistant genotype (F = 5. 3, p< 0. 05). Two distinct morphologies suggestive of an ex vivo embryonic heart and a de novo formation were observed sub-grossly, histologically, ultra-structurally and with confocal microscopy. Both types contained cells consistent with cardiomyocytes, endothelium, and fibroblasts. Ageing of SCPCs in culture was observed with increased auto fluorescence in live imaging, and as myelin figures and cellular degeneration ultra-structurally. The SCPCs model was challenged with cardiotropic viruses and both the viral load and the mx gene expression were measurable along time by qPCR. In summary, SCPCs represent a step forward in <b>salmon</b> cardiac <b>disease</b> research as an in vitro model that partially incorporates the functional complexity of the fish heart...|$|R
