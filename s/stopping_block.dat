40|$|The {{mixing of}} wood-polymer {{composites}} inside an extruder was modelled using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the software Ansys CFX. The {{motions of the}} mixing blocks inside the extruder were modelled using the immersed boundary method, which avoids re-meshing in each time step. Two different models were used; one with a <b>stopping</b> <b>block</b> and one without. The purpose of the <b>stopping</b> <b>block</b> {{is to ensure that}} the flow stays inside the mixing region for a longer time. The flow field was initialized in two different ways; one starting from a steady state-solution, and one starting directly from a specified flow field and specific volume fraction. The results indicate that the <b>stopping</b> <b>block</b> works as intended. The general conclusion is that immersed solids is a promising method, but more work is required.

40|$|A {{series of}} psychophysical lifting studies was {{conducted}} to establish maximum acceptable weights of lift (MAWL) for three supply items commonly handled in underground coal mines (rock dust bags, ventilation stopping blocks, and crib blocks). Each study utilized 12 subjects, {{all of whom had}} considerable experience working in underground coal mines. Effects of lifting in four postures (standing, stooping under a 1. 5 m ceiling, stooping under a 1. 2 m ceiling, and kneeling) were investigated together with four lifting conditions (combinations of lifting symmetry and lifting height). The frequency of lifting was set at 4 per minute, and the task duration was 15 minutes. Posture significantly affected the MAWL for the rock dust bag (standing MAWL was 7 % greater than restricted postures and kneeling MAWL was 6. 4 % less than stooped); however, posture interacted with lifting conditions for both of the other materials. Physiological costs were found to be significantly greater in the stooped postures compared to kneeling for all materials. Other contrasts (standing versus restricted postures, stooping under 1. 5 m ceiling versus stooping under 1. 2 m ceiling) did not exhibit significantly different levels of energy expenditure. Energy expenditure was significantly affected by vertical lifting height; however, the plane of lifting had little influence on metabolic cost. Recommended acceptable workloads for the three materials are 20. 0 kg for the rock dust bag, 16. 5 kg for the ventilation <b>stopping</b> <b>block,</b> and 14. 7 kg for the crib block. These results suggest that miners are often required to lift supplies that are substantially heavier than psychophysically acceptable lifting limits. 1...|$|E

5000|$|The process {{involves}} the mechanical {{disintegration of the}} surrounding country/host rock, typically through fracturing due to pressure increases associated with thermal expansion of the host rock in proximity of the interface with the melt. Once fractures are formed, melt and/or volatiles will typically invade, widening the fracture and promoting the foundering of host rock <b>blocks</b> (i.e. <b>stoped</b> <b>blocks).</b> Once suspended in the melt, <b>stoped</b> <b>blocks</b> may either sink or float depending upon {{the density of the}} block relative to that of the melt.

40|$|As part of {{the search}} for a seismic {{isolator}} for low-rise buildings, this paper proposes a marble-graphite slide seismic isolation system composed of marble-graphite slides, an upper foundation beam, the lower counter{{part of the}} upper beam, and the corresponding <b>stop</b> <b>blocks,</b> with the <b>stop</b> <b>blocks</b> consisting of restrictive screws, positioning plates, nut connectors and stop holes linking the two foundation beams. To provide the desired isolation performance, plain mortar bars can be included at the beam interface to better control the initiating loads for foundation slippage. Tests of low-reversed cyclic loading were performed on four different masonry specimens: a recycled brick wall, a clay brick wall, an integrated recycled brick wall with flay ash blocks sandwiched between, and its clay brick counterpart. The four specimens were provided with marble-graphite slide isolators placed at the foundations. The isolator thickness was 20 mm, and the graphite and the marble served as a lubricant and a bearing, respectively. This paper then analyses all of the specimens in terms of the damage that occurred, the initiating load for slippage, the hysteretic performance, the bearing capacity and the performance of the <b>stop</b> <b>blocks.</b> The results indicate that mortar bars embedded in the marble-graphite slide isolator offer effective control of the initiating load, and the isolation system delivers good hysteretic performance. The <b>stop</b> <b>blocks</b> are capable of withstanding a large-magnitude earthquake and are a good choice for constraining the slippage displacement. Damage or failure of the specimens occurs only when the low-reversed cyclic loading continues after slippage takes place. The design is shown to be an outstanding and flexible seismic scheme for use in low-rise buildings...|$|R
