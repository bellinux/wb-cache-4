500|$|Social critics accuse governments, corporations, and {{the mass}} media of being {{involved}} in the manufacturing of a national consensus and, paradoxically, a culture of fear due to the potential for increased social control that a mistrustful and mutually fearing population might offer to those in power. The worst fear of some conspiracy theorists, however, is that the New World Order will be implemented through the use of mind control—a broad range of tactics able to subvert an individual's control {{of his or her own}} thinking, behavior, emotions, or decisions. These tactics are said to include everything from Manchurian candidate-style brainwashing of sleeper agents (Project MKULTRA, [...] "Project Monarch") to engineering psychological operations (water fluoridation, <b>subliminal</b> <b>advertising,</b> [...] "Silent Sound Spread Spectrum", MEDUSA) and parapsychological operations (Stargate Project) to influence the masses. The concept of wearing a tin foil hat for protection from such threats has become a popular stereotype and term of derision; the phrase serves as a byword for paranoia and is associated with conspiracy theorists.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008 Marlboro {{displayed}} explicit on-car branding on Ferrari for {{the last}} time, then permanently replaced {{with a variety of}} barcodes in place of it. Since then there were calls from leading health officials, the European Commissioner for Health and influential doctors for a review of the <b>subliminal</b> <b>advertising</b> contract Marlboro has with Advertising Guerrilla and Ferrari, due to the implications of influencing the purchase of cigarettes with possible <b>subliminal</b> <b>advertising,</b> as no tobacco products can be promoted in sporting events in Europe by law. [...] The Ferrari team claimed the barcode was part of the car design, not an advertising message.|$|E
50|$|Josie and the Pussycats {{contains}} placements {{in most of}} the shots.

5000|$|In {{the parts}} that the band isn't performing, clips of various people and places are shown. The video begins with a {{distorted}} clip of an older man giving a speech over a classical piano tune. The man is shown behind of a pedestal with a phonograph microphone in front of three banners showing pictures of a grenade, a symbol for war. The image presented can be likened to World War II era videos of Adolf Hitler delivering oppressive speeches {{in front of the}} swaztika, to which the grenade flag itself strikingly resembles. The video progresses to show <b>subliminal</b> imaging of <b>advertising</b> and hate campaigns blaming youth for various things. Later in the video, images of doves are shown to be spray painted over the advertising in a rebellious fashion. The dove is the second part to the Hollywood Undead's symbol, [...] "The Dove and Grenade", with the grenade standing for war and the dove for peace. The video pinnacles when all the images of fan's masks are shown in close up on the wall and fades out to the band ripping them all down and breaking free of the room. The video ends with Johnny 3 Tears forcibly removing the speech giver {{from the beginning of the}} video from his pedestal and he takes his place.|$|R

5000|$|Advertainment {{has been}} {{compared}} to <b>subliminal</b> messaging in <b>advertising.</b> Consumer advocacy groups argue that advertainment is deceptive in part because it can be so subtle that sometimes consumers do not even recognize the fact they have just viewed a commercial. The dangers to consumers are tangible, critics argue, and consumers require added sophistication to address them. [...] "Deceptive marketing harms consumers’ health, welfare and financial resources, reduces people’s privacy and self-esteem, and ultimately undermines trust in society. Individual consumers must try to protect themselves from marketers’ misleading communications by acquiring personal marketplace deception-protection skills that go beyond reliance on legal or regulatory protections," [...] wrote the authors of [...] "Deception In The Marketplace: The Psychology of Deceptive Persuasion and Consumer Self-Protection." [...] Where children are concerned, many parents believe the idea of explicit advertainment is unfair because the target audience is perceived as vulnerable and unable to make informed decisions on their own. Despite this, the FTC has ruled that children are no different than adults in perception, and advertainment in children’s programming does not violate any regulations. Parents have been increasingly vocal about advertainment in children’s movies and programs, arguing that children do not have the understanding that adults do regarding the product that their favorite star is using. A proposed solution is for advertisers or producers of children’s programming to openly state when a show contains embedded advertisement, much like a ratings system. Transparency seems to be the underlying issue regarding both ethical and legal aspects of advertainment; the broadly accepted solution to the ethical dilemma is overwhelmingly disclosure of embedded advertainment to viewers.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{describe}} our entanglement in {{the controversial}} public issue of <b>subliminal</b> messages in <b>advertising</b> and popular music {{in order to}} provide a report of our research unencumbered bythe misrep-resentations in the various media reports of this work. A distinction is drawn between the allegedpresence of these messages in the media concerned and the impact they are purported to have upon the listener or viewer. Our research is concerned primarily with the latter: Is there any evidence to warrant assertions that such messages affect our behavior? Across a wide variety of tasks, we were unable to find any evidence to support such a claim. Secondarily, we present evidence to sug-gest hat the apparent presence of backward messages in popular music is a function more of active construc-tion {{on the part of the}} perceiver than of the existence of the messages themselves. Finally, we describe our experiences with the public media's handling of these issues. In the fall of 1982 we were contacted by a local radio announcer for information about a phenomenon he referred to as "backmasking. " However, his question did not concern the well-studied phenomenon ofvi-sual persistence (see DiLollo, 1980; Sakitt, 1976); the announcer wanted to know what were the effects on a listener of messages that allegedly had been recorded backward into popular ock music. He informed us that when such recordings are played in the normal, forward fashion, the messages are not consciously perceived; however, played backward, intelligible messages can be heard. His concern was not that lis-teners would play their records backward and thereby "hear " the messages but rather that the messages would be perceived unconsciously b the listener when the recording was played forward. He informed us that those who advocated this belief also claimed that the messages had an evil content and that, upon hear-ing them, the youthful listener was led down a path of loose morality and behavioral berration. Depend-ing upon the degree of religious belief held by the proponents ofthese views, the backward messages are, at the least, thought to have been technologically en-gineered by the rock groups themselves or, at the worst, inserted by Satan...|$|R
40|$|When a {{broadcaster}} broadcasts {{directly to}} {{people living in}} another state disputes can arise. The audience may find the programmes offensive. The programmes may foment disorder and rebellion and corrupt the values and traditions of {{the inhabitants of the}} receiving state or even threaten their very survival. The problem is not new. It {{has been a source of}} international tension since the inception of broadcast technology. The problem has however become more pointed as that technology has become ever more sophisticated. The power of radio is aptly illustrated by recalling the panic caused in 1938 by Orson Welles' famous hoax broadcast announcing the invasion of Earth by Martians. More recently commentators such as James Miles, BBC correspondent in Peking at the time, have suggested that the rebellion in China before and after the massacre at Tianamen Square was fomented, prolonged and to a degree coordinated by programmes broadcast on overseas radio stations such as Voice of America and the BBC. Television has a much greater graphic capacity than radio and is also vulnerable to abusive techniques such as <b>subliminal</b> suggestion and <b>advertising.</b> The impact of television is set for another great leap ahead as the development of High Definition Television technology proceeds apace. The development of communications satellites has greatly increased the range and quality of broadcasts. There have been a number of attempts to address this problem but none have met with much success. The international community has polarised into two camps, one taking a position based on a very strict view of the right to freedom of expression, and the other insisting that that right yield to a degree at least to accommodate peoples' rights to determine their own economic, social and cultural development. This paper offers a solution to this impasse. It offers guidelines to help resolve international broadcasting disputes. The guidelines are based on the international human right to freedom of expression as viewed particularly by the two bodies responsible for drafting that right's most famous exposition in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the host of other international and constitutional instruments which it inspired. It is argued that cultural relativity in the human rights context is consistent with the sources of international law specified in article 38 of the statue of the International Court of Justice, and that by incorporating a degree of cultural relativity the guidelines advocated herein are similarly consistent with current international law. It is also shown that the view of human rights the guidelines evince is consistent with a version of constructivist human rights theory which accords with observable practice and which enjoys widespread academic support. Some alternative methods for addressing the problem arising from international broadcasting are examined and their shortcomings identified. This leads to the conclusion that the method proposed in this paper for regulating international broadcasting, notwithstanding that it is most surely within the realm of de lege ferenda, is both consistent with current international law and jurisprudentially defensible, and therefore better than the alternatives...|$|R
