50|$|It was {{not until}} June 1976 that a second F-15 {{training}} squadron was established, with the 4461st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron <b>sanding</b> <b>up</b> on 23 June. The assets of the 4461st TFTS were re-designated as: 461st Tactical Fighter Training Squadron: 1 July 1977. The 550th TFTS traded in its F-4s in August 1977 becoming the third F-15 training squadron. The F-15As, which remained troublesome throughout the 1970s, were replaced in 1982 with the updated F-15D.|$|E
50|$|The {{peninsula}} of Zingst or the Zingst is the easternmost {{part of the}} Fischland-Darß-Zingst peninsula {{that lies}} between the city of Rostock and town of Stralsund on the southern Baltic Sea coast. With a length of just under 20 km and a width of 2 to 4 km the Zingst stretches aways eastwards from the adjacent peninsula of Darß. It is bounded to the north by the Baltic and to the south by the lagoons of Barther Bodden und Grabow, that belong to the Darss-Zingst Bodden Chain. The island of Großer Werder, which once lay off the eastern coast of Zingst, has now become attached as a peninsula {{as a result of}} <b>sanding</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

40|$|Mechanical Anti-erosive Barrier {{increases}} Colonization of Fixed Sand Dune by Plant Species. South-Eastern Niger {{is subject}} to wind erosion. In the region of Gouré, the oasis basins are {{the main source of}} agricultural production and incomes. But these are threatened to disappear because of the phenomenon of <b>sanding</b> <b>up.</b> Many sand dune fixation methods were tested without any substantial results. In this work, a mechanical antierosive barrier, made of Leptadenia pyrotechnica branches, was used to test its effectiveness for soil erosion control and plant restoration. Three years after the implementation of this barrier, the treated areas were colonised by spontaneous vegetation made up of 58 plant species belonging to 20 families including 17 perennials, i. e. 42 additional species more than in the untreated areas. Over the years, the floristic composition has gradually stabilised, reflecting a significant reduction of environmental disturbances caused by wind...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSince 1834 the Seine estuary (France) {{has been}} the site of {{numerous}} construction projects with the aim to accommodate and secure boat traffic. Since 1978, the increasing of the activities of Le Havre port, located {{at the mouth of}} the estuary, has accelerated the construction work rate. Several dykes, a bridge, and new port facilities have been constructed in rapid succession, modifying considerably the hydrodynamic conditions which sustain a partially vegetated sandy–muddy tidal flat located in the North bank of the estuary between the new port of Le Havre and the Normandy bridge achieved in 1995. The present study deals with the morphological evolution of this zone from 1978 to 2005. The use of a low altitude remote sensing technique combined with traditional methods of ground survey and probes allow to demonstrate the impact of human activities on sedimentary and vegetation dynamics. The Northern mudflat of the estuary is the most affected by these human activities, which surface have reduced of 62 % during the last 27 years with an intensified local erosion during the last 27 months corresponding to a loss 1250 000 m 3 of fine-grained sediment. At the same time, the general <b>sanding</b> <b>up</b> in the channel of the zone has caused a loss of more than 31 % of the tidal prism, more than three quarters of which occurred during the last three years. Results also establish that the response times of the sedimentary or topographic readjustment to an installation depend on the extent and the nature of the construction. In fact, the sedimentary readjustments to an installation can be delayed by up to 10 years in the case of the Seine estuary. This delay is explained by a rapid succession of construction works which may occult the effect of a single installation. Except in the case of a dyke built perpendicular to ebb and flood currents, the impacts of these installations reach a hydrosedimentary equilibrium on the level between 1 and 7 years after their completion...|$|E
