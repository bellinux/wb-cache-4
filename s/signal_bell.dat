2500|$|The Gotthardbahn {{employed}} signal bells {{within its}} stations {{and along the}} line to signal any approaching train. An alarm was triggered once a train had left a neighbouring station or block station. These signal bells were partly installed along the line and signalled any construction worker an approaching train. In addition, any railway watchman's house and railroad crossing would be equipped with a <b>signal</b> <b>bell.</b> Southbound trains were signalled by 3 triple chimes, northbound trains by two double chimes. The signalling mechanism at each <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> had to be manually wound up every day by station employees and railway watchmen. Part of the mechanism was a weight having to be raised by help of a pulley. The electric signal triggering the alarm operated a relay, activating the bell's hammer through force of the aforementioned weight. Each <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> within the Gotthard railway's network is marked on the graphic timetable. The railway watchman's house number159 (Casello159) <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> on the Monte Ceneri line between Giubiasco and Rivera-Bironico is shown as an example in the [...] A southbound train departing Giubiasco for Rivera-Bironico would trigger alarms of eleven different signal bells on its 11 kilometres long journey. Around 1980 these signal bells were decommissioned.|$|E
60|$|About {{seven in}} the evening the <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> for landing on the rock was again rung, when every man was at his quarters. In this service it was thought more {{appropriate}} to use the bell than to pipe to quarters, {{as the use of}} this instrument is less known to the mechanic than the sound of the bell. The landing, as in the morning, was at the eastern harbour. During this tide the seaweed was pretty well cleared from the site of the operations, and also from the tracks leading to the different landing-places; for walking upon the rugged surface of the Bell Rock, when covered with seaweed, was found to be extremely difficult and even dangerous. Every hand that could possibly be occupied now employed in assisting the smith to fit up the apparatus for his forge. At 9 p.m. the boats returned to the tender, after other two hours’ work, in the same order as formerly—perhaps as much gratified with the success that attended the work of this day as with any other in the whole course of the operations. Although it could not he said that the fatigues of this day had been great, yet all on board retired early to rest. The sea being calm, and no movement on deck, it was pretty generally remarked in the morning that the bell awakened the greater number on board from their first sleep; and though this observation was not altogether applicable to the writer himself, yet he was not a little pleased to find that thirty people could all at once become so reconciled to a night’s quarters within a few hundred paces of the Bell Rock.|$|E

50|$|Several {{advances}} in the technology of fog signals were made during the 1850s. In 1851, an experimental air fog whistle and reed horn was installed at Beavertail Lighthouse {{at the entrance to}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. At first this sound signal was powered by a horse-operated treadmill and later by an internal combustion steam engine. Around 1851, mechanically rung fog bells were introduced. The striking mechanism was governed by a weight attached to a flywheel, and later internally run by clockworks. The strokes of the fog signals were timed deliberately to afford each signal a unique sound characteristic. The <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> was gradually replaced by three variations of that instrument. The first was an ordinary locomotive whistle, enlarged and modified and blown by steam from a high-pressured tubular boiler. The second was a reed-trumpet, and in 1866 the third variation, a siren-trumpet. Although the fog <b>bell</b> <b>signal</b> was still used for warning vessels over short distances, other fog signals started to supersede the smaller <b>bell</b> <b>signal.</b> <b>Bells</b> were also used on buoys; later whistling buoys were invented by J. M. Courtenay and were first in use in 1876. The first gas-lighted buoy was installed in 1882. The gong buoy was invented in 1923.|$|R

50|$|Soon {{after the}} {{introduction}} of electric power into coal mines, {{it was discovered that}} lethal explosions could be initiated by electrical equipment such as lighting, signals, or motors. The hazard of fire damp or methane accumulation in mines was well known by the time electricity was introduced, along with the danger of suspended coal dust. At least two British mine explosions were attributed to an electric bell signal system. In this system, two bare wires were run along the length of a drift, and any miner desiring to signal the surface would momentarily touch the wires to each other or bridge the wires with a metal tool. The inductance of the <b>signal</b> <b>bell</b> coils, combined with breaking of contacts by exposed metal surfaces, resulted in sparks which could ignite methane, causing an explosion.|$|E

50|$|The {{telegraph}} {{invented by}} Baron Schilling von Canstatt in 1832 had a transmitting device {{which consisted of}} a keyboard with 16 black-and-white keys. These served for switching the electric current. The receiving instrument consisted of six galvanometers with magnetic needles, suspended from silk threads. Both stations of Shilling's telegraph were connected by eight wires; six were connected with the galvanometers, one served for the return current and one - for a <b>signal</b> <b>bell.</b> When at the starting station the operator pressed a key, the corresponding pointer was deflected at the receiving station. Different positions {{of black and white}} flags on different disks gave combinations which corresponded to the letters or numbers. Pavel Shilling subsequently improved its apparatus. He reduced the number of connecting wires from eight to two. On 21 October 1832, Schilling managed a short-distance transmission of signals between two telegraphs in different rooms of his apartment. In 1836 the British government attempted to buy the design but Schilling instead accepted overtures from Nicholas I of Russia. Schilling's telegraph was tested on a 5 km experimental underground and underwater cable, laid around the building of the main Admiralty in Saint Petersburg and was approved for a telegraph between the imperial palace at Peterhof and the naval base at Kronstadt. However, the project was cancelled following Schilling's death in 1837. Schilling {{was also one of the}} first to put into practice the idea of the binary system of signal transmission. In 1833, Carl Friedrich Gauss, together with the physics professor Wilhelm Weber in Göttingen installed a 1200 m wire above the town's roofs. Gauss combined the Poggendorff-Schweigger multiplicator with his magnetometer to build a more sensitive device, the galvanometer. To change the direction of the electric current, he constructed a commutator of his own. As a result, he was able to make the distant needle move in the direction set by the commutator on the other end of the line.|$|E

50|$|The railway block <b>signalling</b> <b>bell</b> code is {{a system}} of bell rings used in Great Britain to {{communicate}} between manually operated Signal Boxes (the system is not used in modern power signal boxes, unless it is a fringe box to an older signalbox). Each signal box would have a bell circuit to the box {{on either side of}} it along the line. The equipment would consist of a plunger or tapper (rather like a Morse key) which if pressed, rings the bell in the neighbouring box. The neighbouring box would have a key for communicating back, therefore each box has a key which rings the bell in the other box. Where a signal box communicates with more than one other box (in either direction along the line, and possibly along a branch line too), each bell would have a different tone, so that the signalman could tell them apart by ear.|$|R
