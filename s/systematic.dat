5|$|The {{highest quality}} {{evidence}} indicates that circumcision does not decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} penis, harm sexual function or reduce sexual satisfaction. A 2013 <b>systematic</b> review found that circumcision did not appear to adversely affect sexual desire, pain with intercourse, premature ejaculation, time until ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or difficulties with orgasm. However, the study found that the existing evidence is not very good. Another 2013 <b>systematic</b> review found that the highest-quality studies reported no adverse effects of circumcision on sexual function, sensitivity, sensation or satisfaction. A 2017 <b>systematic</b> review and meta-analysis found that circumcision did not affect premature ejaculation.|$|E

25|$|The {{conclusions}} of many trials and numerous <b>systematic</b> reviews of acupuncture are largely inconsistent. An overview of Cochrane reviews found that acupuncture is not effective {{for a wide}} range of conditions. A <b>systematic</b> review of <b>systematic</b> reviews found little evidence of acupuncture's effectiveness in treating pain. The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits. Some research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain, though the majority of research suggests that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to the placebo effect. A <b>systematic</b> review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias. A meta-analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was cost-effective as an adjunct to standard care, while a <b>systematic</b> review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.|$|E

25|$|To that point, much of {{the debate}} had been equivocal on the {{decision}} to use naturalistic (e.g., Peano’s Interlingua, Novial and Occidental) or <b>systematic</b> (e.g., Esperanto and Ido) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the <b>systematic</b> languages that thousands of words were already present in many, or even a majority, of the European languages. Their argument was that <b>systematic</b> derivation of words was a Procrustean bed, forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the <b>systematic</b> languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.|$|E

A 2014 <b>systematic</b> review found that while the evidence suggested acupuncture could be an effective treatment for postoperative gastroparesis, a firm conclusion could not be reached because the trials examined were of low quality.|$|E
