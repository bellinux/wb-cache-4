40|$|Selective {{electron}} beam melting (SEBM) is an additive manufacturing method where complex parts are built from metal powders in layers of about 50 [*]μm. SEBM works under vacuum conditions which results in a perfect protection of the metal alloy. The {{electron beam}} is used for heating (about 900 [*]∘C building temperature) and <b>selective</b> <b>melting.</b> The high beam velocities allow innovative scanning strategies in order to adapt the local solidification conditions which determine the epitaxial solidification process of IN 718. We show how scanning strategies can be used either to produce a columnar grain structure with a high texture in building direction or a complete texture-free fine grained structure.

40|$|Continuously rising {{demands on}} {{automotive}} and railway structures require significant weight reductions. Therefore lightweight concepts using metallic hybrid constructions, like steel-aluminum structures, {{are becoming more}} and more interesting. The required efficient joining technologies, especially for deformable hybrid body structures are not sufficiently applicable up to now. Conventional heat based joining techniques, like welding or brazing, mainly fail because of pronounced intermetallic phase formations in conjunction with reduced ductility. Therefore Fraunhofer IWS developed a new laser based joining technology especially for high deformable hybrid car body applications. For the joining of hybrid T-joints a controlled laser remote process has been combined with a novel construction approach, the so-called “web-slot-design”. In essence, a special contour is laser-cut into two separate sheet metal components (aluminum web plate / steel cover sheet). The T-joint assembly is produced by placing the web components through the slots of the cover sheet (creating a form fit). Lastly, a one-sided laser beam welding process is realized. The formation of intermetallic phases can be avoided by a <b>selective</b> <b>melting</b> process (thin metallic bond). This includes a highly controlled laser remote process to perform a <b>selective</b> <b>melting</b> only of the low melting material, in this case aluminum. By optimizing the laser remote process different joint shapes can be realized, that generate a one- or both-sided form fit. The paper presents significant results of process research, mechanical property benefits and experimental crash test results of hybrid demonstrator parts. Hence, the characteristics of this technology might be the key in order to solve existing challenges in automotive but also railway lightweight construction...|$|E

Bulk titanium is the gold standard of metallic implant materials, but does not match the mechanical properties of the surrounding bone, potentially leading to problems of fixation and bone resorption. As an alternative, nickel–titanium alloys possess a unique combination of mechanical properties including a relatively low elastic modulus, pseudoelasticity, and high damping capacity, matching the properties of bone better than any other metallic material.

We find there is no measurable field-induced shift in the ODT temperature ($T_{ODT}$) which suggests that <b>selective</b> <b>melting</b> does not play a role in mesophase alignment during isothermal experiments. Our data indicate instead that sub-ODT alignment occurs by slow, large scale grain rotation whereas alignment during cooling from the disordered melt is rapid and driven by the nucleation of weakly ordered but preferentially aligned material. We identify an optimum sub-cooling that maximizes alignment during isothermal field annealing. This is corroborated by a simple model incorporating the competing effects of an exponentially decreasing mobility and divergent, increasing magnetic anisotropy on cooling below $T_{ODT}$. The absence of measurable field-effects on $T_{ODT}$ is consistent with rough estimates derived from the relative magnitudes of the free energy due to field interaction and the enthalpy of the isotropic-LC transition.

Polypropylene can be melt spun and solid state drawn to give oriented tapes, and moduli of - 15 GPa and tensile strengths of - 550 MPa can be achieved. These tapes can then be oriented into sheets, either in the form of woven fabrics or unidirectional layers. These sheets form the reinforcing phase of a single polymer composite material.

Theoretical method based on beam theory has been proposed for evaluating the behaviors of the commonly used body-centered cubic lattice structures. However, it is difficult to predict theoretically the properties of the uniaxially reinforced lattice structures based on the body-centered cubic structures. Since the reinforced structures have superior strength to weight ratio and are deemed promising in lightweight-design applications, this article proposed a force-method-based theoretical method to calculate the mechanical properties of the body-centered cubic structure and its two types of uniaxially reinforced structures fabricated via <b>selective</b> laser <b>melting.</b> The finite element analysis and compression experiment study of <b>selective</b> laser <b>melting</b> samples made using Ti 6 Al 4 V powders demonstrated the validity of the proposed analytical method...|$|R
