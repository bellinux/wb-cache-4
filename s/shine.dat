5|$|In <b>Shine</b> Runners, {{the player}} must collect <b>Shine</b> Sprites (an object from Super Mario Sunshine). The player can attack other racers {{to take away}} a <b>Shine</b> Sprite from them, and racers with the fewest <b>Shine</b> Sprites are {{eliminated}} from the game over time. In single player, if the human player is eliminated from the round, the game ends {{and the results are}} randomized.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Sunshine shares many similar {{gameplay}} elements {{with its}} predecessor, Super Mario 64, while introducing various new gameplay features. Players control Mario {{as he tries}} to obtain 120 <b>Shine</b> Sprites in order to bring light back to Isle Delfino and prove his innocence after Bowser Jr. (disguised as Mario) steals the <b>Shine</b> Sprites and covers the island in toxic slime. Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Similar to collecting Stars in Super Mario 64, players obtain <b>Shine</b> Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more <b>Shine</b> Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more <b>Shine</b> Sprites in the boathouse in Delfino Plaza.|$|E

5000|$|The third broad {{category}} of <b>Shining</b> games is the [...] "action RPG" [...] set of titles. This incorporates: <b>Shining</b> Wisdom, <b>Shining</b> Soul, <b>Shining</b> Soul II, <b>Shining</b> Force Neo, <b>Shining</b> Tears, <b>Shining</b> Force EXA and <b>Shining</b> Wind. This category {{is essentially a}} dumping ground for any <b>Shining</b> game which does not use turn-based combat; the games it incorporates do not necessarily have any noticeable similarity in gameplay. For instance, while <b>Shining</b> Tears uses similar mechanics to <b>Shining</b> Soul II, it has less in common with <b>Shining</b> Wisdom than it does {{with any of the}} strategy RPG titles of the series.|$|R

5|$|After {{the public}} and press {{interest}} garnered from Echo & the Bunnymen's debut album, Crocodiles, the band released the <b>Shine</b> So Hard EP which maintained their profile. Work then soon began on their second album, Heaven Up Here. Following musical differences between the band and Crocodiles producers Bill Drummond and David Balfe, Hugh Jones {{was brought in to}} produce Heaven Up Here. Jones had previously engineered Crocodiles and co-produced <b>Shine</b> So Hard with Drummond. Jones would later go on to produce the band's 2005 album Siberia. The band were also given an additional producer credit. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales during March 1981.|$|E

50|$|While {{the game}} {{is the first in}} chronological order in the <b>Shining</b> series, it is the second game {{released}} in the series, of which the first game released is <b>Shining</b> in the Darkness. Though <b>Shining</b> Force retained many elements from its predecessor, such as the distinctive menu system, the gameplay is drastically different. <b>Shining</b> in the Darkness is a dungeon crawler in first-person perspective, while <b>Shining</b> Force is a strategy RPG. The <b>Shining</b> series flips between many gameplay styles: returning to first person dungeon crawler for <b>Shining</b> the Holy Ark; adopting Legend of Zelda mechanics for <b>Shining</b> Wisdom; and the <b>Shining</b> Soul games being inspired by Diablo, for instance.|$|R

During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and <b>Shine</b> told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a <b>shine.</b> Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second <b>shine.</b> Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise that sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} vehicle and {{equipment}} camouflage differs from personal camouflage {{in that the}} primary threat is aerial reconnaissance.

50|$|From <b>Shining</b> Soul I onward, {{installments}} of {{the series}} tend to have less significant connections.
