40|$|Single shear {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on nailed timber joints with varying main member thickness, side member thickness and nail length projecting from the main member, and their effects on various shear performances <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints were investigated. Initial stiffness and yield load <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints were almost constant when the ratio of main member thickness to nail diameter (lm/d) was 7 - 14 and 10 - 14, respectively. Maximum load and energy capacity increased as main member thickness was greater and {{showed the highest values}} when lm/d was 13 - 17 and 13 - 15. respectively. Maximum load <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lm/d of 9 was 36 % lower than that <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lm/d of 13 - 17. Energy capacity <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lm/d of 9 was 58 % lower than that <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lm/d of 13 - 15. Regardless <b>of</b> <b>nail</b> length projecting from the main member (lnp), initial stiffness <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lnp was close to that <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints without lnp. When the ratio of the sum of lm and lnp to nail diameter ratio (lr/d) was 10 - 11, maximum load and energy capacity <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lnp were close to those <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints without lnp. When lr/d was 12 - 15, maximum load and energy capacity <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints with lnp were lower than those <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints without lnp. When nailed joints have a member thickness according to the standard for structural design of timber structures edited by Architectural Institute of Japan, initial stiffness and yield load are little affected by member thickness but maximum load and energy capacity are greatly affected by member thickness. 主材と側材の厚さや主材からの釘の突き出し長さが 1 面せん断釘接合部のせん断性能に及ぼす影響を調べた。剛性係数は主材中の釘長さと釘径の比（lm/d）が 7 ～ 14 のとき概ね一定の値を示し、その後lm/dが大きくなるにつれ減少する傾向を示した。降伏荷重はlm/dが大きくなるにつれ増加し、lm/dが 10 ～ 14 のときに一定、その後lm/dが大きくなるにつれ減少する傾向を示した。最大荷重と吸収エネルギーはlm/dが大きくなるにつれ増加し、lm/dが 13 ～ 17 のとき最大荷重が、lm/dが 13 ～ 15 のとき吸収エネルギーが最も大きな値を示した。主材からの釘の突き出し長さにかかわらず剛性係数は概ね一定の値を示した。釘の突き出し長さが長い接合部の最大荷重と吸収エネルギーは突き出していない接合部より低い値となった。日本建築学会の木質構造設計規準・同解説に準じ、主材中の釘長さが釘径の 9 倍以上、側材厚が釘径の 6 倍以上であるとき、釘接合部の剛性係数と降伏荷重には大きな変化は見られないが、最大荷重と吸収エネルギーは部材の厚さによって大きな差が生じた...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Fracture of Tibia is {{the most}} common amongst {{pediatric}} fractures. Most tibial shaft fractures are treated conservatively with close reduction and above knee cast application. Surgery is indicated only when the fracture is unstable, open fracture and associated with multiple injuries. Flexible intramedullary nailing is commonly used for diaphyseal tibial fracture and is also well used in other long bone fracture. The advantages <b>of</b> flexible intramedullary <b>nailing</b> are minimal invasive surgery, short hospital stay and early weight bearing. The objective of this prospective study was to review the functional outcome <b>of</b> flexible intramedullary <b>nailing</b> in pediatric age group. In the study, the union time, weight bearing time and complications associated with flexible intramedullary nailing were observed. There were 18 children with fracture <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> tibia treated at the Department of Orthopedics, Manipal Teaching Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal from April 2014 to March 2015. The protocol consisted in flexible intramedullary <b>nailing</b> <b>of</b> fracture <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> tibia in children. Angulation, shortening and other complications were checked.

30|$|Dynamic tests <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> plywood–timber joints are {{conducted}} under harmonic vibrations from 2 to 7  Hz.

The dynamic response <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> plywood–timber joints is clearly dependent upon both the input frequency and the acceleration. These responsive characteristics {{arise from the}} nonlinear load–slip relationships and the characteristic cyclic stiffness degradation <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints; that is, the cyclic degradation of the equivalent linear stiffness decreases the resonant frequencies of the same joints, which results in a transition of dynamic responses. It indicates that frequency components of seismic waves resonant to the frequencies corresponding to safety-limit stiffness <b>of</b> <b>nailed</b> joints may lead them to critical failures, even if the accelerations do not exceed the accelerations equivalent to the static damage-limit resistance.|$|R
