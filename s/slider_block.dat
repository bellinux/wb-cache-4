The slider crank mechanism is simulated in ADAMS software to observe {{the response of the}} <b>slider</b> <b>block</b> and the reaction forces at joint R 2 (joint between crank shaft and connecting rod). The dynamic analysis has been performed by applying moment of 4. 2 Nm at joint R 1 (the revolute joint between connecting shaft and connecting plate). The applied moment is removed by imposing rotational motion at joint R 1 with angular velocity of 6 rad/sec to perform dynamic analysis. These simulations were performed with different time steps and durations. The friction was assumed to be negligible during these simulations. As a result of this work, the longitudinal response of the <b>slider</b> <b>block</b> is observed with applied moment as well as <b>slider</b> <b>block</b> response along with reaction forces at joint R 2 is investigated in case of imposed rotational motion. presents a multibody dynamics approach that uses a simulation of crank-slider mechanism in ADAMS software [5].

40|$|Landforms and {{earthquakes}} {{appear to}} be extremely complex; yet, there is order in the complexity. Both satisfy fractal statistics {{in a variety of}} ways. A basic question is whether the fractal behavior is due to scale invariance or is the signature of a broadly applicable class of physical processes. Both landscape evolution and regional seismicity {{appear to be}} examples of self-organized critical phenomena. A variety of statistical models have been proposed to model landforms, including diffusion-limited aggregation, self-avoiding percolation, and cellular automata. Many authors have studied the behavior of multiple slider-block models, both in terms of the rupture of a fault to generate an earthquake {{and in terms of the}} interactions between faults associated with regional seismicity.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a pair of}} <b>slider</b> <b>blocks</b> connected {{to each other and}} to a constant velocity driver by springs. Stick-slip behaviour is obtained using static and dynamic coefficients of friction. With any asymmetry, numerical calculations show that this system can exhibit classical chaotic behaviour. We simplify the behaviour of the system by assuming that the two blocks never slide together. One block may trigger the slip of the other, but its slip is delayed until the first block sticks. The orbits in phase space are periodic in the symmetrical case but the orbit the system evolves to depends on the initial conditions. If the friction coefficients of the blocks are different, we can have chaotic behaviour with positive Lyapunov exponents for some parameter values, and periodic or limit cycles orbits for other values. In some cases we have limit cycle orbits for one interval of initial conditions and chaotic behaviour for others. The Poincark map for the model is a piecewise linear function and is strongly dependent on the parameters of the model. The behaviour of the simplified single slip model is quite similar to the original multiple slip model. The advantage of the simplified model is that the solution is algebraic and it can form the basis for a cellular-automata model which is completely deterministic.

The initial state is only incompletely documented and the geodetic data acquired after the mass movement are sparse. A generalized 3 -D topographic model of the landslide and its surrounding area was assembled and a representative longitudinal profile extracted. The reconstruction of the original surface {{is based on an}} orthophoto as well as on morphological considerations. Recorded observations include the locations of the outcrops of basal sliding surfaces, displacements at the main scarp and in {{the lower part of the}} slide, and a value to describe the total mass transport. Such sparse and inhomogeneous data were insufficient to derive a comprehensive documentation of the landslide or obtain adequate constraints for an accurate numerical analysis. Therefore, <b>slider</b> <b>block</b> models were fitted to the field data, which have only a small number of free parameters. A general view on the morphology of the mass movement justifies its classification as a rotational slide. A double <b>slider</b> <b>block</b> model fits all observational parameters within their error margin and supplies valuable information on the geometry of the slide. Estimates of the residual friction angles were derived and the question of reactivation was addressed. Finite Difference (FD) modelling and the application of conventional stability analysis support the geometry of the slider blocks and the computed average residual friction angles. Generally, the results are assumed to represent preliminary information, which could only be attained by the combination of the thinly distributed geodetic data with qualitative morphological observations and the implementation of a model. This type of information can be gained quickly and may be valuable for preliminary hazard mitigation measures or the planning of a comprehensive exploration and monitoring program...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} dynamic {{motions of}} two elastic systems undergoing frictional slip. The {{first one is}} the classical model of the frictional slider loaded through an elastic spring. The second one is an infinite elastic slab bounded by two planes which is in contract with a rigid body and submitted to shearing. Slip weakening and slip rate weakening friction laws are both considered. The two simple systems show very different qualitative behaviors. In {{the case of the}} slip dependent friction a slider moves with a single slip event when a critical stress level is reached. Under the same conditions, a series of slip events occur for the infinite slab. This difference between the behavior of the two systems is due to the important part played by inertia in the mass concentrated <b>block</b> <b>slider</b> model. In the case of slip rate weakening, the analysis of the problem for the infinite slab indicates a major difficulty: this problem has no unique solution if the rate of weakening exceeds a limit that is explicitly given. Whatever is the selection rule chosen to discriminate the solution, shocks will occur. The slip history obtained for the slab {{is very different from the}} one obtained with a <b>block</b> <b>slider.</b> For the infinite elastic slab the slip velocity exhibits sharp variations (shocks).

40|$|We {{investigate}} the chaotic behaviour of slip pulses that propagate in a spring <b>block</b> <b>slider</b> model with velocity weakening friction by numerically solving a computationally intensive set of n coupled non-linear equations, where n {{is the number}} of blocks. We observe that the system evolves into a spatially heterogeneous pre-stress after the occurrence of a sufficient number of events.

This observation allows us to write an energy balance equation that describes the evolution of the pulse as it propagates through the known pre-stress. The equation predicts the evolution of individual ruptures and reduces the computational time dramatically. The long-time solution of the equation reveals its multiscale nature and its potential to match many of the long-time statistics of the original system, but with a much shorter computational time...|$|R

We obtain results indicating that this model displays several additional kinds of phenomena seen in real earthquake faults, even though "realistic" physics is missing from the model. Asperity-like slip distributions in this model arise from strong elastic coupling, rather than the spatially heterogeneous frictional strength often inferred for real faults. Simulation results indicate that "characteristic" earthquakes can be produced {{as a consequence of the}} nonlinear dynamics. Thus segmentation on faults may be a result of the nonlinear dynamics as well as being due to geometric properties of fault systems. These conclusions may be modified when more "realistic" physics is added to the model, although the presence of dynamical effects in the toy model calculations similar to those observed in nature demonstrates alternative possibilities for the origin of these effects...|$|E

40|$|When the {{frictional}} {{strength of}} a fault zone is met, displacement occurs within the fault zone. Displacement can occur at a seismogenic or aseismic velocity. Seismogenic events cause devastating earthquakes while aseismic activity {{is the result of}} low velocity slip events. These slow slip events are thought to be from over pressured pore pressures present in the fault zone. This work investigates the effect of pore fluid flow within fault gouge during an earthquake by using a grain scale numerical model. Fault gouge is simulated using a Discrete Element Model (DEM) that is coupled with grain motion to generate pressures from fluid flow. We compare the evolution of an earthquake using numerical simulations that began with identical granular arrangements run with a high permeability (drained) and a low permeability (undrained). Drained simulations are defined as those where fluid can flow freely enough such that the slip event is not affected by it. Undrained simulations are those in which pore fluid pressure cannot flow, and the strength of the system is severely affected by pressure perturbations. Type I events the undrained system reached a lower static strength while Type II events are those where the undrained system achieved a higher static strength. Local granular rearrangements are responsible for the strengthening or weakening of the undrained events. The slip velocities during a simulated earthquake in a drained system are well modeled by the <b>block</b> <b>slider</b> model with a constant coefficient of dynamic friction. However, a number of undrained earthquakes showed complex slip characteristics including abrupt changes in velocity and a variable dynamic resistance. These slip events resemble creep-like and tremor-like behavior seen in natural subduction zones and caused by pressure perturbations within the gouge zone. We find fluid pressure perturbations can weaken the static strength of undrained systems, but not always. This shows reductions in pressures play the dominant role in controlling the {{strength of a}} system. In addition, the dynamic resistance of complex events is primarily controlled by fluid flow, and not a variable coefficient of dynamic friction...|$|R

Deviations from n≈ - 1 arise from second order effects on strength, with n 3 ̆e - 1 corresponding to apparent time-dependent strengthening and n 3 ̆c - 1 corresponding to weakening. Simulations with rate and state-variable equations show that dynamic shear stress drop Δ τd scales with recurrence as dΔτd/dlntr ≤ σe(b-a), where σe is the effective normal stress, μ=τ/σe, and (a-b) =dμ 38 /dlnV is the steady-state slip rate dependence of strength. In addition, accounting for seismic energy radiation, we suggest that the static shear stress drop Δτs scales as dΔτs/dlntr ≤σe(1 + ∫) (b-a), where ∫ is the fractional overshoot. The variation of Δτs with lntr for earthquake stress drops is somewhat larger than implied by room temperature laboratory values of ∫ and b-a.

40|$|Seismic {{inversion}} and computational {{models have}} shown that earthquake ruptures may propagate {{in one of two}} basic modes; the cracklike mode and the slip pulse mode. In this work we use analytical and numerical techniques to study the dynamics and implications of pulselike ruptures propagating on strong velocity-weakening frictional interfaces using both discrete and continuum models of fracture. Results of the study of the discrete spring <b>block</b> <b>slider</b> model suggest that strong velocity-weakening friction might yield to the propagation of unsteady slip pulses and chaotic dynamics. The prestress in most of these systems evolves into very heterogeneous spatial distributions characterized, in general, by non-Gaussian statistics and power-law spectral properties. It is also shown that the combined effect of slip pulse propagation and strong velocity-weakening friction could yield to size effects in strength with the strength decreasing as a power law with increasing rupture length. By examining the energy budget of slip pulses in the discrete model, we show {{that it is possible to}} derive a nonlinear differential equation that could predict the final slip distribution in an event, given the prestress existing before that event and some information about friction and pulse dynamics. The equation is successful in replicating many of the macroscopic slip features, including the slip distribution and total rupture length, can also match many long-time statistics regarding the prestress evolution and the event size distribution. Results from the continuum study suggest that the absence of steady pulses in previous studies could be attributed to the details of the nucleation procedure. We show that steady pulses could exist on strong velocity-weakening friction and uniform prestress if both the prestress and nucleation procedures are correctly tuned. We find that steady pulses are unstable to perturbations in the form of a step in the prestress and could arrest quickly in regions of low prestress. Steady pulses are also found to adapt well to local fluctuations in the prestress, leading to heterogeneous slip distributions. This result might have important implications for the problem of slip complexity in real earthquakes. ...|$|R

Our investigations are restricted to regimes of pressure and roughness where only elastic deformations occur between asperities at the contact surface between the <b>slider</b> <b>block</b> and the substrate. In this regime, solid friction is due to the generation of vibrational radiations which are subsequently damped out. We study periodic commensurate and incommensurate asperities and various types of disordered surfaces. We report the evidence of a transition from zero (or non-measurable μ < 0. 001) friction to a finite friction as the normal pressure increases above about 10 ^ 6 Pa. For larger normal pressures (up to 10 ^ 9 Pa), we find a remarkably universal value for the friction coefficient μ≈ 0. 06, which is independent of the internal dissipation strength over three order of magnitudes, and independent of the detailled nature of the slider block-substrate interactions. We find that disorder may either decrease or increase μ due to the competition between two effects: disorder detunes the coherent vibrations of the asperties that occur in the periodic case, leading to weaker acoustic radiation and thus weaker damping. On the other hand, large disorder leads to stronger vibration amplitudes at local asperities and thus stronger damping. Our simulations have confirmed the existence of jumps over steps or asperities of the slider blocks occurring at the largest velocities studied (10 m/s). These jumps lead to chaotic motions similar to the bouncing-ball problem. We find a velocity strengthening with a doubling of the friction coefficient as the velocity increases from 1 m/s to 10 m/s.

Depending on the model parameters and on the initial stress, the fault exhibits aftershocks, slow earthquakes, or decaying afterslip. We found several regimes with slip rate decaying as a power law of time, with different characteristic times and exponents. The behavior of the rate-state friction law is thus far more complex than described by the “steady state” approximation frequently used to fit afterslip data. The fault reaches steady state only at very large times, when slip rate has decreased to the tectonic loading rate. The complexity of the model makes it unrealistic to invert for the friction law parameters from afterslip data. We modeled afterslip measurements for three earthquakes using the complete rate-and-state law and found a huge variety of model parameters that can fit the data. In particular, {{it is impossible to}} distinguish the stable velocity-strengthening regime (A > B) from the (potentially) unstable velocity-weakening regime (A < B). Therefore, {{it is not necessary to}} involve small-scale spatial or temporal fluctuations of friction parameters A or B in order to explain the transition between stable sliding and seismic slip. In addition to B/A and stiffness, the fault behavior is strongly controlled by stress levels following an event. Stress heterogeneity can thus explain part of the variety of postseismic behaviors observed in nature. Afterslip induces a progressive reloading of faults that are not slipping, which can trigger aftershocks. Using the relation between stress and seismicity derived from the rate-and-state friction law, we estimate the aftershock rate triggered by coseismic and postseismic slip. Aftershock rate does not simply scale with stress rate but exhibits different characteristic times and sometimes a different power law exponent. Afterslip is thus a possible candidate to explain observations of aftershock rate decaying as a power law of time with an Omori exponent that can be either smaller or larger than 1. Progressive unloading due to afterslip can also produce delayed seismic quiescence...|$|E
40|$|Tsunamis are {{generated}} by displacement or motion of {{large volumes of}} water. While there are several documented cases of tsunami generation by volcanic eruptions and landslides, most observed tsunamis are attributed to earthquakes. Kinematic models of tsunami generation by earthquakes — where specified fault size and slip determine seafloor and sea-surface vertical motion — quantitatively explain far-field tsunami wave records. On the other hand, submarine landslides in subduction zones and other tectonic settings can generate large tsunamis that are hazardous along near-source coasts. Furthermore, the ongoing exploration of the oceans has found evidence for large paleo-landslides in many places, not just subduction zones. Thus, {{we want to know}} the relative contribution of faulting and landslides to tsunami generation. For earthquakes, {{only a small fraction of}} the minimum earthquake energy (less than 1 % for typical parameter choices for shallow underthrusting earthquakes) can be converted into tsunami wave energy; yet, this is enough energy to generate terrible tsunamis. For submarine landslides, tsunami wave generation and landslide motion interact in a dynamic coupling. The dynamic problem of a 2 -D translational <b>slider</b> <b>block</b> on a constant-angle slope can be solved using a Green's function approach for the wave transients. The key result is that the largest waves {{are generated}} when the ratio of initial water depth above the block to downslope vertical drop of the block H 0 /W sin δ is less than 1. The conversion factor of gravitational energy into tsunami wave energy varies from 0 % for a slow-velocity slide in deep water, to about 50 % for a fast-velocity slide in shallow water and a motion abruptly truncated. To compare maximum tsunami wave amplitudes in the source region, great earthquakes produce amplitudes of a few meters at a wavelength fixed by the fault width of 100 km or so. For submarine landslides, tsunami wave heights — as measured by b, block height — are small for most of the parameter regime. However, for low initial dynamic friction and values of H 0 /W sin δ less than 1, tsunami wave heights in the downslope and upslope directions reach b and b / 4, respectively. Wavelengths of these large waves scale with block width. For significant submarine slides, the value of b can range from meters up to the kilometer scale. Thus, the extreme case of efficient tsunami generation by landslides produces dramatic hazards scenarios...|$|E
40|$|In {{both our}} past {{work and the}} work in {{progress}} we focused on understanding the physics and statistical patterns in earthquake faults and fault systems. Our approach had three key aspects. The first was to look for patterns of seismic activity in earthquake fault systems. The second {{was to understand the}} physics of a sequence of models for faults and fault systems that are increasingly more realistic. The third key element was to connect the two previous approaches by investigating specific properties found in models to see if they are indeed properties of real faults. A specific example of how this approach works {{can be seen in the}} following: In the papers discussed below, we demonstrated that the cellular automation (CA) versions of the <b>slider</b> <b>block</b> models with long range stress transfer are ergodic and could be described by a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution in the meanfield limit. The ergodicity follows from the fact that the long range stress transfer makes the model meanfield. The meanfield nature of the CA models, generated by long range stress transfer, also allows a description of the CA models by a Langevin equation. The Langevin equation indicates that evolution of seismicity in the model over relatively short times is linear in time. This appears to be consistent with the success of a forecasting algorithm we have developed that is based on a linear evolution of seismicity patterns. This algorithm has had considerable success in that the regions of the Southern California fault system which have been predicted to have a higher probability of an event greater than magnitude 5 have consistently been the sites where such events occur. These two results have led to the question as to whether the Southern California fault system is ergodic and can be described by a Langevin equation like the model. To answer this question we ran a series of tests for ergodicity very much like the ones run on the models. Our results, which have been accepted for publication in Physical Review Letters (Tiampo et al., in press), demonstrate that the Southern California system is ergodic in the same way that is seen in the models. These results will be discussed in more detail below. However, the point that needs to be emphasized is that it was the combination of model investigation via theory and simulation coupled with assimilation and classification of real data and applying the methods of statistical mechanics to real fault systems that led to both a successful forecasting algorithm and a deeper understanding of the nature of earthquake fault systems. This paper describes in some detail the results obtained in the previous funding period. We present these in three groups. (A) Investigation of statistical physics models and applications. (B) Earthquake fault systems and Greens functions for complex sources and (C) Space time patterns, data analysis and forecasting...|$|E
40|$|The Dynamic Interaction Simulation of Controls and Structure (DISCOS) {{program was}} {{developed}} for the dynamic simulation and stability analysis of passive and actively controlled spacecraft. In the use of DISCOS, the physical system undergoing analysis may be generally described as a cluster of contiguous flexible structures (bodies) that comprise a mechanical system, such as a spacecraft. The entire system (spacecraft) or portions thereof may be either spinning or nonspinning. Member bodies of the system may undergo large relative excursions, {{such as those of}} appendage deployment or rotor/ stator motion. The general system of bodies is, by its inherent nature, a feedback system in which inertial forces (such as those due to centrifugal and Coriolis acceleration) and the restoring and damping forces are motion-dependent. The system may possess a control system in which certain position and rate errors are actively controlled through the use of reaction control jets, servomotors, or momentum wheels. Bodies of the system may be interconnected by linear or nonlinear springs and dampers, by a gimbal and <b>slider</b> <b>block</b> mechanism, or by any combination of these. The DISCOS program can be used to obtain nonlinear and linearized time response of the system, interaction constant forces in the system, total system resonance properties, and frequency domain response and stability information for the system. DISCOS is probably the most powerful computational tool to date for the computer simulation of actively controlled coupled multi-flexible-body systems. The program is not easy to understand and effectively apply, but is not intended for simple problems. The DISCOS user is expected to have extensive working knowledge of rigid-body and flexible-body dynamics, finite-element techniques, numerical methods, and frequency-domain analysis. Various applications of DISCOS include simulation of the Shuttle payload deployment/retrieval mechanism, solar panel array deployment, antenna deployment, analysis of multispin satellites, and analysis of large, highly flexible satellites, including the design of attitude-control systems. The overall approach of DISCOS is unique in that any member body of the system may be flexible, and the system is not restricted to a topological tree configuration. The equations of motion are developed using the most general form of Lagrange's equations, including auxiliary nonholonomic rehenomic conditions of constraint. Lagrange multipliers are used as interaction forces/ torques to maintain prescribed constraints. Nonlinear flexible/rigid dynamic coupling effects are accounted for in unabridged fashion for individual bodies and for the total system. Elastic deformation can be represented by normal vibration modes or by any adequate series of Rayleigh functions, including 'quasi-static' displacement functions. To 'solve' Lagrange's equations of motion, the explicit form of the kinetic and potential energy functions, the dissipation function, and the form of the transformation relating ordinary Cartesian position coordinates to the generalized coordinates must be defined. The potential energy and dissipation functions for a structure are determined with standard finite-element techniques by the NASTRAN program. In order to use the computed functions, the Lagrange's equations and the system kinematic constraint equations are expressed in matrix format. These differential matrix equations are solved numerically by the DISCOS program. Provisions are included for environmental loading of the structure (spacecraft), including solar pressure, gravity gradient, and aerodynamic drag. Input to DISCOS includes topological and geometrical descriptions of the structure under analysis, initial conditions, control system descriptions, and NASTRAN-derived structural matrices. Specialized routines are supplied that read the input data and redimension the DISCOS programs to minimize core requirements. Output includes an extensive list of calculated parameters for each body of the structure, system state vector and its time derivatives, euler angles and position coordinates and their time derivatives, control system variables and their time derivatives, and various system parameters at a given simulation time. For linearized system analysis, output includes the various transfer matrices, eigenvectors, and calculated eigenvalues. The DISCOS program is available by license for a period of ten (10) years to approved licensees. The licensed program product delivered includes the source code and supporting documentation. Additional documentation may be purchased separately at any time. The IBM version of DISCOS is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on an IBM 360 series computer under OS with a central memory requirement of approximately 1, 100 K of 8 bit bytes. The DEC VAX version of DISCOS is written in FORTRAN for batch execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer under VMS. For plotted output a SC 4020 plotting system is required. DISCOS was developed on the IBM in 1978 and was adapted (with enhancements) to the DEC VAX in 1982...|$|E
