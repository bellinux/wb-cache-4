40|$|There are {{two views}} {{concerning}} {{the mountains of}} Snowdonia and their role during former glaciations of Britain.

In this paper striation directions are used to test the two hypotheses. The striation pattern reflects ice flow radiating from the general vicinity of Snowdon summit and the strong eastward component of flow contradicts the idea that the Welsh ice sheet overran the area. Since the striation directions are conformable with large landforms of glacial erosion, it is reasonable to suggest that Snowdonia maintained an independent ice centre during much of the last glaciation...|$|E
40|$|The Island of Montserrat lies {{towards the}} {{northern}} end of the Lesser Antilles. It is made up of the products of five major and three smaller, parasitic volcanic centres. The four oldest volcanoes occur in the northern half of the island. Products of these volcanoes include andesitic lavas and pyroclastics but {{there is a lack of}} unreworked fragmental deposits and primary volcanic structures so that it is difficult to reconstruct the volcanic history of these centres. It appears however that the Harris-Bugby Centre, where a two-pyroxene andesite lava gave a K-Ar of 4. 1 m. y. is the oldest volcano on Montserrat. Silver Hill where a late-stage (?) lava has a K-Ar age of 1. 5 m. y. is older than the Centre Hills and Carabald Hill should probably be regarded as a parasitic centre of the Centre Hills in view of the similarity of the products and state of erosion of the two volcanoes. The oldest volcano in the south of Montserrat is South Soufriere Hill, where eruptions may have begun as much as 1. 6 m. y. ago. The products of this volcano include basaltic lava flows and a well-exposed sequence of andesitic and basaltic pyroclast falls, known as the White River Pyroclast Fall Series. Ultrabasic cumulate blocks occur within an andesite block fall of the White River Pyroclast Fall Series. It is thought that the lava flows and pyroclast falls built up a cone-shaped strato-volcano with a large central crater. Late in the history of Smith Soufriere Hill two basic domes were extruded within the crater and their extrusion destroyed most of the crater wall and much of the eastern flank of the strato-volcano. The intrusion at Roche's of a body of basic two-pyroxene andesite of similar composition to the domes at South Soufriere Hill may also have occurred about this time. Among deposits disturbed by this intrusion are a group of tuffaceous limestones which on palaeontological grounds are thought to be about 40, 000 yrs. old. Because of the compositional similarity of the Roche's Intrusion and the South Soufriere Hill domes and because the intrusion has affected deposits which are similar to South Soufriere Hill pyroclast falls the Roche's Centre is probably a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>centre</b> of South Soufriere Hill. The earliest events at the Soufriere Hills included the extrusion of of two-pyroxene andesite and associated pyroclast flow eruptions. These were followed by the extrusion of at least two domes of hornblende-hypersthene andesite and charcoal from a pyroclast flow believed to have been associated with one of these domes gave an age of 23, 568 andplusmn; 786 yrs. St. George's Hill which erupted large quantities of hornblende-hypersthene andesite pumice falls may have been active as a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>centre</b> on the north west flank of the Soufriere Hills about this time. Sometime after the extrusion of the hornblende-hypersthene andesite domes violent pumice flow eruptions gave rise to the formation of English's Crater. Charcoal from one of the pumice flows has given an age of 18, 390 andplusmn; 360 yrs. Late stage events at the Soufriere Hills include the extrusion of the Castle Peak hornblende-hypersthene andesite dome within the crater and this may be related to the breaching of the east wall of the crater. Minor eruptions of pyroclast flows and pyroclast falls have occurred since the formation of Castle Peak and charcoal from the most recent of these has been dated at A. D. 1646 ± 54 yrs. Although there have been no recorded eruptions at the Soufriere Hills solfataric activity has been continuous in historic time and three periods of unusually intense seismic and solfataric activity have occurred within the last 70 years. An estimate of the relative volumes of rock types on Montserrat shows that andesite (96. 5 %) greatly predominates over basalt (3. 3 %) and dacite (0. 2 %). Basalts occur only at South Soufriere Hill where they account for about 35 % of the total volume. South Soufriere Hill with its ultrabasic cumulates, basalts, basaltic andesites and andesites resembles Mt. Misery, St. Kitts or the Soufriere, St. Vincent. The other Montserratian volcanoes and most volcanoes in the Lesser Antilles have erupted nothing but andesite. The Montserrat basalts and andesites have many petrographical features in common with other calc-alkaline lavas. Plagioclase which is the most abundant phenocryst mineral has highly calcic cores (~An 85) which may reflect initial crystallisation under high water vapour pressures. Olivine (~Fo 75) was apparently the first phenocryst to form in the basalts. There is some evidence of a reaction relation between u and liquid to produce hypersthene but olivine is more often surrounded by clinopyroxene coronas than by hypersthene rims. Magnetite which is more abundant in the basalts than the andesites may also have been an early phase to separate. Pyroxene phenocrysts in the basalts and andesites show complex interrelationships. There is, however, no evidence to suggest a reaction relationship between augite and liquid to give hypersthene. Instead clinopyroxene probably reacts with liquid to give hornblende, which will account for the antipathetic relationship between these minerals in the Montserrat lavas. Microphenocrysts in the lavas have different compositions and properties to the phenocrysts and are believed to have crystallised at higher levels in the crust probably close to the surface. Phenocrysts which initially formed deeper in the crust may undergo additional crystallisation at this stage. A notable feature of the groundmasses of the Montserrat lavas is the abundance of tridymite and cristobalite, which appear to have crystallised at a very late stage, perhaps from fluids tripped in lavas at the time of their eruption. A few lavas contain quartz rich mica-bearing aggregates which have a similar mode of occurrence to tridymite and cristobalite in the other rocks. The mica is probably phlogopite. Disequilibrium petrographic features are common in the Montserrat lavas. Lowering of water vapour pressure may account for the resorption of quartz, hornblende and calcic plagioclase at shallow depths. Oscillatory zoning in plagioclase might reflect small fluctuations in water vapour pressure but is probably best explained in terms of a diffusion-supersaturation theory. Four groups of xenoliths were recognised on Montserrat. Ultrabasic cumulates composed of unzoned crystals of sodic anorthite (~An 90), aluminous amphibole, olivine (~Fo 75) and magnetite occur within andesitic pyroclastics of the White River Pyroclast Fall Series. They have probably formed by the crystallisation of basaltic magma under high water vapour pressures at depths of ? 6 andndash; 8 km. Rare doleritic blocks also occur in andesitic horizons of the White River Pyroclast Fall Series. Cognate xenoliths of basaltic composition are found in andesitic lavas and represent accumulations of minerals which occur as microphenocrysts in the host rock together with a few "older" phenocrysts. Metasedimentary and metavolcanic blocks were also found on Montserrat. Forty-five new major element analyses together with new determinations of 13 trace elements in 13 rocks and Sr 87 / 86 ratios in 7 rocks are presented along with some older analytical data. These data suggest that the Montserrat lavas form a closely related series of rocks. The rocks of South Soufriere Hill however, differ from those of the other Montserratian volcanoes in that their SiO 2 range is larger and the South Soufriere Hill andesites are slightly depleted in total iron, MgO, TiO 2 and V and slightly enriched in Na 2 O and Al 2 O 3 relative to andesites from the other volcanoes. Petrochemically, the Montserrat lavas resemble those from most of the other islands in the Lesser Antilles, especially St. Kitts. However they have less K 2 O, Rb, Ba and Cr and more Na 2 O, V, Co and Cu than lavas from St. Lucia and lower Sr 87 / 86 ratios and smaller amounts of radiogenic lead than lavas from St. Lucia and Dominica. The Montserrat lavas also bear an overall chemical resemblance to lavas from other calc-alkaline suites but they are somewhat depleted in TiO 2, Rb, Sr, Ba, Ni and Cr and enriched in Al 2 O 3 and CaO compared with most calc-alkaline lavas especially those from continental areas. Basalts from Montserrat contain slightly more K 2 O than most high alumina basalts but the Montserrat andesites are considerably depleted in K 2 O relative to most andesites. The fundamental process in the petrogenesis of the Montserrat lavas is believed to involve the partial melting of oceanic tholeiite, or its metamorphosed equivalent along the Benioff Zone beneath the Lesser Antilles. Oceanic tholeiite is a suitable parent for the Montserrat and the Lesser Antillean lavas in terms of composition and availability. The only difficulty is that the Lesser Antillean lavas, particularly those from St. Lucia and Dominica are so enriched in the large and highly charged cation elements and radiogenic nuclides compared with oceanic tholeiite that an extra source for these appears to be required. Relatively small amounts of alkali basalt, oceanic sediment and detritus from South America or the Lesser Antilles may be carried into the upper mantle and melted with the oceanic tholeiite and these are possible sources of the "missing" elements and also of water. The composition of the magmas resulting from the melting of material along the Benioff Zone will vary depending on the physical conditions. Low temperatures and hydrous conditions will favour the production of andesitic liquids whereas dry melting and high temperatures will tend to produce basaltic liquids. As the arc evolves the tendency is probably towards wetter melting conditions as more material from the arc or more oceanic sediment does down the Benioff Zone. As the magmas generated along the Benioff Zone ascend to the surface they may be modified by a number of secondary processes. These include fractional crystallisation, wallrock reaction, assimilation and gas transfer. There is evidence in the Lesser Antillean rocks for at least two periods of fractional crystallisation. One of these occurs near the surface, at low pressures and probably has little fundamental petrogenetic effect. The other, which occurs deeper in the crust (? 6 andndash; 8 km.) involves the separation of sub-silicic aggregates from basaltic magma and is probably instrumental in producing andesites at certain volcanoes in the Lesser Antilles, like South Soufriere Hill, Montserrat and Soufriere, St. Vincent. The relative importance of the other "secondary" processes is rather difficult to assess. Wall rock reaction does not appear to be very important within the mantle but may occur within the crust. Gas transfer is likely to be quite important especially in water rich magmas and may be in some measure responsible for the erratic behaviour of certain elements notably K 2 O in the Lesser Antillean lavas. The compositional variation within the Lesser Antilles may to some extent reflect differences in the relative importance of different "secondary" petrogenetic processes at different places. The restriction of chemically "evolved" lavas to the islands of St. Lucia, Dominica. and ?Martinique in the central portion of the arc may, however reflect the fact that these islands are the oldest in the Lesser Antilles although their position relative to the direction of underthrusting of oceanic crust might also be important. </p...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{presented}} is {{that current}} trends in shopping habits within affluent urbanised societies are well enough defined to significantly guide planners {{in the selection}} of optimum locations and designs for planned service centres within metropolitan areas. Changing shopping habits and changes in the retail industry are closely inter-related. This cyclic relationship between the consumer and the retailer is further actuated by changes within the metropolitan system and by the prevailing economic situation. An appreciation of these factors may allow the optimum location and form of service centres, at any one time, to be identified. Whilst long term forecasting should be avoided, it is possible to show that through a study of metropolitan areas and their major <b>subsidiary</b> <b>centres,</b> the apparent trends in consumer behaviour and the action of the retailer, it is feasible to discuss the emerging pattern of service centres within metropolitan areas with some confidence. The research supporting the writer's thesis includes a detailed critical appraisal of trends, over the last twenty years or so, in both consumer behaviour and the retail industry. A longitudinal series of surveys undertaken by the writer supplies further evidence of the changing shopping habits of consumers in part of a large metropolitan area. These surveys, the methodology of which is fully explained, also indicate the impact of a planned regional shopping centre within a metropolitan area. In discussing trends in the design of service centres certain aspects of the physical environment at selected centres are critically examined, and some general comparisons made by the use of abstracted plans drawn at the same scale and by photographs. The attractiveness" of a shopping centre to consumers may depend in part on the environmental amenity of the centre. It is suggested that this notion should be explored further by future research...|$|R

50|$|Koh-i-Sultan is a {{volcanic}} complex {{with at least}} three cones, named Kansuri, Abu and Miri after their respective summits. Each has a central crater—the largest of which is over 5 km wide—which have been heavily affected by erosion. The summit of Koh-i-Sultan is 7656 ft high. and the 2333 m-high Miri is considered the youngest cone. Its crater is nested; the outer crater has a diameter of 6.5 km and the inner crater, formed by resurgent activity, has a diameter of 800 m. Miri's summit, south of the crater, {{is surrounded by a}} zone of altered rock. <b>Subsidiary</b> volcanic <b>centres</b> also exist in the form of volcanic plugs and satellite cones; those around Miri are named Bag Koh, Batal Koh, Chhota Dalil, Dam Koh, Koh-e-Dalil, Koh-e-Malik and Mit Koh. The volcanic pile covers an area of 500 to 770 km2, and the volcanic complex has an area of 17 x 10 mi running west-northwest. Although Koh-i-Sultan is considered dormant or extinct, ongoing fumarolic activity has been recorded.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} governance process development on engagements between onshore and offshore subsidiaries of multinational IT services organisations. Offshoring is a significant global phenomenon. Over the last decade, there has been substantial {{growth in the number}} of organisations setting up ‘captive’ (wholly owned <b>subsidiaries)</b> <b>centres</b> in offshore locations. The desired benefits of greater coordination, leveraging and sharing of knowledge have, in many instances, failed to materialise for these IT services organisations. These failures arise from a variety of causes including a lack of intra-organisational processes to coordinate and manage work, weak alignment between the parent organisation’s strategic objectives and those of the subsidiary, and the inability to navigate cross-organisational and cultural barriers. This thesis comprises three interrelated projects. The first established that organisations develop offshore subsidiaries in order to obtain one or more of a number of complex and interrelated set of strategic objectives. The second project, through the use of grounded theory, demonstrates that within one IT services organisation, imposed governance processes do not facilitate communication and engagement between the onshore and offshore subsidiaries. Cross-cultural and organisational differences inhibited the engagement between the subsidiaries, thus contributing to the failure to achieve the desired benefits of offshoring. Organisations engaged in captive offshoring are faced with two apparently contradictory sets of issues: a set of highly desirable and interrelated strategic benefits and a variety of operational challenges that arise from the imposed nature of the governance processes. The third project, a case study of a similar IT services organisation, examines how these apparently contradictory issues were resolved. The results show that it is the co-development and implementation of governance processes based on the informal working practices of both the onshore and offshore teams that enable the operational challenges established in the second project to be resolved and thus provide reconciliation between these and the achievement of the strategic benefits that drive offshoring. This thesis concludes that co-developed and implemented governance processes are a key factor in the mitigation of the deleterious effects of cross-organizational and cultural working and adds the notion of co-development and implementation of governance processes to the academic literature on the governance of outsourcing...|$|R
