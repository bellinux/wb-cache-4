50|$|In a {{delay line}} {{detector}} the electrons are accelerated to 500 eV between {{the back of}} the last MCP and a grid. Then they fly for 5 mm and are dispersed over an area of 2 mm. A grid follows. Each element has a diameter of 1 mm and consists of an electrostatic lens focusing arriving electrons through a 30 µm hole of a grounded <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium.</b> Behind that a cylinder of the same size follows. The electron cloud induces a 300 ps negative pulse when entering the cylinder and a positive when leaving. After that another sheet, a second cylinder follows, and a last sheet follows. Effectively the cylinders are fused into the center-conductor of a stripline. The sheets minimize cross talk between the layers and adjacent lines in the same layer, which would lead to signal dispersion and ringing. These striplines meander across the anode to connect all cylinders, to offer each cylinder 50 Ω impedance, and to generate a position dependent delay. Because the turns in the stripline adversely affect the signal quality their number is limited and for higher resolutions multiple independent striplines are needed. At both ends the meanders are connected to detector electronics. These electronics convert the measured delays into X- (first layer) and Y-coordinates (second layer). Sometimes a hexagonal grid and 3 coordinates are used. This redundancy reduces the dead space-time by reducing the maximum travel distance and thus the maximum delay, allowing for faster measurements. The microchannel plate detector must not operate over around 60 degree Celsius, otherwise it will degrade rapidly, bakeout without voltage has no influence.|$|E

5000|$|Thin <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> are {{not very}} {{effective}} at attenuating low-frequency magnetic fields. The shielding effectiveness is dependent upon the skin depth.

40|$|Applicability of the {{vibration}} correlation technique (VCT) for nondestructive {{evaluation of the}} axial buckling load is considered. Thin-walled cylindrical shells with and without circular cutouts have been produced by adhesive overlap bonding from a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloy. Both mid-surface and bond-line imperfections of initial shell geometry have been characterized by a laser scanner. Vibration response of shells under axial compression has been monitored to experimentally determine the variation of the first eigenfrequency {{as a function of}} applied load. It is demonstrated that VCT provides reliable estimate of buckling load when structure has been loaded up to at least 60 % of the critical load. This applies to uncut structures where global failure mode is governing collapse of the structure. By contrast, a local buckling in the vicinity of a cutout could not be predicted by VCT means. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that certain reinforcement around cutout may enable the global failure mode and corresponding reliability of VCT estimation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Trace {{rainfall}} {{is defined}} as rainfall under 0. 2 mm (or 0. 05 in) which cannot be measured by conventional types of rain-gauges. In the Canadian Arctic Islands, trace rainfall is commonly reported by the government weather stations or by researchers in the field. Frequent Occurrence of such events is attributed to the moisture provided by the open water areas and melting snow (Barry and Hare, 1974). To date, however, the measurement of trace rainfall has not been attempted. In view of low rainfall in the High Arctic, the exclusion of trace rainfall can possibly cause an underestimation of summer precipitation (Courtin and Labine, 1977; Jackson, l%l). The {{purpose of the present}} study is to determine the magnitude of several trace rainfall events using a simple device modified after one designed to study fog (Burton, 1971).

The acoustic emission technique allows the monitoring of the evolution of acoustic activities by taking into account energy of the events. The digital image correlation technique confirms the damage scenarios after the treatment of strain field at any point near the fastener and especially between the exit hole and the shoulder footprint.

40|$|Land mass {{transport}} systems {{have an open}} architecture and are therefore vulnerable to terrorist attack. The risk of injuries and fatalities {{in a case of}} an explosion inside trains or stations can be minimized by strengthening and optimizing these structures. Several calculation models can be used to simulate air blast waves. Ignoring the fluid behaviour, a pressure-time function can be applied onto the structure. Since in a long tube, like a train, the channelling has to be considered, and since the risk analysis needs the pressures inside the train, fluid dynamic calculations are performed to investigate the risk inside a train carriage. The geometry of the train is determined using a 3 D laser scanning technology. The structural part is built up from aluminium. Special failure models are used for laminated glass. A new approach for a fluid-structure interaction is presented, where a structure can be introduced in a fluid mesh without a connection to the fluid nodes. This procedure avoids also problems after the element erosion of the glass. Several structures of the train body are investigated here numerically. A relatively stiff honeycomb structure results in small displacements and limited failure. The risk inside such a train is much higher than in a train, which is built from a frame structure, where a thin <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> is welded on.

40|$|In {{almost all}} {{domestic}} refrigerators-freezers all components are {{assembled in the}} same relative position since several years ago. It is also known that the condenser releases heat at high temperatures (first law of thermodynamics) {{as well as the}} compressor. This heat is rejected to the environment in almost all practical situations partially by natural air convection. However, part of it is due to thermal radiation that causes an overheating of the refrigerator-freezer surfaces adjacent to those equipments. As a consequence there are more heat gains to the refrigerator-freezer through these surfaces and hence higher air temperatures inside. This paper describes how a simple technique can be very useful in order to minimize that part of heat transfer by radiation. The improvement is achieved by placing a radiation shield - a <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium</b> foil - over the surfaces close to the condenser and the compressor. For validating this technique a refrigerator-freezer was monitored with thermocouples for the measurements of the inside air temperatures in two situations: with and without the radiation shield. Results show that with this practice the average inside air temperatures in the refrigerator-freezer could decrease to about 2 K. An available commercial code was used in order to simulate the air temperature distribution and air velocities inside the refrigerator cabinet in both situations. Results from the experimental apparatus and from simulations show that there is a good agreement between them which validates the experiments carried out. Also an available commercial code, the Fluent, was used to simulate the internal air temperature in both situations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR...|$|E

In the proposed case of study, a cover of this type, made on a plant of 7, 500 sq. m, which are held in machining of high precision electronic components, in a few years has been the subject of twice total renovations, both consisted of adding one additional layer of waterproofing bituminous self-protected sheet, to end the drip of water inside, which continued to be present in winter, despite the work already done and redone. And there was going to run the third work of the same type, until the writer has identified the cause of the dripping water in absence of a continuous vapour barrier below the insulation. A work of complete restructuring of the construction’s cover has been then proposed and implemented, without modifying the existing roof, and allowing that the industrial production would remain in operation without any interruption: the waterproofing has been used as vapour barrier of new layers of insulation; higher slopes have been made, very useful for large spans of the deformable cover; a new waterproofing and new insulation layer have been put in place as an "inverted roof", protected from the weather and the sun and drained, for cope with the tropical downpours which have now become common even in the city of Potenza.

In the case of bending without pre-strain, no rupture was observed. Therefore, a tensile pre-strain, ranging from 0. 19 up to 0. 45 (longitudinal strain), was applied prior to bending. The highest pre-strain values were reached within the necking area. Tensile tests on rectangular samples were performed, then reduced samples were cut out and submitted to bending. A Digital Image Correlation (DIC) system was used to measure the maximum local strains reached during both tests. The evolution of the applied load on the bending tool versus its displacement showed that a rupture in bending was obtained for tensile pre-strains higher than 0. 25, as evidenced by a load drop. These results showed that very high strains can be reached in bending, which is consistent with previously obtained numerical results...|$|R

The electron backscatter increases with the increase in thickness of the metal until a saturation level is reached and thereafter no change in scatter enhancement is noticed. AimElectron backscatter effects at metallic interfaces were analysed in this study. High energy electron beams ranging from 6 to 20 MeV were used. Materials/MethodsMeasurements were carried out with a PTW thin-window parallel plate ionization chamber and an RDM- 1 F electrometer. Thin <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>aluminium,</b> copper and lead were used as inhomogeneities. The chamber was positioned below the inhomogeneities with the gantry maintained under the couch.
