40|$|International audienceRandom {{uncertainties}} in {{finite element}} models in linear structural dynamics are usually modeled by using parametric models. This means that: (1) the uncertain local parameters occurring in the global mass, damping and <b>stiffness</b> <b>matrices</b> of the finite element model have to he identified; (2) appropriate probabilistic models of these uncertain parameters have to be constructed; and (3) functions mapping the domains of uncertain parameters into the global mass, damping and <b>stiffness</b> <b>matrices</b> have to be constructed. In the low-frequency range, a reduced matrix model can then be constructed using the generalized coordinates associated with the structural modes corresponding to the lowest eigenfrequencies. In this paper we propose an approach for constructing a random uncertainties model of the generalized mass, damping and <b>stiffness</b> <b>matrices.</b> This nonparametric model does not require identifying the uncertain local parameters and consequently, obviates construction of functions that map the domains of uncertain local parameters into the generalized mass, damping and <b>stiffness</b> <b>matrices.</b> This nonparametric model of random uncertainties is based on direct construction of a probabilistic model of the generalized mass, damping and <b>stiffness</b> <b>matrices,</b> which uses only the available information constituted of the mean value of the generalized mass, damping and <b>stiffness</b> <b>matrices.</b> This paper describes the explicit construction {{of the theory of}} such a nonparametric model...|$|R
25|$|The {{finite element}} method approximates a {{structure}} as an assembly of elements or components with various forms of connection between them and each element of which has an associated stiffness. Thus, a continuous system such as a plate or shell is modeled as a discrete system with {{a finite number of}} elements interconnected at finite number of nodes and the overall stiffness {{is the result of the}} addition of the stiffness of the various elements. The behaviour of individual elements is characterized by the element's stiffness (or flexibility) relation. The assemblage of the various stiffness's into a master <b>stiffness</b> <b>matrix</b> that represents the entire structure leads to the system's stiffness or flexibility relation. To establish the stiffness (or flexibility) of a particular element, we can use the mechanics of materials approach for simple one-dimensional bar elements, and the elasticity approach for more complex two- and three-dimensional elements. The analytical and computational development are best effected throughout by means of matrix algebra, solving partial differential equations.|$|E
