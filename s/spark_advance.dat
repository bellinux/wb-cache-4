The knock-limited performance of the three fuels - 33 -R, a blend of 80 percent 28 -R plus 20 percent triptane (leaded to 4. 5 ml TEL/gal), and 28 -R - was investigated in two modified 14 -cylinder double-row radial air-cooled engines.

2500|$|The {{ignition}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Model T,with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and trembler coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the <b>spark</b> <b>advance</b> lever mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed spur gear (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6mph). A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element to the gear element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.|$|E

Before the invention of antifreeze, the air-cooled car had a huge advantage in cold weather, and Franklins were popular among people such as doctors, who needed an all-weather machine. The limitation of air-cooling was the size of the cylinder bore and the available area for the valves, which limited the power output of the earlier Franklins. By 1921, a change in cooling—moving the fan from sucking hot air to blowing cool air—led the way to the gradual increase in power.|$|E

40|$|Introduction {{of novel}} fuels, such as {{mixtures}} of ethanol or butanol with hydrocarbons, requires new fundamental understanding of in-cylinder combustion properties in modern direct-injection spark-ignition engines since those {{can be quite}} sensitive to fuel properties. Gasoline and its blends with 25 % ethanol and butanol at 25 % and 16 % per volume (the latter equivalent to 10 % ethanol blending ratio in terms of oxygen content) were studied in comparison to gasoline, ethanol, and butanol combustion. The same alcohol blending ratios were also employed with iso-octane as the base component for direct comparison. Testing was performed at 1500 RPM with 0. 5 bar intake plenum pressure using 20 °C or 80 °C engine coolant temperature. Thermodynamic parameters were derived using in-cylinder pressure analysis for stoichiometric (ϕ = 1. 0) and lean (ϕ = 0. 83) fueling over a range of <b>spark</b> <b>advances.</b> Additionally, high speed color and greyscale chemiluminescence imaging was conducted at gasoline’s maximum break torque spark timing, calculating flame growth speeds, flame roundness, and centroid motion. Laminar burning velocity data from the literature and in-cylinder flow measurements from the same engine were used for interpretation. Overall, the analysis showed small differences between gasoline and the blends in general, but showed changes for the pure alcohols with typically much faster flame progression for ethanol and issues with the combustion stability of butanol at low engine temperatures. Alcohol blending, particularly with iso-octane, showed some benefits at lean conditions...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, two {{different}} methodologies are adopted and critically integrated {{to analyze the}} knock behavior of a last generation small size spark ignition (SI) turbocharged VVA engine. Particularly, two full load operating points are selected, exhibiting relevant differences in terms of knock proximity. On one side, a knock investigation is carried out {{by means of an}} Auto-Regressive technique (AR model) to process experimental in-cylinder pressure signals. This mathematical procedure is used to estimate the statistical distribution of knocking cycles and provide a validation of the following 1 D- 3 D knock investigations. On the other side, an integrated numerical approach is set up, based on the synergic use of 1 D and 3 D simulation tools. The 1 D engine model is developed within the commercial software GT-Power™. It is used to provide time-varying boundary conditions (BCs) for the 3 D code, Star-CD™.

40|$|The {{turbocharged}} {{direct injection}} stoichiometric spark ignition gasoline engine {{has less than}} diesel full load brake engine thermal efficiencies and much larger than diesel penalties in brake engine thermal efficiencies reducing the load. This engine has, however, a much better power density, and therefore may operate at much higher {{brake mean effective pressure}} (BMEP) values over driving cycles thus reducing the fuel economy penalty of the vehicle. This engine also has the advantage of the very well developed three way catalytic (TWC) converter after treatment to meet future emission regulations. Replacement of fossil gasoline with renewable gasoline-like fuels has major advantages. Ethanol and methanol have larger than gasoline resistance to knock and heat of vaporization, and this ultimately translates in larger than gasoline compression ratio and boost pressure and <b>spark</b> <b>advances</b> closer to maximum brake torque producing better efficiencies both full and part load. For the specific of these novel turbocharged direct injection stoichiometric spark ignition renewable gasoline-like engines coupled to a hybrid-electric power train, the paper considers the option to boost the total fuel conversion efficiency generating both mechanical and electric energy. When the internal combustion engine operates, significant fuel energy is lost in both the exhaust and the coolant.
