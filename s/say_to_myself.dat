We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes—and a writer I am not." [...] He said that he and Forster [...] "were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it, but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished." ...|$|E

500|$|Neal Purvis and Robert Wade {{returned}} as screenwriters and completed {{a draft of}} the script by April 2007; Paul Haggis also worked on the script, completing it two hours before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began. Further work on the script had to be undertaken by Forster and Daniel Craig, who said later, [...] "We had the bare bones of a script {{and then there was a}} writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not". Craig also admitted that the film was not initially meant to be a sequel, but it became one because of the re-writes undertaken by him and Forster. Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps, but Forster wanted the action sequences to allude to the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire. Michael G. Wilson decided on the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its announcement on 24 January 2008. Forster hired Dennis Gassner as production designer, replacing Peter Lamont.|$|E
500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{opens with}} the singer using sexually {{explicit}} language to describe an evening {{at her home}} where she is cooking a meal for her love interest while being naked and alone, [...] "I'm in my penthouse half-naked / I cook this meal for you naked". Idolator's Mike Wass interpreted these lines as showing the singer [...] "emotional shortcomings". The Atlantic editor Nolan Feeney felt that these lines showcased many of the singer's recurring themes present on her other albums — [...] "the empowerment that comes with being a strong, independent woman, and the fulfillment that comes with love and marriage". Finney wrote that during {{the beginning of the}} song, Beyoncé seemed excited about her role as a wife in the kitchen, but afterwards as the events go wrong and she is left alone, the same role feels oppressive.The singer continues singing lines about jealousy and realizes her partner will not come: [...] "I wish you were me/ So you could feel this feeling/ I never broke one promise, and I know when you're not honest." [...] After the chorus, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "Sometimes I want to walk in your shoes, do the type of things I never ever do. I take one look in the mirror, and I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself,</b> 'Baby girl, you can't survive like this.'" [...] The protagonist can not tolerate the fact she has been underappreciated and goes on to put on a [...] "freakum dress out my closet" [...] (a reference to her own song [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] (2006)) and stay the night outside further singing about her own attractiveness. As she continues to describe her love–hate relationship detailing her emotions, Beyoncé sings the song's bridge: ...|$|E

[...] He explained that he was successful in his endeavors with women due to some unknown quality he possessed, [...] "The women I have dated over the years could have any man they want; they are the top models and most beautiful women in the world.

2500|$|Her self-hatred {{accelerated}} into raging {{cycles of}} bulimia and anorexia, repressing the issue until questioned. Jackson said, [...] "people say to me: `Okay, you've {{got to start}} eating more. You're too thin.' But when {{you look in the}} mirror, you see something totally different." [...] She continued, [...] "I had swung so far in one direction, I never thought I could swing so far in the other. You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> I could afford to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life". She also began using coffee enemas to remove [...] "sad cells", leading to media scrutiny. The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying [...] "Am I curious? I think every girl has wondered". Jackson culminated the experiences into the album's subject matter, recording over two years.|$|E

2500|$|If it weren’t for {{the fact}} that I {{actually}} enjoy conversing with the fans of my prior bands, I would never have found out about a new band called Screeching Weasel beginning to tour. “This can’t be the band I was in.” I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself.</b> “I would have been preparing.” [...] My mind would much prefer going to a place of calm contemplation than into a dark cold room filled with anger and the emotions associated with betrayal. So to avoid painful emoting I first took the facts that Ben and I started a band together called Screeching Weasel, we both spent all our days making that band a home for ourselves, and 18 years later we put it to rest. This along with the statement made by both me and Ben on many occasions that the band wouldn’t be Screeching Weasel without either of us, makes me assume that this band playing isn’t Screeching Weasel, because I don’t recall having kicked myself out of the band. So it seems logical that this is not Screeching Weasel. If it were I would have to admit that I longer [...] have friends named Ben Foster or Dan Schafer. As for people like Ben Weasel, Dan Vapid, or even John Jughead, I have nothing to say, because they never really existed, they were just made up names for a bunch of friends that tried to do something different in order to survive and make a living in this world. And I imagine they are all still {{trying to make a living}} somehow, seeing that their band’s prominent “leader” never wanted to tour in order to make it financially viable to continue on.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group has}} been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading {{exporters}} of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls [...] "the new welfarists," [...] arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives."What I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>myself</b> all the time is that we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make no bones about the fact that we want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal."Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, I think she would choose to have that happen." [...] There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, [...] "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it." [...] Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, [...] "t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." [...] Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be [...] "press sluts." [...] She argues, [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." [...] PETA has also faced criticism for it's targeting of children, such as distributing comic books entitled Your Mommy Kills Animals.|$|E
