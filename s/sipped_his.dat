60|$|Aynesworth <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> whisky and Apollinaris, {{and lit a}} cigarette.|$|E
60|$|Duncombe {{leaned back}} in his chair and <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> port thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|Edward rose, {{and paced}} the room. His imperturbable parent <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> tea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Women always confuse {{instincts}} with prejudices," [...] Borden rejoined, calmly <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> whisky and soda. [...] "May I smoke a pipe?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Geoffrey, <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> tea, smiled grimly {{behind the}} shelter of his cup. [...] "She does it uncommonly well," [...] he thought to himself.|$|R
6000|$|On {{the young}} man's face, {{as he sat}} <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> ginger-ale in the club-house smoking-room, there was a look of disillusionment. [...] "Never again!" [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Blatherwick had <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> {{glass of}} champagne, and {{answered}} without a stutter.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> tea {{and smiled}} at me while I ran over the pages.|$|E
60|$|Hodder <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> coffee, {{and looked}} out at the morning-glories opening to the sun.|$|E
6000|$|So Martin {{unearthed}} {{a carbon}} copy of [...] "Star-dust," [...] {{and during the}} reading of it Brissenden chuckled, rubbed his hands, and forgot to <b>sip</b> <b>his</b> toddy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Capital, Louis!" [...] Ware replied, <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> cocktail. [...] "It will {{be another}} {{quarter of an hour}} yet before we see {{anything}} of them, I am afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why didn't you {{contradict}} {{all those}} rumours {{as to his}} disappearance?" [...] the detective asked, pointing to where Job Masters was contentedly <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> brandy and water.|$|R
60|$|The doctor paused, <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> wine, emptied {{his glass}} {{and set it down}} approvingly.|$|E
60|$|No answer. The youth read studiously; {{he slowly}} broke his bread and <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> milk.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin smiled, a slow contemplative smile. He <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> {{chocolate}} {{and lit a}} cigarette.|$|E
6000|$|... "What acknowledgment?" [...] {{asked the}} Whip <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> port wearily, for such {{negotiations}} were no new thing to him. [...] "I mean, {{how do you}} spell it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O, it's {{better known}} than you suppose," [...] said Michael <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> brandy and soda. [...] "I always {{act on it}} myself when I want a drink." ...|$|R
60|$|The squire {{continued}} to <b>sip</b> <b>his</b> claret; {{he had to}} think over the matter a while before he could answer a statement so deliberately made by his son.|$|R
60|$|He <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> {{wine for}} a moment thoughtfully. Then a grim, hard smile parted his lips.|$|E
60|$|He <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> wine thoughtfully for {{a minute}} or two, and helped himself to some curry.|$|E
60|$|Julien made no reply. He <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> {{coffee for}} a moment. Then he turned slowly round.|$|E
6000|$|Bemis, who {{has been}} <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> tea in silent admiration: [...] "Are you often able to keep it up in that way? I was fancying myself at the theatre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'It's very good,' ses Bob, <b>sipping</b> <b>his,</b> 'but {{it wants}} a sixpenny cigar {{to go with}} it. It's been the dream o' my life to smoke a sixpenny cigar.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very good,' {{said that}} gentleman, <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> peppermint; 'I'll call at Sowerberry's as I go home, {{and tell him}} to send to-morrow morning. Was it that as frightened you, love?' ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grex <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> pale, lemon-flavoured tea and {{toyed with}} his cigarette-case. He was eating nothing.|$|E
60|$|I said nothing. My surprise, indeed, had bereft me of words. He <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> wine slowly, and continued.|$|E
60|$|The Prince <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> wine--a cabinet hock of rare vintage--and {{found it}} good. He leaned over towards his companion.|$|E
6000|$|... "One other," [...] the Colonel acknowledged, <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> wine appreciatively. [...] "My {{military}} police here, however, are very intelligent, and I should think it very doubtful {{whether he can}} escape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The devil she is!" [...] muttered Barry, {{throwing}} {{himself into}} an arm-chair. He sat there some little time, {{and the doctor}} also sat down, said nothing, but continued <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> wine.|$|R
6000|$|He did {{not take}} the {{identification}} as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> cognac to the end, he added: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes, I {{remember}} him--the little, dried-up Scotchman." [...] Wallenstein <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> whiskey. [...] "He's {{called the}} Trouble-mender, isn't he?" ...|$|E
60|$|Hamel {{accepted}} a quaintly-cut wine-glass {{full of the}} amber liquid. Mr. Fentolin <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> with {{the air of a}} connoisseur.|$|E
60|$|And {{the old man}} <b>sipped</b> <b>his</b> brown wine, {{and smiled}} again. He made quite a {{handsome}} picture: but he was frail.|$|E
6000|$|One morning, as {{our hero}} sat <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> coffee, clad only in loose cotton drawers, a shirt, and a jacket, and with {{slippers}} upon his feet, {{as is the}} custom in that country, where everyone endeavors to keep as cool as may be--while he sat thus <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> coffee Miss Eliza, {{the youngest of the}} three daughters, came and gave him a note, which, she said, a stranger had just handed in at the door, going away again without waiting for a reply. You may judge of Barnaby's surprise when he opened the note and read as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Peter Conant, <b>sipping</b> <b>his</b> coffee reflectively, {{read the}} lengthy {{telegram}} a second time. Then he said, somewhat irritably and chopping his words into distinct syllables, {{as was his}} habit at all times: ...|$|R
6000|$|Gys stared so hard at {{him with}} the one good eye that even Maurie became embarrassed and turned away <b>his</b> head. <b>Sipping</b> <b>his</b> tea and brandy he {{presently}} resumed, in a casual tone: ...|$|R
