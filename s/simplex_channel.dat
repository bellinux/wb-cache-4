A <b>simplex</b> <b>channel</b> may comprise only a transmitting station with only a transmitter and a transmit antenna on the sending end coupled with a receiving station comprising only a receive antenna and a receiver on the receiving end.

In contrast, for spoken dialogue systems turn allocation is a difficult task, and often technical restrictions are introduced to simplify it. In this paper we investigate, by comparing two experimentally collected corpora of human–human task oriented dialogue, what the consequences are of imposing one particular kind of restriction, namely that of using a <b>simplex</b> <b>channel</b> managed by push-to-talk (PTT). We found, as expected, a loss of interactivity in the PTT condition (fewer, longer turns; more silences), but surprisingly, no loss of efficiency; in fact, {{the subjects in the}} PTT condition were able to finish their task in roughly the same time, while using fewer words along the way. We analyse here the differences in the interaction patterns and the interplay of ‘naturalness ’ and efficiency as relevant factors for practical system development.

40|$|Abstract—Wireless {{networking}} {{is currently}} dominated by radio frequency (RF) techniques. However, the soon-to-be ubiquity of LED-based lighting motivated by significant energy savings provides an opportunistic deployment of widespread free-space optical (FSO) communications. LEDbased network transceivers {{have a variety}} of competitive advantages over RF including high bandwidth density, security, energy consumption, and aesthetics. They also use a highly reusable unregulated part of the spectrum (visible light). In this paper we describe results from a pilot project to demonstrate the viability of an optical free-space visible light transceiver as a basis for indoor wireless networking. Inexpensive, commercial, off-the shelf LEDs and photodiodes we used to construct two prototypes; a <b>simplex</b> <b>channel</b> as expected as a component of an asymmetric/hybrid RF-FSO system, and a full-duplex channel demonstrating the ability to isolate multiple channels. On— off keying (OOK) was applied without observable flicker in the target modulation ranges.

40|$|The {{research}} effort {{presented in}} this paper focuses on two main issues encountered in designing real time FoIP gateways using ITU-T T. 38 protocol recommendations. The first issue deals with reducing the complexity of FoIP gateways whereas the second issue aims to provide the required Quality of Service (QoS). The former is accomplished by minimizing the T. 30 state machine required to be implemented in the gateways with an alternative architecture. This architecture maps a full duplex IP channel over a half duplex facsimile session in a T. 38 gateway. Thus, two <b>simplex</b> <b>channels</b> operate concurrently, transferring facsimile control and image data in either direction. The latter of the two issues discussed here is traditionally resolved in FoIP gateways via spoofing. Here, the required QoS is achieved mainly through minimizing the packetization and de-packetization latencies within the gateways to the minimum by transmitting Internet Facsimile Protocol (IFP) packets that contain partial T. 30 High Level Data Link Control(HDLC) frames. Additionally, implementation of some unique spoofing techniques is also discussed that utilize special HDLC frames. This unique spoofing technique is required to keep the facsimile session alive when the packet switched network introduces excessive latencies.

The fundamental requirement of an SA arrives when the two entities communicate over more than one channel. Take, for example, a mobile subscriber and a base station. The subscriber may subscribe itself {{to more than one}} service. Therefore, each service may have different service primitives, such as a data encryption algorithm, public key, or initialization vector. To make things easier, all of this security information is grouped logically, and the logical group itself is a Security Association. Each SA has its own ID called SAID. So both the base station and mobile subscriber will share the SAID, and they will derive all the security parameters.|$|R

40|$|The current {{challenge}} in designing an integrated {{packet switched network}} is to support real-time applications {{with a wide variety}} of quality of service requirements, in terms of expected throughput, acceptable level of packet losses, and bounded network packet delay.

40|$|M. Ing. The {{transmission}} of digital data at higher data rates and greater reliabilities {{is becoming increasingly}} {{more important in the}} society of today. The usage of, especially wireless digital data, is increasing at an alarming rate, and the need arises for more bandwidth to be made available for this purpose. Hence, the need arises to optimise and expand the usage of bandwidth currently under use. Existing wireless channels, such as the commercial FM service, need to be re-evaluated and unused bandwidth needs to be developed and used as close to capacity as possible. In this dissertation, a study was launched to develop the FM SST (Supplementary Signal Transmission) commercial analog service as a <b>simplex</b> digital <b>channel</b> that can commercially be used to transmit a myriad of digital data. With the help of a commercial FM radio channel, digital data was transmitted using a number of different modulation schemes to obtain channel measurements for the FM SST channel. The modulation scheme that performed the best, given certain criteria, was GMSK. This raw information was then used to extract first and higher order statistical information from the channel, in order to parameterise discrete channel models, based on a Markov process. The channel models that were used were the Gilbert, GilbertElliott and Fritchman channel models. These channel models were then tested according to their iirst and higher order statistical data to evaluate their effectiveness in modelling the error process on the FM SST channel. It was found that the channel model best approximating the real channels was the Gilbert channel. Once satisfactory results were obtained, these discrete channel models were then used to evaluate various error correction schemes for their ability to correct burst errors on the FM SST channel. From the various schemes evaluated, a (63, 39) BCH with an interleaver of index 4 was found to perform the best.

40|$|This {{numerical}} {{study is}} divided into two main parts: In the first part a model for routing unsteady flows in compound channels, called RUFICC, is developed. The model accounts for flood plain contribution to system conveyance and also for lateral momentum transfer (LMT) between adjacent deep and shallow zones of compound flow fields. In the modeling approach composite channel sections are divided into representative deep and shallow zones. The resulting one-dimensional model equations, which are a modified form of the St. Venant equations, are solved using a four-point implicit finite difference scheme. Different procedures to account for LMT in the modeling process were considered. These included empirical models that were developed based on field and laboratory measurements under steady flow conditions. The effect of LMT was found to be insignificant in most of the applications considered. For a hypothetical channel with wide and rough flood plains LMT was found to be strongest at small flood plain depths and resulted in attenuation of the discharge hydrographs. In the simulation exercises included in this work RUFICC's performance was compared to those of two frequently-used conventional models, namely: the Off-Channel Storage Model (OCSM) and the Separate Channel Model (SCM). For the applications considered a better agreement was achieved between RUFICC's simulated hydrographs and the observed data. Applying the two conventional models resulted in a marked delay in the fall of the recession curve of the simulated hydrographs. The OCSM also underestimated stages and discharges by more than 25 %, especially for fairly high flood plain flows. Flood routing exercises, which involve the solution of the St. Venant equations, require that the geometric and hydraulic properties of the river reach under study be known. This includes the cross-sectional area of flow as well as the channel boundary roughness coefficients for different flow depths. The second phase of this study concerned the testing of different optimization techniques to determine the most suitable optimization algorithm(s) in the estimation of flood routing data. The algorithms considered include Powell's and Rosenbrock's methods, and the Nelder and Meade <b>Simplex</b> algorithm. Regular <b>channel</b> data as well as compound channel data were used in these exercises. The solution of the unsteady flow equations requires only cross-sectional area (A) and conveyance (K) as functions of flow depth (y). Thus, instead of following the conceptual approach of optimizing upon a channel's geometric and hydraulic parameters, optimization was performed upon abstract parameters in assumed A(y) and K(y) relationships. These types of relationships in the so-called 'Black-Box' approach would obviously speed up the computations involved in solving the unsteady flow equations. Furthermore, the relative simplicity of such relationships resulted in decreased computer times and reduced amounts of required computer storage. Estimated data using the Rosenbrock and Simplex methods were then applied to route different flood events. Simulated peak stages and discharges were in good agreement with those estimated using actual routing data. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
