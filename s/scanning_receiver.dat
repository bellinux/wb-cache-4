40|$|Abstract- Composite {{materials}} {{are more and}} more used for primary structures in aerospace components. Examples are the new aeroplanes Boeing 787 and the Airbus A 350 which are mostly produced out of composites. In order {{to take advantage of the}} specific properties of composites the complexity of the structures increases more and more. On the other hand the costs for inspection after fabrication and especially in service have to decrease. Cost effective NDT-methods have to be implemented. This paper presents the possibilities of guided waves inspection techniques for complex composite components. Guided waves such as Lamb waves can be easily excitated and received by applied piezo-elements and penetrate large areas so that complex structures in principle can be inspected (SHM). However, for each frequency in minimum two different wave modes exist so that the responses are difficult to evaluate. The Lamb wave research is carried out within the EU project AISHA. The ultrasonic imaging technique is successfully used for the visualisation of the Lamb wave propagation. This combination between SHM and ultrasonic technique provides the optimisation of the sensor and actuator placement and also an interesting method for in-field inspection of air aerospace components.

40|$|Electronic Support Measures (ESM) {{receivers}} {{exist that}} {{are capable of}} detecting the transmissions from radar emitters in a robust and reliable manner. Typically, the receiver operator wishes to detect the transmitted signals from a known set of emitters as quickly as possible. To achieve this, a schedule is created that dictates the order in which the receiver will search for the various emitters. Techniques exist for predicting the maximum time to intercept between a receiver and an emitter, but they only work from known scheduling parameters. The quantity of emitters and the density of their signals typically prevents a naive approach to generating the schedule. The purpose of this thesis was to generate <b>scanning</b> <b>receiver</b> schedules that minimize the maximum time to intercept for a set of scanning emitters. Genetic algorithms and the use of pulse train theory were combined to generate the schedules in an automated fashion. The genetic algorithm consistently produced ESM receiver schedules that used duration values for each frequency band that were near the largest scan rate of all the emitters in each band. This was an unexpected result and demonstrated that the minimization of the maximum intercept time for a set of emitters can be accomplished using the maximum scan values. A new scheduling algorithm was created that utilized the maximum scan values. It generated ESM receiver schedules that were equivalent to the best schedules produced by the genetic algorithm scheduler, and produced them with much less computational effort...|$|E

5000|$|The {{essence of}} ALE {{techniques}} {{is the use}} of automatic channel selection, <b>scanning</b> <b>receivers,</b> selective calling, handshaking, and robust burst modems. An ALE node decodes all received ALE signals heard on the channel(s) it monitors. It utilizes the fact that all ALE messages utilize Forward error correction (FEC) redundancy. By noting how much error-correction occurred in each received and decoded message, an ALE node can detect the [...] "quality" [...] of the path between the sending station and itself. This information is coupled with the ALE address of the sending node and the channel the message was received on, and stored in the node's Link Quality Analysis (LQA) memory. When a call is initiated, the LQA lookup table is searched for matches involving the target ALE address and the best historic channel is used to call the target station. This reduces the likelihood that the call has to be repeated on alternate frequencies. Once the target station has heard the call and responded, a bell or other signalling device will notify both operators that a link has been established. At this point, the operators may coordinate further communication via orderwire text messages, voice, or other means. If further digital communication is desired, it may take place via external data modems or via optional modems built into the ALE terminal.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. In {{the process}} of warfare the system and radio {{communications}} are used in a complex electronic environment. The former is created by the great amount of natural and man-made obsticles. Recently means of radio communication with a FHSS have become more widespread as they provide more reliable connection and protect the signal from obstacles. The effectiveness of hindrance influence on the radio communication system (RCS) with FHSS is achieved by intercepting the signal and determining its parameters. A malefactor obtains these parameters via electronic intelligence station (EIS). The aim of the article is to assess the probability of interception single signal transmitter hops from FHSS using searcher receiver. The subject {{of the study is}} a searcher, the product of Rohde & Schwarz (R&S) company, and a spectrum analyzer RTSA, which search for signals from a transmitter with hopping mode. The probability of intercept for a single signal in a single trial. We consider the probability of intercepting signals of single- and multi-channel transmitter for single frequency hopping in different types of overlapping frequency ranges. For these cases the analytical expressions are presented. The probability of intercept for a single signal in multiple testing.

40|$|Institute of Perception, Action and BehaviourThe aim of {{the work}} {{reported}} in this thesis is to investigate a methodology for studying perception by building and testing robotic models of animal sensory mechanisms. Much of Artificial Intelligence studies agent perception by exploring architectures for linking (often abstract) sensors and motors so as to give rise to particular behaviour. By contrast, this work proposes that perceptual investigations should begin with a characterisation of the underlying physical laws which govern the specific interaction of a sensor (or actuator) with its environment throughout the execution of a task. Moreover, it demonstrates that, through an understanding of task-physics, problems for which architectural solutions or explanations are often proposed may be solved more simply at the sensory interface - thereby minimising subsequent computation. This approach is applied to {{an investigation of the}} acoustical cues that may be exploited by several species of tone emitting insectivorous bats (species in the families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae) which localise prey using systematic pinnae scanning movements. From consideration of aspects of the sound filtering performed by the external and inner ear or these bats, three target localisation mechanisms are hypothesised and tested aboard a 6 degree-of-freedom, binaural, robotic echolocation system. In the first case, it is supposed that echolocators with narrow-band call structures use pinna movement to alter the directional sensitivity of their perceptual systems in the same whay that broad-band emitting bats rely on pinnae morphology to alter acoustic directionality at different frequencies. <b>Scanning</b> <b>receivers</b> also create dynamic cues - in the form of frequency and amplitude modulations - which very systematically with target angle.

40|$|An {{important}} function of an Electronic Warfare Support Measures (ESM) receiver is the acquisition and identification of signals in the Electronic Warfare (EW) environment. Ideally the receiver requires {{a high probability}} of intercept. Current receiver types include wide open systems, which suffer from signal overlap, and <b>scanning</b> superheterodyne <b>receivers,</b> which have a low probability of intercept against some signals.

In total there were 888 recorded positions of radiotagged northern pike over a 6 month period. Fish locations relative to the Port Davidson Weir allowed us to characterize specific discharge-dependent barriers to northern pike movement, and important spawning habitat.

Passage rates at the Port Davidson Weir were 80 % for upstream migrating northern pike, and 50 % for downstream migrating northern pike. During the study period, there were 14 upstream movements through the Port Davidson Weir bypass channel from March 27 to April 24, with river discharge between 0. 7 and 15. 2 m 3 /s. Upstream movement peaked when river discharge was 4. 2 - 6. 4 m 3 /s. In addition, seven downstream movements occurred between March 27 and April 21 over a range of river discharge from 0. 8 - 6. 4 m 3 /s with peak movement at 4. 2 m 3 /s.
