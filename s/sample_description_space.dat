Silver and Plummet (1985) {{provide an}} {{analysis}} of the Focussing algori thm and the Classification algorithm in the case where the <b>description</b> <b>space</b> consists of a set of relation trees. This paper discusses an extension to their analysis in which the <b>description</b> <b>space</b> is construed as a geometric space. Under this construal the behaviour of both the Focussing algori thm and the Classification algorithm is analysed in terms of the construction of hypercuboids. This analysis leads to a number of observations: (i) that a dis-t inction can be made between a strong and a weak version of the disjunctive-concept problem; (i i) that certain solutions to the disjunctive-concept problem can be shown to exploit what are, in effect, distance functions over the <b>description</b> <b>space</b> and (i i i). that the Classification algorithm is only capable of learning a subset of the possible disjunctive con-cepts in any given domain. 1...|$|R

40|$|Video copy {{detection}} {{is mainly}} required for protecting owners against unauthorized {{use of their}} content. Content-based copy detection methods rely on {{the evaluation of the}} similarity between potential copies and the original videos. Scalability is the key issue in making these methods practical for very large video databases. To address this challenge, we put forward here an optimized similarity-based search method that takes into account the local characteristics of the space of content signatures. First, refined models of the distortions undergone by the signatures during the copy creation process allow to search in a more appropriately defined area of the <b>description</b> <b>space,</b> increasing query selectivity and improving detection quality. Second, by identifying in the <b>description</b> <b>space</b> those regions where the local density of content signatures is high, a significant additional reduction of the computation cost is obtained. An evaluation on ground truth databases shows that the proposed solution is reliable. Scalability is then demonstrated on larger databases of up to 280, 000 hours of video...|$|R
40|$|As {{the concept}} of what {{constitutes}} a "content-based" search grows more mature, it becomes valuable for us to establish a clear sense of just what is meant by "content. " Recent multimedia document retrieval systems have dealt with this problem by indexing across multiple indexes; {{but it is important to}} identify how such multiple indexes are dealing with multiple dimensions of a <b>description</b> <b>space,</b> rather than simply providing the user with more descriptors. In this paper we consider a <b>description</b> <b>space</b> for multimedia documents based on three "dimensions" of a document, namely context, form, and content. We analyze the nature of this space with respect to three challenging examples of multimedia search tasks, and we address the nature of the index structures that would facilitate how these tasks may be achieved. These examples then lead us to some general conclusions on the nature of multimedia indexing and the intuitions we have inherited from the tradition of books and libraries...|$|R
