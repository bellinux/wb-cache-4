5|$|A {{proposal}} for a new underground railway running from Victoria to Walthamstow was first proposed by a Working Party <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British Transport Commission in 1948, though that largely followed a 1946 plan for an East Croydon to Finsbury Park line. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962. Construction began in 1962 on the initial Walthamstow to Victoria section. The Victoria line platforms opened on 7 March 1969. The station opened {{as part of a}} second extension from Warren Street to Victoria. Cross-platform interchange between the Bakerloo and Victoria lines was provided by constructing the Victoria line platforms parallel to the Bakerloo ones.|$|E
5|$|Around 23:00 on 15 August, {{elements}} of the Serbian 1st Combined Division encountered outposts <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> invading Austro-Hungarian army {{on the slopes of}} Cer Mountain and fighting erupted. The Austro-Hungarian positions were lightly held, and their defenders were driven back away from the mountain. By midnight, fierce clashes between the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs were underway and chaos ensued in the darkness. By the morning of 16 August, the Serbians had seized the Divača Range and dislodged the Austro-Hungarians from their positions in the village of Borino Selo. The Austro-Hungarians, who had suffered heavy casualties during the fighting, retreated in some disorder. As the day progressed, the Serbs drove the 21st Infantry Division off the slopes of Cer to prevent it from linking with the 2nd Army in Šabac.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass. Other units of measure which did not rely on specific artefacts were controlled by other bodies. In the scientific world, quantum theory was in its infancy and Einstein had yet to publish his theories of relativity. By the end of the century, a coherent system of units was in place under the control of the bodies <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Convention du Mètre (Metre Convention), the definition of the second relied on quantum theory, the definition of the metre relied on the theory of relativity, and plans were being made to relegate the international prototype kilogram to the archives.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage movement had built up a steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school had been <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given. In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews.|$|E
5|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to one of several Mossad safe houses that had been <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> team.

During these days, Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, as the Mossad had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight. However, Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city, and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had gone, so the plans for his capture had to be abandoned. Eitan told Haaretz in 2008 that they intentionally made {{the decision not to}} pursue Mengele, reasoning that to do so might jeopardize the Eichmann operation.|$|E

5|$|Following LeRoy's {{death in}} 1932, his film {{collection}} {{was bought by}} the Museum of Modern Art in 1936. The museum's acquisition and subsequent screenings of A Trip to the Moon, {{under the direction of}} MoMA's film curator Iris Barry, opened the film up once again to a wide audience of Americans and Canadians and established it definitively as a landmark in the history of cinema. LeRoy's incomplete print became the most commonly seen version of the film and the source print for most other copies, including the Cinémathèque française's print. A complete version of the film, including the entire celebration sequence, was finally reconstructed in 1997 from various sources by the Cinémathèque Méliès, a foundation <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Méliès family.|$|E
