Results {{show that the}} substructures are generated during evolution of <b>shear</b> <b>transformation</b> on the (111 -) plane of γ lath. At the beginning, <b>shear</b> <b>transformation</b> evolves in a single γ lath, and a superstructure intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) forms in the γ lath. After {{the formation of the}} SISF, the <b>shear</b> <b>transformation</b> may evolve in two different ways. If the <b>shear</b> <b>transformation</b> evolves into neighboring γ laths, the SISF also penetrates into neighboring γ laths and a ribbon of SISFs forms. If <b>shear</b> <b>transformation</b> continues to evolve in the original lath, complex substructures begin to form in the original. If <b>shear</b> <b>transformation</b> in the original lath is homogeneous and complete, secondary twin forms which may further grow into twin intersection.

Despite their importance, the dynamic features of <b>shear</b> <b>transformations</b> are far from clear. Here, we use a colloidal glass under shear as the prototype to directly observe the <b>shear</b> <b>transformation</b> events in real space. By tracing the colloidal particle rearrangements, we quantitatively determine two basic properties of shear transformations: local shear strain and dilatation (or free volume). It is revealed that the local free volume undergoes a significantly temporary increase prior to <b>shear</b> <b>transformations,</b> eventually leading to a jump of local shear strain. We clearly demonstrate that <b>shear</b> <b>transformations</b> {{have no memory of}} the initial free volume of local regions. Instead, their emergence strongly depends on the dilatancy ability of these regions, i. e., the dynamic creation of free volume. More specifically, the particles processing the high dilatancy ability directly participate in subsequent <b>shear</b> <b>transformations.</b> These results experimentally support the Argon's statement about the dilatancy nature of <b>shear</b> <b>transformations,</b> and also shed insight into the structural origin of amorphous plasticity...|$|R

40|$|Multiple-quantum magic-angle-spinning (MQMAS) NMR {{experiments}} {{have recently been}} used to remove second-order broadening from the central transition of half-integer quadrupolar nuclei. In this paper, the various methods that have been proposed for obtaining pure absorption-mode lineshapes in MQMAS experiments are described and compared. The methods can be classified according to whether the data are amplitude- or phase-modulated {{as a function of}} the evolution period, t 1. Both classes of experiment are usually performed in such a way that the inhomogeneous quadrupolar broadening is spread out along a ridge which, for spinsI= 3 / 2 and 5 / 2, respectively, has a slope of − 7 / 9 or 19 / 12 with respect to the F 2 axis. This paper shows, however, that there are disadvantages associated with recording the data in this fashion and demonstrates, in particular, that a <b>shearing</b> <b>transformation</b> of the final two-dimensional spectrum can lead to distorted lineshapes. Novel amplitude- and phase-modulated “split- t 1 ” MQMAS experiments are introduced which fully refocus the second-order broadening during the evolution period,t 1, thereby avoiding the need for a <b>shearing</b> <b>transformation.</b> The considerable practical advantages of these split- t 1 experiments are discussed, particularly with regard to ease of implementation and processing. In general, the sensitivities achievable using the split- t 1 MQMAS experiments are predicted to be similar to those obtainable with other methods and, in the special case of the spin I = 3 / 2 phase-modulated experiments, are even shown to be slightly superior...|$|E

40|$|Fast {{and massive}} {{dissemination}} of image data across the Internet imposes great challenges of protecting images against illegal access and unauthorized reproduction. Image watermarking provides a powerful solution for intellectual protection. In this paper, {{a new image}} watermarking approach robust to various geometric distortions is proposed. The new scheme involves detecting image feature points and triangulating them in a secure key-dependent manner. The neighborhood pixel ratio of gray-scale image is investigated in the paper. It is a novel robust image feature which can be seamlessly combined with the proposed key-dependent triangulation scheme. A random pre-warping framework is adopted to make the scheme robust to collusion attack. Our experiments demonstrate that the new scheme is robust to rotation, scaling, noise addition, JPEG compression, StirMark, <b>shearing</b> <b>transformation,</b> collusion, and other common attacks in both spatial and frequency domain.

We show that the parametrization represents a <b>shearing</b> <b>transformation</b> of the 2 -D time-domain and relate the resulting frequency domain spectrum to the HYSCORE spectrum in terms of a skew-projection. It is emphasized that the parametrization of the time-domain variables may be chosen arbitrarily and affects neither the computation of the correct nuclear frequencies nor the resulting resolution.

40|$|A {{program for}} calculating a C-type mesh around airfoil like shapes is described. The Jameson/Caughey {{approach}} is used: a parabolic transformation {{coupled with a}} <b>shearing</b> <b>transformation.</b> The algebraic algorithm is capable of efficiently generating nearly orthogonal grids. A high degree of grid control is possible. The user may specify grid boundaries, number of grid lines, and location of (and spacing in) trailing edge and leading edge fine mesh areas. The capability of embedding fine mesh regions, for use with new adaptive grid techniques, is being developed. Grids generated by the program were used in Euler flow flow calculatons by W. Usab. Results superior to results calculated on previous O-type grids were obtained. Specifically, calculations converged faster using C-grids rather than 0 -grids, total pressure loss spikes at {{the trailing edge of}} the airfoil were eliminated, and the Ni method converged with zero artificial smoothing for a subcritical case (resulting overall total pressure loss was then nearly zero). These improvements were attributed to higher grid orthogonality, especially at the trailing edge. The program itself is fairly straightforward.

40|$|International audienceA double-zero quantum (DZQ) -refocused INADEQUATE {{experiment}} is introduced for J-based NMR correlations under ultra-fast (60 kHz) magic angle spinning (MAS). The experiment records two spectra {{in the same}} dataset, a double quantumsingle quantum (DQ-SQ) and zero quantumsingle quantum (ZQ-SQ) spectrum, whereby the corresponding signals appear at different chemical shifts in ? 1. Furthermore, the spin-state selective excitation (S 3 E) J-decoupling block is incorporated {{in place of the}} second refocusing echo of the INADEQUATE scheme, providing an additional gain in sensitivity and resolution. The two sub-spectra acquired in this way can be treated separately by a <b>shearing</b> <b>transformation,</b> producing two diagonal-free single quantum (SQ-SQ) -type spectra, which are subsequently recombined to give an additional sensitivity enhancement, thus offering an improvement greater than a factor of two as compared to the original refocused INADEQUATE experiment. The combined DZQ scheme retains transverse magnetization on the initially polarized (I) spin, which typically exhibits a longer transverse dephasing time (T 2 ') than its through-bond neighbour (S). By doing so, less magnetization is lost during the refocusing periods in the sequence to give even further gains in sensitivity for the J correlations. The {{experiment is}} demonstrated for the correlation between the carbonyl (CO) and alpha (CA) carbons in a microcrystalline sample of fully protonated, [15 N, 13 C]-labelled CuII,?ZnII superoxide dismutase, and its efficiency is discussed with respect to other J-based schemes...|$|E
40|$|The Wigner {{function}} {{is a useful}} tool to analyze partially coherent light. Particularly the propagation of light in optical systems can be described by the Wigner function, while including effects of coherence and diffraction. Here we concentrate on discontinuous optical surfaces where diffraction effects can be dominant, such as the kinoform lenses, gratings, and lens arrays. To calculate the change of the Wigner function in an optical system, we treat the optical components as thin phase elements. A Wigner function describes signals in space vs. spatial frequency, resembling position vs. angle in geometrical optics. Therefore the ABCD matrix {{can be used to}} model the paraxial propagation of partially coherent light. This propagation can be computed efficiently with a <b>shearing</b> <b>transformation.</b> However, the implementation of Wigner functions for a highly convergent or divergent beam requires many sampling points. To overcome this drawback, we apply a method to remove the parabolic wavefront from the beam, transforming it into a quasi-collimated beam without losing physical effects or computational accuracy. We discuss a kinoform lens as a first example with the partially coherent light. The Wigner function vividly visualizes the essential effects such as the focal shift and multiple foci for wavelengths different from the design wavelength. As another example for Wigner functions, we analyze the lens arrays for beam homogenizing. The Wigner functions visualize the beam-shaping contribution of individual lenslets including their diffraction effects. In conclusion, the Wigner function offers a convenient approach to analyze the design of components where diffraction effects are important...|$|E

40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>transformations</b> (i. e., {{localised}} rearrangements {{of particles}} {{resulting in the}} shear deformation of a small region of the sample) are {{the building blocks of}} mesoscale models for the flow of disordered solids. In order to compute the time-dependent response of the solid material to such a <b>shear</b> <b>transformation,</b> with a proper account of elastic heterogeneity and shear wave propagation, we propose and implement a very simple Finite-Element (FE) -based method. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones glass are used as a benchmark for comparison, and information about the microscopic viscosity and the local elastic constants is directly extracted from the MD system and used as input in FE. We find very good agreement between FE and MD regarding the temporal evolution of the disorder-averaged displacement field induced by a <b>shear</b> <b>transformation,</b> which turns out to coincide with the response of a uniform elastic medium. However, fluctuations are relatively large, and their magnitude is satisfactorily captured by the FE simulations of an elastically heterogeneous system. Besides, accounting for elastic anisotropy on the mesoscale is not crucial in this respect. The proposed method thus paves the way for models of the rheology of amorphous solids which are both computationally efficient and realistic, in that structural disorder and inertial effects are accounted for.

The merit of the proposed method is that it can be operated directly on a single character so that more accurate statistical information can be obtained. The rationale of our proposed method is that the difference of certain features derived from italic style characters after <b>shear</b> <b>transformation</b> will be canceled, whereas the difference will be more obvious for non-italic style (normal style) characters. In our proposed ap-proach, the virtual strokes embedded in the considered character image are extracted first. Then, reverse transformation is operated on the considered character image.
