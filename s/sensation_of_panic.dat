50|$|Interoceptive {{exposure}} is a cognitive behavioral therapy technique {{used in the}} treatment <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. It refers to carrying out exercises that bring about the physical <b>sensations</b> <b>of</b> a <b>panic</b> attack, such as hyperventilation and high muscle tension, {{and in the process}} removing the patient's conditioned response that the physical sensations will cause an attack to happen.|$|R
40|$|Background: Interoception {{refers to}} the ability to sense body signals. Two interoceptive {{dimensions}} have been recently proposed: (a) interoceptive sensitivity (IS) –objective accuracy in detecting internal bodily sensations (e. g., heartbeat, breathing) –; and (b) metacognitive interoception (MI) –explicit beliefs and worries about one’s own interoceptive sensitivity and internal <b>sensations.</b> Current models <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> assume a possible influence of interoception on the development <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks. Hypervigilance to body symptoms {{is one of the most}} characteristic manifestations <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorders. Some explanations propose that patients have abnormal IS, whereas other accounts suggest that misinterpretations or catastrophic beliefs play a pivotal role in the development of their psychopathology. Our goal was to evaluate these theoretical proposals by examining whether patients differed from controls in IS, MI, or both. Twenty-one anxiety disorders patients with panic attacks and 13 healthy controls completed a behavioral measure of IS motor heartbeat detection (HBD) and two questionnaires measuring MI. Findings: Patients did not differ from controls in IS. However, significant differences were found in MI measures. Patients presented increased worries in their beliefs about somatic sensations compared to controls. These results reflect a discrepancy between direct body sensing (IS) and reflexive thoughts about body states (MI). Conclusion: Our findings support the idea that hypervigilance to body symptoms is not necessarily a bottom-up dispositional tendency (where patients are hypersensitive about bodily signals), but rather a metacognitive process related to threatening beliefs about body/somatic sensations. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} carbon dioxide inhalation could induce panic anxiety {{in a group}} of rare lesion patients with focal bilateral amygdala damage. To further elucidate the amygdala-independent mechanisms leading to aversive emotional experiences, we retested two of these patients (B. G. and A. M.) to examine whether triggering palpitations and dyspnea via stimulation of non-chemosensory interoceptive channels would be sufficient to elicit panic anxiety. Participants rated their affective and sensory experiences following bolus infusions of either isoproterenol, a rapidly acting peripheral β-adrenergic agonist akin to adrenaline, or saline. Infusions were administered during two separate conditions: a panic induction and an assessment of cardiorespiratory interoception. Isoproterenol infusions induced anxiety in both patients, and full-blown panic in one (patient B. G.). Although both patients demonstrated signs of diminished awareness for cardiac sensation, patient A. M., who did not panic, reported a complete lack of awareness for dyspnea, suggestive of impaired respiratory interoception. These findings indicate that the amygdala {{may play a role in}} dynamically detecting changes in cardiorespiratory <b>sensation.</b> The induction <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> anxiety provides further evidence that the amygdala is not required for the conscious experience of fear induced via interoceptive sensory channels...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. Specific objectives include comparing and contrasting the genetic versus environmental factors that contribute to the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. Currently, there are four main theories to explain the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder: psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, and biological. Methodology: This is accomplished via a systematic review of evidence-based medicine. Search engines utilized included: MEDLINE FirstSearch, Medline PubMed, ProQuest Nursing, PsycINFO, Current Research and a bibliographic search of selected articles. Results: The best quality evidence indicates that between 40 - 60 % of the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder is due to genetics. Further, a body of good quality research states that environmental influences to the expression <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder; such as CO 2 reactivity, learned anxiety, and fear conditioning; may also be hereditable traits. Lifestyle choices, such as smoking, also play a role in the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. The evidence-based review does not support a role for the psychodynamic theory in the etiology <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. Conclusion: The majority <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder is due to genetics.

2500|$|In some cases, {{the attack}} may {{continue}} at unabated high intensity, or {{seem to be}} increasing in severity. Common symptoms of an attack include rapid heartbeat, perspiration, dizziness, dyspnea, trembling, uncontrollable fear such as: the fear of losing control and going crazy, the fear of dying [...] and hyperventilation.

40|$|Introduction. Panic {{attacks are}} {{characterized}} with sudden attacks of anxiety with numerous somatic symptoms, such as palpitations, tachycardia, tachypnea, nausea, vertigo. The {{objective of this}} study was to analyze symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks in patients with panic disorder, especially, to determine the specific relationship of somatic and neurological symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks in boundaries of somatic systems. Material and methods. The study sample consisted of 97 patients with primary diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder, without any acute, severe and unstable somatic illness. The presence and frequency <b>of</b> symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks were estimated by the Panic Disorder Questionnaire. Results. The study results indicate that the most frequent symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks were cardiological signs (heart pounding or racing) and trembling, followed by unsteady and fainting feeling symptoms, sweating, respiratory symptoms and gastroenterological symptoms. The results of correlation analyses indicate that symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks classified into cardio-vascular, gastro-enterological, respiratory and neuro-otological systems show statistically significant correlations. Conclusion. The results of analyses <b>of</b> symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks point to their intercorrelation. This specific association of the symptoms, if they are examined on their own in the patients, could lead to false clinical manifestation of some somatic illness. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze adequately and make the proper differential diagnosis <b>of</b> patients with <b>panic</b> disorder...|$|R

40|$|The effects <b>of</b> {{changes in}} <b>panic</b> {{appraisal}} dimensions during cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) on both short- and long-term improvement in panic disorder symptoms were examined. Panic disorder severity and panic appraisal measures {{were collected from}} 120 CBT-treated patients at pretreatment, post-treatment, and 6 -month follow-up. Several panic appraisal dimensions investigated in panic disorder and agoraphobia include (a) perceived likelihood <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> occurrence (i. e., anticipated panic), (b) perceived negative consequences <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> occurrence, and (c) perceived <b>panic</b> coping efficacy. <b>Of</b> those <b>panic</b> appraisal dimensions studied, change in anticipated panic during treatment emerged as the most potent predictor of short-term improvement across each of the major clinical status measures (i. e., panic attack frequency, agoraphobic avoidance, and anxiety). Change in perceived consequences <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> uniquely contributed to short-term improvement in both anxiety and global disability, and reduction in perceived panic coping efficacy was unique predictor of short-term improvement in only agoraphobic avoidance. Both changes in perceived consequences <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> and in anticipated panic uniquely contributed to long-term improvement in agoraphobic avoidance and anxiety, respectively. In addition, only change in perceived consequences <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> uniquely contributed to long-term improvement in global disability.

40|$|Copyright © 2002 RMIT PublishingThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the degree to which fearful and catastrophic cognitions, and self-efficacy for managing panic predicted various panic attack characteristics in panic disorder. The cognitive variables consisted of anxiety sensitivity, the frequency of fearful agoraphobic cognitions and measures of catastrophic misinterpretation <b>of</b> symptoms. The <b>panic</b> parameters were number and severity <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> symptoms, distress associated with panic attacks, worry about future <b>panics,</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder, and life interference due to panic disorder. These variables were measured in 40 people with <b>panic</b> disorder, 31 <b>of</b> whom also had significant agoraphobia. The frequency of fearful agoraphobic cognitions was the strongest predictor <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attack symptomatology, predicting number of symptoms, symptom severity and degree of anticipatory fear <b>of</b> <b>panic.</b> Catastrophic misinterpretation <b>of</b> symptoms and anxiety sensitivity did not independently predict any panic parameters. Only self-efficacy for managing the rapid build-up <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> symptoms was specifically related to panic severity. The results therefore suggest that cognitive behaviour therapy for panic symptoms in panic disorder should reduce fearful cognitions rather than focus on panic coping strategies. The results offer little support for the contribution of the expectancy or catastrophic misinterpretation theories to the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder.

TYPE OF STUDY: Randomized study with clonazepam and placebo. SETTING: Outpatient Anxiety and Depression Unit of the Institute of Psychiatry, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 34 patients with a diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder with agoraphobia, between 18 and 55 years old. PROCEDURES: Administration of clonazepam or placebo for 6 weeks, in panic disorder patients, after they were classified within two subtypes <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder: respiratory and non-respiratory. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Changes in the number <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks {{in comparison with the}} period before the beginning of the study; Hamilton Anxiety Scale; Global Clinical Impression Scale; and Patient's Global Impression scale.

40|$|Background: Although panic {{disorder}} {{is generally considered}} to be a chronic condition, {{little is known about the}} natural history <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks and the factors predicting the prognosis <b>of</b> <b>panic.</b> It is expected that data derived from the community show more variation in the prognosis <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> and that subjects with less severe, 'subthreshold {{panic disorder}}' have a better prognosis. Methods: Using a large, representative population-based study, the 2 -year course <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks and its predictors were investigated among 155 subjects with panic disorder and subthreshold panic disorder. Presence and frequency of attacks were studied using structured interviews. Putative risk-indicators of chronicity included socio-demographics, psychobiological, environmental, psychiatric and panic-related factors. Results: Thirty-nine percent <b>of</b> those with <b>panic</b> disorder and 17 % of those with subthreshold panic disorder reported panic episodes during more than 75 % of the observed time periods in the Life Chart Interview. Forty-three percent <b>of</b> those with <b>panic</b> disorder and 14 % of those with subthreshold panic disorder reported over 24 attacks per 3 -month period. Male gender, severity <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> and agoraphobia predicted a high proportion of time spent in panic episodes. Low self-esteem, limited positive life events and severity <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> predicted highly frequent attacks. Limitations: The sample size was small, thereby limiting statistical power. The reported outcome may have overestimated chronicity. Conclusions: As was expected, the 2 -year prognosis <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> was more varied than is often found in clinical studies. Although subthreshold panic disorder had a more favourable prognosis than full-blown panic disorder, a sizeable proportion of those with subthreshold panic disorder had an unfavourable prognosis. © 2009 Elsevier B.

Evidence for additional dimensions such as a cardiac dimension and the allocation of several <b>of</b> the <b>panic</b> attack symptom criteria is less consistent. Clarifying the dimensional structure <b>of</b> the <b>panic</b> attack symptoms should help to specify the relationship of potential risk factors like anxiety sensitivity and fear of suffocation to the experience <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attacks and the development <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> disorder. Method. In an outpatient multicentre study 350 panic patients with agoraphobia rated the intensity {{of each of the}} ten DSM-IV bodily symptoms during a typical panic attack. The factor structure of these data was investigated with nonlinear confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The identified bodily symptom dimensions were related to panic cognitions, anxiety sensitivity and fear of suffocation by means of nonlinear structural equation modelling (SEM). Results. CFA indicated a respiratory, a vestibular/mixed somatic and a cardiac dimension of the bodily symptom criteria. These three factors were differentially associated with specific panic cognitions, different anxiety sensitivity facets and suffocation fear. Conclusions. Taking into account the dimensional structure <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attack symptoms may help to increase the specificity of the associations between the experience <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> attack symptoms and various panic related constructs...|$|R

Results: Symptoms indexing ‘choking’, ‘fear of dying’, and ‘tingling/numbness’ are some of the more severe symptoms <b>of</b> <b>panic</b> whilst ‘heart racing’, ‘short of breath’, ‘tremble/shake’, ‘dizzy/faint’, and ‘perspire’ are some of the least severe symptoms. Significant levels of DIF were detected in the ‘perspire’ symptom between males and females and the ‘fear of dying’ symptom between young and old respondents. Limitations: The current study was limited to examining cross-sectional data from respondents who had experienced at least one panic attack across their lifetime. Conclusions: The findings of the current study provide additional information regarding panic symptoms in the general population that may enable researchers and clinicians to further refine the detection of ‘at-risk’ individuals who experience threshold and sub-threshold levels <b>of</b> <b>panic...</b>|$|R
