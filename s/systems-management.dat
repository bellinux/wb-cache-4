50|$|The SEI is {{also the}} home of the CERT/CC (CERT Coordination Center), a federally funded {{computer}} security organization. The SEI CERT Program's primary goals are to ensure that appropriate technology and <b>systems-management</b> practices are used to resist attacks on networked systems and to limit damage and ensure continuity of critical services in spite of successful attacks, accidents, or failures. The SEI CERT program is working with US-CERT to produce the Build Security In (BSI) website, which provides guidelines for building security into every phase of the software development lifecycle. The SEI has also conducted research on insider threats and computer forensics. Results of this research and other information now populate the CERT Virtual Training Environment.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} is described that compares {{the use of}} redundant color coding for search and identification tasks under dual-task conditions; subjects made judgments {{about the state of}} components of a <b>systems-management</b> display while performing a compensatory tracking task. The availability of redundant color coding on the secondary task resulted in a global improvement in tracking performance (primary task) that applied at all times, even when subjects were not attending to the systems-managment display. With regard to the response-time data for the color-coded display, redundant color coding improved search performance, but there was no benefit for performance on the identification task. The implications of the results for hypotheses relating to the serial or parallel processing of shape and color, and for cockpit applications generally, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Collaborative {{prediction}} (CP) is {{a problem}} of predicting unobserved entries in sparsely observed matrices, e. g. product ratings by different users in online recommender systems. However, the quality of prediction may be quite sensitive to the choice of available samples, which motivates active sampling approaches. In this paper, we suggest an active sampling method based on the recently proposed Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF) [7], a linear factor model that was shown to outperform state-of-art collaborative prediction techniques. MMMF is formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP) that finds a low-norm (rather than traditional low-rank) matrix factorization, and is also closely related to learning max-margin linear discriminants (SVMs). This relation to SVMs inspires several margin-based active sampling heuristics that augment MMMF and demonstrate promising results in a variety of practical domains, including both traditional recommender systems and novel <b>systems-management</b> applications such as predicting latency and bandwidth in computer networks.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} <b>systems-management</b> {{approach}} that enables administrators to effectively handle {{the challenge of}} increasing numbers of hosts, routers, users, and services in the networks to manage. Our approach is to map the actions of an administrator on a single host (such as creating a new user account) to the network at large, while maintaining the exact same interface. Our system amplifies the administrator’s actions appropriately throughout the network, and confirms the correct propagation of all configuration changes throughout the distributed system. We argue that this approach allows administrators to easily manage several aspects of a large domain, because it provides a familiar and intuitive interface. Such a system {{can be used as}} a front-end to any other automation system used to manage large domains. To determine the feasibility of our approach, we implemented it on the OpenBSD system. We discuss the prototype implementation, along with the limitations to our approach that it exposes. I...|$|E
40|$|The sleek {{exterior}} of a human-rated spacecraft gives little hint {{to the very}} complex (and often interconnected) guidance and navigation systems, propulsion systems, electrical and mechanical power generation and delivery systems, command and data processing systems, communication systems, and environmental control and life support systems that lie within. Operating a spacecraft is thus a combination of familiar flight-related activities, such as docking with another orbital vehicle, and less well-known <b>systems-management</b> activities, such as diagnosing and recovering from mechanical faults and failures. NASA is currently designing {{a new generation of}} crewed spacecraft to return humans to the moon and explore destinations beyond. A fundamental issue for the designers of these vehicles is how to divide operational duties between crewmembers and onboard computers. The issue of human-automation function allocation is not new. By the early 1960 ’s, experience with supersonic aircraft had already established that many flight-related operations, such as real-time vehicle guidance, navigation, and trajectory adjustment during ascent and entry...|$|E
40|$|Computers {{and their}} {{interfaces}} {{are part of}} the spaces from which social reality emerges. They are indicators of direct and indirect cultural negotiations between the networks of production and consumption of these technologies. Technology is thus conceived as not only a product, but also as part of a cultural process of encoding and decoding. This implies a new concept of the Human-Computer relationship that breaks the prevalent idea of symmetry between human and computers as abstract information processing entities, i. e. it re-humanizes users as persons and re-locates computers and its interfaces as tools in real sociocultural settings. The paper briefly discusses the main theoretical strands that study the shaping of computer systems design and use by context and culture. These are Situated Action, the Semiotic perspective, Scenario-based Design, Activity theory, and the <b>Systems-Management</b> approach. Further, the role of ethnography, qualitative methods and intercultural studies are discussed as important contributors {{to a better understanding of}} the significance of context and culture in computer use and design. The Hermeneutic approach of Gadamer and Winograd and the idea of technology as interpretatively flexible text shaped by specific genres and tastes, serve as the main cornerstone of this discussion. A starting theoretical framework composed of three cultural dimensions (workplace, tool-related, and personal background) is proposed for researching the role of culture in systems and interface use and design. The main reflection from this discussion is that the question “Does this technology make sense for them?” is rarely made in pursuit of successful systems design. Therefore, the direction for research presented here tries to answer the question of how people situated in concrete cultural configurations make sense of computer systems...|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. A {{constraint}} {{is anything}} that limits a system's performance relative to its goal. The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a <b>systems-management</b> philosophy developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt {{since the early}} 1980 's {{in a series of}} non-fiction books, articles and novels. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} understand the nature of the small business environment and the constraints it has to deal with. It is further part of this goal to determine if TOC could be made applicable in the small organisation. This goal is accomplished in the form of a literature study on the small business sector as well as on TOC. The method centres on gathering and analysing information from various literature sources. TOC's fundamental message is that constraints determine the performance of any system, and any system contains only a few constraints. Constraints may be found within or outside a company. A production bottleneck, which can limit the overall profitability of a manufacturing firm, is an example of an internal constraint. An external constraint could be a lack of customer orders. TOC suggests that the goal of for -profit firms is making money, and constraints must be effectively managed if this goal is to be achieved. This is then also the goal of most small businesses, i. e. to be profitable. They need to be profitable in order to survive. The survival and growth of the small business sector is critical to the social and economic development of South Africa. Small enterprises are an integral part of a healthy economy. They increase competitiveness, contribute a great deal to job-creation and can provide long-term jobs for millions. Small businesses faces however a wide range of constraints. These constraints should be addressed in order to sustain growth in the small business sector...|$|E
