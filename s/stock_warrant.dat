5000|$|The {{losses at}} AIGFP caused credit {{agencies}} to downgrade the credit {{rating of the}} entire AIG corporation in September 2008. The resulting liquidity crisis essentially bankrupted all of AIG. Many [...] believed that AIG was {{too big to fail}} and that an AIG bankruptcy could cause an already fragile financial system to collapse, prompting the Federal Reserve Bank to extend an $85 billion line of credit to AIG. As a result, the Federal Reserve was issued a <b>stock</b> <b>warrant</b> for 79.9% of the equity in AIG, effectively nationalizing the world's largest insurer. Shortly after, then treasury secretary, Henry Paulson announced the treasury's desire to break up and liquidate most of AIG. The company has since been selling off many of its subsidiaries in order to raise the cash necessary to pay back the Federal Reserve. AIG is currently in the process of closing AIGFP.|$|E

5000|$|As an {{alternative}} to <b>stock</b> <b>warrants,</b> companies may compensate their employees with stock appreciation rights (SARs). A single SAR is {{a right to be}} paid the amount by which the market price of one share of stock increases after a period of time. In this context, [...] "appreciation" [...] means the amount by which a stock price increases after a time period. In contrast with compensation by <b>stock</b> <b>warrants,</b> an employee does not need to pay an outlay of cash or own the underlying stock to benefit from a SAR plan. In arrangements where the holder may select the date on which to redeem the SARs, this plan is a form of stock option.|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{government}} {{interventions to}} recapitalize a banking sector that restricts lending to firms because of debt overhang. We {{find that the}} efficient recapitalization program injects capital against preferred <b>stock</b> plus <b>warrants</b> and conditions implementation on sufficient bank participation. Preferred <b>stock</b> plus <b>warrants</b> reduces opportunistic participation by banks {{that do not require}} recapitalization, while conditional implementation limits free riding by banks that benefit from lower credit risk because of other banks' participation. Efficient recapitalization is profitable if the benefits of lower aggregate credit risk exceed the cost of implicit transfers to bank debt holders. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} intraday {{interdependence of}} returns and trades between Chinese equity and warrants markets {{based on a}} vector autoregression framework proposed by Chan et al.

However, when the data frequency is reduced from 100 seconds to 5 minutes, we find that stock volume has {{a negative impact on}} contemporaneous stock returns, which contradicts the informational effect of stock-trading activities.
