5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} from the plane to the sphere and other quadratic surfaces. For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using <b>stereographic</b> projection. Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the <b>stereographic</b> projection. Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E
5|$|Circle inversions {{correspond}} to {{a subset of}} Möbius transformations on the Riemann sphere. The planar Apollonius problem can {{be transferred to the}} sphere by an inverse <b>stereographic</b> projection; hence, solutions of the planar Apollonius problem also pertain to its counterpart on the sphere. Other inversive solutions to the planar problem are possible besides the common ones described below.|$|E

5|$|In 1861, Rossier was in Siam, {{where he}} {{assisted}} the French zoologist Firmin Bocourt by taking ethnographic portraits for the latter's scientific expedition of 18611862, and in 1863, Negretti and Zambra issued {{a series of}} 30 <b>stereographic</b> portraits and landscapes taken in Siam that are almost certainly the work of Rossier.

25|$|Intuitively, then, the <b>stereographic</b> {{projection}} {{is a way}} of picturing {{the sphere}} as the plane, with some inevitable compromises. Because the sphere and the plane appear in many areas of mathematics and its applications, so does the <b>stereographic</b> projection; it finds use in diverse fields including complex analysis, cartography, geology, and photography. In practice, the projection is carried out by computer or by hand using a special kind of graph paper called a <b>stereographic</b> net, shortened to stereonet, or Wulff net.|$|E
25|$|Geometrically, a Möbius {{transformation}} can {{be obtained}} by first performing <b>stereographic</b> projection from the plane to the unit two-sphere, rotating and moving the sphere to a new location and orientation in space, and then performing <b>stereographic</b> projection (from the new position of the sphere) to the plane.|$|E
50|$|Philips solved a {{significant}} problem with electronic displays in the mid-1990s by slanting the cylindrical lenses {{with respect to the}} underlying pixel grid. Based on this idea, Philips produced its WOWvx line until 2009, running up to 2160p (a resolution of 3840×2160 pixels) with 46 viewing angles.

25|$|Although any <b>stereographic</b> {{projection}} misses {{one point}} on the sphere (the projection point), the entire sphere can be mapped using two projections from distinct projection points. In other words, the sphere can be covered by two <b>stereographic</b> parametrizations (the inverses of the projections) from the plane. The parametrizations can be chosen to induce the same orientation on the sphere. Together, they describe the sphere as an oriented surface (or two-dimensional manifold).|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 The Line Integral Convolution (LIC) is a {{mainstay}} of flow visualization. It is, however, computationally intensive, which limits its interactivity. Also, when used to view three-dimensional (3 D) vector fields, the resulting images are dense and cluttered, {{making it difficult to}} perceive the flow on the interior parts of the field. This thesis describes research to make the 3 D LIC more interactive by implementing it on the Graphics Processor Unit (GPU). It also includes methods to improve the clarity of the 3 D LIC images. The volume dataset and a 3 D noise volume are placed in GPU memory as 3 D textures. The GPU is then used to perform the LIC computations and display the resulting volume. This allows the user to dynamically adjust LIC parameters and derive more insight into the 3 D flow field. Various techniques such as introduction of sparsity and the use of <b>stereographics</b> help to de-clutter the scene. Resulting images and timing benchmarks are included...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{new techniques}} for interactive input and manipulation of three-dimensional data using a motion tracking system {{combined with an}} autostereoscopic display. Users interact with the system by means of video cameras that track a light source or a user’s hand motions in space.

We then synthesize two to nine images as seen by virtual cameras observing the objects and interlace them to drive the autostereoscopic display. The light source is tracked within a separate interaction space, so that users interact with images appearing {{both inside and outside}} the display. With some displays that use nine images inside a viewing zone (such as the SG 202 autostereoscopic display from <b>StereoGraphics),</b> user head tracking is not necessary because there is a built-in left right look-around capability.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} experimental measurements and comparison of human interaction {{with three different}} types of stereo computer displays. We compare traditional shutter glasses-based viewing with three-dimensional (3 D) autostereoscopic viewing on displays such as the Sharp LL- 151 - 3 D display and <b>StereoGraphics</b> SG 202 display. The method of interaction is a sphere-shaped “cyberprop ” containing an Ascension Flock-of-Birds tracker that allows a user to manipulate objects by imparting {{the motion of the}} sphere to the virtual object. The tracking data is processed with OpenGL to manipulate objects in virtual 3 D space, from which we synthesize two or more images as seen by virtual cameras observing them. We concentrate on the quantitative measurement and analysis of human performance for interactive object selection and manipulation tasks using standardized and scalable configurations of 3 D block objects. The experiments use a series of progressively more complex block configurations that are rendered in stereo on various 3 D displays. In general, performing the tasks using shutter glasses required less time as compared to using the autostereoscopic displays. While both male and female subjects performed almost equally fast with shutter glasses, male subjects performed better with the LL- 151 - 3 D display, while female subjects performed better with the SG 202 display.

Stereoviewing for Interactive and Published Scientific Visualization The benefits of using stereoviewing in entertainment and scientific visualization are well known. By simulating human binocular vision, stereo imagery can greatly enhance a user’s understanding and enjoyment of a 3 D scene. The methods for simulating the views seen by the left and right eyes are fairly straightforward. If this is a real scene, then two cameras are typically used, each one separated by a distance that approximates the eye separation distance.
