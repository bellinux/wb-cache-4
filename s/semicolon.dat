5|$|Unlike {{function}} and class names, variable names are case sensitive. Both double-quoted ("") and heredoc strings provide {{the ability to}} interpolate a variable's value into the string. PHP treats newlines as whitespace {{in the manner of}} a free-form language, and statements are terminated by a <b>semicolon.</b> PHP has three types of comment syntax: /* */ marks block and inline comments; // as well as # are used for one-line comments. The echo statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text, e.g., to a web browser.|$|E
25|$|The comma {{operator}} separates expressions (which have value) {{in a way}} {{analogous to}} how the <b>semicolon</b> terminates statements, and sequences of expressions are enclosed in parentheses analogously to how sequences of statements are enclosed in braces: (a, b, c) is a sequence of expressions, separated by commas, which evaluates to the last expression c while {a; b; c;} is a sequence of statements, and does not evaluate to any value. A comma can only occur between two expressions – commas separate expressions – unlike the <b>semicolon,</b> which occurs {{at the end of}} a (non-block) statement – semicolons terminate statements.|$|E
25|$|Its use is {{consistent}} with other means of separating items in a list (for example, when semicolons are used to separate items, a <b>semicolon</b> {{is consistent}}ly included before the last item even when and or or is present).|$|E
5000|$|The comma {{operator}} has {{the lowest}} precedence of any C operator, and acts as a sequence point.

25|$|Historically, a {{sentence}} used {{to end with}} either a single bar । (“pūrna virāmam”) or a double bar ॥ (“dīrgha virāmam”); in handwriting, Telugu words were not separated by spaces.

25|$|Quebec French {{has some}} {{typographical}} differences from European French. For example, in Quebec French, unlike European French, a full non-breaking space {{is not used}} before the <b>semicolon,</b> exclamation mark, or question mark. Instead, a thin space (which according to Le Ramat de la typographie normally measures {{a quarter of an}} em) is used; this thin space can be omitted in word-processing situations where the thin space is assumed to be unavailable, or when careful typography is not required.|$|E
25|$|To {{show the}} length of a note, several devices are used. If the {{duration}} of note is to be doubled, the letter is either capitalized (if using Roman script) or lengthened by a diacritic (in Indian languages). For a duration of three, the letter is capitalized (or diacriticized) and followed by a comma. For a length of four, the letter is capitalized (or diacriticized) and then followed by a <b>semicolon.</b> In this way any duration can be indicated using a series of semicolons and commas.|$|E
25|$|JavaScript {{supports}} {{much of the}} {{structured programming}} syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: JavaScript originally had only function scoping with var. ECMAScript 2015 added keywords let and const for block scoping, meaning JavaScript now has both function and block scoping. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic <b>semicolon</b> insertion, which allows the semicolons that would normally terminate statements to be omitted.|$|E
50|$|<b>Semicolons</b> are {{optional}} in {{a number}} of languages, including BCPL, Eiffel, and Go, meaning that {{they are part of the}} formal grammar for the language, but can be inferred in many or all contexts (e.g. by end of line that ends a statement (in Go)). As languages can be designed without them, <b>semicolons</b> are considered an unnecessary nuisance by some.|$|R
50|$|SuperPascal is a block {{structured}} language, {{with the same}} basic syntax as Pascal. A program consists of a header, global variable definitions, function or procedure definitions and a main procedure. Functions and procedures consists of blocks, where a block {{is a set of}} statements. Statements are separated by <b>semicolons,</b> as opposed to languages like C or Java, where they are terminated by <b>semicolons.</b>|$|R

25|$|The syntax of Ruby is broadly {{similar to}} that of Perl and Python. Class and method {{definitions}} are signaled by keywords, whereas code blocks can be both defined by keywords or braces. In contrast to Perl, variables are not obligatorily prefixed with a sigil. When used, the sigil changes the semantics of scope of the variable. For practical purposes there is no distinction between expressions and statements. Line breaks are significant and taken as the end of a statement; a <b>semicolon</b> may be equivalently used. Unlike Python, indentation is not significant.|$|E
500|$|In Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri punctuation, various {{combinations}} of dots {{were used as}} word dividers and to separate phrases, clauses, and paragraphs. In monumental inscriptions and manuscripts of 5th to 10th centuries, these were written as dashes, like , = and =. In the 10th century, clusters of one (·), two (:), three (...) and six (჻჻) dots (later sometimes small circles) were introduced by Ephrem Mtsire to indicate increasing breaks in the text. One dot indicated a [...] "minor stop" [...] (presumably a simple word break), two dots marked or separated [...] "special words", three dots for a [...] "bigger stop" [...] (such as the appositive name and title [...] "the sovereign Alexander", below, or {{the title of the}} Gospel of Matthew, above), and six dots were to indicate the end of the sentence. Starting in the 11th century, marks resembling the apostrophe and comma came into use. An apostrophe was used to mark an interrogative word, and a comma appeared {{at the end of an}} interrogative sentence. From the 12th century on, these were replaced with the <b>semicolon</b> (the Greek question mark). In the 18th century, Patriarch Anton I of Georgia reformed the system again, with commas, single dots, and double dots used to mark [...] "complete", [...] "incomplete", and [...] "final" [...] sentences, respectively. For the most part, Georgian today uses the punctuation as in international usage of the Latin script.|$|E
500|$|Although it wagered only $947 on the clue, Watson was {{the only}} {{contestant}} to miss the Final Jeopardy! response in the category U.S. CITIES ("Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero; its second largest, for a World War II battle"). Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago, but Watson's response was [...] "What is Toronto?????" [...] Ferrucci offered reasons why Watson would appear to have guessed a Canadian city: categories only weakly suggest the type of response desired, the phrase [...] "U.S. city" [...] did {{not appear in the}} question, there are cities named Toronto in the U.S., and Toronto in Ontario has an American League baseball team. Dr. Chris Welty, who also worked on Watson, suggested that {{it may not have been}} able to correctly parse the second part of the clue, [...] "its second largest, for a World War II battle" [...] (which was not a standalone clause despite it following a <b>semicolon,</b> and required context to understand that it was referring to a second-largest airport). Eric Nyberg, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team, stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable. Although not displayed to the audience as with non-Final Jeopardy! questions, Watson's second choice was Chicago. Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson's confidence threshold, at 14% and 11% respectively. (This lack of confidence was the reason for the multiple question marks in Watson's response.) ...|$|E
