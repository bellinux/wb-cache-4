5|$|The {{concept of}} {{evolution}} was widely accepted in scientific circles {{within a few}} years of the publication of Origin, but the acceptance of natural selection as its driving mechanism was much less widespread. The four major alternatives to natural selection in the late 19th century were theistic evolution, neo-Lamarckism, orthogenesis, and saltationism. Alternatives supported by biologists at other times included <b>structuralism,</b> Georges Cuvier's teleological but non-evolutionary functionalism, and vitalism.|$|E
5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme {{of the book is}} that biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated <b>structuralism</b> as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|Preface to Plato had a {{profound}} impact almost immediately after publication, but an impact that was complex and inconsistent. The book's claims refer to the ideas of a number of different fields: the study (then fairly new) of oral literature as well as Greek philosophy and Greek philology; the book also acknowledges the influence of literary theory, particularly <b>structuralism.</b> The 1960s were a period in which those fields were growing further apart, and the reaction to Preface from each of them was starkly different. Among classicists the response ranged from indifference to derision, with the majority simply questioning the details of Havelock's history of literacy, pointing both to earlier instances of writing than Havelock thinks possible or to later instances of oral influence. Philosophy, particularly Platonic scholarship, was moving in a different direction at the time, and Havelock neither engages nor was cited by the principal movers in that field. However, the book was embraced by literary theorists, students of the transition to literacy, and others in fields as diverse as psychology and anthropology.|$|E

5000|$|Post-structuralists such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida {{rejected}} <b>structuralism's</b> {{insistence on}} fixed meaning, its privileging of a meta-linguistic standpoint; but continued {{all the more}} to problematize the human subject, favoring the term [...] "the decenter-ed subject" [...] which implies the absence of human agency. Derrida, arguing that the fundamentally ambiguous nature of language makes intention unknowable, attacked Enlightenment perfectionism, and condemned as futile the existentialist quest for authenticity {{in the face of}} the all-embracing network of signs.

25|$|The structuralist mode of {{reasoning}} {{has been applied}} in a diverse range of fields, including anthropology, sociology, psychology, literary criticism, economics and architecture. The most prominent thinkers associated with <b>structuralism</b> include Claude Lévi-Strauss, linguist Roman Jakobson, and psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. As an intellectual movement, <b>structuralism</b> was initially presumed to be the heir apparent to existentialism. However, by the late 1960s, many of structuralism's basic tenets came under attack from {{a new wave of}} predominantly French intellectuals such as the philosopher and historian Michel Foucault, the philosopher and social commentator Jacques Derrida, the Marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, and the literary critic Roland Barthes. Though elements of their work necessarily relate to <b>structuralism</b> and are informed by it, these theorists have generally been referred to as post-structuralists. In the 1970s, <b>structuralism</b> was criticized for its rigidity and ahistoricism. Despite this, many of structuralism's proponents, such as Lacan, continue to assert an influence on continental philosophy and many of the fundamental assumptions of some of structuralism's post-structuralist critics are a continuation of <b>structuralism.</b>|$|E

40|$|Two {{enduring}} {{legacies of}} mid-twentieth century Structuralist theory are the typological approach to literary subgenres {{and the idea}} of the Death of the Author, which rules authorial intention irrelevant in the interpretation of the text. The article demonstrates how both of these influential approaches to literary criticism are put into question by certain texts on the fringes of pastiche. The 'possible pastiche', for which the author's intention to imitate a textual model is unclear, troubles the boundaries of any typology of hypertexts that would set clear limits to its categories. In the continuum of rewritings that extends beyond <b>Structuralism's</b> best-fit categories, only the restoration of authorial intention preserves the terms parody and pastiche from expansion into all-encompassing redundancy...|$|R

He contends that Structuralist commentaries does not provide much in terms of enjoying and understanding poetry because it says almost nothing to get us in close touch with the lived experience of poet and the world of his work. Phenomenological approach, on the contrary, moves from noema toward noesis and as such gives a way {{to the world of the}} work and yields an aesthetic understanding of it.

Drawing on Charles Tilly’s work on collective violence and Michael Mann’s work on ethnic cleansing, this paper attempts to identify the crucial mechanisms turning nationalism violent. Some of the usual suspects involved in nationalism and violence are familiar from the nationalism literature.

40|$|This paper compares {{some studies}} {{in the field of}} {{economics}} and management in order to identify an innovative model of strategic management in reference to complex products. The work starting from (after having taken a critical look at) a critical analysis of structuralist studies, highlights the need to move from industry analysis to business analysis to define strategies, later on it offers a new definition of Product - increasingly made up of good /goods + service/services and subsequently seen as commodities - as well as a new definition of Consumer - as a person searching for characteristics in products and then seen as “usumer”. Such definitions underlie a model that allows the analysis of both market structure and market “soul”. The <b>structuralism’s</b> limitations – thanks to a brief analysis of literature – are considered outweighed by business models, among which one in particular is Abell’s model defining the (SBA) Strategic Business Areas. This study, after considering complex products and usumer, aims to complete Abell’s model and to provide a revision of it, in order to suggest new guidelines and interpretations mainly aimed to complex products such as the “Made in Italy”...|$|R

40|$|Economic growth {{driven by}} the {{creation}} of new ideas, knowledge, and innovations is an interesting and challenging phenomenon to be modelled and analysed. Dominant approaches, like Romer’s endogenous growth models, Aghion-Howitt creative destruction growth models, RBC models, or the not so dominant ones, like that of the Neo-Austrians, of industrial <b>structuralisms,</b> or Nelson and Winter’s evolutionary theory, emphasize the need for modelling innovations in a comprehensive manner but fail to encapsulate the intrinsic indeterminacies of the innovational process in an insightful manner. Romer (1986, 1990, 1993), in his seminal works, has stressed the importance of modelling ideas and knowledge and showed how ideas can be encoded as information bit-strings, using the chemistry set metaphor. Zambelli (2004, 2005) developed the idea further, modelling an innovation process as a Turing Machine (TM) process and applied the TM metaphor within Romer’s endogenous growth model in an interesting way. But due to the time-less property of the production function, the dynamic interactions between the production and innovational processes could not be explored in detail. In this paper, we harness the intrinsic indeterminacies within the TM metaphor to model process innovations and analyse its dynamic interactions with the production processes within a time to build framework. 3...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{looks at}} the healing {{practices}} of Main Peteri, a traditional-ritual form of Malay theatre, as an expression and evolution of local culture and knowledge. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to understand and highlight the uniqueness of local knowledge and culture within the trajectory of its community. The rituals of buka and tutup panggung, the concept of the angin/wind(s) and semangat/spirit/soul are seen within the context of local knowledge and the healing mechanisms of performance. This research situates main peteri as a communal theatre performed not only for the benefit of the sick person, but also for the performers and by extension, the community at large. This study is based on ethnographic investigations and recordings involving phenomenological observations and in-depth semiological interviews with key informants of the main peteri. This resarch is grounded on <b>structuralism's</b> intricate interpretations of relationships between elements of signifiers and signifieds in order to understand the unconscious mind of the sick persons, the practitioners and the community. This is achieved through a study of the form and the semiotics of the main peteri theatre. The binary relationships between religious restraints/edicts and modernists approaches, the concerns of purists-traditionalists and accomodators-innovators of this theatre form are juxtaposed within the parameters of cultural change, innovation and development. It concludes by analyzing traditional theatre's re-positioning as it confronts an information-technology driven world...|$|R

Since the mid- 1990 s a new wave of research has formed around wider debates in the humanities and social sciences, such as decentering the subject, new analytics of power, reconsideration of one-dimensional time and three-dimensional space, attention to beyond-archival sources, alterity, Otherness, the invisible, and more. In addition, broader and contradictory impulses around the question of the nation - transnational, post-national, proto-national, and neo-national movements – have unearthed a new series of problematics and focused scholarly attention on traveling discourses, national imaginaries, and less formal processes of socialization, bonding, and subjectification. New Curriculum History challenges prior occlusions in the field, building upon and departing from previous waves of scholarship, extending the focus beyond the insularity of public schooling, the traditional framework of the self-contained nation-state, and the psychology of the schooled individual. Drawing on global studies, historical sociology, postcolonial studies, critical race theory, visual culture theory, disability studies, psychoanalytics, Cambridge school <b>structuralisms,</b> poststructuralisms, and infra- and transnational approaches the volume holds together not despite but because of differences and incommensurabilities in rereading historical records.
