5|$|Shortly after 0600UTC on January29, Firinga made {{landfall}} on Réunion {{while at}} peak intensity. It quickly crossed {{the island and}} began weakening; MFR downgraded the storm below cyclone status at 1200UTC that day. The JTWC followed <b>suit</b> <b>on</b> January30, {{and the next day}} Firinga began turning to the south. On February1, the JTWC discontinued advisories, although MFR continued tracking the storm. After turning to the east and executing a loop to the southwest, Firinga was last observed on February7.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, {{after missing}} the initial October 2015 deadline, Caltrain {{requested}} {{a third party}} review of the CBOSS project from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). APTA noted that Caltrain was not effectively managing the project schedule and cost because of generally poor communication between Caltrain's project management and Parsons, and Caltrain's project manager {{did not have the}} technical experience or authority to resolve technical and contractual issues with Parsons. In February 2017, Caltrain terminated its contract with Parsons for failure to perform on time and budget and announced potential litigation. Parsons filed <b>suit</b> <b>on</b> February 22, saying delays were due to changing client requirements and circumstances beyond their control. Caltrain filed suit a week later, seeking $98million in damages; although the system has been mostly installed, testing is still incomplete.|$|E

5|$|Construction of two prototypes {{began in}} February 1965: 001, built by Aérospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at Filton, Bristol. Concorde 001 {{made its first}} test flight from Toulouse on 2 March 1969, piloted by André Turcat, and first went {{supersonic}} on 1 October. The first UK-built Concorde flew from Filton to RAF Fairford on 9 April 1969, piloted by Brian Trubshaw. Both prototypes were presented {{to the public for}} the first time on 7–8 June 1969 at the Paris Air Show. As the flight programme progressed, 001 embarked on a sales and demonstration tour on 4 September 1971, which was also the first transatlantic crossing of Concorde. Concorde 002 followed <b>suit</b> <b>on</b> 2 June 1972 with a tour of the Middle and Far East. Concorde 002 made the first visit to the United States in 1973, landing at the new Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport to mark that airport's opening.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before any}} {{construction}} work {{had started the}} cost of the forts had been estimated to exceed the previous calculations by fifty percent. In December 1901, only few months after the first blasting work that had been done at Gammelängsberget in July 1901, the cost for the four forts northeast of the river was expected to be sixty-five percent more expensive than the initial calculation. The blueprints of the forts at Degerberget, Gammelängsberget and Södra Åberget were the first to be confirmed, which happened on 11 May 1901. The fort at Mjösjöberget followed <b>suit</b> <b>on</b> 3 April 1902 and the last fort to get a confirmed blueprint was the fort at Rödberget, on 19 May 1903. The last proposed fort, at Paglaberget, was deleted from the plans in 1906along with the batteries at Fällberget and Slumpberget as well as the fortifications at Avan and Svartbyträsketbefore any work on the fort had started, due to the proposal of the new Fortification Committee of 1905, which was formed following the reports of the large rise in costs. On 9 February 1906, the current Minister for War Lars Tingsten calculated the total cost to end at 19,220,000 kronor, more than twice the cost reported by the 1897 committee.|$|E
5|$|Gellers was {{representing}} the Passamaquoddy pursuant to a 10% contingency fee agreement. Gellers, in turn, had assigned 40% of his fee to Bottomly. As the negotiations of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act were reaching a close in May 1978, even though neither Gellers nor Bottomly had performed any further {{work for the}} tribes, Bottomly filed suit in the District of Maine claiming he was entitled to a portion of any eventual settlement. On October 10, Judge Gignoux dismissed Bottomly's <b>suit</b> <b>on</b> the grounds of tribal sovereign immunity. When Bottomly's appeal came before the First Circuit in 1979, Maine filed an amicus brief arguing that the tribe was entitled to no such immunity. The First Circuit rejected this argument. A similar suit by Gellerswho had since been disbarred and {{changed his name to}} Tuvia Ben Shmuel Yosefwas thrown out in 1989.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, {{the tribe}} {{filed suit in}} the United States Court of Federal Claims, seeking $14,000,000 in damages for breach of trust by DOI. The tribe argued that the United States had {{exclusive}} control over the buildings and allowed them to fall into disrepair, {{a violation of the}} trust relationship established by the 1960 statute. Additionally, the tribe claimed that the Snyder Act and the National Historic Preservation Act applied in this case. The Snyder Act deals with appropriations to the BIA, and the National Historic Preservation Act discussed federal assistance for preservation programs. The United States moved for dismissal on the basis of lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. In addition, the United States claimed that the statute of limitations had run under both the Tucker Act and the Indian Tucker Act, the acts governing claims in the Federal Court of Claims. The trial court dismissed the <b>suit</b> <b>on</b> the failure to state a claim.|$|E
5|$|North of the Alps, Army Group G {{followed}} <b>suit</b> <b>on</b> 6 May. Kesselring now {{decided to}} surrender his own headquarters. He ordered Hausser {{to supervise the}} SS troops {{to ensure that the}} surrender was carried out in accordance with his instructions. Kesselring then surrendered to an American major at Saalfelden, near Salzburg, in Austria on 9 May 1945. He was taken to see Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, the commander of the 101st Airborne Division, who treated him courteously, allowing him to keep his weapons and field marshal's baton, and to visit the Eastern Front headquarters of Army Groups Centre and South at Zeltweg and Graz unescorted. Taylor arranged for Kesselring and his staff to move into a hotel at Berchtesgaden. Photographs of Taylor and Kesselring drinking tea together created a stir in the United States. Kesselring met with Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers, commander of the Sixth United States Army Group, and gave interviews to Allied newspaper reporters.|$|E
5|$|Button thus {{inherited}} the lead but reported to his team via radio {{that he was}} losing rear grip in his tyres after pushing hard. He made a pit stop on lap 18 and re-emerged in fourth. Hamilton attempted to pass Vettel around the outside heading into turn 12 on lap 18 {{but was unable to}} complete the manoveure after running deep into the corner. By the end of the 19th lap, all of the leading drivers had taken their pit stops. The running order was Webber leading with Vettel, Hamilton and Button in close attendance, then a 15-second gap back to Schumacher, Rosberg and Kubica. Massa in eighth was being caught by Petrov in ninth, and the two were followed by Alonso, Kobayashi, Sutil, de la Rosa, Alguersuari, Liuzzi, Hülkenberg, Kovalainen, Barrichello, Trulli, Glock, Senna, Buemi, di Grassi and Chandhok. The top nine drivers remained in the same positions in which they had qualified, and as the race continued, there was a threat of rain forecast by meteorological service Météo-France which was intensified by the hot weather and heavy clouds brewed {{to the west of the}} circuit. Trulli pulled off to the side of the track with an hydraulic failure, becoming the first retirement of the race on lap 35. Trulli's teammate Kovalainen followed <b>suit</b> <b>on</b> the following lap, after Kovalainen's power steering failed in turn eight which was followed by him not being able to operate his gearbox, clutch and throttle and his car was pushed into the Lotus garage to retire from the event.|$|E
