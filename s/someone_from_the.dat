5|$|Just before {{graduating from}} Millikin University in 1999, <b>someone</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> college {{recommended}} that West attend the GMA Music in the Rockies event for aspiring musicians. Although West {{was not interested}} at first, he attended after learning that other people signed him up and paid his entrance fee. He met a representative from Word Publishing at the event who took interest in him and kept in contact until he graduated. West landed in the finals of a songwriting competition and was offered a songwriting deal in July 1999, five weeks after graduating. After penning songs for well-known musicians like Billy Ray Cyrus and Rachael Lampa, he began touring the United States as an independent artist in 2000 and 2001.|$|E

30|$|Guarantees {{are closely}} related to microcredit. Part of the reason microentrepreneurs, {{especially}} poor ones, are not able to get loans is {{that they do not have}} collateral.

25|$|Toubou legal customs are {{generally}} based on Islamic law, that allows restitution and revenge. Murder, for example, is settled directly between {{the families of}} the victim and the murderer. Toubou honour requires that <b>someone</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> victim's family try to kill the murderer or a relative; such efforts eventually end with negotiations to settle the matter. Reconciliation follows the payment of the Goroga (Islamic tenet of Diyya), or blood money. Among the Tomagra clan of the Teda people in the Tibesti region, there is a derde (spiritual head). He is recognized as the clan judge, who arbitrates conflict and levies sanctions.|$|E

25|$|His {{nickname}} has a {{basis in}} this legend. “Chucho” {{is a common}} nickname for his given name “Jesús.” “El Roto” refers to his ability and tendency to dress in fine clothes, with “roto” referring to a well-dressed person, especially <b>someone</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> lower classes in fine clothing. In later literary works about him, this would be interpreted in various ways, either as his insulting the lower classes from which he came or as symbolize of his basic honor. Others acknowledge {{that he may have}} done so to avoid mistreatment prevalent against the poor of the time.|$|E
25|$|In Makidani, Yamasaki, Shisō District, Harima Province (now within Shisō, Hyōgo Prefecture), a tale {{was passed}} down {{about a person}} in Karakawa who was a bakeneko. The same kind of tale was also found in Taniguchi, Fukusaki village, Jinsai District, of the same province, where {{it is said that}} in Kongōjō-ji, a bakeneko who troubled a {{villager}} was killed by <b>someone</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> temple. This bakeneko was protected from arrows and bullets by a chagamas lid and an iron pot. These, like the legend of Susanoo's extermination of Yamata no Orochi, have a commonality in that the local old families of the area played a role.|$|E
25|$|Many provinces {{date back}} to semi-independent local chiefdoms or kingdoms, which made up the Ayutthaya kingdom. As today, the provinces were created around a capital city (mueang), and {{included}} surrounding villages or satellite towns. The provinces were administered either by a governor, who was appointed by the king; or by a local ruling family, who were descendants of the old local kings and princes of that area and had been given this privilege by the central king. De facto the king {{did not have much}} choice but to choose <b>someone</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local nobility or an economically strong man, as against these local power groups the administration would have become impossible. The governor was not paid by the king, but instead financed himself and his administration by imposing taxes by himself, thus effectively a kleptocracy. Every province was required to send an annual tribute to Bangkok.|$|E

25|$|According to the tale, three {{brothers}} evaded Death, who {{gave them a}} choice of anything they wanted. The first brother chose a wand {{that could not be}} defeated in battle, the second brother asked for a way to bring back <b>someone</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead, and the third brother selected a cloak that made the wearer invisible, even to Death himself. Eventually, the first brother was killed, the second committed suicide, and finally, the third brother made Death a friend and gave the cloak to his son. The story is generally believed to refer to the Peverell brothers centuries ago, although very few actually believe the story to be fully true. Dumbledore believed that the Peverells were simply particularly powerful and ingenious wizard inventors. The sign of the Deathly Hallows had also been adopted as a personal symbol by dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald; therefore many wizards, such as Viktor Krum, mistakenly understood it to be a symbol of dark magic.|$|E
25|$|The two {{accused in}} the case were already in police custody while the {{skeletal}} remains of the young children were being unearthed from behind {{and in front of}} Pandher's residence. An FIR had been filed on 7 October 2006. Investigations revealed that Payal's cellphone was being used although the SIM card she owned remained inactive. Through digital surveillance, the investigators were able to track down a number of people and could finally reach the man who sold the phone. The rickshaw cart puller affirmed that the phone belonged to <b>someone</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pandher residence. After the affirmation of the facts by the witness, Moninder Singh was called for interrogation, which subsequently revealed nothing. His aide and servant, Surinder Koli was picked up the next day and he confessed killing the woman and dumping her body behind the house. The police started digging and henceforth recovered the skeletal remains of the missing children instead of Payal.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the office of}} stadtholder was indispensable, the States of the five provinces with a vacancy could and would have {{appointed}} a successor, though not necessarily <b>someone</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Nassau families. As a matter of fact, there were the precedents of Willem IV van den Bergh and Adolf van Nieuwenaar in Gelderland in early Republican times. But the Holland regents did not feel a pressing need to appoint anyone, especially in view of recent events. They acted very quickly to undo the effects of William's coup, freeing the captive regents and reinstating them in their offices. The Gecommitteerde Raden (executive committee) of the States of Holland moved immediately to reassert their authority over the army and convened a plenary session of the States. Next Holland proposed in the States General that a so-called Great Assembly (a kind of constitutional convention) should be convened at short notice, to amend the Union of Utrecht.|$|E
