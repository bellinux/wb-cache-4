2500|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators. This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external <b>splitter</b> <b>box</b> called an [...] "External Recycle Mechanism" [...] or [...] "ERM" [...] box separate to the flotation cell. Thus, when {{the production of the}} feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased {{as a result of a}} fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell. This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries. In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems.|$|E

In the late 1980s many toy manufactures attempted to make toys that interacted with live television feeds, thus allowing children to play the television. An {{example of this is}} the 1987 Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future show, in which the toys reacted to the television show.|$|E
5000|$|A {{domestic}} supply typically {{consists of}} a large cable connected to a service head, the sealed box containing the main supply fuse, treated as the supply to the premises. This will typically have a value from 40-100 A. Separate [...] and neutral cables (tails) go from here to an electricity meter, and often an earth conductor too. More tails proceed from the meter into the consumer side of the installation and into a consumer unit (distribution board), {{or in some cases}} to a Henley block (a <b>splitter</b> <b>box</b> used in low voltage electrical engineering) and thence to more than one distribution board.|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to identify methods of achieving uniform flow distribution in compact irrigation <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes</b> over a wide range of flows but specifically operating at high flow rates. The hydraulic issues resulting from high flow rates in the boxes and their potential implications are discussed to provide a basis for the study. Two <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes,</b> one square and one rectangular in layout, were constructed for testing. Numerous improvement designs were developed, built, and installed in the boxes to inspect and measure their performance. Vertical perforated plates with varying hole diameter, perforated area porosity, and plate thickness succeeded in distributing the flow uniformly across the length of the weir. Data presented show the effectiveness of the various designs in improving the distribution and splitting the flow entering into the box. Vertical removable perforated plates are recommended to be installed in <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes</b> where uniform distribution is not currently achieved. Details for the designs that improved flow performance are discussed and the successful application of the designs into prototype <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes</b> is demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} work details {{an investigation}} into improving efficiency in pulverised-fuel- fired power stations. The particular area of focus is the splitter box; this {{is located in the}} pneumatic conveying pipeline within the power station. The conveying pipelines take the pulverised fuel from the mill to the burner face, at some point the air/fuel mixture has to be split to feed the individual burners. It is at these points that the <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes</b> occur, dividing the pipe into multiple legs. It is common for some of these splits to produce poor fuel balance between legs, leading to excess air being required for their combustion at the burner wall. The increased supply of air increases the chance of the formation of NOx gases as well as reducing the overall efficiency of the plant. The poor fuel balance is caused by a particle rope, a dense area of particle stratification that creates an area of high fuel density that is not easily divided by the <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes.</b> The objective of this work is to develop devices to improve the fuel balance at <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes.</b> The work involves {{an investigation into}} existing devices and station geometries to see why existing devices have not become commonplace in coal-fired power stations. It also involves conceptual design of devices and then their testing, both computationally and experimentally. Finally, the devices are assessed for their suitability for full-scale power station implementation. This thesis used both experimental and computational techniques to develop devices to overcome the problems at <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes</b> and successfully produced several devices that could be developed and deployed in full scale testing.

50|$|The initial default {{hardware}} implementation for AppleTalk was {{a high-speed}} serial protocol known as LocalTalk that used the Macintosh's built-in RS-422 ports at 230.4 kbit/s. LocalTalk used a <b>splitter</b> <b>box</b> in the RS-422 port {{to provide an}} upstream and downstream cable from a single port. The topology was a bus: cables were daisy-chained from each connected machine to the next, up to the maximum of 32 permitted on any LocalTalk segment. The system was slow by today's standards, {{but at the time}} the additional cost and complexity of networking on PC machines was such that it was common that Macs were the only networked personal computers in an office. Other larger computers, such as UNIX or VAX workstations, would commonly be networked via Ethernet.|$|E

This was mainly used in integrated rectangular cells (see Figure 6), where the feed tank and tailings recycling system could easily be built in a single unit with the flotation cell. This system reduced the cell installation costs and made the cell more compact. During this period, the orifice diameter was increased from the 28 mm design used in 1990 to 34 mm with the Mark II model and 38 mm in 1997. This, together with the larger Mark II downcomer diameter, allowed the slurry flow per downcomer to be doubled from 30 m3/h in 1990 to 60 m3/h in 1997.|$|E
40|$|In many {{irrigation}} systems and networks, {{there are multiple}} water users and shareholders who take their water from different locations along a single canal or pipeline. Often, irrigation splitter boxes are used to divert water to multiple shareholders from a single location. The splitter boxes, which can be small and compact, are generally installed at different locations along a piped irrigation supply line. The purpose of a <b>splitter</b> <b>box</b> is to split a specific amount of water so that each user receives their allotted portion, regardless of the flow rate in the system. Each <b>splitter</b> <b>box</b> usually includes two compartments, separated by a wall {{that acts as a}} weir for the water to flow over. The water in the supply pipe enters the box and fills the upstream compartment until it spills over the weir. As water flows over the weir, it is separated by vertical dividers. Each divider is positioned to split a certain percentage of the total flow to one of the outlet pipes, which carry the water to various destinations. In general, splitter boxes perform very well at lower flow rates. However, if high flow rates are present in the box, due to under-design of the box or for any reason, the water surface becomes turbulent and the flow profile over the weir becomes disturbed and nonuniform. Because of these conditions, the flow becomes unevenly distributed and an accurate flow split cannot be achieved. This study focuses on developing a solution that can be installed in flow splitter boxes to effectively dissipate energy and uniformly distribute the flow across the length of the weir during times of high flow rates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Electron Cyclotron Emission {{diagnostic}} on ITER requires {{electron temperature}} profile with 10 μsec time and 6 – 7 cm spatial resolution. The diagnostic is also useful to study many plasma physics phenomenon like temperature fluctuation, non-thermal electrons {{population and the}} power loss due to ECE. The conceptual design being considered for ITER ECE consist of a radiometer of frequency range 122 to 220 GHz for O-mode radiation measurement and two Fourier transform spectrometers of frequency range 70 to 1000 GHz as measuring instruments for O-mode and X-mode radiation measurement. There are two lines of sight for the collection of cyclotron radiation. One is radial view and other is oblique view at 10 degree [1]. The radiation collected by both view will be transmitted through the polarization <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes</b> and four transmission lines to the diagnostic area. In this paper we will summarize the conceptual design details and changes proposed at the Conceptual Design Review. The required calibration time for the ECE measuring instrument {{will be discussed in}} the paper. ...|$|R
40|$|The Double Chooz {{experiment}} is a reactor antineutrino experiment {{searching for a}} non-vanishing value of the neutrino mixing angle θ 13; it will commence operation in fall 2010. The scintillation light of the neutrino events is detected {{by a total of}} 390 photomultiplier tubes, and the subsequent data acquisition chain consists of <b>Splitter</b> <b>Boxes,</b> Frontend Electronics, the Trigger Board and Flash ADCs. This Diploma thesis describes certain properties of the photomultiplier tubes and their measurements, such as linearity characteristics at high light levels and afterpulse behaviour with respect to charge and time. The e ect of afterpulsing on the Double Chooz experiment has been estimated by converting the measured results, together with the trigger conditions, into a simulation. In order to allow for tests of the Double Chooz data acquistion chain in advance, Frontend Electronics, Flash ADCs and a 30 litre acrylic cylinder filled with the Double Chooz target scintillator {{have been added to the}} existing photomultiplier test facility at MPIK Heidelberg. The measurements of the gain of the Frontend Boards are discussed in this thesis. Furthermore the preparation and installation of the acrylic vessel is described and the detection of scintillation light of rst events produced by muons is presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{baseline}} {{design for}} the ITER electron cyclotron emission (ECE) diagnostic has entered the detailed preliminary design phase. Two plasma views are planned, a radial view and an oblique view that is sensitive to distortions in the electron momentum distribution near the average thermal momentum. Both views provide high spatial resolution electron temperature profiles when the momentum distribution remains Maxwellian. The ECE diagnostic system consists of the front-end optics, including two 1000 K calibration sources, in equatorial port plug EP 9, the 70 - 1000 GHz transmission system from the front-end to the diagnostics hall, and the ECE instrumentation in the diagnostics hall. The baseline ECE instrumentation will include two Michelson interferometers that can simultaneously measure ordinary and extraordinary mode ECE from 70 to 1000 GHz, and two heterodyne radiometer systems, covering 122 - 230 GHz and 244 - 355 GHz. Significant design challenges include 1) developing highly-reliable 1000 K calibration sources and the associated shutters/mirrors, 2) providing compliant couplings between the front-end optics and the polarization <b>splitter</b> <b>box</b> that accommodate displacements of the vacuum vessel during plasma operations and bake out, 3) protecting components from damage due to stray ECH radiation and other intense millimeter wave emission and 4) providing the low-loss broadband transmission system...|$|E
40|$|The Alyeska Pipeline Service Company (APSC) Ballast Water Treatment Facility (BWTF) at the {{terminus}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in Port Valdez, Alaska, treats and discharges {{an average}} of nine million gallons per day of oil-contaminated ballast water offloaded from the tankers utilizing the Port. This study quantifies the fractions of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene(s) (BTEX), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and saturated hydrocarbons (SHC) being removed {{at different stages of}} treatment inside the terminal and evaluates the relative importance of abiotic (aeration) versus microbial processes. Evaporation is the dominant removal mechanism for BTEX, lower-molecular-weight SHC, and possibly the naphthalenes in the dissolved air flotation (DAF) cells/weirs and in the <b>Splitter</b> <b>Box</b> distributing DAF effluent to the biological treatment tanks (BTTs). Within the BTTs, microbial degradation of BTEX is very efficient and essentially complete midway through the tanks. During the warmer months, SHC biodegradation within the BTT tanks is also very rapid, but PAH biodegradation is only partially complete before the effluent is discharged into Port Valdez, a sill-constricted, subarctic fjord. Both SHC and PAH biodegradation are limited within the BWTF during colder months. Alkylated PAH homologues that make up the discharged oil signal have been tracked via mussel and sediment samples from the Long-Term Environmental Monitoring Program (LTEMP) that has detected accidental discharges as well as the seasonally-controlled transport of BWTF-sourced dissolved- and particulate/oil-phase fractions throughout the Port. ...|$|E
40|$|The H- 02 Wetland Treatment System (Figure 1) is used {{to remove}} heavy metals (e. g., copper and zinc) from the H-Area process and storm water discharge. Routine flow enters an {{equalization}} basin by inlets on either the east (Location 1) or west end (Location 2). The west end influent constitutes 75 % of the average flow into the basin which has an average residence time of approximately 3 days at low pool (i. e., 120 gal/min. through a volume of 0. 5 million gallons). The water then exits via the basin outlet on the east end. Next, the water flows to a <b>splitter</b> <b>box</b> (Location 3) which evenly separates the flow between two wetland cells for a design flow of 60 gal/min. per wetland cell with a residence time in the cell of approximately 2 days. The wetland effluent is then combined (Location 4) and flows through a spillway before reaching the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) measurement point near Road 4. During initial operation, {{it was observed that}} the pH of the water leaving the equalization basin was elevated compared to the influent pH. Furthermore, the elevated pH remained through the wetland cells so that there was an average pH of 10 leaving the wetland cells during the daytime which exceeds the upper NPDES limit of 8. 5. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the cause of the increase in pH within the equalization basin of the H- 02 Wetland Treatment System. Possible mechanisms included algal activity and inorganic chemistry interactions (e. g., interactions with the clay and/or bentonite liner). Water quality parameters were evaluated throughout the H- 02 Wetland Treatment system and over time {{in order to determine the}} cause of high pH values measured in the basin and wetland. Fluctuations in dissolved oxygen (DO) and accompanying changes in pH would be expected in systems where algae are an influencing factor. An unexpected increase or decrease in the concentration of inorganic substances may indicate operational changes or an inorganic chemistry influence on pH. In addition, alternative methods to alleviate or mitigate the pH increase were evaluated. This study documents the results of sampling activities undertaken and conveys the analytical results along with suggestions for operation of the H- 02 Wetland Treatment System. The water samples collected and the water quality data generated from this activity are for analytical purposes only, and as such, were not collected in support of compliance activities...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the pressure drop characteristics of residential duct system components that are either not available or not thoroughly (sometimes incorrectly) described in existing duct design literature. The tests were designed to imitate cases normally found in typical residential and light commercial installations. The study included three different sizes of flexible ducts, under different compression configurations, <b>splitter</b> <b>boxes,</b> supply boots, and a fresh air intake hood. The experimental tests conformed to ASHRAE Standard 120 P – Methods of Testing to Determine Flow Resistance of HVAC Air Ducts and Fittings. The flexible duct study covered compressibility and bending effects on the total pressure drop, and the results showed that the available published references tend to underestimate the effects of compression in flexible ducts that can increase pressure drops by up to a factor of nine. The supply boots were tested under different configurations including a setup where a flexible duct elbow connection was considered {{as an integral part of}} the supply boot. The supply boots results showed that diffusers can increase the pressure drop by up to a factor of two in exit fittings, and the installation configuration can increase the pressure drop by up to a factor of five. The results showed that it is crucial for designers and contractors to be aware of the compressibility effects of the flexible duct, and the installation of supply boots and diffusers...|$|R

40|$|Lecturepg. 109 This paper {{describes}} the successful application of cavitation flow visualization to redesign the impeller of an 8. 5 -MW (11, 400 hp) high energy double suction single stage boiler feedpump. Dual {{purpose of the}} investigation was to develop an impeller/pump case combination showing significantly less cavitation at the impeller leading-edges than the original design, and realize specific rate objectives for meeting new duty points to eliminate high pressure throttling over the discharge valve. New impeller designs were tested in a full scale model test pump running at reduced speed, which was equipped with an acrylic viewing window for direct observation of the impeller blade cavitation. Elements of the experimental effort included determination {{of the effect of}} impeller (vane) design changes, along with the effect of suction box changes introduced at the splitter vanes. Initially, a total of four alternative impeller designs were considered, form which potentially best design was selected and tuned to specification. The new impeller design developed typically had sharp elliptic leading-edges to overcome the cavitation problem. Compared with the original design, in which impellers were replaced/repaired after less than one year of operation, the new impeller lifetime was calculated to be improved by at least a factor of eight, on the basis of cavitation bubble length. The NPSH required for the new design proved to be much better than for the original design, and, additionally the efficiency was established to be improved by one to two percent. Furthermore, a suction <b>box</b> <b>splitter</b> vane modification has led to less (cavitation) bubble activity in the eye area...|$|R
