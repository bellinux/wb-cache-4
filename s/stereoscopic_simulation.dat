40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} multi-material virtual {{prototyping}} (MMVP) system that integrates the virtual reality (VR) and the layered manufacturing (LM) technologies for digital fabrication of heterogeneous multi-material prototypes for advanced product development and biomedical engineering. The system consists mainly of two algorithms for sequential and concurrent multitoolpath planning, and a virtual prototyping system. The algorithms adopt a topological hierarchysorting algorithm {{to establish the}} hierarchy relationship of multi-material slice contours for facilitating toolpath planning of multi-material layered manufacturing (MMLM). Subsequently, the sequential multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates sequential toolpaths that avoid redundant tool movements. To reduce build time further, the concurrent multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates collision-free concurrent toolpaths. Based on the hierarchy information, a bounding box can be adopted to approximate envelopes of contour families of the same material property to simplify detection of tool collisions. The algorithms are integrated to form the MMVP system for planning, <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>simulation,</b> and validation of multi-toolpaths for MMLM. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system, which integrates virtual reality (VR) and layered manufacturing (LM) for digital fabrication of multi-material prototypes to facilitate advanced product development and biomedical engineering. The MMVP system incorporates a topological hierarchy-sorting algorithm, two algorithms for sequential and concurrent multi-toolpath planning, a build-time estimation algorithm, and a virtual prototyping system. Based on the topological hierarchy of slice contours, the sequential multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates sequential toolpaths that avoid redundant tool movements, while the concurrent multi-toolpath planning algorithm generates collision-free concurrent toolpaths to further reduce the build-time. To verify the resulting toolpaths and to facilitate estimation of fabrication cost, a mathematical model is incorporated for build-time estimation of multi-material fused deposition processes. The MMVP system is useful for planning, <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>simulation,</b> build-time estimation and validation of multi-toolpaths, and subsequent digital fabrication and analysis of multi-material prototypes. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} topological hierarchy-based {{approach}} to toolpath planning for multi-material layered manufacturing (MMLM) of heterogeneous prototypes. The approach facilitates control of MMLM {{and increases the}} fabrication efficiency of complex objects by generating multi-toolpaths that avoid redundant tool movements and potential collisions. It uses a topological hierarchy-sorting algorithm to group complex multi-material slice contours into families connected by a parent-and-child relationship. Subsequently, a sequential toolpath planning algorithm generates multi-toolpaths for sequential deposition of materials without redundant tool movements. To reduce build time further, a concurrent toolpath planning algorithm generates collision-free multi-toolpaths to control the tools that deposit materials concurrently. It uses parametric polygons to construct tool envelopes for contour families of the same material property to simplify detection of tool collisions. The tightness of polygons can be controlled to suit the processing speed and the optimality of the resulting concurrent toolpaths. The proposed approach has been implemented {{as an integral part}} of a multi-material virtual prototyping (MMVP) system that can process complex slice contours for planning, <b>stereoscopic</b> <b>simulation,</b> and validation of multi-toolpaths. It may be adapted for subsequent control of MMLM processes. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|We present our {{approach}} to extend a Virtual Reality software framework towards the use for Augmented Reality applications. Although VR and AR applications have very similar requirements in terms of abstract components (like 6 DOF input, <b>stereoscopic</b> output, <b>simulation</b> engines), the requirements in terms of hardware and software vary considerably. In this article {{we would like to}} share the experience gained from adapting our VR software framework for AR applications. We will address design issues for this task. The result is a VR/AR basic software that allows us to implement interactive applications without fixing their type (VR or AR) beforehand. Switching from VR to AR is a matter of changing the configuration file of the application. We also give an example of the use of the extended framework: Augmenting the magnetic field of bar magnets in physics classes. We describe the setup of the system and the real-time calculation of the magnetic field, using a GPU...|$|R
40|$|Virtual reality (VR) {{has long}} promised to {{revolutionize}} education, but with little follow-through. Part {{of the reason}} for this is the prohibitive cost of immersive VR headsets or caves. This has changed with the advent of smartphone-based VR (along the lines of Google cardboard) which allows students to use smartphones and inexpensive plastic or cardboard viewers to enjoy <b>stereoscopic</b> VR <b>simulations.</b> We have completed the largest-ever such study on 627 students enrolled in calculus-based freshman physics at The Ohio State University. This initial study focused on student understanding of electric fields. Students were split into three treatments groups: VR, video, and static 2 D images. Students were asked questions before, during, and after treatment. Here we present a preliminary analysis including overall post-pre improvement among the treatment groups, dependence of improvement on gender, and previous video game experience. Results on select questions are discussed. Several electric field visualizations similar to those used in this study are freely available on Google Play [URL] 4 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

40|$|Stereoscopic {{video is}} a {{practical}} and important manner for 3 -D video applications, and robust stereoscopic video transmission over error-prone networks has posed a technical challenge for stereoscopic video coding. In this paper, we present a rate-distortion optimization algorithm with inter-view refreshment for error-resilient stereoscopic video coding. First, inter-view refreshment is proposed to suppress error propagations besides intra refreshment. Then, we propose an end-to-end distortion model for stereoscopic video coding which concurrently considers network conditions, inter-view refreshment, and error concealment tools. Finally, based on the proposed end-to-end distortion model, a rate-distortion optimization algorithm is presented to adaptively select inter-view, inter and intra coding modes for error-resilient <b>stereoscopic</b> video coding. <b>Simulation</b> {{results show that the}} proposed scheme has a superior transmission efficiency improvement for stereoscopic video coding...|$|R
40|$|The Pleiades system, {{of which}} the first {{platform}} of the constellation shall be ready for launch in early 2009, is {{the new generation of}} high resolution optical sensor satellites developed by CNES, the French space agency. With its ability to provide photogrammetrists with instantaneous colour image stereo-pairs of 20 km swath and 70 cm resolution acquired with B/H ratios ranging from 0. 15 to 2, the very agile and precisely pointing Pleiades platforms should open in many countries a new era for the updating of high scale maps, by probably avoiding heavy aerial survey campaigns in many cases. In the framework of a cooperation agreement between CNES and IGN-France (IGN-F), designed to prepare an operational use of these images, several experimentations and simulations are being carried out, in order to verify the ability of the system to fulfill the technical and operational requirements of the map-making processes, in comparison with those presently based on digital aerial photography. Among others, present studies particularly focus on: • the geometric and radiometric quality assessment of the planned system products (sensor level, orthoimages and mosaics). • the capacity assessment of the Pleiades constellation to meet the IGN-F cartographic mission needs in terms of image volume for the coverage of the national territory, whether in monoscopic or stereoscopic mode. • the potential of stereo- and three-fold <b>stereoscopic</b> image <b>simulations</b> for the extraction of buildings in 3 D, afte...|$|R
40|$|Rigid body {{motion is}} part of {{mechanics}} that students find hard to understand. It {{is due to the}} inability to exhaustively demonstrate such a motion in laboratories. For example, throwing a disc happens fast and the motion cannot be properly observed. Also {{it is not possible to}} show vectors describing the rotational motion while the body is moving. These limitations considerably hamper the comprehension of the studied phenomena by students. The current article tries to demonstrate the use of free online <b>stereoscopic</b> 3 D <b>simulations</b> as a virtual laboratory. The well known recreation game of throwing a flying disc hides important physical insights. The motion of the flying disc is simulated and the rotation process is analyzed qualitatively. The learning process using the simulation is followed and the student’s benefits of utilizing the simulation are disclosed. The used stereo 3 D simulation of rigid body rotation can be observed free online a...|$|R
