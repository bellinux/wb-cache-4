5|$|A dam {{was built}} across the Cefni river north of Llangefni {{in the late}} 1940s to {{increase}} the water supply available to the island. The new reservoir, Llyn Cefni, crossed the railway's trackbed, and a bridge was built to <b>support</b> <b>it.</b> A second reservoir, Llyn Alaw, was formed adjacent to the railway north of Llanerchymedd in the 1960s, but did {{not interfere with the}} line's alignment.|$|E
5|$|After Fielding {{returned}} {{to working with}} the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane, he wrote The Lottery, which first ran on 1 January 1732 alongside Addison's Cato. The play was successful and was performed 15 times during January. He altered the play in February, and the revised form ran for 14 more nights during that season and was put on each year until 1740 and occasionally thereafter until 1783. The story deals with Chloe's desire to play the lottery and pokes fun at the London lottery system and those who <b>support</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{nuclear weapons}} {{development}} proceeded, the weapons became mass-produced, smaller, lighter, {{and easier to}} store, handle and maintain. They also required less effort to assemble. The AFSWP gradually shifted its emphasis away from training assembly teams, and became more involved in stockpile management and providing administrative, technical and logistical <b>support.</b> <b>It</b> supported nuclear weapons testing, although after Operation Sandstone in 1948, this was increasingly in a planning and training capacity rather than a field role. In 1958, the AFSWP became the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA), a field agency of the Department of Defense.|$|E
5|$|Before leaving Atlantic, the Rolling Stones {{released}} Undercover (UK 3; US 4) in late 1983. Despite {{good reviews}} and the Top Ten peak {{position of the}} title track, the record sold below expectations {{and there was no}} tour to <b>support</b> <b>it.</b> Subsequently, the Stones' new marketer/distributor CBS Records took over distributing the Stones' Atlantic catalogue.|$|E
5|$|But the WFM's {{success at}} Cripple Creek {{also created a}} {{significant}} backlash. The WFM was forever tarred as a dangerous and violent organization {{in the eyes of}} employers. Never again would the WFM have in a local strike the level of public <b>support</b> <b>it</b> enjoyed at Cripple Creek in 1894. Indeed, when the union struck the Cripple Creek mines again in 1898, its public support ended after violence broke out. During another strike in 1903–4, whose violent significance earned it the name Colorado Labor Wars, the union went up against the power of the employers and the state combined.|$|E

5|$|Commander T'Pol and Commander Tucker remain captives of Paxton, who {{continues}} to broadcast his demand on all channels and frequencies. Paxton's action has an unsettling effect on the interspecies conference since {{it is clear that}} not all humans <b>support</b> <b>it.</b> On Mars, Paxton allows T'Pol and Tucker see the baby, and T'Pol uses her scanner to learn that the child is unwell (and that Paxton has been using Rigelian gene therapy to treat himself). Seeking to fine-tune their attack, Paxton then threatens T'Pol to force Tucker to optimize the targeting system of the array.|$|E
5|$|In 1168, his great-uncle, Marco Polo, {{borrowed}} money and commanded a ship in Constantinople. His grandfather, Andrea Polo {{of the parish}} of San Felice, had three sons, Maffeo, yet another Marco, and the traveller's father Niccolò. This genealogy, described by Ramusio, is not universally accepted {{as there is no}} additional evidence to <b>support</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Harrison asked Congress {{to suspend}} the anti-slavery clause of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years. Harrison claimed it was {{necessary}} to increase the territory's population more quickly and attract new settlers. Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the federal government would not longer have to financially <b>support</b> <b>it.</b> In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude.|$|E

5|$|Jose Brandao, a {{historian}} specializing in North American Native history, suggests that contemporary {{analyses of the}} Lachine Massacre continue to demonstrate cultural bias. Brandao criticizes historians Parkman, Charles McIlwain, and George Hunt for citing the growing dependence on European goods (which were, according to these historians, viewed by the Iroquois as superior to other goods) {{as a reason for}} Iroquois dissatisfaction and violence. Brandao dismisses this theory as a largely ethnocentric interpretation with little evidence to <b>support</b> <b>it.</b> Brandao also dismisses Hunt’s suggestion that natives, similar to the Europeans, waged wars for economic reasons.|$|E

5|$|Nepenthes rajah, like {{virtually}} all {{species in the}} genus, is a scrambling vine. The stem usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can <b>support</b> <b>it.</b> The stem is relatively thick (≤30mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. rajah does not produce runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue culture, where numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E

5|$|The main {{tension between}} {{fisheries}} {{science and the}} fishing industry {{is that the two}} groups have different views on the resiliency of fisheries to intensive fishing. In places such as Scotland, Newfoundland, and Alaska the fishing industry is a major employer, so governments are predisposed to <b>support</b> <b>it.</b> On the other hand, scientists and conservationists push for stringent protection, warning that many stocks could be wiped out within fifty years.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} slavery is {{of such a}} nature, that it is {{incapable}} of being introduced on any reasons, moral or political; but only positive law, which preserves its force long after the reasons, occasion, and time itself from whence it was created, is erased from memory: it's so odious, that nothing can be suffered to <b>support</b> <b>it,</b> but positive law. Whatever inconveniences, therefore, may follow from a decision, I cannot say this case is allowed or approved by the law of England; and therefore the black must be discharged.|$|E
