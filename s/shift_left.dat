25|$|More significantly, bit {{shifting}} {{allows one}} to compute the square (<b>shift</b> <b>left</b> by 1) or take the square root (shift right by 1). This leads to approximate computations of the square root; combined with the previous technique for taking the inverse, this allows the fast inverse square root computation, which was important in graphics processing in the late 1980s and 1990s. This can be exploited in some other applications, such as volume ramping in digital sound processing.|$|E
25|$|Pro mode for {{keyboards}} shows during gameplay ten white {{keys and}} the corresponding black keys, as the full range cannot be displayed on screen; Two visual cues are given to the player to identify what position on the controller they should play relative to the keys shown on-screen. One cue is through highlighting the entire lane that corresponds to a played note whether correct or not; this {{is designed to help}} keep the player's hand positions correlated on the unit. A second cue is uniquely grouped coloring of a channel containing a set of 5 keys matching similar markings on the keyboard unit to identify the correct area of the keyboard that the player should be on. Pro keyboard charting includes notes and chords using a combination of white and black keys. On Easy or Medium Pro keys, the range of keys on screen does not shift, but on Hard and Expert the range of keys shown on the screen shifts as the song necessitates, requiring the player to move their own hands in turn. Arrow indicators are displayed to indicate when the displayed area is about to <b>shift</b> <b>left</b> or right, giving the player time to compensate.|$|E

2500|$|Though not {{directly}} related to the numerical interpretation of binary symbols, sequences of bits may be manipulated using Boolean logical operators. When a string of binary symbols is manipulated in this way, it is called a bitwise operation; the logical operators AND, OR, and XOR may be performed on corresponding bits in two binary numerals provided as input. The logical NOT operation may be performed on individual bits in a single binary numeral provided as input. Sometimes, such operations may be used as arithmetic short-cuts, and may have other computational benefits as well. [...] For example, an arithmetic <b>shift</b> <b>left</b> of a binary number is the equivalent of multiplication by a (positive, integral) power of 2.|$|E

50|$|As {{illustrated}} in the following figure, many projects developing large and complex software-reliant systems decompose development into {{a small number of}} increments (Vs) having correspondingly shorter durations. The <b>shift</b> <b>left</b> illustrated by the dashed red arrows occurs because parts of the single, large waterfall V model’s types of testing (shown in gray) are shifted left to become increments of the corresponding types of testing in the smaller incremental V models. When each increment is also a delivery to the customer and operations, then incremental <b>shift</b> <b>left</b> testing shifts both developmental testing and operational testing to the left. Incremental <b>shift</b> <b>left</b> testing is popular when developing large, complex systems, especially those incorporating significant amounts of hardware.
