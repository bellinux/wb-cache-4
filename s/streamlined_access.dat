40|$|ABSTRACT: Advances in hydroarylation {{have been}} {{achieved}} {{by the development of}} a one-pot regioselective allene hydrosilylation/Pd(0) -catalyzed cross-coupling protocol. The regioselectivity is primarily governed by N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand identity in the hydrosilylation step and is preserved in the subsequent cross-coupling reaction. This methodology affords <b>streamlined</b> <b>access</b> to functionalized 1, 1 -disubstituted alkenes with excellent regiocontrol. Alkenylsilanes are versatile nucleophiles in metal-catalyzedcross-coupling reactions. Numerous carbon−carbon bond-forming reactions with alkenylsilanes have been well developed, 1 including the powerful cross-coupling methodology extensively developed by Hiyama and Denmark. 2 − 4 Currently, the most direct routes to alkenylsilanes are via metal-catalyzed hydro-silylations of alkynes. 5 However, subtle alterations in the π-component, silane coupling partner, and metal catalyst often have substantial effects on the reaction outcome, leading t...|$|E

In general, 13 universities offer formal or informal early admission to gifted students, while 33 universities provide dual enrolment options. No minimum age requirements are in place for the majority of Australian universities. Nonetheless, enrolment of students, younger than 17 years, is more often used as a recruiting tool than as an accommodation for extraordinary academic talent.

40|$|To prepare {{students}} {{in just four}} years to enter veterinary practice, veterinary medical educators offer an array of laboratory and clinical experiences coordinated with didactic instruction. Recent curricular changes have reduced the numbers of animals involved in painful or terminal procedures. For each use of animals, veterinary educators are required by the USDA's policies 11 and 12 to complete animal-use protocols that include questions on alternatives to procedures causing more than momentary pain or distress. Veterinary medical educators seeking improved teaching resources and methods or completing animal-use protocols may find it frustrating to locate the relevant information, which is dispersed across many databases. This paper addresses a gap facing veterinary educators by presenting user-friendly searching tools that are targeted toward (a) locating teaching resources and (b) conducting effective bibliographic searches on standard teaching laboratory procedures, as required for animal-use protocols.

This research paper explores the male experience in the STEPS enabling program and identifies the challenges and obstacles that affect them. Males who were enrolled in STEPS were asked to complete a survey sharing their experience throughout their journey, both positive and negative. The findings indicate that whilst males encountered challenges along the way, they acknowledged the benefits of seeking support through the various networks available.
