25|$|Members of the Deaf {{community}} {{tend to view}} deafness as {{a difference}} in human experience rather than a disability or disease. Many members take pride in their Deaf identity. Deaf people, {{in the sense of}} a community or culture, can then be seen as a minority group, and therefore <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> a part of this community may feel misunderstood by those who don't know sign language. Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than being born into it.|$|E
25|$|Ellis {{was careful}} to state that REBT was {{independent}} of his atheism, noting that many skilled REBT practitioners are religious, including <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> ordained ministers. In his later days, he significantly toned down his opposition to religion. While Ellis maintained his firm atheistic stance, proposing that thoughtful, probabilistic atheism was likely the most emotionally healthy approach to life, he acknowledged and agreed with survey evidence suggesting that belief in a loving God can also be psychologically healthy. Based on this later approach to religion, he reformulated his professional and personal view {{in one of his}} last books The Road to Tolerance, and he also co-authored a book, Counseling and Psychotherapy with Religious Persons: A Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy Approach, with two religious psychologists, Stevan Lars Nielsen and W. Brad Johnson, describing principles for integrating religious material and beliefs with REBT during treatment of religious clients.|$|E
25|$|The {{defining}} {{feature of}} ORS is excessive thoughts of having offensive body odor(s) which are detectable to others. The individual may {{report that the}} odor comes from: the nose and/or mouth, i.e. halitosis (bad breath), the anus, the genitals, the skin generally, or specifically the groin, armpits or feet. The source(s) of the supposed odor may also change over time. There are also <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unsure of the exact origin of the odor. The odor is typically reported to be continuously present. The character of the odor may be reported as similar to bodily substances, e.g. feces, flatus, urine, sweat, vomitus, semen, vaginal secretions; or alternatively {{it may be an}} unnatural, non-human or chemical odor, e.g. ammonia, detergent, rotten onions, burnt rags, candles, garbage, burning fish, medicines, old cheese. Again, the reported character of the odor complaint may change over time. Halitosis appears to be the most common manifestation of ORS, with 75% complaining of bad breath, alone or in combination with other odors. The next most common complaint was sweat (60%).|$|E

500|$|The {{penetration}} of the bride's infibulation takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. <b>Some</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unable to penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant {{in spite of the}} infibulation, and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, {{with the help of the}} [...] "little knife".

However, in 2009, Yates cast Nighy as Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour in the seventh film. Nighy said, [...] "I am no longer the only English actor not to be in Harry Potter and I am very pleased." [...] Jude Law once quipped, [...] "Nobody's asked me. I was a bit too old for Harry."

500|$|Both Kalanduyan and Cadar {{have been}} {{impressed}} {{that so many}} people lacking Maguindanaon or Maranao background, and <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not even Filipino, have become dedicated students and supporters of their cultural heritage. An additional surprise came after a decade-long series of American-based kulintang students traveled to Mindanao to perform, sparking a kulintang renaissance in the Philippines. The groundwork for this Renaissance originated as early as 1978 through the work of one of the early cultural pioneers and activists amongst Filipino Americans, Robert Kikuchi-Yngojo. It was his dedication in the early 80's that created the cultural awareness in the Fil-Am community of San Franccisco that sparked a cultural movement. The knowledge of outsiders playing traditional kulintang has encouraged the younger generation of musicians in the Philippines, both in Mindanao and in Taguig, Metro Manila. Enthusiastic appreciation by foreigners has given life to a dying tradition, and the music has become a unifying force in the Philippine diaspora. [...] For the first time in history, kulintang music is now formally taught to music students at several universities located throughout Metro Manila.|$|E

[...] Winthrop's son Henry Winthrop missed the Arbella sailing and ended up on the Talbot, which also sailed from Wight. [...] Winthrop wrote a sermon entitled A Modell of Christian Charity, which was delivered either before or during the crossing. [...] It described the ideas and plans to keep the Puritan society strong in faith, while also comparing the struggles {{that they would have to}} overcome in the New World with the story of Exodus. In it, he used the now-famous phrase [...] "City upon a Hill" [...] to describe the ideals to which the colonists should strive, and that consequently [...] "the eyes of all people are upon us." [...] He also said, [...] "In all times some must be rich some poore, some highe and eminent in power and dignitie; others meane and in subjection"; that is, all societies include <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> rich and successful and others who are poor and subservientâ€”and both groups were equally important to the colony because both groups were members to the same community.|$|E

500|$|The {{international}} use of Greek was {{one factor}} enabling {{the spread of}} Christianity, as indicated for example {{by the use of}} Greek for the Epistles of Paul. Constantine, the first emperor to convert to Christianity, presumably knew some Greek, but Latin was spoken in his court, and he used an interpreter to address Greek-speaking bishops at the Council of Nicaea. In the Christian Latin West, Greek became associated with [...] "paganism" [...] and regarded as a foreign language (lingua peregrina). Saint Augustine confessed that he loathed Greek and found it hard to learn. By late antiquity, however, it was possible to speak Greek as a primary language while not conceiving of oneself as a [...] "Hellene" [...] in matters of religion and culture. In {{the first half of the}} 5th century, Greek was the standard language in which bishops communicated, and the Acta Conciliorum ("Acts of the Church Councils") were recorded originally in Greek and then translated into Latin, Syriac, or Coptic. During this period, Latin played only a subordinate role in the ecumenical councils, as did representatives from the Western empire. Although traditionally Armenian is regarded as having been established as a Christian language by this time, it does not appear in the Acta. There are hints that Coptic might be spoken at the councils, but no secure record. On-the-spot translation into Greek was available for the participant who used his own language, including <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> referred to as [...] "Arabs", [...] "Saracens" [...] or [...] "Ishmaelites". Christian content has been found in a few Arabic inscriptions from the 6th century.|$|E
500|$|In Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine, Egypt {{is covered}} only in passing. When Eusebius {{remarks on the}} region, however, he writes of tens, twenties, even {{hundreds}} of Christians put to death on a single day, which would seem to make Egypt the region that suffered the most during the persecutions. According to one report that Barnes calls [...] "plausible, if unverifiable", 660 Christians were killed in Alexandria alone between 303 and 311. In Egypt, Peter of Alexandria fled his namesake city {{early on in the}} persecution, leaving the Church leaderless. Meletius, bishop of Lycopolis (Asyut), took up the job in his place. Meletius performed ordinations without Peter's permission, which caused some bishops to complain to Peter. Meletius soon refused to treat Peter as any kind of authority, and expanded his operations into Alexandria. According to Epiphanius of Salamis, the Church split into two sections: the [...] "Catholic Church", under Peter, and, after Peter's execution, Alexander; and the [...] "Church of the Martyrs" [...] under Meletius. When the two groups found themselves imprisoned together in Alexandria during the persecution, Peter of Alexandria drew up a curtain {{in the middle of their}} cell. He then said: [...] "There are <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> of my view, let them come over on my side, and those of Melitius's view, stay with Melitius." [...] Thus divided, the two sects went on with their affairs, purposely ignoring each other's existence. The schism continued to grow throughout the persecution, even with its leaders in jail, and would persist long after the deaths of both Peter and Meletius. Fifty-one bishoprics are attested for Egypt in 325; fifteen are only known otherwise as seats of the schismatic Church.|$|E

2500|$|Torrey has {{generally}} been in favor of antipsychotic drugs. He has claimed that taking antipsychotics {{reduces the risk of}} violence, homelessness and prison. He has argued that [...] "noncompliance" [...] in about half of cases of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is due to lack of [...] "insight" [...] into the illness because {{the part of the brain}} for self-awareness has been affected; and that in <b>some</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> aware it is due to adverse effects ranging from tremors or sedation to sexual dysfunction to substantial weight gain. He has also reported that at least some antipsychotics cause medical conditions that can be fatal in some people, especially African Americans. He has also argued that pharmaceutical companies have too much influence over psychiatric organizations and psychiatrists, effectively buying them off.|$|E
