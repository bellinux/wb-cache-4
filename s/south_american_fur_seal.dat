40|$|Sustentación de TesisSouth <b>American</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus australis) {{continue}} {{to survive in}} Peru in spite of commercial harvesting, periodic disappearance of prey (i. e., El Niño), and competition with the Peruvian anchoveta fishery. I investigated {{the ability of the}} Peruvian population of <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> to recover from catastrophic declines at two temporal and spatial scales. The first analysis determined intrinsic rate of growth (r) and the potential carrying capacity (K*—the number of <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> that could be supported in Peru in the absence of sealing and El Niño) from 1880 – 2010, and the second used pup counts from 1984 – 2010 to determine the relationship between prey abundance and the timing of pupping at an important <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> breeding site in southern Peru. Model results indicated that <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> in Peru have an intrinsic growth rate r of 0. 20 and a potential carrying capacity K* of 115, 000 seals. Recent counts (2007) show that current population is at 33 % of the estimated mean numbers of <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> alive from 1880 - 1925. Analysis of 25 years of counts of pups and adult females at the breeding site showed a correlation between anchoveta biomass and mean birth dates (r 2 = 0. 59, P< 0. 01) and with the ratio of pups to females (r 2 = 0. 66, P< 0. 01) in the upcoming breeding seasons. It also revealed a 2 -week shift in the mean birth date that may reflect a change in the age structure of the population. Numbers of pups born tended to be lower in years with low anchoveta biomass, as did recruitment of young females. Monitoring daily numbers of pups born and adult females appears to be a useful means to assess the feeding conditions encountered by <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> in Peru. My study also suggests that <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> are adapted to survive in extremely disturbed environments and have the potential to rapidly recover following population declines. Whether or not they ever again achieve their potential carrying capacity will depend upon protection of breeding rookeries, a continued harvest ban, reduced bycatch, incidental captures and illegal poaching, regulation of anchoveta fishing quotas and good environmental conditions.

5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|R

40|$|The <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>Fur</b> <b>Seal</b> Arctocephalus australis {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} South American otariid species. In Brazil, during austral winter months specimens of A. australis are regularly found along the Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina coasts. Occasionally, vagrants have been recorded along the southeastern coast but rarely moves north of Rio de Janeiro, at 23 °S. On 01 May 2015, fishermen noticed in the surf zone an unidentified large animal in Ilhéus, Bahia, northeastern Brazil. Severely wounded, it was still alive when first spotted. Numerous shark bites were observed in the rostrum and flippers, the peduncle was severely lacerated and the intestines were protruding. The specimen was identified as an adult of <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>Fur</b> <b>Seal</b> based on the combination of the characteristic coloration of the pelage, head shape, body size, the relatively large eye size, and mainly due to the pronounced three cusped teeth in post canines. Fishermen decided to butcher the carcass and share the meat among their companions. The present record, however, is of special concern as human consumption <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>Fur</b> <b>Seal</b> seems to be unusual in Brazil. Pieces of meat were shared among fishermen. In addition, small pieces of blubber were used as bait in the local shark long-line fishery. Consumption of an injured and presumably weak marine mammal carcass points to an increasing risk of contact between potentially harmful viruses, bacteria and fungi and humans.

40|$|<b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (SAFS) (Arctophoca australis 1) {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} otariids breeding on both the Atlantic and Pacific sides of South America, from Uruguay to Peru (Campagna 2008). Breeding colonies are, however, patchily distributed and geographically isolated, separated by hundreds to thousands of kilometers (Túnez et al. 2008). Two SAFS subspecies are typically recognized, but their validity is debated (reviewed in Oliveira and Brownell, in press). Specifically, the mainland subspecies (A. australis gracilis) (Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay) is separated from SAFS breeding at the Falkland Islands (A. australis australis) on the basis of skull morphometry (King 1954, Rice 1998, Brunner 2004, Campagna 2008). In addition to these subspecies, recent studies reveal genetic and morphometric differences between the Peruvian (A. australis unnamed) and Uruguayan populations of SAFS (Túnez et al. 2007, Oliveira et al. 2008, Berta and Churchill 2012, Committee on Taxonomy 2012). Genetic and morphometric discontinuities characterize distinct populations of SAFS that may constitute biologically relevant conservation and management units (Túnez et al. 2007, Oliveira et al. 2008). A prerequisite for effective SAFS conservation is the ability to identify the appropriate focus of management effort.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} ontogenetic dietary {{changes in}} male <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> Arctocephalus australis in northern and central Patagonia (Argentina) using stable isotope ratios (δ 15 N and δ 13 C) in vibrissae and bones. Sucking pups were characterised by higher δ 15 N values and lower δ 13 C values than older specimens. Weaning {{was associated with}} a marked drop of δ 15 N values, both in bone and vibrissae. Such a drop was inconsistent with the consumption of local prey and may reveal movement to distant foraging grounds or physiological changes associated with either fasting or rapid growth. Stable isotope ratios indicated that juveniles fed more pelagically than subadults and adults, but that there were no major differences between the 2 latter age categories. As subadults and adults are rather similar in body mass and are much larger than juveniles, body mass {{may play a role in}} the ontogenetic dietary changes reported. Nevertheless, demersal benthic prey were always scarce in the diet of male <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> which relied primarily on Argentine shortfin squid and small pelagic fish throughout life, though adults also consumed large amounts of decapod crustaceans available at shallow depths. Vibrissae did not reveal regular oscillations of δ 15 N or δ 13 C, except in 1 individual. Thus, male <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> from northern and central Patagonia do not appear to migrate regularly between isotopically distinct areas, although nomadic displacements cannot be ruled out...|$|R
40|$|Hookworms of {{the genus}} Uncinaria have been widely {{reported}} from juvenile pinnipeds, however investigations of their systematics has been limited, with only two species described, Uncinaria lucasi from northern <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Callorhinus ursinus) and Uncinaria hamiltoni from <b>South</b> <b>American</b> sea lions (Otaria flavescens). Hookworms were sampled from these hosts and seven additional species including Steller sea lions (Eumetopias jubatus), California sea lions (Zalophus californianus), <b>South</b> <b>American</b> <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus australis), Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus pusillus), New Zealand sea lions (Phocarctos hookeri), southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), and the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus). One hundred and thirteen individual hookworms, including an outgroup species, were sequenced for four genes representing two loci (nuclear ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial DNA). Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences recovered seven independent evolutionary lineages or species, including the described species and five undescribed species. The molecular evidence shows that U. lucasi parasitises both C. ursinus and E. jubatus, whereas U. hamiltoni parasitises O. flavescens and A. australis. The five undescribed hookworm species were each associated with single host species (Z. californianus, A. pusillus, P. hookeri, M. leonina and M. monachus). For parasites of otarids, patterns of Uncinaria host-sharing and phylogenetic relationships had a strong biogeographic component with separate clades of parasites from northern versus southern hemisphere hosts. Comparison of phylogenies for these hookworms and their hosts suggests that the association of U. lucasi with northern <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> results from a host-switch from Steller sea lions. Morphometric data for U. lucasi shows marked host-associated size differences for both sexes, with U. lucasi individuals from E. jubatus significantly larger. This result suggests that adult growth of U. lucasi is reduced within the host species representing the more recent host– parasite association. Intraspecific host-induced size differences are inconsistent with the exclusive use of morphometrics to delimit and diagnose species of Uncinaria from pinnipeds...|$|R
