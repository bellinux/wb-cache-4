40|$|Abstract: Modern manufacturers, {{seeking to}} remain {{competitive}} in the market, rely on their manufacturing engineers and production personnel to quickly and effectively set up manufacturing processes for new products. Taguchi Parameter Design is a powerful and efficient method for optimizing quality and performance output of manufacturing processes, thus {{a powerful tool for}} meeting this challenge. This paper discusses an investigation into the use of Taguchi Parameter Design for optimizing surface roughness generated by a CNC turning operation. This study utilizes a standard orthogonal array for determining the optimum turning parameters, with an applied noise factor. Controlled factors include spindle speed, feed rate, and depth of cut; and the noise factor is slightly damaged jaws. The noise factor is included to increase the robustness and applicability of this study. After experimentally turning <b>sample</b> <b>workpieces</b> using the selected orthogonal array and parameters, this study produced a verified combination of controlled factors and a predictive equation for determining surface roughness with a given set of parameters.

40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} {{inspection}} equipment exists in industry {{to capture the}} points on a surface that will envisage manufacturing form errors. Manufacturing inspection faces a problem of finding optimal methods to capture an evenly spread distribution of points on the surface. Sampling does not yield complete information about a surface. Each material removal process leaves a unique pattern {{on the surface of}} the workpiece, which has to be taken into consideration while developing the sampling strategy. For instance, round patterns left by face milling at low feeds on flat surfaces, and spiral patterns left during surface milling and turning operations on surfaces of revolution. Two new methods have been developed to improve sampling using the coordinate measuring machine (CMM) for inspection of flat and revolved surfaces. These are the Spiral, and Hamspi sampling methods. The Spiral method focuses on the centre of the area and uses the Archimedean spiral. Hamspi is a method that combines both the Spiral and randomized Hammersley tomeasure points in the middle as well as the outer zone of the workpiece. Mathematical comparisons of these methods have been made to establish feasibility. An experiment was performed to determine the accuracy of these models using two dependent variables: inspection time and minimum zone. The minimum zone was (statistically) significantly affected by only two factors: <b>sample</b> size and <b>workpiece</b> shape. The <b>sampling</b> time was however affected by <b>sample</b> size, <b>workpiece</b> shape, and the interaction between them. This study observed that the beginning and ending cutting zones of spherical surfaces were the most significant regions to verify. It was found that the Spiral and Hamspi methods had similar point distributions as the Hammersley method while placing more emphasis on the origin of the workpiece...|$|R
40|$|To achieve desired accuracy, {{precision}} and surface roughness during laser 2 ̆ 013 material removal process, {{monitoring and control}} of the process parameters related to laser, optics, workpiece material and its motion are required. Focus position, defined as a gap between the focusing lens and the surface of the <b>sample</b> <b>workpiece,</b> {{is one of the most}} critical process parameters, which determines the projection of the intensity of the laser beam on the surface to be ablated and therefore directly affects volume and geometry of the material removed and there by machining quality. In this paper, acoustic emission (AE) generated by laser 2 ̆ 013 material interactions was statistically analyzed with respect to the variations in the focus position. The study involved on-line measurements of the AE signal from the laser 2 ̆ 013 material interaction zone as a function of the focus position and the width of the machined trenches. Several basic statistical parameters, e. g. average amplitude, variance and power spectrum density were analyzed to select distinct informational parameters. Pattern recognition analysis of three informational parameters based on variances within frequency diapasons of 202 ̆ 013180, 1802 ̆ 013300, and 3002 ̆ 013500 kHz was used for reliable classification of the focus position and width of the machined trenches. The results provide important information for future development of on-line monitoring and control systems for laser 2 ̆ 013 material removal process. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

Smallest depths of cut, smooth surfaces and minimal shape errors of complex parts are required. To test the behavior of high precision feed drive systems several direct and indirect analysis methods can be applied. In this report three indirect test methods are presented. By machining and evaluation of specified <b>workpiece</b> <b>samples</b> information about the feed drive behaviour are obtained.

40|$|Tolerance {{verification}} {{permits to}} check the product conformity and to verify assumptions made by the designer. For conformity assessment, the uncertainty associated with {{the values of the}} measurands must be known. In fact, to evaluate form characteristics of large aircraft structure <b>workpieces,</b> <b>sampling</b> is required, so a measurement error is present: exact estimation of form characteristics would require complete knowledge of the surface. To minimise this measurement error, this paper presents a Krigingbased procedure to identify the minimum of measured points {{to check the}} conformity with a given confidence level. The proposed method is validated on a simple example of orientation tolerance and then performed to inspect the form defect on three large aircraft workpieces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{commonly}} {{believed that the}} white layer formed during hard machining of steels is caused primarily by a thermally induced phase transformation resulting from rapid heating and quenching. The focus {{of this study is}} to investigate the white layers produced on the machined surfaces and on the inner side part of the chips in dry hard turning GCr 15 with PCBN tools. <b>Samples</b> of machined <b>workpiece</b> and chips were metallographically processed and observed under a microscope to determine whether white layers were present or not. Some properties of white layers were deduced in order to verify some of the prevalent theories. More specifically, chip shapes were studied to determine how they developed during machining with potential appearance of white layers, with a view to correlating the chip shapes with the white layer formation...|$|R
5000|$|Maintaining UHV {{conditions}} {{requires the}} use of unusual materials for equipment. Heating of the entire system above 100 °C for many hours ("baking") to remove water and other trace gases which adsorb on the surfaces of the chamber is required upon [...] "cycling" [...] the equipment to atmosphere. To save time, energy, and integrity of the UHV volume an [...] "interlock" [...] is often used. The interlock volume has one door or valve facing the UHV side of the volume, and another door against atmospheric pressure through which <b>samples</b> or <b>workpieces</b> are initially introduced. After sample introduction and assuring that the door against atmosphere is closed, the interlock volume is typically pumped down to a medium-high vacuum. In some cases the workpiece itself is baked out or otherwise pre-cleaned under this medium-high vacuum. The gateway to the UHV chamber is then opened, the workpiece transferred to the UHV by robotic means or by other contrivance if necessary, and the UHV valve re-closed. While the initial workpiece is being processed under UHV, a subsequent sample can be introduced into the interlock volume, pre-cleaned, and so-on and so-forth, saving much time. Although a [...] "puff" [...] of gas is generally released into the UHV system when the valve to the interlock volume is opened, the UHV system pumps can generally snatch this gas away before it has time to adsorb onto the UHV surfaces. In a system well designed with suitable interlocks, the UHV components seldom need bakeout and the UHV may improve over time even as workpieces are introduced and removed.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and develop a {{friction}} stir welding (FSW) based on current CNC machine. The development is based on CNC milling machine using FSW tool that been machined. Aluminium Alloy 5083 was used as <b>workpiece</b> <b>sample</b> while mild steel was selected as the material for the tool. The experiments are based on selected welding conditions such as feed speed, tool rotation speed, plunge depth and tool design. Some of the parameter was set to a certain value, thus leaving 3 parameters with different value. For analyzation, feed speed and tool rotation was concentrated to study which parameter is the best based on analysis, either the combination of 10, 15 and 20 mm/min feed speed and tool rotation of 1000, 1500 and 2000 rpm. Post analysis involving hardness test, impact test and microstructure analysis. The experimental results were statistically analyzed to study the influence of both parameters on weld area cross section. Based on hardness test and impact test, the weld area are strong enough after combining two aluminum. The microstructural imaging shows that at certain number of feed speed or rotation speed, the weld area starting to crack. The outcome of this study shows that feed speed and tool rotation speed have significance effects on the strength and cosmetic of weld area and the best condition is at 10 mm/min feed speed and 1000 rpm of tool rotation speed. The results also shows that the setting of the experiment can have bigger effect on the welding result...|$|R
