25|$|As emperor, Berengar was wont to {{intervene}} {{outside of his}} regnum of Italy. He even dabbled in an episcopal election in the diocese of Liège. After {{the death of the}} saintly Bishop Stephen in 920, Herman I, Archbishop of Cologne, representing the German interests in Lotharingia, tried to impose his choice of the monks of the local cloister, one Hilduin, on the vacant <b>see.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> opposed by Charles III of France, who convinced Pope John to excommunicate Hilduin. Another monk, Richer, was appointed to the see with the support of pope and emperor.|$|E
25|$|Nailatikau {{retired from}} the Army and decided to pursue a new career in the {{diplomatic}} service. After completing the Foreign Service Course at Oxford University in the United Kingdom, he was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and accredited as Fiji's Ambassador to Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Israel and the Holy <b>See.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> later appointed as Fiji's Roving Ambassador and High Commissioner to the member states of the South Pacific Forum, before taking up a post as Permanent Secretary for Foreign Affairs and External Trade in 1999.|$|E

500|$|Israel's poem De arte metrica was {{dedicated}} to Rotbert, Archbishop of Trier. It was almost certainly composed in England, and the dedication was probably a successful plea for Rotbert's patronage when Æthelstan died in 939. From about 940 Israel was the tutor of Bruno, the future Archbishop of Cologne and brother of the Holy Roman Emperor, Otto the Great. Froumund of Tegernsee described Israel as Rotbert's [...] "shining light". In 947 Israel attended a synod at Verdun presided over by Rotbert, where he {{was referred to as}} a bishop, but without identification of his <b>see.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> famous as a schoolmaster and [...] probably {{played an important role in}} Emperor Otto's establishment of a court school at Aachen.|$|E
500|$|Curtis asked Moffat to criticise [...] "anything and everything" [...] {{and later}} {{said he was}} very honest. Executive {{producer}} Piers Wenger and director Jonny Campbell also critiqued the script. Moffat told Curtis that it needed to [...] "start quicker" [...] and that the meeting with the Doctor and Vincent was [...] "dull" [...] {{and needed to be}} something [...] "cute" [...] like Curtis had done in his films. He also noted that the Doctor did not talk as much as Curtis had written and recommended Curtis watch some episodes to <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> [...] "rather efficient in the way that he talked". Curtis enjoyed the experience, commenting that it was [...] "fun" [...] to work within boundaries rather than doing it all himself. After seeing a read-through performed by leads Matt Smith and Karen Gillan, Curtis made more changes. He commented that it was easy to write for them as they were [...] "so delightful and modern and relaxed". Curtis's original title for the episode was [...] "Eyes that See the Darkness", but he said this was vetoed.|$|E
2500|$|Yohannan Sulaqa {{traveled}} by land {{on his way}} back to Constantinople and from there to the northern town of Amid (modern Diyarbakır), where he arrived on November 12, 1553 and established his <b>See.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by the bishop Ambrose Buttigeg, OP († 1558), a powerful Maltese clergyman, who was specially appointed as [...] "Nuncio for Mosul." ...|$|E

2500|$|Graham [...] "Green" [...] Bailey, {{and would}} meet Steve Budd, closely {{involved}} with his band The Sound {{in their early}} years, in his early teens. Budd would later recall, [...] "We met when we were both 14. He {{was the only other}} kid I knew with an electric guitar. Even at 14 you could <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a genius". Borland played guitar left-handed.|$|E
2500|$|The Mikado {{has been}} admired by other composers. Dame Ethel Smyth wrote of Sullivan, [...] "One day he {{presented}} {{me with a}} copy of the full score of The Golden Legend, adding: 'I think this is the best thing I've done, don't you?' and when truth compelled me to say that in my opinion The Mikado is his masterpiece, he cried out: 'O you wretch!' But though he laughed, I could <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> disappointed." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we never did that. We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I could <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E

2500|$|Lowell now {{implemented}} a second, equally revolutionary restructuring of undergraduate education. As early as his service on {{an ad hoc}} faculty Committee on Improving Instruction in 1903, he had determined that the elective system was a failure. Large numbers of students, lacking intellectual ambition, chose their courses with little concern for learning, more intent on {{the ease with which}} they could fulfill the course requirements, resulting in a course of study that was [...] "neither rigorous nor coherent." [...] Lowell dismantled the elective system and in its place established concentration (what is commonly call a [...] "major") and distribution requirements that would soon become the new American model. Paired with the concentration requirement was a tutorial system in which every student had the guidance of a tutor to <b>see</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> prepared for examination in his area of concentration.|$|E
