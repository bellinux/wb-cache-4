40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{describe}} a defense system to contain DDoS flooding attacks in high-speed networks. We aim at protecting TCP friendly traffic, which occupies {{the main body}} of the Internet traffic. DDoS flooding attacks tend to establish large numbers of malicious traffic flows to congest network. These flows are marked as TCP flows, and use spoofed <b>source</b> <b>identifiers</b> to hide their identities. The current network equipments are lack of the countermeasure capacity to such kind of DDoS attack and do not provide the mechanisms to support the extension of the new DDoS attack countermeasures. We adopt a gateway-based approach. A set of gateways are deployed at different location in the network to collaboratively perform the desired countermeasure functions such as attack detection and traffic access control. I...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: On the {{semantic}} web, in life sciences in particular, data is often distributed via multiple resources. Each of these sources {{is likely to}} use their own International Resource Identifier for conceptually the same resource or database record. The lack of correspondence between identifiers introduces a barrier when executing federated SPARQL queries across life science data. Results: We introduce a novel SPARQL-based service to enable on-the-fly integration of life science data. This service uses the identifier patterns defined in the Identifiers. org Registry to generate a plurality of identifier variants, which can then be used to match <b>source</b> <b>identifiers</b> with target identifiers. We demonstrate the utility of this identifier integration approach by answering queries across major producers of life science Linked Data.

5000|$|Trademark holders {{may also}} allege {{that the use}} of trademarked characters, settings, etc. may {{constitute}} trademark dilution. The concept of trademark dilution is that overuse or improper use of a mark, even when it does not create consumer confusion, can lessen the mark’s uniqueness and value as a <b>source</b> <b>identifier.</b> A dilution claim requires that the mark in question be famous throughout general consuming public and {{that the use of}} the mark create a likelihood of either [...] "blurring" [...] or [...] "tarnishment."

5000|$|Current federal {{trademark}} law {{follows the}} Lanham Act, {{otherwise known as}} the Trademark Act of 1946. Under the Lanham Act, a trademark is [...] "any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof" [...] used in commerce to identify a service or good. Under this definition, {{it is possible for}} the names and likenesses of television, film and book characters, fictional settings, or other elements of entertainment products to act as trademarks. Unlike copyright, however, trademark rights are not automatic. To establish a right in trademark, the rights-seeker must establish that his/her mark acts as a distinctive [...] "source identifier" [...] for a particular type of good or service. Thus, trademark rights may arise when a fictional character’s name or likeness may serve to identify the source of an entertainment product or related good. For example, the use of Mickey Mouse’s name or likeness may serve to identify a particular book or toy as originating from Disney. One way to establish that a mark acts as a distinctive <b>source</b> <b>identifier</b> is to establish that the relevant purchasing public has developed a strong association between the mark and its originating source. [...] In legal terms, this is known as [...] "secondary meaning." ...|$|E
40|$|A key {{challenge}} in combating Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is to reliably identify attack sources from packet contents. If a source can be reliably identified, routers can stop {{an attack by}} filtering packets from the attack sources without causing collateral damage to legitimate traffic. This task is difficult because attackers may spoof arbitrary packet contents to hide their identities. This paper proposes a packet passport system to address this challenge. A packet passport efficiently and securely authenticates {{the source of a}} packet. A packet with a valid passport must have originated from the claimed source. The packet passport system can be incrementally deployed without introducing extra control messages. It also provides incentives for early adoption: a domain that deploys packet passport system can prevent other domains from spoofing its <b>source</b> <b>identifiers.</b> Our preliminary analysis suggests that the packet passport system can be implemented at high-speed routers with today’s technologies. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIdentifier names (e. g., packages, classes, methods, variables) {{are one of}} most {{important}} software comprehension <b>sources.</b> <b>Identifier</b> names need to be analyzed {{in order to support}} collaborative software engineering and to reuse source codes. Indeed, they convey domain concept of softwares. For instance, ''getMinimumSupport'' would be associated with association rule concept in data mining softwares, while some are difficult to recognize such as the case of mixing parts of words (e. g., ''initFeatSet''). We thus propose methods for assisting automatic software understanding by classifying identifier names into domain concept categories. An innovative solution based on data mining algorithms is proposed. Our approach aims to learn character patterns of identifier names. The main challenges are (1) to automatically split identifier names into relevant constituent subnames (2) to build a model associating such a set of subnames to predefined domain concepts. For this purpose, we propose a novel manner for splitting such identifiers into their constituent words and use N-grams based text classification to predict the related domain concept. In this article, we report the theoretical method and the algorithms we propose, together with the experiments run on real software source codes that show the interest of our approach...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} dynamic changing of colours and intensities of light sources in a radiosity-lit environment. We introduce a fast radiosity sampling approach where energy is sorted {{with respect to the}} emitting lights. The idea is to tag energy with a light <b>source</b> <b>identifier</b> in order to determine from which light source energy is coming from, either directly or indirectly. Based on this information the subsequent reconstruction allows for interactive changing of light source emissions, as long as the geometry in the environment remains static. We illustrate this concept by developing a modified progressive refinement algorithm that performs efficient concurrent sampling of separate light source solutions. We show that the result is useful for real-time animation of realistic lighting in virtual environments. Furthermore, we describe how the method can be adapted to handle near real-time animation of moving lights...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} a defense system to contain Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) flooding attacks in highspeed networks. We aim at protecting TCP friendly traffic, which forms {{a large portion}} of Internet traffic. DDoS flooding attacks tend to establish large numbers of malicious traffic flows to congest network. These flows are marked as TCP flows, and use spoofed <b>source</b> <b>identifiers</b> to hide their identities. Current network equipment lacks the countermeasure abilities for such kind of DDoS attack. We {{describe a}} gateway-based countermeasure approach. A gateway is a device that is inserted in some point of the network. We envision the gateway devices that are deployed in the network to collaboratively perform the desired countermeasure functions, including detection of DDoS flooding attacks and access control of network traffic. Given the nature of DDoS attack in high speed networks and the limitation of defense resources, it is impossible for the gateway to work on the individual level of on-going traffic flows. We use a groupbased strategy where we partition the network under DDoS attack into several subnetworks, and handle the traffic from the same subnetworks as an aggregate. This approach is applied both in attack detection and access control. With this strategy, the system can be free from the overhead to handle individual flows, and focus on the groups of traffic flows. I...|$|R
