These are analysed under three different policy settings: a continuation of current policies, except for export refunds which are phased out by 2013, a continuation of current policies including export refunds and finally a World Trade Organisation agreement. Preferential imports are estimated to clearly exceed current estimates by the European Commission. In all scenarios, however, they are not found to threaten the reference price of the new Common Market Organisation.

40|$|Although the EU {{is still}} in a quasi {{moratorium}} stage concerning GM crops, doors for GM crops in the sugar industry seem to open.

40|$|A {{major concern}} about the {{mechanized}} of cane sugar production are the direct and indirect impacts on employment generation. To study these impacts were: a) made an inter-regional input-output model, using the matrix for the Brazilian economy in 1997, considering the five macro regions, emphasizing the Cane Sugar, Alcohol and <b>Sugar</b> <b>sectors</b> b) estimated the level of employment for the sectors of the model, considering the level of qualification of labor, that is, by years of study (less than 1 year between 1 and 3 years, 4 and 7 years 8 and 10, 11 and 14, and finally, over 15 years), c) built two sets for the process of machining and to changes in crop productivity.

40|$|The {{subsidies}} and protection {{structure of the}} <b>sugar</b> <b>sectors</b> in the European Union originated from the individual national protection systems, unified {{with the creation of}} the Common Agricultural Policy. The COM for Sugars is based on an intervention price quite higher than international prices. To determine who benefits from this intervention price, production quotas are established and distributed to each Member- State, producer and raw-material supplier. In parallel, levies are charged on sugar produced and tariffs on imported sugar, which contribute part of total funds required to finance these subsidies. The difference is covered by the community budget. The Eu imports sugar from ex- European colonies, paid at the internal EU price and benefitting from import tariff isention. Most of this sugar is reexported refined. There are other “entrances” for smaller quantities of sugar with preferential treatment, used, among others, by Cuba and Brazil. Subsidies and privileges are being contested internally and externally. Negotiations in international fora (WTO, bilateral talks) and preparation for the accession of East European countries to the EU will probably accelerate the reform of the COM for Sugar.

50|$|Even {{agriculture}} {{has played}} {{a very important role}} in the economic history of the island, especially in the great plain of Campidano, particularly suitable for wheat farming. The Sardinian soils, even those plains are slightly permeable, with aquifers of lacking and sometimes brackish water and very small natural reserves. Water scarcity was the first problem that was faced for the modernization of the sector, with the construction of a great barrier system of dams, which today contains nearly 2 billion cubic meters of water. The Sardinian agriculture is now linked to specific products such as cheese, wine, olive oil, artichoke, tomato for a growing product export. The reclamations have helped to extend the crops and to introduce other ones such as vegetables and fruit, next to the historical ones, olive and grapes that are present in the hilly areas. The Campidano plain, the largest lowland Sardinian produces oats, barley and durum, of {{which is one of the}} most important Italian producers. Among the vegetables, as well as artichokes, has a certain weight the production of oranges, and, before the reform of the <b>sugar</b> <b>sector</b> from the European Union, the cultivation of sugar beet. In the forests there is the cork oak, which grows naturally; Sardinia produces about 80% of Italian cork. In fresh food, as well as artichokes, the production of tomatoes (including Camoni tomato) and citrus fruit are of a certain weight. Sardinia is the 5th Italian region for rice production, the main paddy fields are located in the Arborea Plain.|$|E

In 1978, Sucrerie du Congo took over management of the <b>sugar</b> <b>sector.</b> Societé Industrielle et Agricole du Tabac (SIAT; Industrial and Agricultural Tobacco Company) was established in 1942, privatized in the 1990s, and was acquired by Imperial Tobacco in 2001. Agriculture accounted for less than 10% of GDP during the 1990s and 2000s, which further declined to 5% in 2008, even though 30% of the work force is engaged in farming and allied fields. A drawback in agriculture operations is that young men often prefer to move to urban areas to obtain work, leaving the task of farming to women and old people. This is one reason for the stagnation in agricultural growth in the country. In recent years, to boost agricultural production the Government of Congo has invited farmers from South Africa to carry out commercial farming in the country on a lease basis.

40|$|This work models {{the carbon}} {{neutralization}} capacity of Brazil`s ethanol program since 1975. In addition to biofuel, we also assessed the mitigation potential of other energy products, such as, bioelectricity, and CO(2) emissions captured during fermentation of sugar cane`s juice. Finally, we projected the neutralization capacity of sugar cane`s bio-energy system {{over the next}} 32 years. The balance between several carbon stocks and flows was considered in the model, including the effects of land-use change. Our {{results show that the}} neutralization of the carbon released due to land-use change was attained only in 1992, and the maximum mitigation potential of the <b>sugar</b> cane <b>sector</b> was 128 tonnes Of CO(2) per ha in 2006. An ideal reconstitution of the deployment of the <b>sugar</b> cane <b>sector,</b> including the full exploitation of bio-electricity`s potential, plus the capture Of CO(2) released during fermentation, shows that the neutralization of land-use change emissions would have been achieved in 1988, and its mitigation potential would have been 390 tCO(2) /ha. Finally, forecasts of the sector up to 2039 shows that the mitigation potential in 2039 corresponds to 836 tCO(2) /ha, which corresponds to 5. 51 kg Of CO(2) per liter of ethanol produced, or 55 % above the negative emission level.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the economic}} effects of different magnitudes of tariff cuts, different tariff cutting formulas, {{the implications of}} tariff capping as well as different numbers and width of tariff bands in the market access pillar of the Doha Round agricultural negotiations. The simulations are conducted with an extended version of the GTAP model and an extended version of the GTAP data base (6. 0) including bound and applied rates. The results reveal that the EU- 27 experiences a negative change of its trade balance in the highly protected beef and <b>sugar</b> <b>sectors.</b> The relative increase of EU beef and sugar imports is mainly evoked by the magnitude of tariff cuts and, to a lesser extent, {{by the kind of}} formula used to implement the tariff cuts. In contrast, the EU trade balance for milk and cereals is hardly influenced by different options to cut tariffs. Here, the negative change of the trade balance is mainly driven by the elimination of export subsidies.
