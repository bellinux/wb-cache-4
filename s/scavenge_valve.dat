40|$|Fuel {{efficiency}} and torque performance {{are two major}} challenges for highly downsized turbocharged engines. However, the inherent characteristics of the turbocharged SI engine such as negative PMEP, knock sensitivity and poor transient performance significantly limit its maximum potential. Conventional ways of improving the problems above normally concentrate solely on the engine side or turbocharger side leaving the exhaust manifold in between ignored. This paper investigates this neglected area by highlighting a novel means of gas exchange process. Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) is an alternative way of accomplishing the gas exchange process in turbocharged engines. The DEP concept engine features two exhaust valves but with separated function. The blow-down valve acts like a traditional turbocharged exhaust valve to evacuate the first portion of the exhaust gas to the turbine. While the <b>scavenge</b> <b>valve</b> feeding the latter portion of the exhaust gas directly into the low resistant exhaust pipe behaves similarly to valves in a naturally aspirated engine. By combining the characteristics of both turbocharged and naturally aspirated engines, high backpressure between the turbine inlet and the exhaust port is maintained in the blowdown phase while significant reduction of the backpressure could be achieved in the latter displacement phase. This is directly beneficial for pumping work and residual gas scavenging. Combustion phasing & stability and turbocharger efficiency could also benefit from such concept. This simulation study was carried out using a validated 1 D model of a highly downsized SI engine. Two degrees of freedom including the lift and {{the duration of the}} <b>scavenge</b> <b>valve</b> were optimized to achieve minimum BSFC. The potential for higher attainable BMEP was also briefly investigated at low engine speed...|$|E
40|$|Cylinder scavenging, {{negative}} PMEP {{and knock}} sensitivity at high engine speeds {{are some of}} the main challenges facing downsized turbocharged SI engines, while torque deficiency is more of a problem related to engines under low speed conditions. Traditional downsized engine can currently only address the above problems within a very small window inevitably leaving the other situation compromised which would either affect fuel efficiency or engine power. In order to simultaneously enhance the already competitive advantages while mitigating inherent deficiencies of turbocharged engines, some novel techniques need to be investigated. Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) is such a gas exchange concept where two exhaust ports from each cylinder are separated into different manifolds. The blow-down pulse is directed through one valve that leads to the turbocharger in order to boost the intake charge, while the other valve path (termed <b>scavenge</b> <b>valve)</b> bypasses the turbine to scavenge the remainder of the exhaust. By combining the characteristics of the downsized turbocharged engine and the scavenging process of a more-normal naturally aspirated engine, both the torque performance and the gas exchange process could be enhanced. In this paper, the DEP concept will be investigated in simulation using a validated highly downsized 2. 0 Litre SI engine model. The final results showed that the BMEP & transient performance, BSFC and the stability of the engine were all improved {{due to the fact that}} the DEP concept features better gas exchange process and improved combustion efficiency...|$|E
5000|$|The Humphrey pump {{could operate}} {{with either a}} {{four-stroke}} or two-stroke cycle. [...] Their normal operation was a four-stroke cycle. This required mechanical interlocks to the inlet valves, so that the exhaust and <b>scavenge</b> <b>valves</b> open once during the cycle to allow scavenging of the exhaust, but not during the compression cycle afterwards. A two-stroke cycle was also possible, if adequate scavenging could be achieved. The air trapped within the combustion chamber of a Humphrey pump has two roles: both for combustion and also as an air spring to maintain the oscillating water column. As this spring action involves a large volume of air, relative to the minimal air needed for combustion, the air cools easily to below the ignition temperature to pre-ignite the next charge. There {{would still be a}} risk of inefficient four-stroking though, unless the scavenging is effective enough to sweep out the previous exhaust gases. This was done by using a tall, thin combustion chamber so that the combustion air remained roughly isolated from the majority of the chamber's air and so was scavenged through the exhaust valves first. There was no separate <b>scavenge</b> air <b>valve.</b>|$|R

Suzuki and Yamaha enjoyed success in grand Prix motorcycle racing in the 1960s due in no small way to the increased power afforded by loop scavenging.|$|R
40|$|Most {{downsized}} gasoline engines {{currently in}} the market place {{appear to have a}} ‘downsizing factor’ of approximately 30 % to 40 %. However, as concerns regarding fuel efficiency and emission legislations increase, more aggressive downsizing may have to be introduced. This, although can improve fuel efficiency and enhance power density of a gasoline engine further, has some challenges that must be addressed. Large backpressure {{is one of the most}} important aspects that needs to be improved for a highly downsized gasoline engine, especially if a Regulated 2 -stage system is considered. The Divided Exhaust Period (DEP) concept is an alternative gas exchange process, where two exhaust valves from each cylinder separately function, with one valve leading the blow-down pulse into the turbocharger turbine, while the remainder of the exhaust mass flow bypasses the turbine through the other valve. The simulation results suggest that by adopting the DEP concept, the full-load Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC) and the stability of the engine were all improved due to the fact that the DEP concept features a better gas exchange process and improved combustion phasing. The part-load BSFC could also be reduced by using the <b>scavenging</b> <b>valve</b> to extend the ‘duration’ of the exhaust valve (thus reducing the re-compression effect) and to achieve internal exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) through reverse flow. However, this depends on the authorities of the <b>scavenging</b> <b>valve</b> timing (and piston clearance) and the combustion stability (EGR tolerance). Driveability issue and poor fuel efficiency in some engine operating regions of a conventional fixed-ratio positive-displacement supercharging system also need to be mitigated. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) driven supercharging solution, with the capability to decouple the supercharger speed from the engine speed, has the potential to provide the full-load BSFC improvement and to enhance the driveability performance, with a minor penalty in part-load BSFC. Both the simulation and experimental results have demonstrated its advantages over its fixed-ratio positive-displacement counterpart. The high-load fuel consumption can be improved by as much as 17. 5 %, and the time-to-torque performance can be improved by up to 37 %. The low-load BSFC was only degraded by up to 2 %, however, given that there was no clutch fitted for the CVT driven supercharging system, a better transient performance is anticipated...|$|R
40|$|Capnography {{was used}} to {{determine}} the onset of rebreathing in afferent (AR) and efferent (ER) reservoir breathing systems in a spontaneous ventilation lung model. In the case of the Lack and enclosed AR systems, the best sampling site was found to be in the exhaust limb of the systems, 5 cm from the Y connector. For the Magill system, fitted with a hooded <b>scavenging</b> <b>valve,</b> the best site was deep inside the hooded valve. In contrast, the best sampling site in an ER system (e. g. Bain system) was in the tracheal tube. For AR systems, the loss of a fresh gas elimination pattern (carbon dioxide trace failing to reach zero) was shown to occur at the onset of rebreathing. As the sampling site was moved distally into the exhaust limb, the same pattern was seen at greater flow rates - that is, before rebreathing was actually occurring. When sampling was within the tracheal tube, using ER systems, a typical 'rebreathing wave' occurred at the onset of established rebreathing. Articl...|$|R

40|$|A simple, {{compact and}} {{lightweight}} device for coupling active scavenging systems to shrouded breathing system valves is described. Provided a scavenging minute flow rate greater than the expired gas volume is available, the unit can handle automatically changes in both variables. Optimal function is achieved with scavenging flows from about twice the discharged gas flow to about 50 litre mm" 1 At these flows the valve can accommodate the outflow of gas-dnven ventilators where driving gas and circuit gas are discharged through the same port There is no interference with expiratory valve function {{in the event of}} <b>scavenging</b> failure The <b>valve</b> described appears to be the most compact, simplest and easiest to use of those currently available for coupling active scavenging systems to shrouded expiratory valves.

40|$|In {{this work}} {{different}} {{internal and external}} EGR strategies, combined with extreme Miller cycles, were analyzed {{by means of a}} one dimensional CFD simulation code for a Wartsila 6 cylinder, 4 strokes, medium speed marine diesel engine, to evaluate their potential in order to reach the IMO Tier 3 NOx emissions target. By means of extreme Miller cycles, with Early Intake Valve Closures (EIVC up to 100 crank angle degrees before BDC), a shorter compression stroke and lower charge temperatures inside the cylinder can be achieved and thanks to the cooler combustion process, the NOx specific emissions can be effectively reduced. EIVC strategies can also be combined with reductions of the <b>scavenging</b> period (<b>valve</b> overlap) {{to increase the amount of}} exhaust gases in the combustion chamber. However, the remarkably high boost pressure levels needed for such extreme Miller cycles, require mandatorily the use of two stage turbocharging systems. Despite two stages turbocharging, combined with extreme Miller timings, may allow up to 50 % NOx reduction compared to a conventional, single stage turbocharger architecture, further NOx emissions reductions are necessary to meet the IMO Tier 3 NOx limit. Higher EGR percentages, which could be achieved by means of external circuits, were therefore also evaluated. However, it should be pointed out that, although the external EGR technology is well established for automotive and heavy duty diesel engines, it is not yet state of the art for marine diesel engines, and its application to a highly boosted engine using extreme Miller timings is not straightforward. Several different complex EGR routes were thus investigated, and for the preliminary assessment of their NOx emissions abatement potentialities, the use of numerical simulation allowed a detailed and extensive evaluation of the effects on engine performance, fuel consumption, NOx emissions and thermal and mechanical loads on engine components of the combination of different intake valve profiles, intake valve closure timings and scavenging periods with different external exhaust gas recirculation solutions. Percentages of exhaust gases recirculated in the combustion chamber up to 20 % were evaluated that combined with extreme Miller timings (up to 100 crank angle degrees before BDC) allowed up to 90 % NOx reduction compared to a conventional, single stage turbocharger architecture, with only moderate BSFC increas...|$|R
