The incidence of food-borne diseases continues to adversely affect the health and productivity of populations in most countries, especially non-industrialised ones. However, since the 1950 s, the emphasis in the industrialised world had shifted away from addressing public health problems, to problems of chemical contaminants etc., but recently <b>food-borne</b> <b>infections</b> have again become of increasing concern to governments and the food industry.

40|$|Vibrio vulnificus is a {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} both severe necrotizing wound <b>infections</b> and life-threatening <b>food-borne</b> <b>infections.</b> <b>Food-borne</b> <b>infection</b> is particularly lethal as the infection can progress rapidly to primary septicemia resulting in death from septic shock and multiorgan failure. In this study, we use both bioluminescence whole animal imaging and V. vulnificus bacterial colonization of orally infected mice {{to demonstrate that}} the secreted multifunctional-autoprocessing RTX toxin (MARTX Vv) and the cytolysin/hemolysin VvhA of clinical isolate CMCP 6 have an important function in the gut to promote early in vivo growth and dissemination of this pathogen from the small intestine to other organs. Using histopathology, we find that both cytotoxins can cause villi disruption, epithelial necrosis, and inflammation in the mouse small intestine. A double mutant deleted of genes for both cytotoxins was essentially avirulent, did not cause intestinal epithelial tissue damage, and was cleared from infected mice by 36 hours by an effective immune response. Therefore, MARTXVv and VvhA seem to play an additive role for pathogenesis of CMCP 6 causing intestinal tissue damage and inflammation that then promotes dissemination of the infecting bacteria to the bloodstream and other organs. In the absence of these two secreted factors, we propose that this bacterium is unable to cause intestinal infection in humans...|$|R

40|$|Estimates {{suggest that}} {{almost half of}} the {{population}} of the world is affected by water-borne and <b>food-borne</b> <b>infections.</b> Parasitic <b>food-borne</b> and water-borne zoonoses contribute to this statistic by inflicting a heavy toll on human health and causing serious direct and indirect losses to the agricultural industry. The inability of non-industrialised countries to keep pace with population growth, migration from rural to urban areas and the demand for clean, safe drinking water and proper sanitation means that water-borne zoonoses will continue to exact an increasing burden of ill health in these countries. The consumption of raw or undercooked meat, crustaceans, and fresh-water fish and vegetables facilitates transmission of large numbers of zoonotic infections. The burgeoning tourist industry, emigration and the importation of food from endemic regions has resulted in increasing diagnosis of these infections in non-endemic countries.

40|$|Very {{little is}} known {{at the present time}} about the {{importance}} of the germ Arcobacter spp. It can cause <b>food-borne</b> <b>infections</b> in humans and has been detected to a growing degree in recent years in raw poultry meat and pork. For a long time the bacterium was classified as safe; only recently have more and more scientists turned their attention to this issue on the international level. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has undertaken a risk assessment of food contaminated with Arcobacter spp. This pathogen plays a role particularly in the case of poultry meat. However, the available data are not robust because of the non-standardised test methods used. This means that further studies are needed on the for-mation and transmission pathways in order to be able to estimate the actual risk presented by this bacterium. It is only since the 1990 s that this bacterium, which was previously classified as a Campylo-bacter, has been assigned to the Arcobacter spp. strain. Some sub-groups cause gastroin-testinal disorders with stomach cramps and diarrhoea in humans. In the literature various <b>food-borne</b> <b>infections</b> have been described that were caused by Arcobacter spp. Some au-thors attribute to the bacterium a pathogenic potential similar to that of Campylobacter. Comparable studies in various countries have shown that fresh poultry is particularly suscep-tible to attack by this pathogenic microorganism. As, at the present time, it is not possible to definitively evaluate how harmful this bacterium is for humans, BfR advises consumers - along the lines of precautionary consumer protection - to comply with the rules of kitchen hygiene: cook meat through (at least 10 minutes at 70 °C) and thoroughly wash hands, knives, chopping boards, work surfaces in order to avoid the cross contamination of other food...|$|R
