500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to talk about ... and it's something {{that has happened to}} me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|Though Waters had differing {{ideas about}} which songs they should play, he [...] "agreed {{to roll over}} for one night only", Gilmour told the Associated Press, [...] "The rehearsals {{convinced}} me it wasn't <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to be doing a}} lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that ... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend of the Who.|$|E
500|$|For {{her fourth}} album, The House (2010), Melua worked with {{producer}} William Orbit. She {{said about the}} experience: [...] "The whole thing has been really exciting. It was the same feeling I had the first time I went skydiving. I was really quite nervous, but I knew all I {{had to do was}} let myself go and it was going to feel amazing. I wasn't {{trying to get away from}} anything. It was more about going towards <b>something.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> the music to be inspired by the future, something unknown that's never been heard before, but at the same time hold on to the values of the music of the past, to try and tap into something that's so ancient and old that it's kind of forgotten. I thought that, if we went far enough in both directions, we could end up in the same place".|$|E

500|$|Though Pink Floyd {{turned down}} a {{contract}} worth £136million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting {{it ought to be}} for a charity event only. However, Gilmour told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen, stating: [...] "The [...] rehearsals convinced me [...] it wasn't <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be doing a lot of... There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just... I've been there, I've done it." [...] In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed by Gino Castaldo from the Italian newspaper La Repubblica; the resulting article declared: [...] "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." [...] Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: [...] "It's over... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old...it is much more comfortable to work on my own." [...] Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite with the surviving former members.|$|E
2500|$|Nicolas Cage {{had been}} in talks {{to play the role}} of Benjamin Chudnofsky, saying in 2009, [...] "The Green Hornet was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do. I think Michel Gondry is very talented and I had hoped it would work. But I think Seth Rogen and Michel had a {{different}} direction for the character totally than the way I wanted to go. ... I wasn't interested in just being straight-up bad guy who was killing people willy-nilly. I had to have some humanity and try to give it something where you could understand why the character was the way he was. But there wasn't enough time to develop it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their honeymoon {{was at her}} parents' house, and Martin's {{dream of}} life with a family and a white-picket fence faded. [...] "I was 17, a married woman without real responsibilities, miserable about my mixed-up emotions, afraid there was {{something}} awfully wrong with me because I didn't enjoy being a wife. Worst of all, I didn't have enough to do." [...] (p.39) It was [...] "Sister" [...] who came to her rescue, suggesting that she should teach dance. [...] "Sister" [...] taught Martin her first real dance—the waltz clog. Martin perfectly imitated her first dance move, and she opened a dance studio. Here, she created her own moves, imitated the famous dancers she watched in the movies and taught [...] "Sister's" [...] waltz clog. As she later recalled, [...] "I was doing <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do—creating." [...] (p.44) ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Dickinson, his revitalised enthusiasm, {{brought about}} by Harris's idea to make a concept album, carried forward into the cover artwork, saying that [...] "I was {{probably}} responsible in a large part for the cover, with Derek." [...] Dickinson states that the idea to set the painting in a polar landscape may have originated from when he showed Riggs a Gustave Doré piece, depicting traitors frozen in a lake of ice in the ninth circle of Dante's Inferno. In contradiction of this, Riggs states that the setting was because he [...] "might have just seen a documentary about the North Pole or <b>something</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> something that was a departure from all the cityscapes and things. It was about prophecy and seeing the future, and so I just wanted something distant. And then they said, on the back, 'Could you stick all the other Eddies in the ice?' So I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{composing}} two songs, Jorgensen {{considered it}} [...] "easier" [...] writing {{from the perspective}} of being dead. He thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to expand it into a story where he kept [...] "pretending I was dead. I kinda creeped myself out sometimes." [...] Around this time, Jorgensen was going through a break-up [...] "of my first real relationship, which was heartbreaking," [...] combined with [...] "the fact that I had been touring {{for a couple of years}} with Armor for Sleep ... It was a very transitional period, and all those emotions converged." [...] He initially composed the songs before showing them to the rest of the band. Jorgensen wrote the lyrics in isolation. He later pondered [...] "maybe I should have asked for help but it was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be from me completely". According to Decicco, every song on the album is in Drop D tuning, often incorporating a ninth chord, which gave a [...] "super rich" [...] sound.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh--ah--yes." [...] He {{seemed a}} little confused, but {{recovered}} himself. [...] "By the way, Hastings, there is <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you to do for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not for a time, sir. Since I arrived I've been strenuously {{occupied}} {{doing things}} I ought. Now I'm {{going to do}} <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've learned <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to know," [...] he said. [...] "That fellow has a {{mortgage}} on Gerald Mowbray's land. He's playing a deep game." ...|$|E

6000|$|But oh, {{it is not}} enough, it is all no good.

6000|$|... "Yes, I think I had, decidedly," [...] she answered; and {{she hurried}} to add: [...] "Dr. Morrell, there is <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to ask you. You're their physician, aren't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely, {{there was}} <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to say to}} him--or to {{somebody}} else? My memorandum-book, Hopkins. In the basket, on that chair. Why wasn't the basket placed by my bedside?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Robert, dear," [...] she whispered, stooping over him, [...] "there was <b>{{something}}</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to ask you, but papa {{was always}} in the way. You will do something to please me, won't you, Robert?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like G. W., 'I cannot tell a lie;' so I must 'fess' that I {{sold the}} old thing, {{and spent the}} money for <b>{{something}}</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> very much,--not jewelry, but something to give away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to say to}} him," [...] she confided, [...] "something <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to ask you, too. Are you {{the same}} person, Everard, {{when you are in}} town as when you are in the country?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, my dear,' said Mrs. Edmonstone, 'I see {{no reason}} against it. But--' and {{she felt as if}} she was making a desperate plunge, 'there is <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to say to you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> to do <b>something.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{a chance}} like anybody else. Why should I, because I'm a girl, be kept {{at home and}} {{not allowed to be}} anything? What chance HAVE I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to tell you, Mrs. Zapp--something that's {{happened}} to me. That's why I was out celebrating last evening {{and got in}} so late." [...] Mr. Wrenn was diffidently sitting in the basement.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{know quite}} well, Leonard, that I don't mean {{anything}} of the kind. But there was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to say to you, and I wished {{that we should be}} alone. Can you not guess what it is?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If he {{afterward}} {{got in my}} way--that is, thrust himself {{between me}} and <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do--I would try all I could to get my foot on him, and then perhaps keep it there {{a little longer than}} was necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why can't you say <b>something?</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> a man's {{opinion of}} our prospects. Good gracious, how you fidget! Put {{yourself}} in Romayne's place, {{and tell me}} this. If you had left Stella--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait one moment, then," [...] she begged, {{turning to}} the letters by her side. [...] "There is just <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to ask you. Don't be impatient--it is entirely a matter of business." ...|$|R
