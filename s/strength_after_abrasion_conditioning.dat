40|$|Installation {{damage of}} {{geosynthetics}} occurs during their handling, positioning {{on the ground}} and the placing and compacting of fill material. Abrasion is a common damage mechanism where there is cyclic relative motion (friction) between a geosynthetic and contact soil. This paper presents the laboratory test results of mechanical damage and abrasion performed on six geosynthetics. The in isolation and combined effects on mechanical, hydraulic and physical properties of the geosynthetics were assessed. Results show that the effects of induced mechanical and abrasion damage essentially depend on the geosynthetic structure. For the most affected materials, <b>strength</b> losses <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> (in isolation and combined with mechanical damage) are higher than after the induced mechanical damage. Therefore, for most geosynthetics studied, <b>abrasion</b> is the <b>conditioning</b> mechanism which most affects their tensile strength. An increase of the characteristic opening size of the geosynthetics was observed, while their permittivity did not increase. This may be caused by differences in the test set-ups...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of different surface treatments on shear bond strength of saliva-contaminated resin-resin interfaces. Flat resin surfaces were fabricated. In the control group, no contamination or surface treatment was performed. The resin surfaces of the experimental groups were contaminated with saliva and air-dried, and then submitted to: (G 1) rinsing with water and drying; (G 2) application of an adhesive system; (G 3) rinsing and drying, abrasion with finishing disks, etching and application of adhesive system; (G 4) rinsing and drying, etching, application of silane and adhesive system. Resin cylinders were placed over the treated surfaces. The specimens were stored in water or ethanol. Shear bond strength tests were performed and the mode of failure was evaluated. Data were submitted to two-way ANOVA and Dunnett T 3 test. Contamination of resin-resin interfaces with saliva significantly reduced shear <b>strength,</b> especially <b>after</b> prolonged storage (p< 0. 05). Similar values to the original bond <b>strength</b> were obtained <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> and application of adhesive (G 3) or etching and application of silane and adhesive (G 4).

40|$|Abstract The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of grinding on roughness, flexural strength, and reliability of a zirconia ceramic before and after heat treatment. Seven groups were tested (n = 15) : a control group (labeled CG, untreated), and six groups of samples ground with diamond discs, simulating diamond burs, with grits of 200 µm (G 80); 160 µm (G 120), and 25 µm (G 600), either untreated or heat-treated at 1200 °C for 2 h (labeled A). Yttria tetragonal zirconia polycrystal discs were manufactured, ground, and submitted to roughness and crystalline phase analyses before the biaxial flexural strength test. There was no correlation between roughness (Ra and Rz) and flexural strength. The reliability of the materials was not affected by grinding or heat treatment, but the characteristic <b>strength</b> was higher <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> with diamond discs, irrespective of grit size. The X-ray diffraction data showed that grinding leads to a higher monoclinic (m) phase content, whereas heat treatment produces reverse transformation, leading to a fraction of m-phase in ground samples similar to that observed in the control group. However, after heat treatment, only the G 80 A samples presented strength {{similar to that of}} the control group, while the other groups showed higher strength values. When zirconia pieces must be adjusted for clinical use, a smoother surface can be obtained by employing finer-grit diamond burs. Moreover, when the amount of monoclinic phase is related to the degradation of zirconia, the laboratory heat treatment of ground pieces is indicated for the reverse transformation of zirconia crystals...|$|R
40|$|Epidermal {{regeneration}} following abrasion of mouse skin can {{be divided}} into 2 phases. The first phase consists of a period of massive epidermal production. Epidermal wet weight in a standard area of skin increases over 6 × that of normal within 5 days <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> and remains at this level until about the 8 th day. Associated with the increase in epidermal wet weight is a marked increase in total epidermal protein and DNA. The second phase, characterized by a period of regression, begins about 8 days <b>after</b> <b>abrasion,</b> during which the epidermis gradually returns to its normal thickness, and there is a gradual return toward normal levels of wet weight, total protein and DNA. Ribosomes accumulate in large numbers in epidermal cells during the period of massive epidermal production, as measured by the increases in rRNA/DNA and rRNA/gm epidermis. Ribosome accumulation reaches a peak of over 5 × that of normal by 5 days <b>after</b> <b>abrasion,</b> remains high for the next 3 days, and during the period of epidermal regression, gradually decreases approaching normal levels by 21 days <b>after</b> <b>abrasion.</b> A hypothesis is presented that the large accumulation of ribosomes, along with the other associated metabolic regulatory changes, acts as a “driving force” to keep epidermal cells proliferating and thus helps produce the epidermal hyperplasia...|$|R

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} 5 different surface conditioning methods on the bond strength of polycarbonate brackets bonded to ceramic surfaces with resin based cement. Six disc-shaped ceramic specimens (feldspathic porcelain) with glazed surfaces were used for each group. The specimens {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of the following treatment conditions of the ceramic surface: (1) orthophosphoric acid _ primer _ bonding agent, (2) hydrofluoric acid gel _ primer _ bonding agent, (3) tribochemical silica coating (silicon dioxide, 30 _m) _ silane, (4) airborne particle abrasion (aluminum trioxide, 30 _m) _ silane, and (5) airborne particle abrasion (aluminum trioxide, 30 _m) _ silane _ bonding agent. Brackets were bonded to the conditioned ceramic specimens with a light-polymerized resin composite. All specimens were stored in water for 1 week at 37 °C and then thermocycled (1000 cycles, 5 °C to 55 °C, 30 seconds). The shear bond strength values were measured on a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Brackets treated with silica coating with silanization had significantly greater bond strength values (13. 6 MPa, P _. 01) than brackets treated with orthophosphoric acid (8. 5 MPa). There was no significant difference (P _. 97) between the bond <b>strengths</b> obtained <b>after</b> airborne <b>abrasion</b> with aluminium trioxide particles followed by silanization (12 MPa) and hydrofluoric acid application (11. 2 MPa) (ANOVA and Tukey test). Although brackets conditioned with orthophosphoric acid exhibited only adhesive failures of the luting cement from the ceramic surface, other conditioning methods showed mixed types of failures. Airborne particle abrasion with aluminium trioxide or silica coating followed by silanization gave the most favorable bond strengths. The types of failures observed after debonding indicated that the critical parameter was the strength of the adhesive joint of the luting cement to both the bracket and the ceramic. ...|$|R

METHODS: The Y-TZP blanks were cut into 44 discs and sintered according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specimens were treated as follows: (a) control specimens, (b) abraded with 50 μm alumina, (c) abraded with 110 μm alumina, (d) abraded with 30 μm silica-coated alumina, (e) abraded with 110 μm silica-coated alumina, (f) abraded with 110 μm alumina followed by 110 μm silica-coated alumina particles. Airborne abrasion was performed at a pressure of 2. 5 bar for 15 s/cm(2). The Y-TZP was characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). RESULTS: Surface morphology of Y-TZP ceramic was changed <b>after</b> the airborne <b>abrasion</b> process compared to the control specimens. The grain boundaries disappeared and part of the airborne particles are embedded and/or rested on the ceramic surfaces. The elemental composition of the Y-TZP surface <b>after</b> the airborne <b>abrasion</b> process depended on the type and size of these particles. The concentration of Si resulted higher <b>after</b> the airborne <b>abrasion</b> process with 110 μm alumina followed by 110 μm silica-coated alumina particles in comparison to the specimens abraded with 110 μm silica-coated alumina particles. The ratio of elements normalized by yttrium for these specimens was: [Zr]/[Y]/[Al]/[Si]= 15. 2 / 1. 0 / 26. 0 / 73. 6, respectively. CONCLUSION: The change of grain topography occurred during each impact process.

Abrasion behaviors of the fabrics are assessed bymeasuring the weight loss and the color values after four different increasing abrasion cycles. The bamboo/cotton fabrics reveal the highest K/S and C * values, but the lowest L * values before abrasion. The lowest weight loss values are obtained for the bamboo/cotton fabrics. Regarding the color properties <b>after</b> <b>abrasion,</b> the bamboo/cotton fabrics show the highest K/S and C * values, but the lowest L * values {{as in the case of}} those obtained before abrasion. The highest color difference values (E *) occurred between the beginning and the end of the abrasion test (20000 cycles) and are observed for the bamboo/cotton fabrics. The rubbing, wash and perspiration fastness results of the bamboo/cotton fabrics are found to be worse than those of the other fabrics having viscose/cotton and modal/cotton yarns. However, the highest light fastness results are obtained for the bamboo/cotton fabrics. From the color values <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> and the fastness results, it can be concluded that the bamboo/cotton fabrics having the better dyeing properties lose their color more easily than the other fabrics having the viscose/cotton and modal/cotton yarns. The results also indicate that stitch length affects the color values before abrasion and the weight loss and color values <b>after</b> <b>abrasion...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} mechanical planarization (CMP) {{process is}} critical in fabricating ultra large scale integrated (ULSI) circuit devices in semiconductor industry. In a typical aluminum damascene interconnect scheme, Al is usually blanket deposited over a liner layer to fill contact holes and vias. After deposition, the excess of Al is removed by CMP, leaving Al only in the holes and vias to form interconnects. Since the slurries used for aluminum CMP typically contain an oxidant and other chemical additives, the electrochemical behavior of Al and the liner {{may be expected to}} affect the polishing rates. In addition, when the excess of Al is removed, a surface transition from Al to liner occurs. Since Al and the liner may exhibit different electrochemical behaviors in the slurry, galvanic coupling between Al and the underlayer is a possibility. Such a coupling may lead to localized corrosion or rate control problems. The objective of this research was to characterize the fundamental electrochemical behavior of thin aluminum- 0. 5 %copper, titanium and aluminum/titanium stack films before, during and <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> in a commercially available alumina based slurry containing iodate as an oxidant. A special apparatus in which electrochemical tests can be carried out during polishing was fabricated and used for this research. It was found that the electrochemical corrosion rates during abrasion were much smaller than the actual polishing rates obtained with the simulated CMP apparatus, indicating that the mechanism of Al removal by the iodate based slurry may not be dominated by electrochemical factors. A sharp rise in corrosion potential (Ecorr) during the transition from Al to Ti film was measured during polishing of the Al/Ti film stack. This potential change during transition was of the order of 1 V on the Al film deposited at room temperature. The transition was much sharper with the low-temperature (25 °C) Al film than the high-temperature (475 °C) Al thin film. The slower transition in OCP in high-temperature films is most likely due to a Ti-Al intermetallic compound formed at the Al/Ti interface. The galvanic corrosion between Al and Ti during polishing and Al post-polishing corrosion issues were also investigated. It was found that the galvanic corrosion rate between Al and Ti is 6 * 10 ⁻⁴ A/cm² and the corrosion potential is - 0. 24 V. Also, the corrosion current density for Al <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> and immersion in de-ionized water is lower than that in the slurry. In addition, the post polishing corrosion of Al in <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> in the iodate based alumina slurry was also investigated.

During the period of regression, when the epidermis returns to its normal size, the ribosome content also returns to normal. To determine the contribution of ribosome synthesis to the accumulation of ribosomes, mice at varying intervals <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> or treatment with 17 nmoles of TPA were injected with (5 – 3 H) uridine (100 μCi, I.

During {{the production}} of epidermal hyperplasia, following either abrasion or TPA treatment, {{there is a significant}} increase in the incorporation of (5 – 3 H) uridine into the rRNA of the cytoplasmic ribosomes, suggesting that there is an increase in ribosome synthesis. During the period of epidermal regression, ribosome synthesis returns toward normal levels. There is a rough correlation between the amount of hyperplastic growth and the degree of ribosome synthesis. Abrasion induces about a 2 -fold greater increase in epidermal mass, compared to TPA treatment. Accordingly, at its peak ribosome synthesis is about 2 times greater <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> than <b>after</b> TPA treatment...|$|R

Methods. Fifteen experimental composites and 15 corresponding copolymers were prepared combining bis-GMA and TEGDMA, CH 3 bis-GMA or CF 3 bis-GMA, with aldehyde (24 mol% and 32 mol%) or diketone (24 mol% and 32 mol%) totaling 30 groups. For composites, hybrid treated filler (barium aluminosilicate glass/pyrogenic silica; 60 wt%) was added to monomer mixtures. Photopolymerization was affected by 0. 2 wt% each of camphorquinone and N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine. Wear (W) test was conducted in a toothbrushing abrasion machine (n = 6) and quantified using a profilometer. Surface roughness (R) changes, before and <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> test, were determined using a rugosimeter. Microhardness (H) measurements were performed for dry and wet samples using a Knoop microindenter (n = 6). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey`s test (alpha = 0. 05). Results. Incorporation of additives led to improved W and H values for bis-GMA/TEGDMA and bis-GMA/CH(3) bis-GMA systems. Additives had no {{significant effect on the}} W and H changes of bis-GMA/CF(3) bis-GMA.

The effect of low water availability, temperature, low atmospheric pressure and strong UV radiation has been extensively studied in relation to the survival of microorganisms. In addition to these stress factors, it was recently found that silicates exposed to simulated saltation in a Mars-like atmosphere can lead to a production of reactive oxygen species. Here, we have investigated the stress effect induced by quartz and basalt abraded in Mars-like atmospheres by examining the survivability of the three microbial model organisms Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus subtilis, and Deinococcus radiodurans upon exposure to the abraded silicates. We found that abraded basalt that had not been in contact with oxygen <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> killed more than 99 % of the vegetative cells while endospores were largely unaffected. Exposure of the basalt samples to oxygen <b>after</b> <b>abrasion</b> led to a significant reduction in the stress effect. Abraded quartz was generally less toxic than abraded basalt. We suggest that the stress effect of abraded silicates may be caused by a production of reactive oxygen species and enhanced by transition metal ions in the basalt leading to hydroxyl radicals through Fenton-like reactions. The low survivability of the usually highly resistant D. radiodurans indicates that the effect of abraded silicates, as is ubiquitous on the Martian surface, would limit the habitability of Mars as well as the risk of forward contamination. Furthermore, the reactivity of abraded silicates could have implications for future manned missions, although the lower effect of abraded silicates exposed to oxygen suggests that the effects would be reduced in human habitats...|$|R
