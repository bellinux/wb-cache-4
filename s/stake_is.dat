25|$|Wager, then, without {{hesitation}} that He is. (...) There is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, {{a chance of}} gain against {{a finite number of}} chances of loss, and what you <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> finite.

25|$|The {{party is}} joined by Baron Vordenburg, the {{descendant}} of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg, an authority on vampires, has discovered that his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein before she died {{and became one of}} the undead. Using his forefather's notes, he locates Mircalla's hidden tomb. An Imperial Commission exhumes the vampire's body. Immersed in blood, it seems to be breathing faintly, its heart beating, its eyes open. A <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> driven through its heart, and it gives a corresponding shriek; then the head is struck off. The body and head are burned to ashes, which are thrown into a river.|$|E
500|$|The {{survival}} {{time on the}} <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> quite variedly reported, from a few seconds or minutes to a few hours or 1 to 3 days. The Dutch overlords at Batavia, present day Jakarta, {{seem to have been}} particularly proficient in prolonging the lifetime of the impaled, one witnessing a man surviving 6 days on the stake, another hearing from local surgeons that some could survive 8 or more days. A critical determinant for survival length seems to be precisely how the stake was inserted: If it went into the [...] "interior" [...] parts, vital organs could easily be damaged, leading to a swift death. However, by letting the stake follow the spine, the impalement procedure would not damage the vital organs, and the person could survive for several days.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} McManus to {{describe}} {{the value of the}} Steamtown collection, Jim Boyd, editor of Railfan magazine said, [...] "Everything there is no longer obtainable anywhere, whether it is the [...] "Big Boy" [...] Union Pacific No. 4012 or the Rahway Valley No. 15, a nice-sized locomotive any museum would give a right arm for. [...] Most of the other large collections do not have any serviceable equipment." [...] McManus closed his argument for the relocation of Steamtown by pointing out, [...] "What is at <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> more than tourism and jobs. [...] It is a significant part of America's past before the welder's torch is turned on the likes of the 1877 [...] "Prince of Liege", the rare Union Pacific diamond stack, etc. [...] The steel alone is worth $3 million.|$|E

500|$|Although Strolling Jim was a gelding, many World Grand Champions were stallions {{who became}} notable sires. Midnight Sun, winner in 1945 and 1946, sired over 2,600 foals, of which five became World Grand Champions. Midnight Sun was ridden and trained by Fred Walker, and owned by Harlinsdale Farm. The World Grand Champion in 1947 and 1948, Merry Go Boy, {{was known for}} {{producing}} the most desirable Tennessee Walker conformation type in his offspring, {{as well as his}} [...] "duel" [...] with Midnight Sun when he tried to defeat the older horse in 1946. The <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> traditionally a stallions' class, and has not been won by a mare or gelding since 1954, when the gray mare Garnier's White Star, owned by W.V. Garnier and ridden by Percy Moss, was crowned as the World Grand Champion. Incidentally, 23-year-old Moss was also the youngest rider to win the stake at the time. The first female rider to win the World Grand Championship was Betty Sain on Shaker's Shocker in 1966.|$|E
500|$|In {{his other}} works he experimented {{more with less}} {{traditional}} approaches to reality, so that [...] "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression". A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in One Hundred Years of Solitude. The style of these works fits in the [...] "marvellous realm" [...] described by the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier and was labeled as magical realism. Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, [...] "what is really at <b>stake</b> <b>is</b> a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed." [...] García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,"The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ..." [...] "This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited {{to the price of}} tomatoes and eggs." ...|$|E
