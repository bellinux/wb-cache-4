50|$|The {{buttress}} thread form, {{also known as}} the breech-lock thread form, refers to two different thread profiles. One is a type of leadscrew and the other is a type of hydraulic <b>sealing</b> <b>thread</b> form. The leadscrew type is often used in machinery and the sealing type is often used in oil fields.|$|E
50|$|Automotive {{engineering}} {{most often}} uses metallically sealed stripwound hoses. The {{introduction of a}} cotton, rubber or ceramic <b>sealing</b> <b>thread</b> into a specially profiled chamber during the winding process leads to greater tightness. For maximum tightness, the stripwound hoses can also be sheathed in PVC or silicone. The profile shapes range from simple engaged profiles to highly secure Agraff profiles.|$|E
50|$|Emil Witzenmann, son of Heinrich Witzenmann, {{developed}} {{a form of}} the metal hose in 1909 that eliminated the need {{for any kind of}} <b>sealing</b> <b>thread,</b> be it of rubber, textile fibre or asbestos. In this type of hose, the strip edges do not interlock but abut each other and are seamlessly welded together. In 1920, Emil Witzenmann invented the metal expansion joint. This invention was based on the double-walled, welded, corrugated metal hose (with a wound protection sheath) with radial flexibility. In 1929, it became possible {{for the first time to}} produce metal bellows. These were also developed by Albert Dreyer of Lucerne, but independently of Witzenmann.|$|E

40|$|Various organic {{materials}} {{are used as}} essential parts in Stirling Convertors for their unique properties and functionalities such as bonding, potting, <b>sealing,</b> <b>thread</b> locking, insulation, and lubrication. More efficient Advanced Stirling Convertors (ASC) are being developed for future space applications especially with a long mission cycle, sometimes up to 17 years, such as deep space exploration or lunar surface power or Mars rovers, and others. Thus, performance, durability, and reliability of those organics should be critically evaluated in every possible material-process-fabrication-service environment relations based on their mission specifications. In general, thermal stability, radiation hardness, outgassing, and material compatibility of the selected organics have been systematically evaluated while their process and fabrication conditions and procedures were being optimized.

40|$|In {{the future}} higher {{temperature}} Stirling convertors for improved efficiency and performance, various high temperature organic materials have been demanded as essential components for their unique properties and {{functions such as}} bonding, potting, <b>sealing,</b> <b>thread</b> locking, insulation, and lubrication.

Stirling convertor radioisotope generators have been developed for potential future space applications including Lunar/Mars surface power or a variety of spacecraft and vehicles, especially with a long mission cycle, sometimes up to 17 years, such as deep space exploration. Thus, performance, durability, and reliability of the organics should be critically evaluated in terms of comprehensive structure-process-service environment relations based on the potential mission specifications. The initial efforts in screening the high temperature candidates focused on the most susceptible organics, such as adhesive, potting compound, o-ring, shrink tubing, and thread locker materials in conjunction with commercially available materials. More systematic and practical test methodologies that were developed and optimized based on the extensive organic evaluations and validations performed for various Stirling convertor types were employed to determine thermal stability, outgassing, and material compatibility of the selected organic candidates against their functional requirements. Processing and fabrication conditions and procedures were also optimized.

5000|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape (also {{known as}} PTFE tape or plumber's tape) is a {{polytetrafluoroethylene}} (PTFE) film {{for use in}} <b>sealing</b> pipe <b>threads.</b> The tape is sold cut to specific widths and wound on a spool, {{making it easy to}} wind around pipe threads. It is also known by the genericised trade-name Teflon tape; while Teflon is in fact identical to PTFE, Chemours (the trade-mark holders) consider this usage incorrect, especially as they no longer manufacture Teflon in tape form. <b>Thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape lubricates allowing for a deeper seating of the threads, and it helps prevent the threads from seizing when being unscrewed. The tape also works as a deformable filler and thread lubricant, helping to seal the joint without hardening or making it more difficult to tighten, and instead making it easier to tighten.|$|R

50|$|Steel pipe is {{sometimes}} joined using threaded connections, where tapered threads (see National Pipe Thread) are {{cut into the}} end of the tubing segment, sealant is applied in the form of <b>thread</b> <b>sealing</b> compound or <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape), and it is then threaded into a corresponding threaded fitting using two pipe wrenches. Beyond domestic or light commercial settings, steel pipe is often joined by welding, or by use of mechanical couplings made by companies such as Victaulic or Anvil International (formerly Grinnell) that hold the pipe joint together via a groove pressed or cut (a rarely used older practice), into the ends of the pipes.|$|R

50|$|The {{threaded}} pipes {{used in some}} plumbing installations for {{the delivery}} of gases or liquids under pressure have a tapered thread that is slightly conical (in contrast to the parallel sided cylindrical section commonly found on bolts and leadscrews).

50|$|This {{system has}} the {{advantage}} of being able to be tightened mechanically before being <b>sealed.</b> Most <b>threaded</b> systems, such as NPT, have a seal provided by a taper in the thread, so it is difficult to orient both ends of the hose, pipe or tube so that it is not twisted. In the o-ring boss system, this problem is eliminated because the <b>threads</b> do not <b>seal</b> the connection and therefore can be rotated at least a full revolution before they are sealed while maintaining a proper mechanical connection. The orientation problem could also be solved with a suitable union.|$|R
5000|$|The taper on NPT threads {{allows them}} to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads {{compress}} against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight thread fittings or compression fittings in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide the seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without thread sealants, as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape or pipe dope (sometimes plumber's putty). As the thread body is tapered (...) , a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or <b>thread</b> <b>seal</b> tape. The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.|$|R
50|$|A {{threaded}} pipe has a screw thread at {{one or both}} ends for assembly.
