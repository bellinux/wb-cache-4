60|$|The pilot car's flight {{down the}} {{mountain}} suggested the swoop of a swallow that is <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> so swiftly and smoothly and gracefully it swept down the long straight reaches and soared {{in and out of}} the bends and around the corners. We raced after it, and seemed to flash by the capes and crags with the speed of light; and now and then we almost overtook it--and had hopes; but it was only playing with us; when we got near, it released its brake, made a spring around a corner, and the next time it spun into view, a few seconds later, it looked as small as a wheelbarrow, it was so far away. We played with the train in the same way. We often got out to gather flowers or sit on a precipice and look at the scenery, then presently we would hear a dull and growing roar, and the long coils of the train would come into sight behind and above us; but we did not need to start till the locomotive was close down upon us --then we soon left it far behind. It had to stop at every station, therefore it was not an embarrassment to us. Our brake was a good piece of machinery; it could bring the car to a standstill on a slope as steep as a house-roof.|$|E
50|$|The {{white-rumped swallow}} is an aerial {{insectivore}} that usually feeds {{alone or in}} small groups, feeding on flies, beetles, flying ants, Orthoptera, and Lepidoptera. It usually feeds close over water, pastures, and open woodland. Occasionally <b>skimming</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> its flight is fast and direct. It follows humans and other animals, and can usually be seen near humans and animals that are disturbing insects.|$|E

Like most women of her class she was armed only with a single slender blade, so that in such an emergency as now confronted her she must depend almost solely upon her cleverness in remaining undiscovered by enemies. With utmost caution she crept warily toward the crest of the hill, taking advantage of every natural screen that the landscape afforded to conceal her approach from possible observers ahead, while momentarily she cast quick glances rearward lest she be taken by surprise from that quarter.|$|R
50|$|Basenjis are small, {{short-haired}} {{dogs with}} erect ears, tightly curled tails and graceful necks. A Basenji's forehead is wrinkled, {{even more so}} when they are young or extremely excited. A Basenji's eyes are typically almond-shaped. Basenjis typically weigh about 20 - 24 lb and stand 16- 18 in at the shoulder. They are a square breed, which means they are {{as long as they}} are tall with males usually larger than females. Basenjis are athletic dogs, and deceptively powerful for their size. They have a graceful, confident gait like a trotting horse, and <b>skim</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in a double suspension gallop, with their characteristic curled tail straightened out for greater balance when running at their top speed. Basenjis come in a few different colorations: red, black, tricolor, and brindle, and they all have white feet, chests and tail tips. They can also come in trindle, which is a tricolor with brindle points, a rare combination.|$|R
50|$|For centuries, bowling was {{performed}} exactly as in bowls because {{the ball was}} rolled or <b>skimmed</b> along <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>The</b> bowlers may have used variations in pace but the basic action was essentially the same.

5000|$|There is a bat in The Oval {{pavilion}} which {{belonged to}} John Chitty of Knaphill, Surrey. Dated 1729, {{it is the}} oldest known bat.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{question}} of <b>ground</b> influence on airplanes has recently attracted some attention {{in view of}} the claims made by certain designers that the landing speed of their airplanes is much decreased by an increase in lift coefficient due to the proximity of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> in landing. <b>The</b> results of wind tunnel tests indicate that ground effect is not entirely beneficial. It decreases the landing speed and cushions the landing shock somewhat. However, it does so at the expense of an increased length of preliminary <b>skimming</b> over <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> By decreasing <b>the</b> drag and increasing the lift, it lengthens the distance necessary for the airplane to travel before losing enough speed to land. On the other hand, its influence is helpful in taking off, {{especially in the case of}} flying boats with their low-lying wings. In the conventional tractor airplane, the height of the wings above <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> is determined largely by propeller clearance. However, a small low-speed airplane like the Pischoff and large low-speed commercial aircraft with engines between wings can utilize ground influence to good advantage...|$|R

50|$|First Lieutenant Knight's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:He piloted a fighter-bomber {{aircraft in}} a series of low-level strafing missions, destroying 14 grounded enemy aircraft and leading attacks which wrecked 10 others during a critical period of the Allied drive in northern Italy. On the morning of 24 April, he volunteered to lead 2 other aircraft against the strongly defended enemy airdrome at Ghedi. Ordering his fellow pilots to remain aloft, he <b>skimmed</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> through a deadly curtain of antiaircraft fire to reconnoiter the field, locating 8 German aircraft hidden beneath heavy camouflage. He rejoined his flight, briefed them by radio, and then led them with consummate skill through the hail of enemy fire in a low-level attack, destroying 5 aircraft, while his flight accounted for 2 others. Returning to his base, he volunteered to lead 3 other aircraft in reconnaissance of Bergamo airfield, an enemy base near Ghedi and 1 known to be equally well defended. Again ordering his flight to remain out of range of antiaircraft fire, 1st Lt. Knight flew through an exceptionally intense barrage, which heavily damaged his Thunderbolt, to observe the field at minimum altitude. He discovered a squadron of enemy aircraft under heavy camouflage and led his flight to the assault. Returning alone after this strafing, he made 10 deliberate passes against the field despite being hit by antiaircraft fire twice more, destroying 6 fully loaded enemy twin-engine aircraft and 2 fighters. His skillfully led attack enabled his flight to destroy 4 other twin-engine aircraft and a fighter plane. He then returned to his base in his seriously damaged plane. Early the next morning, when he again attacked Bergamo, he sighted an enemy plane on the runway. Again he led 3 other American pilots in a blistering low-level sweep through vicious antiaircraft fire that damaged his plane so severely that it was virtually nonflyable. Three of the few remaining enemy twin-engine aircraft at that base were destroyed. Realizing the critical need for aircraft in his unit, he declined to parachute to safety over friendly territory and unhesitatingly attempted to return his shattered plane to his home field. With great skill and strength, he flew homeward until caught by treacherous air conditions in the Appennines Mountains sic, where he crashed and was killed. The gallant action of 1st Lt. Knight eliminated the German aircraft which were poised to wreak havoc on Allied forces pressing to establish the first firm bridgehead across the Po River; his fearless daring and voluntary self-sacrifice averted possible heavy casualties among <b>ground</b> forces and <b>the</b> resultant slowing on the German drive culminated in the collapse of enemy resistance in Italy.|$|R
