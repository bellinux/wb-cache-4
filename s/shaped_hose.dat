5000|$|A hose is a {{flexible}} hollow tube designed to carry fluids from one location to another. Hoses are also sometimes called pipes (the word pipe usually {{refers to a}} rigid tube, whereas a hose is usually {{a flexible}} one), or more generally tubing. The <b>shape</b> of a <b>hose</b> is usually cylindrical (having a circular cross section).|$|R
50|$|In 1957, as Soviet fighter {{aircraft}} advanced, a {{new suit}} {{was developed to}} handle the demands of mach 2 flight, most notably Su-9 and MiG-21. Complex {{by the standards of}} 1957, it is a simple design that often required an assistant in order for the pilot to wear the suit. The pilot would open the large zip on the front before the pilot entered it, zipping it closed. It had a simple hose setup that was 'H' <b>shaped,</b> with <b>hoses</b> travelling up each leg, joining at the shoulders, and travelling down the arms. Unlike the following VKK suits, it had only a single air inlet on the abdomen.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a shaping mandril {{for the production of}} elastomer moulded hoses, whereby the hose is placed on said shaping mandril for the performance of the vulcanization operation and, on termination of said vulcanization process, said hose is removed. The relation is characterized by the following features: The shaping mandril has a thermoelastic component which is at the vulcanization temperature during the high temperature phase and at ambient temperature in the low temperature phase - at the high temperature phase, the thermoelastic component has the required bend shape for <b>shaping</b> the <b>hose</b> - in the low temperature phase, the theromelastic component is in its extended shape, or it can be transferred into an extended shape with little application of force...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{two components}} suitable {{for construction of}} an all-polymer robot, namely a Synthetic Neural Network and water hammer based actuation. A new data processing element, termed Synthetic Neural Network, or SNN, based on a concept of a polymer-based bistable memory device and a conventional transistor made from polymers, is proposed. A phenomenon known as the water hammer effect is described {{for the purposes of}} propulsion of the serpentine robot constructed from polymer tubing. Arresting the flow of water in the tube causes it to lurch forward. A relationship between the <b>shape</b> of the <b>hose</b> and the direction of propulsion is investigated with the goal of using the SNN to learn to control the forward progress of the robot based on polymer bend sensors...|$|R
40|$|Flexible components, such as rubber hoses, {{are subject}} to large elastic {{deformations}} during movement of the rigid components {{to which they are}} attached. Currently, there is no inherent capability in any solid modeling software to accurately depict the <b>shape</b> of the <b>hose</b> between any two attachment points. Keil (2001) made the hose model in ADAMS/View simulation software. Keil (2002) stated that it is a very time consuming and cumbersome process to set up the model with the flexible beams and its associated joints for modeling of a flexible body without any user errors. This paper presents a method to automatically build a flexible element model using the principles of spatial orientation and vector mathematics. These accurate mathematical principles would maintain the precision in the flexible element model as suggested by Keil while reducing the time for building a hose model to minutes from hours...|$|R

40|$|The present work is {{conducted}} {{within the context}} of air to air refuelling technologies and aims at the development of an understanding of a typical refuelling tanker wake like that of an A 330 [54] and the A 400 M [54]. The wake is particularly investigated within the near field and extended near field wake regions in close vicinity to the rear fuselage. Moreover, the interaction between the wake and the refuelling hose is studied including the resulting hose characteristics. A number of refuelling conditions and aircraft models are considered for the investigation of the wake. Moreover, an arbitrary hose fairing model is considered to study the effect of the fairing on the flow field and the refuelling hose. Different refuelling configurations are taken into account for the investigation of the hose characteristics. Various hose exit positions were studied within the near field wake to assess the impact on the hose characteristics. The probe hose engagement with the associated hose whip phenomenon is a major topic within this work. The hose whip is a highly undesired phenomenon and is amplified by a specific <b>hose</b> <b>shape</b> which is characterised through an inflection point along the hose. The present research reveals that the rear fuselage wake has a crucial impact on the hose characteristics. In particular, the rear fuselage upwash is the primary cause for formation of the undesired hose inflection point. The findings obtained from the present research are used for the suggestion of palliatives to avoid undesirable hose characteristics. In particular, there is one approach recommended which aims at the avoidance of a hose-upwash interaction. It leads to the suggestion of a circumferentially shifted and radially displaced hose exit and deployment of the refuelling hose...|$|R
50|$|Hydro-Man {{is able to}} bodily {{transform}} {{himself into}} a watery liquid substance; he can access secure areas and small openings with relative ease; when his bodily mass is dispersed in this form it simply reforms, albeit slowly depending on how far apart the mass was. All of Hydro-Man's cells remain fully under his control when {{he is in his}} liquid state. Hydro-Man can also merge with and manipulate larger bodies of water when he is in his water form. He can increase his mass and cause tidal waves and tsunamis. He can turn parts of his body to liquid while retaining the rest of his human form, allowing him to slip from a foe's grasp or have projectiles like bullets harmlessly pass through him. Through great mental exertion, Hydro-Man can also turn into steam. Other examples of manipulating his watery form include firing off small streams such as a fire <b>hose,</b> <b>shaping</b> parts of his body into 'solid-water', constructs, and mixing himself with other compounds for different effects. However, this last example to defeat Hydro-Man can be using other compounds against him, since certain substances can either harden him (like cement or concrete), or make him feel sick (such as fire-extinguishers and chlorine). The Wizard enhanced his powers, through the use of sophisticated equipment. These artificial enhancements granted him increased and more precise control over bodies of water and moisture near him, which he demonstrated by absorbing nearly all the moisture in the Trapster's body. However, Spider-Man teamed up with Iceman and used Iceman's powers to solidify him into ice. Hydro-Man claims that he has not aged since he gained his powers. Hydro-Man possesses a certain degree of superhuman strength, and {{has been shown to be}} an exceptionally skilled fighter, and adept at using his powers for that purpose. In some incarnations, depending on the writer, Hydro-Man can form his forearms into weapons such as Sandman does, except that Bench's weapons are made of water. Bench has extensive experience in street-fighting techniques due to his experience as a criminal before his transformation. Though cunning, he has been consistently depicted by writers as a low tier henchman with little formal education and is often tricked into using his powers in ways that incapacitate him (as explained above). His normal attire consists of a black shirt and blue/or green pants, as well as a costume invented by the Wizard.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{tries to}} answer the {{question}} on how to best moor a wave energy converter that has the <b>shape</b> of a <b>hose.</b> A water wave test tank is used on a model with a scale of approximately 1 : 2. 3 of that of the full size structure and the tensile force acting on the mooring line is then measured with a load cell. By using Froude scaling these measured forces are then used to predict the real force on an energy producing hose out in the ocean. SWAN simulated forecasted wave data provided by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) is used to analyse the wave climate at five different locations along the west coast of Sweden and different potential test sites are listed in table 4. 2. This thesis also suggests a mooring design that allowes the moored hose to move with the waves so that dynamic load force on the mooring line can be minimized. The static load force acting on the mooring of a 48 m hose that has a diameter of 0. 5 m should range somewhere around 10 - 15 kN depending on wave weather and current conditions. A dynamic load force on a hose with the same dimensions should be between 12 - 37 kN in waves that are 1. 6 - 5 m high. Under extreme storm conditions the dynamic response to the waves could result in forces estimated at up to 5 - 14 times that of the static drift force value, thus giving a dynamic force acting on the hose mentioned above of up to 50 - 210 kN. The force on the hose in waves that are around 5 m high should be {{at the lower end of}} this force span. Wave tank tests with 0. 7 m waves and a period time of 2. 6 s on a 36 m hose with a diameter of 220 mm resulted in a mooring tensile force of maximum 1000 N. Using Froude scaling, the estimated dynamic force on a 83 m long hose of 0. 5 m diameter should be around 12 kN in 1. 6 m high waves with a period time of 3. 9 s and 37 kN in 5 m high waves with a period time of 3. 9 s...|$|R
