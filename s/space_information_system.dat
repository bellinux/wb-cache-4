40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{architectural}} {{and cultural}} heritage documentation, laser scanning technology today offers several opportunities {{to approach the}} object to study and to extract manifold information levels from it. These account for point-clouds, 3 -D models, and other data {{about the state of}} conservation. Georeferenced point-clouds can be adopted as the spatial framework of a <b>Space</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> for Architecture, integrating all spatial information acquired by TLS, photogrammetry, geodetic surveying and direct survey, but also from other investigation techiques (e. g. GPR, thermal cameras, etc.). Such information system allows to make assessments that are important for the classification of structural elements or for the determination of the state of decay or preservation of each architectural element. With reference to the survey of two wooden domes of San Marco Basilica in Venice (Italy), the completion of the 3 -D model of their complex structure is presented here through the description of its main stages, i. e. data acquisition, registration and modelling. The final 3 -D model is then assumed as a 3 -D database which clarifies the shape, the composition, the state of conservation and the structural function of the wooden beams of the domes...|$|E

The aim is the investigation of scientific basics for political decision finding, especially for the regional-specific realisation of the Alpine Convention. All ascertained information shall be included in “GALPIS”,  a comprehensive Alpine <b>Space</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System.</b> GALPIS based on ESRI ArcGIS and MS Access software works with data from different sources, like ISIS, the electronic data base of Statistic Austria, and original data and maps gathered and elaborated by the working groups of RAUMALP. This also includes ecological raster data. Dealing with administrative units, “reali space and raster space, RAUMALP will integrate the different space levels mostly to administrative spatial units representing the existing 1145 communities of the RAUMALP study area. This will be realised by overlay of grids, types of land use and communitypolygons. Major task of GALPIS is a conversion of former communal data (p. e. 1451 communities in 1951) that should represent the recent administrative boundaries. By this way {{it is possible to}} make thematic and time-integrative analyses of community data. GIS modelling of the six case studies is more complex. The conceptual model has to integrate several vector and raster layers such as land plots (“Digitale Katastralmappe”), types of land use (“Land Use and Land Cover Austriai by M.

40|$|The Reference Architecture for Space Information Management (RASIM) {{suggests}} {{the separation of}} the data model from software components to promote the development of flexible information management systems. RASIM allows the data model to evolve independently from the software components and results in a robust implementation that remains viable as the domain changes. However, the development and management of data models within RASIM are difficult and time consuming tasks involving the choice of a notation, the capture of the model, its validation for consistency, and the export of the model for implementation. Current limitations to this approach include the lack of ability to capture comprehensive domain knowledge, the loss of significant modeling information during implementation, the lack of model visualization and documentation capabilities, and exports being limited to one or two schema types. The advent of the Semantic Web and its demand for sophisticated data models has addressed this situation by providing a new level of data model management in the form of ontology tools. In this paper we describe the use of a representative ontology tool to capture and manage a data model for a <b>space</b> <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> The resulting ontology is implementation independent. Novel on-line visualization and documentation capabilities are available automatically, and the ability to export to various schemas can be added through tool plug-ins. In addition, the ingestion of data instances into the ontology allows validation of the ontology and results in a domain knowledge base. Semantic browsers are easily configured for the knowledge base. For example the export of the knowledge base to RDF/XML and RDFS/XML and the use of open source metadata browsers provide ready-made user interfaces that support both text- and facet-based search. This paper will present the Planetary Data System (PDS) data model as a use case and describe the import of the data model into an ontology tool. We will also describe the current effort to provide interoperability with the European Space Agency (ESA) /Planetary Science Archive (PSA) which is critically dependent on a common data model...|$|E
40|$|The European <b>Space</b> <b>Information</b> <b>System</b> (ESIS) was {{originally}} conceived {{to provide the}} European space science community with simple and efficient access to space data archives, facilities with which to examine and analyze the retrieved data, and general information services. To achieve that ESIS will provide the scientists with a discipline specific environment for querying in a uniform and transparent manner data stored in geographically dispersed archives. Furthermore it will provide discipline specific tools for displaying and analyzing the retrieved data. The central concept of ESIS is to achieve a more efficient and wider usage of space scientific data, while maintaining the physical archives at the institutions which created them, and has the best background for ensuring and maintaining the scientific validity and interest of the data. In addition to coping with the physical distribution of data, ESIS is to manage also the heterogenity of the individual archives' data models, formats and data base management systems. Thus the ESIS system shall appear to the user as a single database, while it does in fact consist {{of a collection of}} dispersed and locally managed databases and data archives. The work reported in this paper is one {{of the results of the}} ESIS Pilot Project which is to be completed in 1993. More specifically it presents the pilot ESIS Query Environment (ESIS QE) system which forms the data retrieval and data dissemination axis of the ESIS system. The others are formed by the ESIS Correlation Environment (ESIS CE) and the ESIS Information Services. The ESIS QE Pilot Project is carried out for the European Space Agency's Research and Information center, ESRIN, by a Consortium consisting of Computer Resources International, Denmark, CISET S. p. a, Italy, the University of Strasbourg, France and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratories in the U.
