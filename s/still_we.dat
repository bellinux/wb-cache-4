5|$|Freyja {{receives}} the slain {{heroes of the}} battlefield quite respectfully as Óðinn does. Her house is called Sessrumnir, 'filled with many seats', and it probably fills the same function as Valhöll, 'the hall of the slain', where the warriors eat and drink beer after the fighting. <b>Still,</b> <b>we</b> must ask why there are two heroic paradises in the Old Norse View of afterlife. It might possibly be a consequence of different forms of initiation of warriors, where one part seemed to have belonged to Óðinn {{and the other to}} Freyja. These examples indicate that Freyja was a war-goddess, and she even appears as a valkyrie, literally 'the one who chooses the slain'.|$|E
500|$|CSKA manager Valery Gazzaev praised {{his players}} despite their loss and hinted that {{injuries}} {{may have been}} a factor in the loss: [...] "The game was satisfactory – we had followed the plan we set out, but <b>still</b> <b>we</b> made two mistakes. On the whole I think our team played very well but of course it is a shame we didn't win. We had a lot of good opportunities but we couldn't do it. Liverpool played as we expected – they played quite aggressively. We didn't feel uncomfortable but we made a couple of mistakes." [...] Gazzaev rued the injuries his team suffered indicating {{there might have been a}} different outcome had certain players been fit.|$|E
500|$|Wenger {{was content}} with his team's performance: [...] "We are at only 80% fitness and <b>still</b> <b>we</b> got a draw with Manchester United," [...] and thought his defence stood firm against United's attack. He felt Jeffers' {{dismissal}} was [...] "deserved" [...] for overreacting, but added, [...] "He's apologised. He realised {{he made a}} mistake. He's intelligent, he's young and he'll learn." [...] The performance of Lehmann encouraged the Arsenal manager; {{he noted that the}} goalkeeper was [...] "amazed to see the referee wave play on after one aerial challenge." [...] Wenger made reference to Arsenal's low crowd turnout and suggested it meant there was [...] "less and less appetite" [...] for the Shield.|$|E

500|$|Benfica opened March {{with the}} quarter-finals of the Portuguese Cup. They played Beira-Mar {{at home and}} won 1–0 with a goal from João Pereira in the 25th minute. Trapattoni {{analysed}} the game, saying, [...] "Everybody knew this match was an revenge for the league defeat. In the first half we dominated, in the second we were dominated. Beira-Mar was fresher – {{it is not easy}} to play every three days. <b>Still,</b> <b>we</b> deserved to win." [...] Three days later, on 6 March, Benfica played at Estádio da Madeira against Nacional and won 1–0 with a goal from Nuno Gomes. Near the end, Quim brought down Wendel Geraldo inside the box but failed to convert the penalty, hitting the woodwork. Trapattoni praised his team's commitment saying their victory was deserved and they were lucky with the missed penalty. On 12 March, Benfica played at home against Gil Vicente. With the chance to open a three-point lead over Porto, Benfica won 2–0 with an opening goal from Mantorras and a second from Miguel. After the game, Trapattoni argued with a fan after the second goal; he said, [...] "I argued with a fan, not fans. I was not nice to him, but since the first game, he has not been nice to me." [...] He added that the win was very important and that Benfica had not won anything yet. Benfica closed March with an away game against Vitória de Setúbal. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first, with Geovanni doubling the lead in the second half in a 2–0 win.|$|E
500|$|With {{the open}} game world, Rocksteady {{included}} more villains to create challenges for Batman. Hugo Strange {{was selected as}} a primary antagonist, as his power and controlling manner help maintain the lockdown on Arkham City once Batman enters. Strange is aware of Batman's true identity, making Batman [...] "vulnerable and exposed {{in a way that}} he has never been before", according to Hill. He noted that Strange is a character new to many players but that his backstory and character are detailed throughout the game. Catwoman was also included based on her long history with Batman, though she was given her own agenda running parallel to the events within Arkham City. Catwoman's missions initially ended with her coming to Batman's aide, but late in development, the developers decided to give the player an alternate choice, allowing them to have the morally grey Catwoman leave the city with her loot; the addition was implemented in two days. Batman's sidekick Robin also appears, featuring a shaved head and contemporary costume design that were intended to move away from his traditional [...] "Boy Wonder" [...] image. Senior concept artist Kan Muftic explained: [...] "Our vision of Robin is the one of a troubled young individual that is calm and introverted at times, but very dangerous and aggressive if provoked. The shaved head is inspired by cage fighters, because we thought that Robin might be doing that in his spare time to keep him on his toes. <b>Still,</b> <b>we</b> kept all the classic trademarks of Robin's appearance, such as the red and yellow colors of his outfit, the cape and the mask." [...] Rocksteady originally did not plan to include Robin in the main story but later decided to as an authentic means of delivering new gadgets to Batman, as well as to introduce their version of the character and his relationship with Batman.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons, Wilkinson's junior and senior seasons, the Hawkeyes {{finished}} with 14–4 (8–4) and 12–7 (5–7) records, respectively.

But Clay had to have an operation—he'd fallen on his tailbone one year—and Danner had some back problems. <b>Still,</b> <b>we</b> were good enough to win the championship more than just that first year." [...] He averaged 8.3ppg and 9.3ppg those years, and although {{he was not a}} consensus selection, Wilkinson earned his second and third consecutive Helms Foundation All-American honors.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the world}} record attempt, Dr. Wolfgang Schreiber, President of Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S, said “When we {{introduced}} the Vitesse, we established the top speed for open-top driving to be 375 km/h. <b>Still,</b> <b>we</b> could not {{let go of the}} idea of reaching the 400 km/h mark with this car as well. The fact that we have succeeded in reaching 408.84 km/h is a thrill for me, and it reaffirms once again that Bugatti is the leader when it comes to technology in the international automotive industry." [...] The driver, Anthony Liu, claimed [...] "Even at such high speeds it remained incredibly comfortable and stable. With an open top, you can really experience the sound of the engine and yet even at higher speeds I did not get compromised by the wind at all.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Following battery re-generation {{problems}} {{on his car}} that left him unable to finish the event after having led the first 16 laps, Abt spoke of his annoyance and revealed he had some issues with his first car: [...] "But <b>still</b> <b>we</b> were {{in a position to}} at least take a podium here which would have been good points. Still good, and then last lap my car shuts off with a battery failure or whatever. It’s annoying." [...] He was also disappointed over losing the possibility of finishing on the podium, but said it was continually satisfying to compete {{at the front of the}} pack but it felt more satisfying to be the first driver to finish the race: [...] "I don’t know why this always happens to me, so many times. It’s just really annoying because in the end people forget what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|The rough-and-tumble {{world of}} legislating is not orderly and civil, human frailties too often taint its membership, and {{legislative}} outcomes are often frustrating and ineffective ... <b>Still,</b> <b>we</b> are not exaggerating {{when we say}} that Congress is essential to American democracy. We would not have survived as a nation without a Congress that represented the diverse interests of our society, conducted a public debate on the major issues, found compromises to resolve conflicts peacefully, and limited the power of our executive, military, and judicial institutions ... The popularity of Congress ebbs and flows with the public's confidence in government generally ... the legislative process is easy to dislike—it often generates political posturing and grandstanding, it necessarily involves compromise, and it often leaves broken promises in its trail. Also, members of Congress often appear self-serving as they pursue their political careers and represent interests and reflect values that are controversial. Scandals, even when they involve a single member, add to the public's frustration with Congress and {{have contributed to the}} institution's low ratings in opinion polls.—Smith, Roberts & Wielen ...|$|E

2500|$|According to the Iraqi Interior Ministry's {{inspector-general}} Aqil al-Turehi, he had {{investigated the}} device in 2008 but found it [...] "inoperative" [...] and costly and recommended that Iraq should not buy it. He told Reuters: [...] "There was corruption {{associated with this}} contract and we referred to this and submitted our report to the Minister of the Interior. We said that the company which you made a contract with is not well-regarded internationally {{in the field of}} explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device." [...] Al-Turehi said that the buying process had been [...] "marred by suspicions over the equipment and the efficiency and value of the contracts. There were senior officials involved in these transactions." [...] The initial investigation found that it could detect some bombs and the ministry went ahead with the contract despite al-Turehi's concerns.
