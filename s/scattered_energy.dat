Zael finds Calista with Zangurak, who has used her Arganan {{blood and the}} Gurak half of the Outsider to anoint his right arm. After the group defeats Zangurak, he rips off his right arm and sends it to use the full power of the Outsider to revive him. However, Dagran kills Zangurak's arm so he can use the Arganan blood and Outsider half on it for himself. He reveals that he murdered Asthar because he learned that Asthar had {{commanded}} the Lazulis knights who killed his family. He has been collaborating with Zangurak with {{the ultimate goal of}} using the Outsider to remake the world so the mercenaries have a better life. Finding he is still not powerful enough to defeat the group, Dagran tries to absorb the Lazulis half of the Outsider into the center of his body, giving Zael an opening to kill him. Dagran reconciles with the group before dying, then his spirit uses the Outsider's energy to resurrect Lowell. Zael and Calista reunite the two halves of the Outsider, which leaves the planet after explaining that its true purpose is to collect <b>scattered</b> <b>energy</b> in outer space and use it to create life on new worlds. Humans and Gurak begin coexisting, sharing their technology and using Lazulis as a neutral land where the two races freely interact. Therius decides to train new knights in the empire while leaving Lazulis in Zael's care, Zael and Calista are married in her ancient family home, the mercenaries hold a funeral for Dagran, and Zael is finally made a knight by Calista.|$|E

However, at higher <b>scattering</b> <b>energies</b> MQCT method appears to be rather accurate. Thus, at <b>scattering</b> <b>energies</b> above 2000 cm− 1 the errors are consistently in the range of 1 %– 2 %, which is basically our convergence criterion with respect to the number of trajectories. At these conditions our MQCT method remains computationally affordable. We found that computational cost of the fully-coupled MQCT calculations scales as n 2, where n is the number of channels. This is more favorable than the full-quantum inelastic scattering calculations that scale as n 3.

50|$|The {{duration}} of the transmission determines {{the length of the}} pulse emitted by the antenna, which in turn corresponds to the volume of air illuminated (in electrical terms) by the radar beam. Small amounts of the transmitted energy are scattered back (referred to as backscattering) toward and received by the radar. Delays of fixed intervals are built into the data processing system so that the radar receives <b>scattered</b> <b>energy</b> from discrete altitudes, referred to as range gates. The Doppler frequency shift of the backscattered energy is determined, and then used to calculate the velocityof the air toward or away from the radar along each beam as a function of altitude. The source of the backscattered energy (radar “targets”) is small-scale turbulent fluctuations that induce irregularities in the radio refractive index of the atmosphere. The radar is most sensitive to scattering by turbulent eddies whose spatial scale is ½ the wavelength of the radar, or approximately 16 centimeters (cm) for a UHF profiler.|$|E

5000|$|Instead of light, {{this method}} employs {{ultrasound}} for collecting {{information on the}} particles that are dispersed in fluid. Dispersed particles absorb and scatter ultrasound similarly to light. This has been known since Lord Rayleigh developed the first theory of ultrasound scattering and published a book [...] "The Theory of Sound" [...] in 1878. There have been hundreds of papers studying ultrasound propagation through fluid particulates in the 20th century. It turns out that instead of measuring <b>scattered</b> <b>energy</b> versus angle, as with light, {{in the case of}} ultrasound, measuring the transmitted energy versus frequency is a better choice. The resulting ultrasound attenuation frequency spectra are the raw data for calculating particle size distribution. It can be measured for any fluid system with no dilution or other sample preparation. This is a big advantage of this method. Calculation of particle size distribution is based on theoretical models that are well verified for up to 50% by volume of dispersed particles. However, as concentration increases and the particle sizes approach the nanoscale, conventional modelling gives way to the necessity to include shear-wave re-conversion effects in order for the models to accurately reflect the real attenuation spectra.|$|E

40|$|An {{elastic wave}} is {{composed}} of compressional (longitudinal) waves and shear (transverse) waves which have different wave velocities in solids. The acoustic field presents complex interference patterns which means its phenomena and properties are difficult to reveal. Fortunately, the energy method is more accurate than the potential function approach in describing the physical properties of the acoustic field. However, the polarization state of particle vibration excited by an elastic wave is spatially periodic in the wave propagation direction. Therefore, the energy propagation direction is {{not consistent with the}} wave propagation direction using commonly used energy method. According to the polarization state of particle vibration, a time-space averaging method based on the spatial periodicity of energy flux in the solid is proposed. The method could eliminate the influence of the interference due to local energy exchange and retain the trend of energy propagation. Several conclusions are illustrated through the analysis of the <b>scattering</b> <b>energy</b> properties of a steel shell in sandy sediment. Sandy sediment can not be regarded as a fluid nor a general solid. <b>Scattering</b> <b>energy</b> excited by an incident shear wave mainly concentrates {{in the vicinity of the}} directions of backscattering and forward scattering.

In the modeled data, we observe variations in the coherence of seismic energy and interference between backward and forward <b>scattered</b> <b>energy.</b> We then sorted data from the Emilio field in Italy in azimuthal gathers. These panels show a striking qualitative resemblance to the modeled data. We conclude that, in this case, a discrete representation of the fractures in the reservoir predicts the observation in the field data well. This supports the idea that fractures can cluster into fracture zones that scatter seismic energy. We then analyze the seismic energy on a profile in the direction perpendicular to the fracture strike. First we use estimated <b>scattered</b> <b>energy</b> in a window around the target zone to estimate the spacing between large fracture zones. The <b>scattered</b> <b>energy</b> in a later time window is shown to consist of mainly P to S <b>scattered</b> <b>energy.</b> For the estimation of smaller spacings, we rely on the smaller wavelength of these converted waves to illuminate finer structure. The result of spacing estimation is not very sensitive to the time window from which we estimate the <b>scattered</b> <b>energy,</b> because, in f-k domain, the wavenumber values of the dominant backscattered energy within successive time windows are almost the same, but frequency content drops gradually.

Exploration of the different sensitivities of Ps and Sp <b>scattered</b> <b>energy</b> suggests that the phases contain independent yet complementary high-resolution information regarding velocity contrasts. Combined inversions of Ps and Sp energy have the potential to tightly constrain associated velocity gradients. In eastern North America, inversions of Sp and Ps data require a strong, 5 – 10 % velocity contrast that is also sharp, occurring over less than 11 km at 87 – 105 km depth. Thermal gradients alone are insufficient to create such a sharp boundary, and therefore another mechanism is required. A boundary in composition, hydration, or a change in anisotropic signature could easily produce a sufficiently localized velocity gradient. Taken separately, the magnitudes of the effects of these mechanisms are too small to match our observed velocity gradients. However, our observations may be explained by a boundary in hydration coupled with a boundary in depletion and/or anisotropy. Alternatively, a small amount of melt in the asthenosphere could explain the velocity gradient. The tight constraints on velocity gradients achieved by combined modeling of Ps and Sp energy offer promise for defining the character of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary globally...|$|E
