40|$|This report {{describes}} an intercomparison of three popular broadband <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> solar irradiance model results with measured data, {{as well as}} satellite-based model <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> results compared to measured <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> data. The authors conclude {{that one of the}} popular <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> models (the Bird <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> model developed by Richard Bird and Roland Hulstrom) could serve as a more accurate replacement for current satellite-model <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> estimations. Additionally, the analysis of the model results with respect to model input parameters indicates that rather than climatological, annual, or monthly mean input data, higher-time-resolution input parameters improve the general <b>clear</b> <b>sky</b> model performance...|$|R

60|$|This {{room was}} unendurable. He must go out. He {{turned to the}} window, and outside was a {{troublesome}} noise of night-jars and a distant roaring of stags, black trees, blacknesses, the <b>sky</b> <b>clear</b> and remote with a great company of stars.... The stars seemed attentive. They stirred and yet were still. It {{was as if they}} were the eyes of watchers. He would go out to them....|$|E
60|$|He {{said nothing}} until breakfast was over, and then, asking Helen {{to come with}} him, {{went on to the}} veranda. The sun was hot, the <b>sky</b> <b>clear,</b> and thin steam drifted across the drenched plain. Had the storm come without the hail a few weeks sooner, it would have saved his crop; but now the vivifying {{moisture}} seemed to mock him. It had come too late; the wheat had gone. Struggling with a feeling of depression, he turned to his wife.|$|E
6000|$|... "Time to rise!" [...] {{replied the}} captain, laughing. [...] "I should think it is. Why, it's past eleven in the forenoon. The stars are bright and the <b>sky</b> <b>clear.</b> The aurora, too, is shining. Come, get up! The natives are all outside {{watching}} Sam while he packs our sledge. The ladies are going about the camp whisking their tails and whacking their babies in great glee, {{for it is}} not every day they enjoy such a feed as they had last night." ...|$|E
60|$|The <b>sky</b> <b>cleared</b> by slow degrees, the multitudes of crows wheeled {{off toward}} the east and vanished, the sun shone out again in quiet glory.|$|R
50|$|The sun {{begins to}} shine strongly, cicadas begin to buzz, and the <b>sky</b> <b>clears</b> up. For Kenji and Nanami, {{it is not}} just another {{ordinary}} summer.|$|R
5000|$|In 2002 President George W. Bush {{announced}} an environment legislative initiative titled <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies.</b> The <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> proposal's stated goals were to reduce three pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and mercury. <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> {{was to use}} a market based system [...] by allowing energy companies to buy and trade pollution credits. The president argued that since <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> would use a market based system, {{millions of tons of}} pollution would be eliminated when compared to the Clean Air Act. However, the presidentâ€™s critics argued that the <b>Clear</b> <b>Skies</b> policy would weaken provisions in the Clean Air Act.|$|R
60|$|The {{storm had}} left the <b>sky</b> <b>clear,</b> and over the smoke of the burning land the little fading {{pinpoint}} of Mars was dropping into the west, when a soldier came into my garden. I heard a slight scraping at the fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I {{looked down and saw}} him dimly, clambering over the palings. At the sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the window eagerly.|$|E
60|$|So, amid {{interesting}} human realities, {{and wide}} cloud-canopies of uncertain speculation, which also had {{their interests and}} their rainbow-colors to him, and could not fail in his life just now, did Sterling pass his year and half at Bayswater. Such vaporous speculations were inevitable for him at present; but {{it was to be}} hoped they would subside by and by, and leave the <b>sky</b> <b>clear.</b> All this was but the preliminary to whatever work might lie in him:--and, alas, much other interruption lay between him and that.|$|E
60|$|Then, one day, {{the wind}} dropped. The distant peaks got hazy, the shining glaciers faded, and {{the outline of}} the rocks was blurred. Although the sun was dim, it was very hot, and Jim felt morose and gloomy as he loafed about the camp. There was no use in going down to the line, and he durst not hope for rain. After a few hours the wind might freshen and the <b>sky</b> <b>clear.</b> He had nothing to do and the {{reaction}} from the strain he had borne had begun.|$|E
60|$|Another rainy spell, lasting three days, followed, {{but after}} that the <b>sky</b> <b>cleared</b> in a fashion which Captain Blossom thought betokened good weather {{for some time to}} come.|$|R
60|$|About {{two o'clock}} in the {{afternoon}} the <b>sky</b> <b>cleared</b> a little. But as the fog lifted, the wind blew with greater force, sending them reeling and plunging into the mighty waves.|$|R
50|$|Rain fell {{the night}} before the race, and the weather {{forecast}} for race day was bleak. However, in the morning, the <b>skies</b> <b>cleared,</b> the track dried, and the race began on-time as scheduled.|$|R
60|$|One day I lay rocking in my boat, {{reading a}} very famous book, which all {{children}} know and love; {{and the name of}} which I'll tell you by and by. So busily was I reading, that I never minded the tide; and presently discovered that I was floating out to sea, with neither sail nor oar. At first I was very much frightened; for {{there was no one in}} sight on land or sea, and I didn't know where I might drift to. But the water was calm, the <b>sky</b> <b>clear,</b> and the wind blew balmily; so I waited for what should happen.|$|E
60|$|Out of English Harbour, {{after taking}} on board fruit and {{bargaining}} for beads, for which Antigua is famous, {{we passed the}} lonely rock of Redonda, toward a mighty mountain which lay under a sheet of clouds of corresponding vastness. That was Guadaloupe. The dark undersides of the rolling clouds mingled with the dark peaks and ridges, till we could not see where earth ended and vapour began; and the clouds from far to the eastward up the wind massed themselves on the island, and then ceased suddenly to leeward, leaving the <b>sky</b> <b>clear</b> and the sea brilliant.|$|E
6000|$|The sun {{had sunk}} already, leaving that evening {{no trace of}} its glory on a <b>sky</b> <b>clear</b> as crystal and on the waters without a ripple. All colour seemed to {{have gone out of}} the world. The {{oncoming}} shadow rose as subtle as a perfume from the black coast lying athwart the eastern semicircle; and such was the silence within the horizon that one might have fancied oneself {{come to the end of}} time. Black and toylike in the clear depths and the final stillness of the evening the brig and the schooner lay anchored in the middle of the main channel with their heads swung the same way. Lingard, with his chin on his breast and his arms folded, moved slowly here and there about the poop. Close and mute like his shadow, Carter, at his elbow, followed his movements. He felt an anxious solicitude. [...] .|$|E
60|$|The {{storm and}} the {{landslide}} had driven away all thoughts of surrounding the Baxters and Roebuck, {{but with the}} coming of morning the <b>skies</b> <b>cleared,</b> and they felt as if they must do as originally planned.|$|R
50|$|Weather: The {{first group}} started to shoot in the rain. But the rain stopped after half an hour. The {{overcast}} <b>sky</b> <b>cleared</b> {{up in the}} afternoon and brought occasional sunshine. The wind refreshed {{in the afternoon and}} disturbed occasionally.|$|R

60|$|The figure given {{represents}} the apparent color[17] {{of the top}} of the Aiguille Bouchard (the mountain which is seen from the village of Chamouni, {{on the other side of}} the Glacier des Bois), distant, by Forbes's map, a furlong or two less than four miles in a direct line from the point of observation. The observation was made on a warm sunny morning, about eleven o'clock, the <b>sky</b> <b>clear</b> blue; the mountain seen against it, its shadows grey purple, and its sunlit parts greenish. Then the darkest part of the mountain was lighter than pure white paper, held upright in full light at the window, parallel to the direction in which the light entered. And it will thus generally be found impossible to represent, in any of its true colors, scenery distant more than two or three miles, in full daylight. The deepest shadows are whiter than white paper.|$|E
6000|$|Once off, {{she did not}} care; {{she should}} be sure of at least seeing Sylvia, and telling her uncle her troubles. She had one great start, when the door was opened, and a gentleman peered in; but it was merely {{to see if there}} was room, for she heard him say, [...] "Only a child," [...] and in came a lady and two gentlemen, who at least filled up the window so that nobody could see her, while they talked a great deal to someone on the platform. And then after some bell-ringing, whistling, sailing {{backwards}} and forwards, and stopping, they were fairly off--getting away from the roofs of London--seeing the <b>sky</b> <b>clear</b> of smoke and fog--getting nearer home every moment; and Countess Kate relaxed her shy, frightened, drawn-up attitude, gave a long breath, felt that the deed was done, and began to dwell on the delight with which she should be greeted at home, and think how to surprise them all! ...|$|E
60|$|As regards Judge Pyncheon's invisibility, however, {{that matter}} {{will soon be}} remedied. The {{northwest}} wind has swept the <b>sky</b> <b>clear.</b> The window is distinctly seen. Through its panes, moreover, we dimly catch the sweep of the dark, clustering foliage outside, fluttering with a constant irregularity of movement, and letting in a peep of starlight, now here, now there. Oftener than any other object, these glimpses illuminate the Judge's face. But here comes more effectual light. Observe that silvery dance upon the upper branches of the pear-tree, and now a little lower, and now on the whole mass of boughs, while, through their shifting intricacies, the moonbeams fall aslant into the room. They play over the Judge's figure and show {{that he has not}} stirred throughout the hours of darkness. They follow the shadows, in changeful sport, across his unchanging features. They gleam upon his watch. His grasp conceals the dial-plate,--but we know that the faithful hands have met; for one of the city clocks tells midnight.|$|E
