2500|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> is an {{apparatus}} designed primarily for firefighting operations. The {{primary purpose of}} the engine is transporting firefighters to the scene, providing a limited supply of water with which to fight the fire, and carrying [...] tools, equipment, and hoses needed by the firefighters. The tools carried on the fire engine will vary greatly based on many factors including the size of the department and what sort of terrain the department must handle. For example, departments located near large bodies of water or rivers are likely {{to have some sort of}} water rescue equipment. Standard tools found on nearly all fire engines include ladders, hydraulic rescue tools (often referred to as the jaws of life), floodlights, fire hose, fire extinguishers, self-contained breathing apparatus, and thermal imaging cameras.|$|E
50|$|WMFS has {{committed}} to keeping open its 38 fire stations, {{with at least one}} <b>standard</b> <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> at all of them, as well as maintaining its five-minute target response time to high-risk incidents.|$|E
50|$|It {{carries a}} {{submersible}} pump, supplying water from any open source to the fireground, a generator that pumps up to 8,000 l/min (twice {{as much as}} a typical <b>standard</b> <b>fire</b> <b>engine),</b> a hose box module, and ancillary equipment.|$|E
500|$|These hoses {{are built}} to {{withstand}} vacuum, rather than water pressure, abrasion, and heat. They are, therefore, constructed {{differently from the}} <b>standard</b> <b>fire</b> hose and have different end fittings. In the United States, they are standard equipment according to the National <b>Fire</b> Protection Association <b>standards</b> for <b>fire</b> <b>engines.</b> Since hard suction hose cannot be folded, it is typically mounted {{on the side of}} a <b>fire</b> <b>engine,</b> often opposite ground ladders. [...] Such hose is used in both structural and wildland firefighting throughout the world.|$|R
500|$|Hard {{suction hose}} (alternatively, suction hose) is a {{specific}} type of fire hose used in drafting operations, when a <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> uses a vacuum to draw water from a portable water tank, pool, or other static water source. [...] It is built to withstand vacuum, rather than pressure, abrasion, and heat. [...] In the United States, it is standard equipment according to the National <b>Fire</b> Protection Association <b>standards</b> for <b>fire</b> <b>engines.</b> It is used in both structural and wildland firefighting throughout the world, and is made in various diameters and connection types.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2007, the National Wildfire Coordinating Group agreed {{on a set of}} <b>standards</b> for all <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> that are used for {{wildland}} firefighting. As structure engines are sometimes used on wildland fires, though primarily for structure protection, they are also included in the NWCG engine typing.Per the standards there are 7 types of <b>fire</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

50|$|An Australian Water Tender {{can range}} from a <b>standard</b> <b>fire</b> <b>engine,</b> with a larger-than-usual {{capacity}} (usually called a tanker), to a Water Tender equipped with specialty equipment such as fixed monitors and long-throw foam nozzles (usually called a Bulk Water Carrier). Several areas also own converted semi-trailer fuel tankers, capable of holding many thousands of litres of petrol, foam or other retardant. These are most often used in severe HazMat situations, such as oil refinery fires or fuel tanker accidents, where a large and continuous volume of water is needed.|$|E

5000|$|Wildland {{engines are}} {{traditionally}} smaller than <b>standard</b> <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> and are primarily used for vegetation fires or wildland fires. They also respond to emergencies {{in the back}} country where traditional engines cannot respond. Most wildland engines feature four-wheel drive capability and can thus climb hills and make it through rough terrain. One of the features that makes these engines ideal for vegetation fires {{is that they can}} pump water while driving, whereas most, but not all traditional engines must be put into park to flow water, it depends on the specifications to which the Fire Department wants the vehicle to be built. This pump-and-roll feature allows the engines to make [...] "running attacks" [...] on vegetation fires, a tactic that can help minimize the rate of spread by having a firefighter walk the edge of a fire with a hose line and the engine trailing close behind.|$|R
50|$|Years later, Button <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> {{continued}} to be manufactured by the American <b>Fire</b> <b>Engine</b> Company, which was formed in 1891 by the consolidation of the Button <b>Fire</b> <b>Engine</b> Works, Silsby Manufacturing Company, Ahrens Manufacturing Company, and Clapp & Jones. In 1900, a group of New York investors formed the International <b>Fire</b> <b>Engine</b> Company, which included American <b>Fire</b> <b>Engine,</b> LaFrance <b>Fire</b> <b>Engine</b> Company, and Thomas Manning Jr. & Company.|$|R
5|$|Other {{advantages}} of using an electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> were {{that it would}} not produce loud noises, smoke, dust, cinders and ashes, as steam <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> did. Also, the cost of an electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> would be about one-third that of a steam boiler <b>fire</b> <b>engine.</b> A typical electric <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> weighed sixty percent less than a steam boiler of the same capacity.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Fire</b> <b>engine</b> {{design is}} based on the {{traditional}} method and product design cycle. In this way, it cost a lot of time. The article proposed a new <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> design flow. Under the parameter restraint conceptual design method, Rapid Design System (QDS) constructed the database which has the parameter reference value non-parameter model. This article taken the <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> as an example, and constructed the <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> Rapid Design System using Script, Visual Basic 2008, and Access 2007.

50|$|Until {{the mid-19th}} century, most <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> were maneuvered by men, but the {{introduction}} of horse-drawn <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> considerably improved the response time to incidents. The first self-propelled steam-driven <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> was built in New York in 1841. It {{was the target of}} sabotage by firefighters and its use was discontinued, and motorized <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> did not become commonplace until the early 20th century. By 1905, the idea of combining gas engine motor trucks into <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> was attracting great attention; according to a Popular Mechanics article in that year, such trucks were rapidly gaining popularity in England. That same year, the Knox Automobile Company of Springfield, Massachusetts began selling what some have described as the world's first modern <b>fire</b> <b>engine.</b> A year later, the City of Springfield had an entire modern fire department supplied with Knox <b>fire</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
5|$|More than 100 <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> were {{assigned}} to the <b>fire.</b> Structural <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> were used in building complexes, where a number are stationed permanently as in urban settings. Smaller wildland <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> suitable for movement over rough terrain were deployed throughout the park.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, Crown {{engineer}} Roy Hardy (a former Mack executive) commenced work on {{a dedicated}} design for a company-produced <b>fire</b> <b>engine.</b> The Crown <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> would compete with the recently-introduced American LaFrance 700 cab-forward <b>fire</b> <b>engine,</b> but built to Crown Coach standards and quality. A {{key part of the}} design behind the new <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> was adapting the chassis and front bodywork of the mid-engine Supercoach school bus for the vehicle.|$|R

50|$|Latta {{invented the}} first {{successful}} steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> {{in the world that}} was practical and used by a city fire department as part of their equipment. The steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> was named Uncle Joe Ross for Joseph Ross, after the councilman that promoted it. Latta designed his steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> in 1852. The steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> was put into full service at the Cincinnati fire department on January 1, 1853, and used as a regular part of their equipment for putting out fires. The Cincinnati volunteer fire department was reorganized in April 1853, because of Latta's practical steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> that they were using successfully to put out fires. The Cincinnati fire department officially became the first paid company of firemen. The city ordered another of Latta's practical steam <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> in 1854 and it was named Citizen's Gift, since the money to purchase it came from the citizens of Cincinnati. Boston was the next to adopt Latta's practical steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine,</b> followed by New York City, and then other cities.|$|R

500|$|The {{electric}} <b>fire</b> <b>engine</b> {{was proposed}} [...] {{to replace the}} steam pumper <b>fire</b> <b>engines</b> used for fighting and extinguishing [...] fires in the 19th century. The <b>fire</b> <b>engine's</b> water pump, used to distribute water {{to put out a}} fire, would be operated by an electric motor instead of steam. The electric motor was claimed to be simpler, cleaner, and faster in operation, and would save money, and require less maintenance than the steam <b>fire</b> <b>engine.</b> There are a few modern battery-operated models, although the environs in which they are used are limited.|$|R
