50|$|He {{was born}} in Minneapolis on April 23, 1920. As a young man, Louis had an {{affinity}} for working with a <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> and electrical gear. He studied music at the University of Chicago. He died on 1 November 1989 in Los Angeles.|$|E
50|$|The <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> {{is useful}} when {{soldered}} joints {{must be made}} intermittently. A constant-heat device has to be set {{in a safe place}} when powered but not actually in use, to prevent damage or injury. The fast-switching gun cools quickly enough to be set down a few seconds after use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soldering</b> <b>guns</b> {{are used}} where more heat is needed {{than from the}} lower-power {{soldering}} irons. They {{can be used for}} heavy electrical connections, stained glass assembly, and light sheet-metal work. Typical <b>soldering</b> <b>guns</b> are rated at 100 to 240 watts power. A gun may include a two-stage trigger to give two heat settings. Tips designed for cutting and shaping plastic are available; <b>soldering</b> <b>guns</b> for general home use may be supplied with a kit of different tips.|$|R
50|$|Commonly {{referred}} to as a soldering torch, heat torches used in jewelry making are often fueled by butane, propane, MAPP gas, or a mixture of propane and oxygen. Heat torches are more effective at working with certain metals, such as sterling, gold, and copper, because they are able to heat these metals to a higher degree than traditional soldering irons and <b>soldering</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
50|$|A library makerspace is {{intended}} to allow community members to experience technology or activities that they previously {{were not able to}} access. As many maker spaces include technology like 3D printers, sewing machines, <b>soldering</b> <b>guns,</b> coding, robotics, and wood carving machines, patrons are invited to experiment freely. The purpose of a maker space is often expressed to be inspiring an interest in science, technology, design, and life-long learning in the people who are served by the library.Over time, it is expected that the available activities within each individual maker space will grow to reflect the interests of each community in which the library is housed. Makerspaces are also intended to allow minorities or underrepresented populations, like women, or people with disabilities, to become involved with technology and fields they may not have previously considered.|$|R
50|$|The copper tip slowly dissolves in {{the solder}} and {{eventually}} {{has to be}} replaced. The <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> generates an electromagnetic spike when the button is released, {{which can be a}} problem for electromagnetically-sensitive devices. The spike can be seen when a high-efficiency LED is soldered, as the LED flashes. The heavy magnetic field produced by the tip can attract and hold small ferrous metal pieces (screws, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|Soft solder {{typically}} has {{a melting}} point range of 90 to 450 C, and {{is commonly used}} in electronics, plumbing, and sheet metal work. Manual soldering uses a soldering iron or <b>soldering</b> <b>gun.</b> Alloys that melt between 180 and 190 C are the most commonly used. Soldering performed using alloys with a melting point above 450 C is called [...] "hard soldering", [...] "silver soldering", or brazing.|$|E
5000|$|After graduation, Acopian was {{employed}} by Weller Electric Corp., where he designed a power sander and a <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> that later became {{two of their}} main products. He started his own company, Acopian Technical Company, in 1957. There he designed and manufactured the first ever solar radio. The Acopian Solar Radio was promoted as [...] "Revolutionary - No Batteries or Outside Electrical Plug-ins - Uses light for its source of energy" [...] on the 1957 product's instruction sheet.|$|E
50|$|Copper tubing conducts {{heat away}} {{much faster than}} a {{conventional}} hand-held <b>soldering</b> iron or <b>gun</b> can provide, so a propane torch is most commonly used to deliver the necessary power; for large tubing sizes and fittings a MAPP-fueled, acetylene-fueled, or propylene-fueled torch is used with atmospheric air as the oxidizer; MAPP/oxygen or acetylene/oxygen are rarely used because the flame temperature {{is much higher than}} the melting point of copper. Too much heat destroys the temper of hard-tempered copper tubing, and can burn the flux out of a joint before the solder is added, resulting in a faulty joint. For larger tubing sizes, a torch fitted with various sizes of interchangeable swirl tips is employed to deliver the needed heating power. In the hands of a skilled tradesman, the hotter flame of acetylene, MAPP, or propylene allows more joints to be completed per hour without damage to copper tempering.|$|R
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the soldering tip is regulated manually by holding the button until the solder melts, and then releasing it. When the solder is about to start solidifying, the button is pressed again, and so on. An experienced worker develops the skill to regulate the temperature according to need. Because the {{temperature of}} the tip is not automatically regulated, use of a <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> for joints on printed circuit boards can result in too much heat supplied to the joint, damaging the circuit board.|$|E
50|$|Hand-soldering tools {{widely used}} for {{electronics}} work include the electric soldering iron, {{which can be}} fitted {{with a variety of}} tips ranging from blunt to very fine, to chisel heads for hot-cutting plastics rather than soldering. The simplest irons do not have temperature regulation; small irons rapidly cool when used to solder to, say, a metal chassis, while large irons have tips too cumbersome for working on PCBs and similar fine work. Temperature-controlled irons have a reserve of power and can maintain temperature over a wide range of work. The <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> heats faster but has a larger and heavier body. Gas-powered irons using a catalytic tip to heat a bit, without flame, are used for portable applications. Hot-air guns and pencils allow rework of component packages which cannot easily be performed with electric irons and guns.|$|E
5000|$|Soldering {{operations}} can {{be performed}} with hand tools, one joint at a time, or en masse on a production line. Hand soldering is typically performed with a soldering iron, <b>soldering</b> <b>gun,</b> or a torch, or occasionally a hot-air pencil. Sheetmetal work was traditionally done with [...] "soldering coppers" [...] directly heated by a flame, with sufficient stored heat in {{the mass of the}} soldering copper to complete a joint; gas torches (eg, butane or propane) or electrically-heated soldering irons are more convenient. All soldered joints require the same elements of cleaning of the metal parts to be joined, fitting up the joint, heating the parts, applying flux, applying the filler, removing heat and holding the assembly still until the filler metal has completely solidified. Depending on the nature of flux material used and the application, cleaning of the joint may be required after it has cooled.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{reworked}} {{name was}} [...] "Al Freddy Newham", depicted {{on the cover}} of the April 1967 issue of the amateur radio enthusiasts 73 Magazine, preparing to ineptly solder the frayed cord of a <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> with the same damaged gun. [...] Neuman appears briefly, in clay animated form, in Jimmy Pickers 1983 stop motion animated film, Sundae in New York. He also makes a cameo in the 1988 Daffy Duck cartoon The Night of the Living Duck. A doodle of Neuman appears on a soldiers helmet in Oliver Stones 1986 Vietnam film Platoon. Lyrically, Neuman is invoked by the Beastie Boys on their song [...] "Shadrach", from their second studio album, Pauls Boutique. A 1980 Password Plus episode featured Neumans name as an answer, using the clues [...] "Ugly", [...] "Mad", [...] "Magazine", [...] "Cover", and [...] "Kid". (Elaine Joyce solved the puzzle after [...] "Cover"). He can be glimpsed holding a fish {{on the cover of}} the album Slow Motion by Man.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> is an {{approximately}} pistol-shaped, {{electrically powered}} tool for soldering metals using tin-based solder {{to achieve a}} strong mechanical bond with good electrical contact. The tool has a trigger-style switch {{so it can be}} easily operated with one hand. The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A soldering tip, made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured {{to the end of the}} transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the tubular copper winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms much less. A tap on the primary winding is often used to light a pilot lamp which also lights the workpiece.|$|E
40|$|Pacemakers {{today are}} {{designed}} to interrupt lives as little as possible. Farmers returning {{to work with a}} pacemaker can raise some concerns. Minimal restrictions are required in the work place, but several modifications may be necessary to the way tasks are performed. The decision to use certain tools requires the consultation of a heart doctor. The doctor can provide information about the degree of risk these tools pose as a medical threat. It is highly important to inform the doctor of any potentially dangerous situations that may be encountered with the pacemaker. Pacemakers do differ and one device may be more appropriate for the person’s occupation than another device. Recommended safety precautions for tools and equipment It is recommended to use a soldering iron instead of a <b>soldering</b> <b>gun.</b> A <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> generates an electromagnetic spike when the button is released, which can be a problem for electromagnetically sensitive devices. If a <b>soldering</b> <b>gun</b> is used it needs to stay at least six inches away from the pacemaker. Turn the engine off before working on any gas-powered tools or equipment. Caution needs to be taken when standing/leaning near the coil, distributor, or spark plugs of a equipment. Do not work on the distributor with the engine running...|$|E
