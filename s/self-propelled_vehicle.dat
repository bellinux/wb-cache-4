After his promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, {{he had enough}} {{time and money to}} devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines. These experiments culminated in 1896 with the completion of a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>vehicle</b> which he named the Ford Quadricycle. He test-drove it on June 4. After various test drives, Ford brainstormed ways to improve the Quadricycle.|$|E

500|$|The {{running gear}} {{seemed to be}} in good order, but it was still unknown if the boiler could still handle the {{pressure}} of steam and a live fire again. The museum asked the Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company to inspect the locomotive's boiler for operation. The inspections were conducted after hours at the museum (from 6:30p.m. to 4:00a.m.) over three days and included electromagnetic, ultrasonic, and radiographic tests. The tests did reveal a few flaws, but it was projected that the engine could operate at a reduced boiler pressure of 50 psi (340 kPa or 3.5 kgf/cm²); as delivered to the Camden & Amboy, the boiler was rated for [...] or 4.9 kgf/cm². The Smithsonian's staff, after a few further hydrostatic tests, were confident that the locomotive could again operate under its own power. [...] The items that needed repair were repaired, and on October 14, 1980, the locomotive was successfully field-tested on the Warrenton Branch Line in Fauquier County between Calverton and Casanova, Virginia. The site was selected, because at the time, only one freight train per week used the branch line. On September 15, 1981, the locomotive operated under steam on a few miles of branch line near the Potomac River within Washington, D.C. [...] With this exhibition, the locomotive became the oldest operable steam locomotive (and oldest <b>self-propelled</b> <b>vehicle)</b> in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{passenger}} and {{freight traffic}} declined in later years, and beginning in 1922 mixed train service was partially supplanted by a Brill railbus, a <b>self-propelled</b> <b>vehicle</b> designed to carry passengers and small freight shipments. [...] For {{most of the}} 1920s, the railbus operated between Salmon and Gilmore, while the tri-weekly mixed continued between Salmon and Armstead. [...] In 1931, the G borrowed a second, larger railbus from the Northern Pacific, {{and used it to}} provide a daily-except-Sunday roundtrip between Armstead and Salmon. [...] The mixed was discontinued at that time, and freight trains began operating only as required, usually about once a week.|$|E
