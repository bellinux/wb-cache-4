50|$|The Emoze technology, called <b>Smart</b> <b>Routing</b> was {{designed}} to provide a seamless and secure messaging for the end users. Data are constantly synchronized, in real-time, only when the mobile device is on and connected to the Internet. The user's privacy is protected and secured by enabling messages to be pushed from the originating mail server to the mobile device without storing it on an intermediate server. Private data are not being stored on a third party server, thus avoiding data loss and corruption. Whenever there is a new event (email, contact or calendar) on the mail server or mobile device, the synchronization is processed immediately.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} 2 ̆ 2 <b>smart</b> <b>routing</b> 2 ̆ 2 as a recommender system for tourists {{that takes into account}} the dynamics of their personal user profiles. The concept relies on three levels of support: 1) programming the tour, i. e. selecting a set of relevant points of interests (POIs) to be included into the tour, 2) scheduling the tour, i. e. arranging the selected POIs into a sequence based on the cultural, recreational and situational value of each, and 3) determining the tour's travel route, i. e. generating a set of trips between the POIs that the tourist needs to perform in order to complete the tour. The 2 ̆ 2 <b>smart</b> <b>routing</b> 2 ̆ 2 approach intends to enhance the experience of tourists in a number of ways. The first advantage is the system's ability to reflect on the tourists’ dynamic preferences, for which an understanding of the influence of a tourist's affective state and dynamic needs on the preferred activities is required. Next, it arranges the POIs together in a way that creates a storyline that the tourist will be interested to follow, which adds to the tour's cultural value. Finally, the POIs are connected by a chain of multimodal trips that the tourist will have to make, also in accordance with the tourist's preferences and dynamic needs. As a result, each tour can be personalised in a 2 ̆ 2 smart 2 ̆ 2 way, from the perspective of both the cultural and the overall experience of taking it. We present the building blocks of the 2 ̆ 2 <b>smart</b> <b>routing</b> 2 ̆ 2 concept in detail and describe the data categories involved. We also report on the current status of our activities with respect to the inclusion of a tourist's affective state and dynamic needs into the preference measurement phase, as well as discuss relevant practical concerns in this regard...|$|E

40|$|We study online graph queries that {{retrieve}} nearby nodes of a query node {{from a large}} network. To answer such queries {{with high}} throughput and low latency, we partition the graph and process the data in parallel across a cluster of servers. State-of-the-art distributed graph querying systems place each graph partition on a separate server, where query answering over that partition takes place. This design has two major disadvantages. First, the router needs to maintain a fixed routing table. Hence, these systems are less flexible with respect to query routing, fault tolerance, and graph updates. Second, the graph data must be partitioned such that the workload across the servers is balanced, and the inter-machine communication is minimized. In addition, it is required to update the existing partitions based on workload changes over graph nodes. However, graph partitioning, online monitoring of workloads, and dynamically updating the graph partitions are expensive. In this work, we mitigate both these problems by decoupling graph storage from query processors, and by developing <b>smart</b> <b>routing</b> strategies that improve the cache locality in query processors. Since a query processor is no longer assigned any fixed part of the graph, it is equally capable of handling any request, thus facilitating load balancing and fault tolerance. On the other hand, due to our <b>smart</b> <b>routing</b> strategies, query processors can effectively leverage their cache contents, reducing the overall impact of how the graph is partitioned across storage servers. A detailed experimental evaluation with several real-world, large graph datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, gRouting - even with simple hash partitioning of the data - achieves up to {{an order of magnitude}} better query throughput compared to existing graph querying systems that employ expensive graph partitioning and re-partitioning strategies.

A wireless ad-hoc sensor network based on the IEEE 802. 11 b standard {{is used as a}} simulation testbed to determine statistical distribution of interference levels. Three different routing methods are used – flood routing, location aware rout-ing (LAR) and a simultaneous localization and radio environment mapping based routing (SLAM routing). Results show that LAR partially reduces in-terference by limiting number of transmissions for a single packet resulting in lower interference. SLAM based routing causes significantly lower interfer-ence throughut the network by both lowering the number of transmissions and reducing the radiated power close to the minimum required for a successful transmission, resulting in an interference noise floor 19. 7 dB below the flood routing protocol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Cascading {{failures}} {{are crucial}} {{issues for the}} study of survivability and resilience of our infrastructures and have attracted much interest in complex networks research. In this paper, we study the overload-based cascading failure model and propose a soft defense strategy to mitigate the damage from such cascading failures. In particular, we assign adjustable weights to individual links of a network and control the weight parameter. The information flow and the routing patterns in a network are then controlled based on the assigned weights. The main idea of this work is to control the traffics on the network and we verify the effectiveness of the load redistribution for mitigating cascading failure. Numerical results imply that network robustness can be enhanced significantly using the relevant <b>smart</b> <b>routing</b> strategy, in which loads in the network are properly redistributed.

In this paper, we first give a simple localized routing algorithm, called Localized Energy-Aware Restricted Neighborhood routing (LEARN), which can guarantee the energy efficiency of its route if it can find the route successfully. We then theoretically study its critical transmission radius in random networks which can guarantee that LEARN routing finds a route for any source and destination pairs asymptotically almost surely. We also extend the proposed routing into three-dimensional (3 D) networks and derive its critical transmission radius in 3 D random networks.
