40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{our study}} was to verify the impact of benign and {{malignant}} residual glandular tissue on <b>surgical</b> <b>bed</b> after radical prostatectomy, {{in terms of both}} biochemical and clinical disease progression, in a group of patients with pathologically organ-confined cancer of the prostate (PCa). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Files from 70 consecutive patients who undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP) for organ-confined PCa were retrospectively evaluated. During each intervention, after prostate removal, biopsies of the <b>surgical</b> <b>bed</b> were obtained from the following sites: urethral/periapical section margin, basal, left and right postero-lateral and under/retrotrigonal regions. No patient was been previously treated with either radiation or hormone therapy. We evaluated the relationship between the presence of either benign or malignant prostatic cells at <b>surgical</b> <b>bed</b> biopsies and the following parameters: postoperative serum PSA levels, definitive Gleason score, tumour staging, margin status. RESULTS: In all cases pathological stage was pT 2 NOMO, an immediate postoperative PSA zeroing occurred and surgical margins were negative. <b>Surgical</b> <b>bed</b> biopsies after prostate removal were positive for malignant cells in 5 / 70 cases (7. 1...|$|E

40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 38 - 44 Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess histologically the effect of {{low-level}} laser therapy (LLLT) (λ 830 nm) on the healing of bone defects associated with autologous bone graft. Background Data: LLLT has been used on the modulation of bone healing because of the photo-physical and photochemical properties of some wavelengths. The use of correct and appropriate parameters has been shown to be effective in the promotion of a positive biomodulative effect on the healing bone. Methods: Sixty male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: G 1 (control), G 2 (LLLT on the <b>surgical</b> <b>bed),</b> G 3 (LLLT on the graft), and G 4 (LLLT on both the graft and the <b>surgical</b> <b>bed).</b> The dose per session was 10 J/cm 2, and it was applied to the <b>surgical</b> <b>bed</b> (G 2 /G 4) and on the bone graft (G 3 /G 4). LLLT was carried out every other day for 15 days (λ 830 nm, = 0. 5 cm 2, 50 Mw, 10 J/cm 2). The dose was fractioned in four points. The animals were sacrificed 15, 21, and 30 days after surgery; specimens were taken and routinely processed (wax, cut, and stain with H&E and Sirius red stains). Light microscopic analysis was performed by a pathologist. Results: In the groups in which the LLLT was used trans-operatively on the <b>surgical</b> <b>bed</b> (G 2 /G 4), bone remodeling was both quantitatively and qualitatively more evident when compared to subjects of groups G 1 and G 3. Conclusion: The present study indicates that the use of LLLT trans-operatively resulted in a positive biomodulative effect on the healing of bone defects associated with autologous bone grafts...|$|E

Methods: This study included 60 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy who were pro-spectively randomized into 2 groups.

The bupivacaine group (n 30) received 20 cc of 0. 5 % bupivacaine in at the same surgical site. Pain was assessed at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours by using a visual analog scale (VAS). Results: A significant difference (P. 018) was observed in pain levels between both groups at 6 hours postoper-atively. The average analgesic requirement was lower in the bupivacaine group, but this did not reach statistical significance.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{cross-sectional study}} was to determine the impact of (1) ring fencing in-patient general <b>surgical</b> <b>beds</b> and (2) introducing a pre-operative assessment clinic (PAC) on the day of surgery admission (DOSA) rate in a single Irish institution. The secondary aim was to analyse the impact of an increased rate of DOSA on cost efficiency and patient satisfaction. METHODS: An 18 -month period was examined following ring-fencing of elective and emergency <b>surgical</b> <b>beds.</b> A PAC was established during the study period. Prospectively collected data pertaining to all surgical admissions were retrieved using patient administration system software (Powerterm Pro, Eircom Software) and a database of performance information from Irish Public Health Services (HealthStat). RESULTS: Ring-fencing and PAC establishment was associated with a significant increase in the overall DOSA rate from 56 to 85  %, surpassing the national target rate of DOSA (75  %). Data relating specifically to general surgery admissions mirrored this increase in DOSA rate from a median of 5 patients per month, before the advent of ring-fencing and PAC, to 42 patients per month (p <  0. 0387). 100 patient surveys demonstrated high levels of satisfaction with DOSA, with a preference compared to admission one night pre-operatively. Cost analysis demonstrated overall savings of 340, 370 Euro from this change in practice. CONCLUSION: The present study supports the practice of DOSA through the introduction of ring-fenced <b>surgical</b> <b>beds</b> and PAC. This has been shown to improve hospital resource utilisation and streamline surgical service provision in these economically challenging times...|$|R

40|$|Radiotherapy {{following}} {{breast cancer}} conserving surgery decreases {{the risks of}} local recurrence. Because 85 % of breast cancers relapse in or around the <b>surgical</b> <b>bed</b> {{there has been some}} debate on the need for irradiating the whole breast. Electron intraoperative radiotherapy (ELIOT) {{has been used as a}} viable alternative for conventional external radiotherapy (RT). While the former requires a single dose of 21 Gy in the tumoral bed, the latter requires 5 - 6 weeks of irradiation with a total dose of 50 Gy and a boost of 10 Gy that irradiates the <b>surgical</b> <b>bed.</b> Herein, we investigated whether any significant differences exist between the mammography findings obtained from patients submitted to one of the two techniques. Two groups of 30 patients each were included in this study. All patients had mammographies taken at 12 and 24 months after finishing treatment. The mammography findings evaluated were: cutaneous thickening (> 2 mm), architectural distortion secondary to fibrosis, edema, calcifications (both benign and malignant), and fat necrosis. For all variables studied, there was no statistical difference between the two groups. This indicates that the mammography findings obtained in either 12 - or 24 -month follow-up periods after breast cancer conserving surgery are similar, regardless of which of the two radiotherapy techniques (ELIOT or RT) is employed as a treatment for breast cancer.
