5|$|Protein folding {{does not}} occur in one step. Instead, {{proteins}} {{spend most of their}} folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, waiting in various intermediate conformational states, each a local thermodynamic free energy minimum in the protein's energy landscape. Through a process known as adaptive sampling, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a set of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a Markov <b>state</b> <b>model</b> (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are discrete-time master equation models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov <b>state</b> <b>model</b> method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on GPUGRID) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov <b>state</b> <b>model</b> is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear parallelization, leading to an approximately four orders of magnitude reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's phase space (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Guinness World Records {{recognized}} Folding@home as {{the most}} powerful distributed computing network. As of September 30, 2014, the project has 107,708 active CPU cores and 63,977 active GPUs for a total of 40.190 x86 petaFLOPS (19.282 native petaFLOPS). At the same time, the combined efforts of all distributed computing projects under BOINC totals 7.924 petaFLOPS. In November 2012, Folding@home updated its accounting of FLOPS, especially for GPUs, and now reports the number of active processor cores and physical processors. Using the Markov <b>state</b> <b>model</b> method, Folding@home achieves strong scaling across its user base and gains a linear speedup for every added processor. This network allows Folding@home to do work that was formerly impractical computationally.|$|E
5|$|Rosetta@home is a {{distributed}} computing project aimed at protein structure prediction {{and is one}} of the most accurate tertiary structure predictors. The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov <b>state</b> <b>model</b> as starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.|$|E

In addition, PackTags were designed to address OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculations.

25|$|The unified {{kingdom of}} Denmark {{emerged in the}} 10th century as a {{proficient}} seafaring nation {{in the struggle for}} control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark, Sweden and Norway were ruled together under the Kalmar Union, established in 1397 and ending with Swedish secession in 1523. Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until outside forces dissolved the union in 1814. The union with Norway made it possible for Denmark to inherit the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Iceland. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several cessions of territory to Sweden. In the 19th century there was a surge of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the 1864 Second Schleswig War. Denmark remained neutral during World War I. In April 1940, a German invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943 until the German surrender in May 1945.

500|$|A {{work unit}} is the protein data {{that the client}} is asked to process. Work units are a {{fraction}} of the simulation between the states in a Markov <b>state</b> <b>model.</b> After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points. [...] This cycle repeats automatically. All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium3 450MHz CPU with Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE). However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as {{a major part of the}} scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.|$|E
500|$|After World War II, two {{distinct}} possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle's steady <b>state</b> <b>model,</b> whereby new matter {{would be created}} as the universe seemed to expand. In this model the universe is roughly the same {{at any point in}} time. The other was Lemaître's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by George Gamow, who introduced big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) and whose associates, Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman, predicted the CMB. Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lemaître's theory, referring to it as [...] "this big bang idea" [...] during a BBC Radio broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio source counts, began to favor Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form {{in the context of the}} Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.|$|E
