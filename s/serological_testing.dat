25|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} in culturing Borrelia bacteria in the laboratory, diagnosis of Lyme disease is typically based on the clinical exam findings {{and a history of}} exposure to endemic Lyme areas. The EM rash, which does not occur in all cases, is considered sufficient to establish a diagnosis of Lyme disease even when serologic blood tests are negative. <b>Serological</b> <b>testing</b> can be used to support a clinically suspected case, but is not diagnostic by itself.|$|E
25|$|<b>Serological</b> <b>testing</b> is {{much more}} {{frequently}} used in areas where leishmaniasis is endemic. A 2014 Cochrane review evaluated different rapid diagnostic tests. One of them (the rK39 immunochromatographic test) gave correct, positive results in 92% of the people with visceral leishmaniasis and it gave correct, negative results in 92% {{of the people who}} did not have the disease. A second rapid test (called latex agglutination test) gave correct, positive results in 64% of the people with the disease and it gave correct, negative results in 93% of the people without the disease. Other types of tests have not been studied thoroughly enough to ascertain their efficacy.|$|E
25|$|Serum {{blood tests}} are an {{important}} marker of disease severity, and are also useful for the primary diagnosis of ABPA. When serum IgE is normal (and patients are not being treated by glucocorticoid medications), ABPA is excluded {{as the cause of}} symptoms. A raised IgE increases suspicion, though there is no universally accepted cut-off value. Values can be stated in international units (IU/mL) or ng/mL, where 1 IU is equal to 2.4ng/mL. Since studies began documenting IgE levels in ABPA during the 1970s, various cut-offs between 833–1000 IU/mL have been employed to both exclude ABPA and to warrant further <b>serological</b> <b>testing.</b> Current consensus is that a cut-off of 1000 IU/mL should be employed, as lower values are encountered in SAFS and asthmatic sensitization.|$|E

40|$|This review covers some {{epidemiological}} {{aspects that}} allow Brucella to survive, spread, and maintain {{itself in the}} environment. Because the success of maintaining Brucella-free herds {{is determined by the}} efficiency of the <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> to detect a single infected animal the limitations of the traditional <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> are emphasized. <b>Serological</b> <b>tests</b> cannot differentiate between cattle infected with Brucella and cattle infected with microorganisms that serologically cross-react with B. abortus antigen. These cattle and cattle with 'natural' antibodies jeopardize the Brucella-free status of a herd. Likewise, infected cattle with serologically inconclusive test results or which elude detection are also a hazard to Brucella-free herds. Since cattle that elude detection with <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> and the presence of non-specific serum antibodies in healthy cattle have long been recignized as problems, it is opportune to reconsider the procedures currently used to diagnose brucellosis in individual animals. Use of the skin delayed-type hypersensitivity test in addition to <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> will significantly improve the diagnosis of brucellosis. This will limit the financial loss incurred by outbreaks of brucellosis...|$|R
2500|$|WSAVA also prefers <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> over {{unnecessary}} boosters or re-vaccination {{doses of}} core vaccines {{after the initial}} 12-month booster that follows the kitten series of modified live virus [...] vaccines. This is because core vaccines show an excellent correlation between the presence of antibody and protective immunity to a disease, and have a long DOI (Duration of Immunity).

2500|$|In 2002, Mayo Clinic {{researchers}} identified an humoral mechanism, targeting a perivascular protein, as {{the culprit}} for NMO and in 2004 an unknown specific autoantibody was found. In 2005 they identified the aquaporin 4 protein as {{the target of}} the disease, and developed a test to aid in the diagnosis of Devic's disease by detection of an antibody, NMO-IgG, in the blood. Some patients with NMO may be seronegative for NMO-IgG, whilst some patients with NMO-IgG may still not fulfill clinical criteria for NMO thus <b>serological</b> <b>testing</b> is now an important part [...] of the diagnostic procedure and seropositive and seronegative cases are described {{in a manner similar to}} myasthenia gravis.

A case definition which included a positive Widal test (TO⩾ 80 & TH>A), a positive Tubex® test (⩾ 4) and a positive Typhidot-M® test, increased the detection of cases by more than twofold from 13 to 28 cases. The case definition has a specificity of 100 % and a sensitivity of 39 %.

The aim {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of 2 commercial, rapid in-clinic <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> for the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies in sera of dogs, the Snap Canine Leishmania Antibody Test kit (IDEXX Laboratories Inc., Westbrook, Maine) and the ImmunoRun Antibody Detection kit (Biogal Galed Labs, Kibbutz Galed, Israel), using indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) as the reference method. A total of 109 sera collected from 65 seropositive and 44 seronegative dogs were used. The sensitivities of the Snap and ImmunoRun kits were 89. 23 % (95 % confidence interval: 79. 05 - 95. 54 %) and 86. 15 % (95 % confidence interval: 75. 33 - 93. 45 %), respectively, and the specificity of both tests was 100 %. A good agreement between each of the rapid in-clinic <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> and IFAT and between the 2 rapid in-clinic <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> was witnessed.

40|$|AbstractSerological {{tests for}} {{tuberculosis}} are inaccurate and WHO has recommended against their use. Although not {{used by the}} Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP), serodiagnostics are widely used {{in the private sector}} in India. A root-cause analysis was undertaken to determine why <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> are so popular, and seven root causes were identified that can be grouped into three categories: technical/medical, economic, and regulatory. Technical/medical: RNTCP’s current low budget does not allow scale-up of the newer, WHO-endorsed technologies. Thus, under the RNTCP, most patients have access to only smear microscopy, a test that is insensitive and underused in the private sector. Because there is no accurate, validated, point-of-care <b>test</b> for TB, <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> meet a perceived need among doctors and patients. Economic: While imported molecular or liquid culture tests are too expensive, there are no affordable Indian versions on the market, leaving <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> as the main alternative. Although <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> are inaccurate, various players along the value chain profit from their use, and this sustains a market for these tests. Regulatory: TB tests are poorly regulated and a large number of serological kits are on the market. Private healthcare in general is poorly regulated, and doctors in the private sector are outside the scope of RNTCP and do not necessarily follow standard guidelines. A clear understanding of these realities should facilitate market-based strategies that can help replace <b>serological</b> <b>tests</b> with accurate, validated tools...|$|R
