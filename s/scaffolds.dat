In this study, we performed a systematic analy-sis of <b>scaffold</b> proteins in signal transduction by integrating protein-protein interaction and kinase-substrate relationship networks. We predicted 212 <b>scaffold</b> proteins that are involved in 605 distinct signaling pathways. The computational prediction was validated using a protein microarray-based approach. The predicted <b>scaffold</b> proteins showed several interesting characteristics, as we expected from the functionality of <b>scaffold</b> proteins. We found that the <b>scaffold</b> proteins are likely to interact with each other, which is consistent with previous finding that <b>scaffold</b> proteins tend to form homodimers and heterodimers.

40|$|Abstract. Tissue {{engineered}} {{heart valve}} (TEHV) is a valve replacement of <b>scaffold</b> materials on which live cells grow. Theoretically, TEHV has good tissue compatibility, self-repair potential and life-long durability, {{which serves as}} the optimal replacement for a heart valve. As {{a result of the}} specific position and function of a specific heart valve, significantly high requirements of mechanical and biological properties are necessary for optimal function. A substantial number of studies suggested that the TEHV available at present has insufficient mechanical properties and lacks relevant anti-calcification function, both of which prevent the successful application of TEHV into clinical practice. A desirable valvular <b>scaffold,</b> which mimics the three-dimensional ultrastructures of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the heart valve, should possess the ECM bioactivity, favorable tissue compatibility and suitable mechanical properties. However, no such valve <b>scaffold</b> is currently available. Hence, clinical efforts should be made to remodel the <b>scaffold</b> materials, allowing for utilizing its functionalization. Here, we reviewed the <b>scaffold</b> materials previously used in TEHV, e. g. decellularized <b>scaffold,</b> polymer-based <b>scaffold,</b> nano-scaffold and nanocomposite <b>scaffold</b> and <b>scaffold</b> material modification...|$|R
