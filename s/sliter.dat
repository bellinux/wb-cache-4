30|$|A {{much less}} {{common type of}} OPS in the Franciscan Complex {{consists}} of basalt overlain by limestone overlain by clastic sedimentary rocks. The basalt of such packages exhibit ocean island basalt (OIB) geochemical affinity (Ghatak et al. 2012). Limestone is rare in the Franciscan Complex and much less abundant than chert (<b>Sliter</b> 1984). Limestone horizons are commonly tens of meters in thickness, and the thickest limestone horizon (130  m) {{is associated with the}} Permanente terrane (<b>Sliter</b> 1984). Owing to the faulting and deformation of the rocks, {{it is not clear whether}} this 130  m thickness was thickened relative to its original stratigraphic thickness by internal faults, but it probably was, by analogy to well-constrained chert exposures of the Marin Headlands as well as ubiquitous occurrence of imbricate faults in all OPS lithologies as will be reviewed in “Imbrication and deformation of OPS and distinguishing tectonic from sedimentary melanges.” Much of the limestone section of the Permanente terrane is interbedded with chert (<b>Sliter</b> 1984; Murchey and Jones 1984). The longest duration of limestone deposition is recorded in the Permanente terrane ranges from early Albian to Turonian (<b>Sliter</b> 1984) (Fig.  5) or ca. 110 – 90  Ma (Cohen et al. 2013, updated). The Permanente terrane has a significant clastic component, but it is less than most Franciscan units excluding the Marin Headlands. This clastic component is primarily siliciclastic, including siliciclastic-matrix mélange, but it may include sedimentary serpentinite mélange as well (Wakabayashi 2012).|$|E

The age gap reflects {{the absence of the}} youngest part of the pelagic record rather than the oldest part of the clastic record because in several cases, the ages for the clastic section are maximum depositional ages. It is not clear whether the apparent age gaps are a product of the lack of original pelagic deposition during those times, excision of a deposited record by faulting and/or erosion, or incomplete biostratigraphic sampling.|$|E
30|$|First, {{the rate}} of people who combine {{multiple}} jobs is progressively increasing in various European (Simic and Sethi 2002) and non-European countries (Kimmel and Smith Conway 2001; <b>Sliter</b> and Boyd 2014). Moreover, many such people are school teachers (Stinson 1997; Simic and Sethi 2002). In Switzerland, {{the rate of}} multiple job-holders is gradually growing, increasing from 4  % in 1994 to 7.4  % in 2009 (Bundesamt für Statistik 2010). The multiple job-holding condition is especially favoured among Swiss vocational education and training (VET) teachers, who are required to have prior careers in their specific teaching fields. To satisfy this requirement, most become teachers after spending several years as employers or tradesmen and some keep their previous jobs {{in addition to their}} teaching jobs (see also Hof et al. 2011). In addition, the Swiss VET system has a strong apprenticeship tradition, founded on a “dual” structure that combines theoretical classes at school with practical experience at the workplace. In such a context, simultaneous experience as both a teacher and a professional in the taught field may be encouraged and valued as an advantage. Against this background, the increasing use of multiple-job contracts has stimulated a growing interest in investigating the possible effects of such a condition for individuals and organisations (<b>Sliter</b> and Boyd 2014).|$|E

The far-traveled nature of limestone-bearing OPS has been shown by paleomagnetic studies, and the Laytonville limestone remains an enigma owing to the anomalously rapid plate motions indicated by the combination of paleomagnetic and biostratigraphic data (Alvarez et al. 1980; Tarduno et al. 1990). A new estimate for an older accretion time of the limestone based on new data from associated clastic rocks would require even higher apparent plate motions (Wakabayashi 2015).|$|E

30|$|Second, {{although}} multiple job-holders {{were originally}} defined {{as people who}} combined primary full-time jobs with secondary part-time jobs for economic reasons—so-called moonlighters (Wilensky 1963)—recent surveys have shown a more heterogeneous picture. A growing number of multiple job-holders combine two or more part-time jobs (Guest et al. 2006) {{as a consequence of}} the widespread use of non-standard contracts in the current labour market. Moreover, in many cases, the choice to combine two or more jobs is driven by an individual preference for independence and a self-managed career, as in the case of portfolio workers who “contract their skills and knowledge to various individuals and organisations, in effect creating a ‘portfolio’ of work activity for themselves” (Fenwick 2006, p. 66). On the basis of those considerations, many scholars have argued the need for a better understanding of the different impacts that such a variety of multiple job-holding situations has on individuals’ attitudes and behaviours at work (Guest et al. 2006; <b>Sliter</b> and Boyd 2014; Zickar et al. 2004).|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis of bioperforations on several tests of Nummulites lyelli and N. discorbinus (B forms) has been performed on four large polished slabs (90 x 45 cm) coming from {{different levels of}} middle Eocene shallow- water limestones. About 80 % of N. lyelli B and 15 % of N. discorbinus B show some type of bioperforation, indicating a vast activity of boring organisms in the life environment. Moreover, encrusting of the same tests by coralline algae and spirorbid worms is common. Seven different types of bioperforation were distinguished: large-irregular, small-irregular, total-irregular, spiral, small circular, transversal, and paraboloid. The spiral and small circular borings were attributed to Trypanites helicus, according to Görmus & Nielsen (2006). The transversal and paraboloid ones resemble Oichnus ispp. (Görmus & Nielsen, 2006). According to Nielsen & Görmus (2004) Trypanites helicus is probably associated with nematod worms. The irregular borings (especially the large-irregular and total-irregular) are still problematic, but could tentatively be attributed to gastropods (<b>Sliter,</b> 1971). The scarce abrasion and fragmentation of the bioeroded tests seems to point to a good degree of authochthony of the nummulite tests, with no or very limited lateral transport. Moreover, the percentages of bored tests are strikingly uniform in the different levels, even if the fossil assemblages show some variation and represent probably slightly different paleoenvironments. The bioperforations have a potential use to detect transport and reworking, since the sediment infilling could be either the same as surrounding or a different one. A careful analysis of this feature is therefore preliminary to the biostratigraphic use of the fossil nummulites. References: Görmus M. & Nielsen J. K.
