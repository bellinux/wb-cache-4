25|$|It {{was clear}} {{to a number of}} {{developers}} that a completely electronic <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> would be superior, and that the scanning could be achieved in a vacuum tube via electrostatic or magnetic means. Converting this concept into a usable system took years of development and several independent advances. The two key advances were Philo Farnsworth's electronic <b>scanning</b> <b>system,</b> and Vladimir Zworykin's Iconoscope camera. The Iconoscope, based on Kálmán Tihanyi's early patents, superseded the Farnsworth-system. With these systems, the BBC began regularly scheduled black-and-white television broadcasts in 1936, but these were shut down again with the start of World War II in 1939. In this time thousands of television sets had been sold. The receivers developed for this program, notably those from Pye Ltd., {{played a key role in}} the development of radar.|$|E
25|$|Computer Identics Corporation {{installed}} one of {{its first}} two scanning systems {{in the spring of}} 1969 at a General Motors (Buick) factory in Flint, Michigan. The system was used to identify a dozen types of transmissions moving on an overhead conveyor from production to shipping. The other <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> was installed at General Trading Company's distribution center in Carlstadt, New Jersey to direct shipments to the proper loading bay.|$|E
25|$|Soon thereafter, in August 2014, President Maduro {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a new voluntary fingerprint <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> that was allegedly aimed at combating food shortages and smuggling. The Venezuelan government announced that 17,000 troops would be deployed along its border with Colombia, where they will assist in closing down traffic each night to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts. The effect of the nightly closings will be assessed after 30 days. Following large shortages in January 2015, Makro announced that some stores would begin using fingerprint systems and that customers would be rationed both daily and monthly.|$|E

40|$|Single-switch <b>scanning</b> <b>systems</b> allow nonspeaking {{individuals}} with motor disabilities to communicate by triggering a single switch (e. g., raising an eye brow). A problem with current single-switch <b>scanning</b> <b>systems</b> {{is that while}} they result in reasonable performance in noiseless conditions, for instance via simulation or tests with able-bodied users, they fail to accurately model the noise sources that are introduced when a non-speaking individual with motor disabilities is triggering the switch in a realistic use context. To help assist {{the development of more}} noise-resilient single-switch <b>scanning</b> <b>systems</b> we have developed a mathematical model of <b>scanning</b> <b>systems</b> which incorporates extensive noise modelling. Our model includes an improvement to the standard scanning method, which we call fast-scan, which we show via simulation can be more suitable for certain users of <b>scanning</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
25|$|According to Lovell {{this did}} not {{represent}} {{as much of a}} disruption as Dee believed; to some extent, the klystron work at Birmingham had been instigated by the Army for GL purposes, so it was not entirely fair to complain. Lovell's primary task during this period was developing a conical <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> that improved the accuracy of the radar beam many times, enough to allow it to be used directly to lay the guns (that is, about the same accuracy as optical instruments). This did not really require much effort, and would be useful for any centimetric radar, including AIS.|$|E
25|$|A second Blenheim, V6000, became {{available}} for additional testing. The team {{began to use}} this aircraft as a testbed for alternate scanning solutions, leaving the original N3522 with the spiral-scan system. One of the first tests was to use a manual <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> {{in place of the}} spiral or helical systems, allowing the operator to scan the sky using controls on his receiver sets. Once a target was found, they could flip a switch and the system would track that target automatically from that point. After considerable effort, they decided this concept simply didn't work, and that the mechanical scanning systems were a better solution.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the African American {{figure on}} the Soldiers and Sailors Monument was {{digitally}} scanned to create a three-dimensional image. The process of creating a computer model was completed in one evening using a hand-held laser <b>scanning</b> <b>system.</b> The data {{will be sent to}} a computer-controlled stone cutting machine for a rough cut of the sculpture in Indiana limestone. This material was chosen for E Pluribus Unum because of its prominence in Indianapolis architecture {{in the late nineteenth century}} and to reflect the state's geological heritage. Like the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, many official buildings and monuments in downtown Indianapolis are constructed with Indiana limestone. After the figure is cut from the stone, an artist will refine the sculpture's more detailed areas.|$|E

25|$|From 1929 to 1932, the BBC {{transmitters}} {{were used}} to broadcast television programmes using the 30-line Baird system, and from 1932 to 1935, the BBC also produced the programmes in their own studio at 16 Portland Place. On 3 November 1936, from Alexandra Palace located on the high ground of the north London ridge, the BBC began alternating Baird 240-line transmissions with EMI's electronic <b>scanning</b> <b>system,</b> which had recently been improved to 405 lines after a merger with Marconi. The Baird system at the time involved an intermediate film process, where footage was shot on cinefilm, which was rapidly developed and scanned. The trial was due to last 6 months but the BBC ceased broadcasts with the Baird system in February 1937, {{due in part to}} a disastrous fire in the Baird facilities at Crystal Palace. It was becoming apparent to the BBC that the Baird system would ultimately fail {{due in large part to}} the lack of mobility of the Baird system's cameras, with their developer tanks, hoses, and cables.|$|E
2500|$|The GamePad {{received}} mixed reviews, with Sterling {{finding it}} [...] "hit-and-miss". He found the scanning and radar functions enjoyable but was annoyed by the lock-picking and barricading minigames, which required players {{to press the}} touchscreen rapidly. According to Sterling, the latter two functions were pointless filler. Stanton praised the <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> for immersing players in the game. Turi found the two-screen experience a noble effort, but was dissatisfied with its controls. According to McGee, the GamePad adds little to the game {{and some of its}} functions are better handled with a controller. Klepek called most of GamePad features well-implemented {{with the exception of the}} gyroscope controls. Mitchell wrote that the GamePad enhanced the overall gameplay, but disliked the screen-taping minigame in certain GamePad features.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} after {{arriving}} in California, Farnsworth was prepared to show his models and drawings to a patent attorney who was nationally recognized as an authority on electrophysics. Everson and Gorrell agreed that Farnsworth should apply for patents for his designs, a decision which proved crucial in later disputes with RCA. Most television systems in use at the time used image scanning devices ("rasterizers") employing rotating [...] "Nipkow disks" [...] comprising lenses arranged in spiral patterns such that they swept across an image in a succession of short arcs while focusing the light they captured on photosensitive elements, thus producing a varying electrical signal corresponding to the variations in light intensity. Farnsworth recognized {{the limitations of the}} mechanical systems, and that an all-electronic <b>scanning</b> <b>system</b> could produce a superior image for transmission to a receiving device.|$|E
40|$|Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a nuclear-medicine imag- ing {{technique}} used extensively in diagnosis of early stage tumors and cancers. Apart from clinical applications, PET is also employed in biomedical and pharmaceutical research. For this purpose, small- animal PET <b>scan</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been developed}} with superior per- formance metrics and cost efficiency. Small-animal PET <b>scan</b> <b>systems</b> provide higher spatial and temporal resolution. Conventionally, PET <b>scan</b> <b>systems</b> are developed using photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) which have certain intrisnsic limit on spatial and temporal resolution. The prospect of designing PET <b>scan</b> <b>systems</b> with solid-state based pho- tomultipliers is quite rewarding in terms of detector miniaturization and higher spatial and temporal resolution. The thesis project presented hereafter discusses the design im- plementation of a small-animal PET scan detector module based on multichannel digital silicon photomultipliers (MD-SiPMs). It outlines the design details of the MD-SiPMs i. e., its pixel and array architec- ture, readout mechanism, on-chip time-to-digital converters (TDCs). The firmware development over field-programmable gate arrays (FP- GAs) is presented next, followed by radiation characterization using a 22 Na radioactive source.

2500|$|The Würzburg D was {{introduced}} in 1941 and added a conical <b>scanning</b> <b>system,</b> using an offset receiver feed called a Quirl (German for whisk) that spun at [...] The resulting signal was slightly offset from the centreline of the dish, rotating around the axis and overlapping it in the centre. If the target aircraft was {{to one side of}} the antenna's axis, the strength of the signal would grow and fade as the beam swept across it, allowing the system to move the dish in the direction of the maximum signal and thereby track the target. The angular resolution could be made smaller than the beam width of the antenna, leading to much improved accuracy, on the order of 0.2degrees in azimuth and 0.3degrees in elevation. Earlier examples were generally upgraded to the D model in the field.|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Global Nuclear Energy Partnership / Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (GNEP/AFCI) is {{developing}} metallic transmutation alloys as a fuel form to transmute the long-lived transuranic actinide isotopes contained in {{spent nuclear fuel}} into shorter-lived fission products. The AFCI program has irradiated and examined eleven metallic alloy transmutation fuel specimens to evaluate the feasibility of actinide transmutation in advanced sodium-cooled fast reactors and thermal reactor implementation. Initial results of postirradiation examinations indicated the irradiation performance of the actinide-bearing compositions is similar to uranium-plutonium-zirconium ternary metallic alloy fuels (U-xPu- 10 Zr). Further studies to characterize radial burnup profile, constituent migration, and fuel cladding chemical interaction (FCCI) are in progress. A microgamma <b>scan</b> <b>system</b> is being developed to analyze the radial distribution of fission products, such as Cs- 137, Cs- 134, Ru- 106, and Zr- 95, in irradiated fuel cross-sections.

The microgamma scan results will be used to evaluate radial burnup profile, cesium migration to the sodium bond and constituent migration within the fuel.
