50|$|The engine's high {{operating}} {{speeds and}} temperatures required a new jet fuel, JP-7. Its reluctance to be ignited required triethylborane (TEB) to be {{injected into the}} engine to ignite it and the afterburner. Above −5 °C, TEB spontaneously ignites in contact with air. Each engine carried a nitrogen-pressurized <b>sealed</b> <b>tank</b> with 600 cm3 (20.7 ounces) of TEB, sufficient for at least 16 starts, restarts, or afterburner lights; this number {{was one of the}} limiting factors of SR-71 endurance, as after each air refueling the afterburners had to be reignited. When the pilot moved the throttle from cut-off to idle position, fuel flowed into the engine, and shortly afterwards an approx. 50 cm3 (1.7 ounce) shot of TEB was injected into the combustion chamber, where it spontaneously ignited and lit the fuel with a green flash. In some conditions, however, the TEB flow was obstructed by coking deposits on the injector nozzle, hindering restart attempts. Refilling the TEB tank was a perilous task; the maintenance crew wore silver fire suits. Conversely, the JP-7 fueling was so safe that some aircraft maintenance was permitted during filling. The chemical ignition was chosen instead of a conventional igniter for reliability reasons, and to reduce mechanical complexity. The TEB tank is cooled with fuel flowing around it, and contains a disk that ruptures in case of overpressure, allowing TEB and nitrogen to discharge into the afterburner.|$|E

This paper presents preliminary results from ZBOT's ground-based research that focuses on the effects of residual noncondensable gases in the ullage on both pressurization and pressure reduction trends in the sealed Dewar. Tank pressurization is accomplished through heating of the test cell wall in the wetted and un-wetted regions simultaneously or separately. Pressure control is established through mixing and destratification of the bulk liquid using a temperature controlled forced jet flow with different degrees of liquid jet subcooling. A Two-Dimensional axisymmetric two-phase CFD model for tank pressurization and pressure control is also presented. Numerical prediction of the model are compared to experimental 1 g results to both validate the model and also indicate the effect of the noncondensable gas on evolution of pressure and temperature distributions in the ullage during pressurization and pressure control.

40|$|Initiation of pitting of {{mild steel}} in {{seawater}} usually {{is attributed to}} anode-cathode reactions {{set up by the}} small manganese sulphide (MnS) inclusions present in most steels. On the other hand there is now considerable evidence that microbiological factors are involved in the early corrosion of mild steel in natural seawater. Presented herein are the results of a two year investigation of whether microbiological factors are likely to have {{a significant role in the}} pitting of mild steel exposed to seawater. In the experiment, natural seawater was pumped from a Port Stephens tributary and split into two streams. One stream flowed slowly through a tank in which 25 mm x 25 mm polished steel coupons were suspended and was then released back to the estuary. The second stream was passed through a series of filters and sterilized using ultra-violet (UV) lamps prior to entering a similar but <b>sealed</b> <b>tank,</b> also fitted with UV sterilization, where identical coupons were suspended, before being returned to the estuary. Coupons were removed at various time intervals and examined both visually and using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In all cases the metal surfaces show a considerable difference in topography between those recovered from natural and those from sterilised seawater. Since the only significant difference between the exposure conditions was the removal of living microbiological material it is concluded that microbiological factors are responsible, directly or indirectly, for the more severe pitting observed on the coupons exposed to natural seawater...|$|E

40|$|Mesoscale tank {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} simulate bioremediation of saturated zone carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) originating from a vadose zone carbon tetrachloride source. The mesoscale tank is 2 -m wide by 2 -m high by 3 -m long and was constructed of stainless steel, yielding a total volume of 12 m 3. Simulated geology within the tank consisted of two unconsolidated sand layers separated by a clay layer containing variable-sized stainless steel tubes that represented fractures within a consolidated porous medium. The thickness of the upper sand layer was approximately 55 cm, {{the thickness of the}} virtual fracture layer was 25 cm, and the thickness of the lower sand layer was approximately 98 cm. The water table was located at an elevation of approximately 54 cm {{from the bottom of the}} tank. CCl 4 was added to the <b>sealed</b> <b>tank</b> by pouring 500 ml of neat CCl 4 into a beaker buried approximately 10 cm below the upper sand surface through a stainless steel tube. The CCl 4 was then allowed to partition through the reactor over time, eventually coming to equilibrium. Once CCl 4 equilibrium had occurred in the saturated zone (~ 500 ppb); the reactor was bioaugmented with a CCl 4 degrading culture enriched from the Subsurface Disposal Area at the INEEL. The culture was grown to a cell density of ~ 1. 0 x 108 cells/ml and injected into the simulated aquifer through a center sampling port. Following injection of the culture, an initial aliquot of lactate (1, 000 g/L), nitrogen, and phosphorus were added to the reactor. Lactate was injected every 3 – 5 days for one month. After 1 month of operation, a continuous supply of lactate (1, 000 g/L) was pumped into the reactor at an average rate of 50 mL/min. CCl 4 concentrations in the unsaturated zone were measured using hollow fiber membrane samplers, while liquid samples were analyzed to monitor levels in the simulated aquifer zone. Samples were also taken for analysis of volatile organic acids and cell density. As would be expected, increases in cell density over the length of the cell correlated with the flow of the water through the cell. One week following injection microbes and lactate, cell numbers were in the range of 5. 0 x 106 cells/mL, by the end of the experiment cell numbers had increased to approximately 1. 94 x 107 cells/mL. Five days after lactate injection was initiated, chloroform appeared in liquid samples taken for chlorinated VOC analysis. CCl 4 concentrations in the liquid phase dropped to approximately 180 ppb. At the conclusion of the batch lactate injection phase of the bioaugmentation, CCl 4 levels averaged 40 ppb and chloroform levels averaged 44 ppb. Interestingly, once continuous lactate addition was initiated, CCl 4 concentrations in the saturated zone increased with spikes as high as 3, 000 ppb. Chloroform concentrations also increased following continuous addition of lactate. Since the CCl 4 source in the breaker had been depleted, vadose zone concentrations of CCl 4 dropped steadily during addition of lactate to the saturated zone. CCl 4 levels of ~ 800 ppmv were noted at the beginning of the experiment, levels decreased to below 200 ppmv by the end of the bioaugmentation phase. No chloroform was noted in the vadose zone during testing...|$|E
