5|$|The mysticete ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear <b>sound</b> <b>frequencies</b> as low as 7 Hz and as high as 22 kHz. It is largely unknown how sound is {{received}} by baleen whales. Unlike in toothed whales, sound does not pass through the lower jaw. The auditory meatus is blocked by connective tissue and an ear plug, which connects to the eardrum. The inner-ear bones are contained in the tympanic bulla, a bony capsule. However, this {{is attached to the}} skull, suggesting that vibrations passing through the bone is important. Sinuses may reflect vibrations towards the cochlea. It is known that when the fluid inside the cochlea is disturbed by vibrations, it triggers sensory hairs which send electrical current to the brain, where vibrations are processed into sound.|$|E
5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for hearing underwater, {{where it can}} hear <b>sound</b> <b>frequencies</b> at up to 70,000Hz. In air, hearing is somewhat reduced in pinnipeds compared to many terrestrial mammals. While {{they are capable of}} hearing a wide range of frequencies (e.g. 500 to 32,000Hz in the northern fur seal, compared to 20 to 20,000Hz in humans), their airborne hearing sensitivity is weaker overall. One study of three species—the harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal—found that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne hearing, the harbor seal was equally capable of hearing in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater hearing. Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E

Amy appears to Kazran and implores his help, but he waves away the holograms. The Doctor appears, and Kazran surmises that he is there to show Kazran his future, {{but he could not}} care less if he dies old and alone; he reveals that Abigail had an incurable disease on entering cryostorage and will only have one more day to live. As he cannot decide which day that should be, Kazran chastises the Doctor for believing he could change his mind. Unbeknownst to Kazran, the Doctor has brought young Kazran with him; the realisation of how much his bitter future self now resembles his feared father causes a change of heart in Kazran (making his own memory of his future self the show's version of the ghost of Christmas yet to come), and he quickly agrees to release the controls to save the ship.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the heart}} of astrology is the metaphysical {{principle}} that mathematical relationships express qualities or 'tones' of energy which manifest in numbers, visual angles, shapes and sounds – all connected within a pattern of proportion.

[...] In a theory known as the Harmony of the Spheres, Pythagoras proposed that the Sun, Moon and planets all emit their own unique hum based on their orbital revolution, and that the quality of life on Earth reflects the tenor of celestial sounds which are physically imperceptible to the human ear. Subsequently, Plato described astronomy and music as [...] "twinned" [...] studies of sensual recognition: astronomy for the eyes, music for the ears, and both requiring knowledge of numerical proportions.|$|E

However, the resonances in the panel are complex and difficult to control, which often leads to complicated computations and insufficient low frequency response. The flat loudspeaker in this paper comprises a novel panel structure, which offers low density, high stiffness, and efficient space utilization. Furthermore we have developed a simple and stable control mechanism to obtain flat <b>sound</b> <b>frequency</b> response.

It is found that the {{sound insulation}} coefficient (transmission loss, TL) of honeycomb panel is {{higher than that of}} the sheet in full <b>sound</b> <b>frequency</b> spectra, and TL spectra of both single sheet and honeycomb panel is similar with the <b>sound</b> <b>frequency,</b> thus the TL is increased obviously with the frequency. Comparably, TL of honeycomb panels is always higher than that of the sheets, especially at middle range of frequencies 6 kHz~ 10 kHz, the sheet has a TL of 27 to 31 dB, and the honeycomb panel has 34 - 39 dB. The parameters of honeycomb cores is discussed briefly...|$|R
2500|$|The {{hair cells}} in the organ of Corti are tuned to certain <b>sound</b> <b>frequencies</b> by way of their {{location}} in the cochlea, due {{to the degree of}} stiffness in the basilar membrane. [...] This stiffness is due to, among other things, the thickness and width of the basilar membrane, which {{along the length of the}} cochlea is stiffest nearest its beginning at the oval window, where the stapes introduces the vibrations coming from the eardrum. [...] Since its stiffness is high there, it allows only high-frequency vibrations to move the basilar membrane, and thus the hair cells. [...] The farther a wave travels towards the cochlea's apex (the helicotrema), the less stiff the basilar membrane is; thus lower frequencies travel down the tube, and the less-stiff membrane is moved most easily by them where the reduced stiffness allows: [...] that is, as the basilar membrane gets less and less stiff, waves slow down and it responds better to lower frequencies. [...] In addition, in mammals, the cochlea is coiled, which has been shown to enhance low-frequency vibrations as they travel through the fluid-filled coil. [...] This spatial arrangement of sound reception is referred to as tonotopy.|$|E
2500|$|Natural mode is characterised by {{subjective}} {{effect of}} balance of different frequency sounds, regardless of level of distortion, {{appearing in the}} reproduction device. It is also regardless of personal user's ability to perceive specific <b>sound</b> <b>frequencies</b> (excluding obvious hearing loss). The natural effect is obtained due to special sound processing algorithm (i.e. [...] "formula of subjective equalisation of frequency-response function"). Its principle is to assess frequency response function (FRF) of mediaplayer or any other sound reproduction device, in accordance with audibility threshold in silence (subjective for each person), and to apply gain modifying factor. The factor is determined {{with the help of}} integrated function to test audibility threshold: the program generates tone signals (with divergent oscillations – from minimum volume 30–45Hz to maximum volume appr. 16kHz), and user assess their subjective audibility. The principle is similar to in situ audiometry, used in medicine to prescribe a hearing aid. However, the results of test may be used to a limited extent as far as FRF of sound devices depends on reproduction volume. It means correction coefficient should be determined several times – for various signal strengths, which is not a particular problem from a practical standpoint.|$|E

The acoustic material is characterized by an empirical, nonlinear impedance in which the instantaneous resistance is a nonlinear function of both the frequency and the acoustic velocity.

It is suggested that reduction in the acoustic energy of the calls (intensity × duration) could decrease their effectiveness in eliciting maternal responses and could be the result of reduced cold stress as the pups develop homoiothermy. © 1969.
