Several underwater hydrothermal features were discovered in the early 1990s and can be seen as <b>slick</b> <b>spots</b> or slight bulges in the summer. During the winter, the underwater thermal features are visible as melt holes in the icy surface of the lake. The surrounding ice can reach three feet (one meter) in thickness.|$|E
50|$|This plant {{grows in}} the {{sagebrush}} steppe ecosystem, {{where it can be}} found in microsites called <b>slick</b> <b>spots,</b> patches of soil covered in a cryptogamic crust of cyanobacteria and algae. Occurrences outside of <b>slick</b> <b>spots</b> are rare. Slick spot soil is generally relatively high in sodium and clay, and the spots are mostly bare of vegetation and very slightly indented so that water accumulates. The soil is lighter in color than surrounding soils. In the dry season the water evaporates and the area becomes very dry. <b>Slick</b> <b>spots</b> {{take a long time to}} form; those existing now were likely formed during the Pleistocene, and then altered early in the Holocene when salt deposits were layered over them by wind. It is thought that <b>slick</b> <b>spots</b> are no longer being formed in today's climate, so when they are destroyed they are permanently lost.|$|E
50|$|The slickspot peppergrass {{population}} in the <b>slick</b> <b>spots</b> varies with annual moisture levels; more spring precipitation allows the growth of more plants. In general, the population {{is thought to have}} declined over time. Slick spot habitat in its limited area has been degraded by agriculture, grazing of cattle, urban development, and wildfire. The frequency of wildfire is increasing as the habitat is invaded by introduced plants such as cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum).|$|E

50|$|On March 27, 2010, Dirrell faced undefeated former Middleweight Champion Arthur Abraham in Detroit, Michigan. In {{the fourth}} round, Dirrell knocked Abraham {{down for the}} first time in his career. Dirrell was outboxing Abraham {{throughout}} the bout and comfortably ahead on the scorecards 97-92, 98-91, and 97-92. In the 11th round, a <b>slick</b> <b>spot</b> in the corner of the ring caused Dirrell to slip to one knee. While down, Abraham delivered a punch to the chin of Dirrell; a delayed reaction was followed by Dirrell lying on the ground, unconscious and shaking. The referee ruled the blow by Abraham an intentional foul and awarded Dirrell a victory via disqualification. Some critics contested the ending of the fight, claiming that Dirrell may have overreacted after Abraham's final punch. However, Dirrell said he was really knocked out and did not know what happened after he fell down.|$|R

40|$|Previous phylogenetic {{analyses}} of Lepidium included {{only a few}} accessions of L. montanum, L. flavum, and L. fremontii to represent western North American species. Two additional species endemic to southwest Idaho have posed both taxonomic and conservation questions regarding their species status. Lepidium papilliferum was originally described as a variety of L. montanum, is morphologically similar to L. montanum, and is found in small scattered populations in southwest Idaho. The plant is restricted to specific edaphic conditions known as <b>slick</b> <b>spots</b> where high clay content creates conditions amenable to L. papilliferum, but to few other species. Resolving whether the populations of L. papilliferum merit species status distinct from L. montanum is a vexing question and phylogenetic analyses can assist in resolving this issue. Like L. papilliferum, L. davisii has specific edaphic requirements and is found in playas, areas similar to <b>slick</b> <b>spots,</b> but larger and with deeper soils. Unlike L. papilliferum, L. davisii is morphologically distinct from L. montanum and has posed less of a taxonomic quandary. Previous phylogenetic {{studies have shown that}} American species of Lepidium are derived from an ancestral allopolyploid species. In this study we have expanded previous analyses to include L. papilliferum, L. davisii, and several accessions of L. montanum along with published sequences of ITS, cpDNA, and PISTILLATA first intron. The western North American species form a monophyletic group with L. davisii sister to the remainder of the clade. Within this clade, L. papilliferum and L. fremontii are each monophyletic and sister to each other, but are imbedded within a paraphyletic L. montanum...|$|E
40|$|This NebGuide is {{intended}} to provide guidelines to help understand and interpret chemical water quality test results. All well and stream waters contain dissolved minerals. The amounts and kinds of minerals vary from one location to another and may vary with time. When irrigation water is applied, the mineral salts are left in the soil after the crop has used the water. Most of these mineral salts are beneficial to crop growth and soil condition, {{but in some cases}} they may be harmful. Irrigation water quality problems may be caused by (1) total mineral salts accumulating so that crops no longer produce well, (2) development of sodic soils (<b>slick</b> <b>spots)</b> or (3) accumulation of toxic levels of elements such as boron. Fortunately most irrigation water in Nebraska is of good quality. There are exceptions.

40|$|Rare {{plant species}} {{typically}} exhibit {{low levels of}} genetic diversity within populations {{and high levels of}} genetic differentiation among populations. Several mechanisms may counter the genetic consequences of rarity such as polyploidy or an outcrossing mating system. However, for rare species whose size and distribution may already be limited, habitat destruction and fragmentation can alter historic patterns of gene flow and increase the risk of genetic erosion. Lepidium papilliferum, slickspot peppergrass, is a rare polyploid, insect pollinated, herbaceous plant endemic to sagebrush steppe communities of southwestern Idaho. Plants exhibit a naturally patchy distribution, occurring in specialized microhabitats called <b>slick</b> <b>spots.</b> Habitat destruction and fragmentation due to overgrazing by livestock, invasive plant species, urban and agricultural development, and off-road vehicle use has lead to a decline in this species. Enzyme electrophoresis was used to determine the amount and distribution of genetic diversity within and among 25 populations of L. papilliferum, including 18 populations from the Snake River Plain and 7 populations from the Jarbidge region. Enzyme banding patterns and a gene duplication at TPI were consistent with polyploid gene expression. Across all populations, 10 of 11 loci (91 %) were polymorphic, with an average of 4. 27 alleles per locus. Thus, compared with endemic diploid plant species, L. papilliferum exhibits high levels of genetic diversity. On average, the disjunct Jarbidge populations exhibited higher levels of polymorphic loci (P = 80. 1 %) compared with the Snake River Plain populations (P = 58. 1 %) and similar number of alleles per locus, A = 2. 16 and 2. 09, respectively. Measures of genetic diversity were positively correlated with population size for all populations, however this trend was most pronounced in Snake River populations. Genetic differentiation (GST) among all populations was 0. 109. Among populations of each region, GST was 0. 042, indicating that the majority of genetic differentiation among all populations is due to genetic differences between the two regions. Management of L. papilliferum should include maintaining large population that still harbor high amounts of genetic diversity, conserving small populations where rare alleles are known to occur, and the conservation of insect pollinators and their habitat in this primarily outcrossing species...|$|E
5000|$|The {{auxiliary}} yacht [...] engaged on May 21 the UC-56 twice off {{the coast}} of Spain while escorting a British merchantman.That afternoon an oil <b>slick</b> was <b>spotted</b> by Christabels crew and later was spotted the wake of the submarine. Depth charges were dropped, but the submarine escaped, and returned to harass the convoy that night. At about 11:00pm lookouts on Cristabel sighted a periscope and immediately maneuvered to fire depth charges. Several successive hits damaged the U-boat, but it escaped and had to cruise on the surface to Santander to prevent its sinking. The crew of UC-56 were interned by Spain, but the U-boat was scuttled rather than be handed over. During the action, a few depth charges became loose aboard Christabel, and at great personal risk Ensign Daniel Augustus Joseph Sullivan secured them, earning him the Medal of Honor.|$|R

5000|$|Assigned to coastal escort and patrol {{duties on}} her arrival at Oran, on 2 May, Nields was soon {{drawn into a}} {{submarine}} chase lasting four days. On 14 May, [...] was detected in the southwestern Mediterranean by British observation aircraft. Nields, temporarily with Destroyer Division 21, {{was one of the}} ships to answer the call. Soon afterward, [...] dropped the first depth charge pattern. On the morning of the 15th, oil <b>slicks</b> were <b>spotted,</b> but sound contact was lost. Another search plane sighted the submarine, now surfaced, ten miles away and running north toward southern France. The destroyers followed. At 1900 on the 16th, Nields, in a scouting line with [...] and , left the formation to investigate a negative sound contact. At 2157, all three destroyers made contact. Macomb illuminated the elusive quarry and opened fire. U-616 returned fire and started diving. At 2214, and again at 2231, Macomb attacked with depth charges. At 2335 and again at 2342, sound contacts were regained, but lost at 800 yards. U-616 was deep and maneuvering radically. At 2346, Nields set off an 11- charge pattern; and at 2350 began “creeping attacks”. At 0043 on 17 May, Gleaves, with Nields directing, fired an 18-charge pattern, with deep settings, which surrounded the U-boat. Contact was lost at 0044. Soon after 0100, the three destroyers, having been joined by Ellyson, , [...] and , commenced a box patrol, with Nields taking position third from the right end of the scouting line. At 0449, Hambleton reported a sound contact, and, at 0515, commenced firing depth charges. At 0525, she made a second attack. Finally, at 0608, U-616 surfaced and was taken under fire by the surrounding destroyers. Nields, unable to fire without endangering others in the destroyer group, watched the hunted U-boat sink at 0612 and then screened the vessels detailed to pick up the 51 survivors.|$|R
