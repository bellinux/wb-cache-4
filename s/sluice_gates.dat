5|$|Several {{years ago}} the {{government}} built <b>sluice</b> <b>gates</b> for the silt fertilization method, though many people disagreed with the plan. In spite of all opposition it was carried through, yet it had little success. When the torrents on Fan Shan were abundant, the gates were kept closed, and this caused damage (by flooding) of fields, tombs, and houses. When the torrents subsided in the late autumn the sluices were opened, and thus the fields were irrigated with silt-bearing water, but the deposit was not as thick as what the peasants call 'steamed cake silt' (so they were not satisfied). Finally the government got tired of it and stopped. In this connection I remember reading the Jiayipan of Bai Juyi (the poet) in which {{he says that he}} once had a position as Traffic Commissioner. As the Bian River was getting so shallow that it hindered the passage of boats he suggested that the <b>sluice</b> <b>gates</b> along the river and canal should be closed, but the Military Governor pointed out that the river was bordered on both sides by fields which supplied army grain, and if these were denied irrigation (water and silt) because of the closing of the <b>sluice</b> <b>gates,</b> it would lead to shortages in army grain supplies. From this I learnt that in the Tang period there were government fields and <b>sluice</b> <b>gates</b> {{on both sides of the}} river, and that irrigation was carried on (continuously) even when the water was high. If this could be done (successfully) in old times, why can it not be done now? I should like to enquire further about the matter from experts.|$|E
5|$|The Rasi Salai Dam was {{completed}} in 1994, {{around the same time}} as the Pak Mun Dam, and received similar local complaints. The dam's central reservoir was occupied for two years by villagers, until a July 2000 decision opened the <b>sluice</b> <b>gates.</b> From 2003 to 2004, Living River Siam coordinated Thai Baan research in three districts: Amphoe Rasi Salai, Amphoe Rattanaburi, and Amphoe Phon Sai. The report examined village culture, ecology, biodiversity, agriculture, and food and water management. The impact of the closing and opening of the <b>sluice</b> <b>gates</b> was also examined. It was concluded that the dam reduced fish populations, but more importantly, flooded natural salt pits and spread them into rice and vegetable fields, destroying trees and crops. The government has not made a commitment to keep the Rasi Salai Dam out of commission, but as of 2008 the gates have not yet been closed.|$|E
5|$|The harbour {{cost more}} than {{anticipated}} and high rates were levied to repay loans, reducing any benefit the new harbour had at drawing companies back from Liverpool. In 1848 the city council bought the docks company to force down the rates. They employed Isambard Kingdom Brunel to make improvements, including new lock gates, a dredger and <b>sluice</b> <b>gates</b> designed to reduce siltation.|$|E

5|$|During 2009 and 2010, {{work was}} {{undertaken}} to upgrade <b>sluice</b> <b>gates,</b> watercourses, and culverts to enable seasonal flooding of Southlake Moor {{during the winter}} diverting water from the Sowy River onto the moor. It {{has the capacity to}} hold 1.2 million cubic metres as part of a scheme by the Parrett Internal Drainage Board to restore ten floodplains in Somerset. In spring, the water is drained away to enable the land to be used as pasture during the summer. The scheme is also used to encourage water birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} was signed on June 15, 1866 and the expropriation {{of the first}} 1,100 houses was completed in a few months. The work began on February 13, 1867. There were several technical difficulties that delayed the covering, {{many of which were}} due to the geology of Brussels, though they were not as bad as some engineers had forecast. The embezzlement scandal also caused a significant delay in construction, largely due to the change in control. The project was completed in 1871, with the municipal council ceremonially opening the reconstructed <b>sluice</b> <b>gates</b> on November 30.|$|E

This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General Maxime Weygand, appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May. On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at Gravelines. <b>Sluice</b> <b>gates</b> had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.|$|E
5|$|Shen Zhou died in {{the late}} winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and {{following}} Confucian ethics, remained inactive {{in a state of}} mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055). As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400kmÂ²) of swampland into prime farmland. Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of <b>sluice</b> <b>gates</b> of irrigation canals.|$|E
5|$|The Senne {{had long}} since lost its {{usefulness}} as a navigable waterway, being replaced by canals, including the Charleroi Canal. The Senne {{had always been a}} river with an inconsistent flow, often overflowing its banks. In times of heavy rainfall, even the <b>sluice</b> <b>gates</b> were unable to regulate the flow of the river which was often swollen by numerous creeks flowing down from higher ground. Making matters worse, within the city the river's bed was narrowed by encroaching construction due to demographic pressure. The supports of numerous unregulated bridges impeded water flow and caused water levels to rise even further, exacerbated by a riverbed of accumulated waste.|$|E
40|$|The <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> is a {{hydraulic}} structure that used for controlling the discharge on dam or irrigation canal. Their discharge coefficient depends on geometric and hydraulic parameters. Swamee (1992) presents two formulas for calculating the discharge coefficient (Cd) for free flow and submerged flow based on Henry 2 Ì 7 s Curve (1950). Laboratory models {{used to find}} out the flow phenomenon that was formed due to a difference in the edge shape of the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> and increased gate base. The simulation done by varying the height of the gate opening (a) and the discharge (Q). The results of the study obtained the length of water jumps (Lj) formed on the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> with edge 450 is longer than the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> with edge 900. The discharge coefficient (Cd) value on the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> with edge 450 is higher than the discharge coefficient (Cd) value on the gate with edge 900. The energy loss trendline (ÎE) obtained shows the value of ÎE increases with increasing h 2 /h 1. The value of the critical flow coefficient range (Ckr) on the <b>sluice</b> <b>gate</b> with edge 450 and 900 increases with the increase in base height.

5|$|The {{results of}} the Thai Baan {{research}} were supported by several academics, including Niti Pawakapan of Chulalongkorn University. The Ubon Ratchathani University study also recommended keeping the <b>sluice</b> <b>gates</b> open {{for at least five}} years. However, the Thai government rejected all of the studies for unclear reasons and instead conducted a three-day opinion poll of a random sample of Thais, after which it decided that the gates would stay closed for eight out of twelve months of the year. In 2007, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont decided to close the gates permanently, citing an alleged secret agreement between thousands of villagers and the Internal Security Operations Command.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{archaeologists have}} {{unearthed}} Han iron farming tools throughout China, from Inner Mongolia {{in the north}} to Yunnan in the south. The spade, shovel, pick, and plow were used for tillage, the hoe for weeding, the rake for loosening the soil, and the sickle for harvesting crops. Depending on their size, Han plows were driven by either one ox or two oxen. Oxen were also used to pull the three-legged iron seed drill (invented in Han China by the 2nd century BCE), which enabled farmers to plant seeds in precise rows instead of casting them out by hand. While artwork of the Wei (220â265 CE) and Jin (265â420 CE) periods show use of the harrow for breaking up chunks of soil after plowing, it perhaps first appeared in China during the Eastern Han (25â220 CE). Irrigation works for agriculture included the use of water wells, artificial ponds and embankments, dams, canals, and <b>sluice</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 1907 IÃ©na {{was moved}} into dry dock No. 2 in the Missiessy Basin at Toulon to undergo {{maintenance}} of her hull {{as well as}} inspection of her rudder shaft. Eight days later, beginning at 1:35a.m. and continuing until 2:45, a series of explosions began in the port No. 5 100-millimetre magazine of IÃ©na which devastated the ship and the surrounding area. Because the ship was in a dry dock it was initially impossible to flood the magazines. The commanding officer of the battleship , which was moored nearby, fired a shell into {{the gate of the}} dry dock in an attempt to flood it, but the shell ricocheted without holing the gate. The dock was finally flooded when Ensign de Vaisseau Roux (who was killed shortly afterward by fragments from the ship) managed to open the <b>sluice</b> <b>gates.</b> The , moored in the No. 1 dock beside IÃ©na, almost capsized under the strength of the blasts.|$|E

Coinciding with this agreement, the government announced that official studies would be conducted by Ubon Ratchathani University and a private team contracted by the National Economic and Social Development Board. The university received a budget of 10 million baht (roughly US$280,000), and the government contractors, alleged {{to be the same}} group that recommended damming another river, received 94 million baht (roughly US$2,700,000), raising suspicions.
