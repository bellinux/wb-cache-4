5|$|The film {{is based}} on a story by Corbijn and Bono, and {{includes}} <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> Bono created for the album. The plot focuses on a Parisian motorcycle officer, played by Saïd Taghmaoui; the character has become disillusioned with his life and the conflict between immigrants and the police in the city, causing him to leave to see his girlfriend in Tripoli. The song order in the film is representative of No Line on the Horizons as it was in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf and Matthew Mungle, the show's make-up effect producers, used several unorthodox {{ingredients}} {{to create the}} effect of melted flesh; {{in addition to the}} use of normal prosthetic make-up, the two also used a combination of figs and Fruit Roll-Ups. <b>Several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> in the episode were named after real-life individuals. The characters of Hellura Lyle and Kai Bowe were named after two Writers Guild trainees on The X-Files staff who served during {{the first part of the}} eighth season. Furthermore, the character Steven Melnick is named after the Vice President of Media Relations for 20th Century Fox Television. Melnick had formerly served as the publicist for the series.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 1981, the Tony Award-winning musical Dreamgirls {{opened at}} the Imperial Theatre on Broadway and ran for 1,522 performances. The musical, loosely based {{on the history of}} the Supremes, follows the story of the Dreams, an all-female singing trio from Chicago who become music superstars. <b>Several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> in the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story {{focusing}} upon the Florence Ballard doppelgänger Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes' and Motown's music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R/soul and Broadway music. Mary Wilson loved the musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered by it and refused to see it.|$|E

25|$|Greed is a {{theme of}} the novel {{because it is a}} basic {{motivation}} for <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters.</b> In the past, Marek and his team are thrust into a world that is one large battlefield between the French and the English. The French are not happy that the English are continuously attempting to conquer their lands. For this reason, {{there is a great deal}} of fighting between the two sides. Of particular interest in this novel is the greed of Sir Oliver in taking Castelgard and La Roque, and Arnaut’s greed in wanting to take it back. This causes Marek and his team to be stuck in the middle of two battling hotheads.|$|E
25|$|Many of Caragiale's {{writings}} reproduce {{discussions between}} clerks on their time off, which usually take {{the shape of}} generic and awkward forays into culture or politics. <b>Several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> in his sketches spuriously claim to be personal friends of major political figures of the day, or {{to have access to}} the back-rooms of politics and journalism. Although often alarmed by political or social developments, they tend to accommodate them quickly, and often encourage each other during very long stays at the beer garden. Gravitating in this environment are the petty journalists, who boast access to unlikely scoops, such as Bulgaria having decided to invade Romania. In one instance, Caragiale invents Caracudi, a newspaperman who writes his sensationalist articles while relaxing in the park.|$|E
500|$|With {{the filming}} and airing of [...] "Salvage", Robert Patrick {{began to feel}} [...] "comfortable in his new role". He later {{recalled}} that [...] "we started seeing our [...] numbers.

The three scientists: Chamber, Clifton, and Pugovel, were named after friends of Bell's, [...] who were engineers. Much of the action was based in Muncie, Indiana. Bell picked this location {{because it was the}} hometown of his grandparents.|$|E

500|$|Joss Whedon {{explained}} that <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> {{that appeared in}} the series were based on real life individuals. Cordelia, for instance, was modeled after a girl with whom Whedon's wife attended high school. Xander was based on Whedon himself. Whedon hoped to include actor Eric Balfour in the title credits to shock viewers when his character dies. Unfortunately, the show could not afford the extra set of title credits at the time. However, Whedon's wish was granted in the season six episode [...] "Seeing Red", with the character Tara Maclay (Amber Benson). Brian Thompson, who plays the vampire Luke, returns to the series in season two as a different character, the Judge, in [...] "Surprise" [...] and [...] "Innocence".|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Space Seed", Khan is {{presented}} as having several positive characteristics: he is gracious, smiling, fearless and generous. He is not threatened {{by the success of}} others, and encourages their self-esteem. He is also ambitious, desiring a challenge commensurate with his abilities, but this ambition is not tempered by any consideration of the rights of others. Author Paul Cantor asserts that Khan is a mirror image of Kirk, sharing his aggressiveness, ambition, and even his womanizing tendencies, but possessing them in far greater degree. During the episode, <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> express their admiration for the man even as they oppose him, with Kirk referring to him as [...] "the best of the tyrants, and the most dangerous." [...] The character's Spanish accent and superhuman appearance strongly differentiate him from most Star Trek characters.|$|E
500|$|The series also {{featured}} {{at least one}} significant cameo role per episode. Notable appearances include Rik Mayall as the debonair Lord Flashheart in [...] "Bells"; Tom Baker and Simon Jones, two figures famous for their roles in science fiction series, as Captain Redbeard Rum and Sir Walter Raleigh in [...] "Potato"; Miriam Margolyes, who {{had appeared in the}} previous series, as the puritanical Lady Whiteadder in [...] "Beer"; and Stephen Fry's comedy partner Hugh Laurie, who appears twice, first as the drunken Simon Partridge in [...] "Beer" [...] and in the final episode as the evil Prince Ludwig. Laurie was later given a larger role as George in the next two series. Also [...] "Bob", played by Gabrielle Glaister, a former classmate of Ben Elton's, made [...] "his" [...] first appearance. <b>Several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> were seen in similar guises in later series.|$|E

500|$|Beveridge {{called the}} third episode [...] "understated", {{moving at a}} slower pace which helps to begin showing the true nature of <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters,</b> and the good pacing {{continues}} into the fourth episode where a dynamic between Akaishi, Nakanishi, and Ko is developed. Beveridge praised the character building in the fifth episode, calling the interaction of Ko and Aoba [...] "very charming" [...] and [...] "reminiscent of real childhoods", with things [...] "starting to fall into place" [...] for the main focus of the series (high school baseball) {{by the end of the}} sixth episode. He praises the exposition used in the seventh episode, the protective instinct of Ko, Nakanishi, and Akaishi when it comes to Aoba, the use of flashbacks which show how the past is affecting the characters in the present, and the good pacing which [...] "really sets it apart from almost every other sports show".|$|E
500|$|Like all {{episodes of}} The Simpsons, [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] {{features}} {{a variety of}} references to popular culture. As Bart fills out the 20-question psychiatry quiz, Homer watches America's Funniest Home Videos where the three nominated clips are all violent. Many of the scenes in the mental institution are references to the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. <b>Several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> at the institution are based on those in the film, such as Chief. Floyd from the film Rain Man also appears at the mental home. When Marge calls the institution, a muzak version of [...] "Crazy", sung by Patsy Cline, can {{be heard over the}} phone. In the shot of the crowd that awaits Michael Jackson's arrival outside of the Simpson family's home, a man is holding a [...] "" [...] sign in reference to Rollen Stewart, who was famous for holding a similar sign at sporting events.|$|E
500|$|<b>Several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> {{are given}} [...] "I am" [...] songs that {{introduce}} them to the audience, allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for onlookers to establish empathy with the character. [...] Linda Low, for example, expresses her self-confidence with [...] "I Enjoy Being a Girl"; we learn Mei Li's hopes with the quieter [...] "I Am Going to Like It Here". [...] Although not a formal musical number, the brief [...] "You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll", sung and danced by Linda and by Wang San, Ta's Americanized teenage brother, was described by Lewis as [...] "virtually the first self-consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung" [...] in a Broadway musical. [...] Patrick Adiarte, who originated the role of Wang San, however, saw it as [...] "corny stuff... put in there to get a laugh". [...] Helen Chao's sad [...] "Love, Look Away" [...] is described by Lewis as [...] "arguably the most tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote".|$|E

500|$|The final {{few minutes}} of [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] {{introduced}} major developments for <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters,</b> including Leslie being approached with the idea to run for elected office, {{which has been a}} lifelong dream for her. Additionally, Tom decides to leave city hall to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, a progression of his character that had been building throughout the third season. Series co-creator Michael Schur said he believes characters should change and their situations should change throughout the season, so he wanted them to be in a very different place {{at the end of the}} season than where they were from the beginning. Schur also described his fellow co-creator Greg Daniels' theory about finale episode as: [...] "write the juiciest, most exciting cliffhanger-y possible scenario you can write, and then you have all summer to figure out how to get yourself out of it". Although Schur said the writing staff had a general idea of where the newly introduced storylines should go, the exact stories had not been completely worked out yet and the writers would be brainstorming how to handle them over the summer.|$|E
500|$|<b>Several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> {{went through}} {{subsequent}} changes as well. In Brian K. Vaughan's original pitch for the series, Karolina Dean was originally called Leslie, a name which {{would eventually be}} given to the character's mother. Her parents were originally real estate agents, as opposed to famous actors. Molly {{was one of the few}} Runaways to actually keep the name she had in Brian K. Vaughan's original proposal; she is named after Vaughan's younger sister, Molly Hayes Vaughan, and was supposed to be thirteen years old instead of eleven. However, in the original pitch for the series, Molly's parents were Hollywood actors; this would eventually become the cover story of Karolina's parents. Also, Molly's sibling-like relationship with Chase was originally supposed to be with Gert. Nico Minoru was called Rachel Messina. Her parents were still magicians, but posed as wealthy antique dealers; this cover story was ultimately used for Gert's parents. Nico's source of power was not originally going to be her mother's Staff, but Robert Minoru's spellbook. Chase was originally called John, and Gert was called Gertie. Originally, Gert was meant to give Molly the name [...] "Bruiser." ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 February 2001, {{starting}} with [...] "Going Under", the fourteenth {{episode of the}} show's seventeenth series, the opening and closing sequences were once again scrapped {{to make way for}} a completely new sequence and theme. This time, the opening sequence consisted of a montage image of the entire cast, backed by a darker, slower version of [...] "Overkill". The closing credits featured a montage of various police-related images, also backed by the new version of [...] "Overkill". The opening sequence was designed by the visuals company [...] "Blue", and the new arrangement of [...] "Overkill" [...] was produced by Miles Bould and Mike Westergaard. These titles remained essentially the same for two years, with two small updates. The font used on the closing credits was changed towards the end of 2001, and the characters featured in the opening sequence were updated in 2002, to remove characters who had departed, and include new characters. These titles were broadcast from Episode No. 017, and are notable as <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> in these titles had not yet appeared in the show. DS Samantha Nixon appeared in the titles from Episode No. 017, but did not first appear until Episode No. 038, some four months later.|$|E
