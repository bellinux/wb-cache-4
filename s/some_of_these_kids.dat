5000|$|Local {{property}} taxes provide {{most of the}} funding for public school and this varies in accordance to the relative affluence of each neighbourhood. Reduced funding can limit available electives, or advanced placement courses. Cases such as these limit students and causes inequality in education {{because there is no}} easy way to gain access to those courses since the education system might not view them as necessary. The public education system does provide the classes needed to obtain a General Education Development (GED) and obtain a job or pursue higher education. [...] Most of the disadvantaged population includes those in a lower income city or neighborhood. This population mostly deals with minorities. As Kozol talks about in his book, racial inequality, school infrastructure, as well as neighborhoods, play a big factor in who gets funded more or less. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> end up dropping out because they no not have support from parents or school faculty.|$|E

50|$|Social Causes: Some {{studies have}} shown that {{adolescents}} have one of the highest rates of polysubstance dependence. According to one study this population, ages 12-25, represents about half of the nation's illicit drug users. <b>Of</b> <b>these</b> illicit drug users, half of them have started using substances by the end of 12th grade. This could be attributed to social expectations of peers, peer pressure to fit it, or a way of numbing their emotions. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> young <b>kids</b> start trying different drugs initially to fit in, but then after a while they start to develop a tolerance for these substances and experience withdrawal if they don’t have enough substances in their system and eventually become dependent on having the effects of substance dependence. With tolerance comes the craving for additional drugs to get high, this constant need for that feeling is polysubstance dependence.|$|R
