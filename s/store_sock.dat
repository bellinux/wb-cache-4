When they are not {{hanging out in the}} <b>store's</b> <b>sock</b> bin, they {{can be found in a}} laundry hamper or in the storeroom.|$|R

5000|$|Hinchliffe's Facia group, {{with its}} {{headquarters}} at Parkhead Hall in Sheffield, rapidly became a retail empire with 850 British high street shops (more than Marks and Spencer at the time), over 6000 employees, and over Â£250m in turnover, {{second only to}} Littlewoods as a private retail group in the United Kingdom. Brands acquired at the pace of around one a month included clothing <b>stores</b> <b>Sock</b> Shop, Red or Dead, Contessa, and Oakland menswear, Torq jewellers, and the shoe shops Trueform, Saxone, Manfield, and Freeman Hardy and Willis, though only fashion chain Red or Dead was profitable. Facia expanded into continental Europe in March 1996 when they acquired the German Bata Shoes chain and renamed it Millennium. Hinchliffe's strategy {{was said to be}} buying well-known but apparently underperforming brand names, centralise warehouses and distribution, and upgrade stores, but also involved delaying payments to suppliers and channelling money to his private company. The group was partly sustained by shell companies that Hinchliffe used to borrow money. Facia bought the shoe shops from Sears, but only paid for the brand names, shelves and tills - in an unusual deal, Sears retained the leases, staff and stock. Murray Johnstone had sold Sock Shop to Hinchliffe and owned 50% of Facia. Rival companies and marketing analysts expressed scepticism over the rapid expansion, the merits of the business strategy in a difficult trading environment for high street brands versus out-of-town stores, the lack of coherence of the brands, and the lack of transparency over accounts and funding sources. Management Today said he was [...] "Like someone playing Monopoly and buying whichever property they land on". A new headquarters was being built in Chelsea in 1996 where Laura Ashley's design HQ used to be, including a [...] "high street" [...] of all the Facia branches.|$|R
50|$|Mirman {{felt her}} {{customers}} {{would prefer to}} buy stylish hosiery without hunting through department stores, which at the time, dominated the British hosiery market. Due {{to a lack of}} willing investors, Mirman and Ross eventually launched Sock Shop with the assistance of a Government loan guarantee programme for capital-short entrepreneurs. The first Sock Shop was on the concourse of the Knightsbridge tube station. Their ambitions were modest, with expectations of eventually having four or perhaps six retail outlets. By 1987, there were 52 <b>stores</b> in the <b>Sock</b> Shop chain {{and it was one of}} the fastest growing speciality retailing businesses in Europe. Mirman had become the 188th richest person in Britain, and its youngest millionaire. They were held up as examples of Britain's new entrepreneurial flair in the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The dousing sock, [...] "spinnaker sleeve", snuffer, or just sock, is {{a device}} {{used to make}} {{deploying}} and retrieving the spinnaker a much easier task. The sock is a long fabric tube with a ring in one end to hold it open. Since the spinnaker is <b>stored</b> in the <b>sock,</b> {{the first step is}} to set up the sock. Two lines are attached to the sock; one is attached to a bridle on the ring, for pulling the sock down, and one is up the inside, from the ring, through the top, and back down, for raising the sock; these lines may be two ends of the same line, to form a loop. The head of the spinnaker is attached the top of the sock and the ring runs down to the tack. The resulting bundle is stuffed into the spinnaker bag. The top of the sock will have provisions for attaching to the spinnaker halyard.|$|R
