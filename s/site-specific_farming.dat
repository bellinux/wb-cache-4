40|$|Coffee {{agroforestry}} systems (CAFS) {{sustain the}} livelihoods {{of many people}} globally {{at the same time}} as providing important ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration that help mitigate climate change. These systems vary in their composition (especially density and species of shade tree) and management. Changes made to enhance their productivity will affect their climate change mitigation potential. With growing food demand and diminishing availability of agricultural land due to global population growth, as well as an increasing threat from global climate change the trade-offs between the socio-economic and net carbon sequestration performance in CAFS are important. The carbon sequestration and socio-economic performance of a range of CAFS varying in composition and management were assessed in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Measurements and modelled estimates were made of (i) greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) from coffee cultivation (the carbon footprint (CF)), (ii) carbon sequestration potential into above-ground biomass and soil organic stocks and (iii) socio-economic performance (productivity and profitability), and their trade-offs analysed. The effects of agronomic management (conventional versus organic) and shade type (ranging from timber trees to full sun) on the CF of two long-standing CAFS experiments in Costa Rica Nicaragua demonstrated that management is the best predictor of the CF whereas shade type has a minor effect. The greatest contributor to the overall CF was N 2 O emissions from the input of N in applied organic and inorganic fertilisers. Shade systems with high levels of N input from leguminous tree pruning had the highest CF. Total soil organic carbon (SOC) decreased over the first nine years of coffee bush and shade tree establishment in these experiments, although this differed amongst soil layers. Organically managed systems tended to have an increase in SOC in the top 10 cm of soil, though organic and conventional systems had similar (larger) decreases in SOC in deeper soil. Shade type and above-ground biomass had a smaller effect on SOC. Comparison of the CF of these experimental CAFS treatments with their C sequestration potential showed that increases in GHG emissions from production intensification can be compensated for or even outweighed by the increase in C sequestration into above-ground biomass, especially for shaded systems. However, if less productive, lower intensity CAFS are extended onto an area of currently forested land in order to compensate for the shortfall in profitability (compared with higher-intensity, higher-yielding systems), this land-use change causes additional GHG emissions from deforestation. This results in net GHG emissions for the whole system for the majority of shade types tested. Evaluation of the C and socio-economic performance of coffee farms in the regions around the two experimental sites showed that due to the huge variation amongst CAFS there is no single strategy for climate change mitigation that could successfully be applied across the range of farms. Instead it will be necessary to carry out accurate and <b>site-specific</b> <b>farm</b> assessments to inform advice and decisions on system improvement tailored to the needs of individual farms and environmental settings.

Consequently, funding was procured for a project in SE North Carolina, titled "Management Practices to Reduce Nonpoint Source Pollution on a Watershed Basis," for a <b>site-specific</b> <b>farming</b> objective titled "To improve and adopt precision farming as a best management practice. " The project goals were to show existing variation in crop yield with combine yield monitors, to use computer models to predict yield and relate precision farming to water quality, and to improve and encourage site-specific nitrogen management.

40|$|Spatial {{distribution}} of soil types and soil {{properties in the}} landscape are important in many environmental researches. Conventional soil surveys are not designed to provide the high-resolution soil information required in environmental modelling and <b>site-specific</b> <b>farm</b> management. The objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the relationship between soil development, soil evolution in the landscape, updating legacy soil maps and pedodiversity in an arid and semi-arid region. The application of Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) techniques was investigated with a particular focus to predict soil taxonomic classes and spatial {{distribution of}} soil types by soil observations and covariate sets representative of s,c,o,r,p,a,n factors. In the first study, focus is on establishing relationships between pedodiversity and landform evolution in a 86, 000 ha region in Borujen, Chaharmahal-Va-Bakhtiari Province, Central Iran. From an overview study, we could conclude that landform evolution was mainly affected by topography and its components. A second study compares various DSM-methods and a conventional soil mapping approach for soil class maps in terms of accuracy, information value and cost in central Iran. Also, the effects of different sample sizes were investigated. Our results demonstrated that in most predicted maps, in DSM approaches, the best results were obtained using the combination of terrain attributes and the geomorphology map. Furthermore, results showed that the conventional soil mapping approach was not as effective as DSM approach. In the third study, different models of the DSM approach were compared to predict the spatial distribution of some important soil properties such as clay content, soil organic carbon and calcium carbonate content. Among all studied models, the terrain attribute “elevation” is the most important variable to predict soil properties. Random forest had promising performance to predict soil organic carbon. But results revealed that all models could not predict the spatial distributions of clay content properly. The minimum area of land that can be legibly delineated in a traditional (printed) map is highly dependent upon mapping scale. For example, this area at a mapping scale of 1 : 24, 000 is about 2. 3 ha but at a mapping scale of 1 : 1, 000, 000 it is about 1000 ha. A mapping scale of 1 : 1, 000, 000 is just too coarse to show a fine-scale pattern or soil type with any degree of legibility, but finer-scale soil maps are more expensive and time-consuming to produce. Thus, spatial variation is often unavoidably obscured. The fourth study of this dissertation focuses on downscaling and updating soil map methods. Thus, the objectives were to apply supervised and unsupervised disaggregation approaches to disaggregate soil polygons of conventional soil map at a scale of 1 : 1, 000, 000 in the selected area. Therefore, soil subgroups and great groups were selected because it is a basic taxonomic level in regional and national soil maps in Iran. In general, we conclude that DSM approach and also disaggregation approach are capable to predict soil types and properties, produce and update legacy soil maps. However, still a number of challenges need to be evaluated e. g. influence of expert knowledge on CSM approach, resolution of ancillary data, georeferenced legacy soil samples data to validate disaggregated soil maps...|$|R

(Verbenaceae) is a weed of great significance in Queensland Australia and globally but its whole life-history ecology is poorly known. Here we used 3 years of field data across four land use types (farm, hoop pine plantation and two open eucalyptus forests, including one with a triennial fire regime) to parameterise the weed’s vital rates and develop size-structured matrix models. Lantana camara in its re-colonization phase, as observed in the recently cleared hoop pine plantation, was projected to increase more rapidly (annual growth rate, λ = 3. 80) than at the other three sites (λ 1. 88 – 2. 71). Elasticity analyses indicated that growth contributed more (64. 6 %) to λ than fecundity (18. 5 %) or survival (15. 5 %), while across size groups, the contribution was of the order: juvenile (19 – 27 %) ≥ seed (17 – 28 %) ≥ seedling (16 – 25 %) > small adult (4 – 26 %) ≥ medium adult (7 – 20 %) > large adult (0 – 20 %). From a control perspective {{it is difficult to}} determine a single weak point in the life cycle of lantana that might be exploited to reduce growth below a sustaining rate. The triennial fire regime applied did not alter {{the population}} elasticity structure nor resulted in local control of the weed. However, simulations showed that, except for the farm population, periodic burning could work within 4 – 10 years for control of the weed, but fire frequency should increase to at least once every 2 years.

40|$|The North Sea is {{a highly}} dynamic area, where a tidal current flows over a sandy seabed. It is an intensively used area where various human {{activities}} take place. The seabed is rich in oil and gas {{and there are a}} lot of oil and gas platforms connected to the shore with pipelines that are mostly buried below the seabed. Telephone and data cables are placed up and in the seabed running from one country to another. Also, since the North Sea is a biological rich area, a lot of fishery takes place. The sand of the seabed is mined and used for large infrastructural projects. As important harbours face the North Sea, intensive shipping takes place and there are many shipping lanes which have to be dredged. Also, large areas are reserved for offshore wind farms and other functions like military terrains. The seabed of the North Sea is not flat, but is shaped in several wavy patterns, ranging from small ripples to large sand banks. Sand banks have a wave length between 1 and 10 km and can have a height of several tens of meters. Somewhat smaller features are sand waves. Their length varies between 100 and 800 m and they can be up to 10 m high from trough to crest. As the North Sea is a very dynamic area, both in natural and a morphological sense, and as many human activities take place here, it is important to know what the large-scale effects of human activities on the seabed will be. Therefore, in this thesis we develop a system that can predict the large-scale effects of human activities on the North Sea seabed on a long timescale. We do this by implementing idealized morphodynamic models in a GIS (Geographical Information System) that also contains data on the North Sea environment. We predict the occurrence of sand banks and sand waves in the North Sea and compare the results with observations of these large-scale bed forms. The results show that in large parts of the North Sea, we are able to correctly predict the occurrence of sand banks and sand waves. (chapter 2 and 3). The models that predict the morphological effects of human activities (chapter 4 and 5) cannot be validated yet. But they are based on the same principles as the models that we use to predict the occurrence of sand banks and sand waves of which the results are compared with observations of large-scale bed forms in the North Sea. It is assumed that the models that predict the effects of human activities, do not show any morphological evolution, if the model that predicts the occurrence of sand banks (chapter 3) does not predict the occurrence of sand banks at this particular location. This because, the 12 underlying mechanism of the models on human activities are based on the same 2 DH flow conditions that are necessary for sand bank development. We connect idealized morphodynamic models to the GIS to create a tool that can be used to predict the effects of human activities on the North Sea seabed. The models use sitespecific input to give predictions for an arbitrary location in the North Sea. The first application of this system is large-scale sand extraction. Due to large construction projects like the enlargement of the Rotterdam harbour, the demand for sand is rising and more offshore resources will be used to fulfill the need. This means that more large-scale sand pits will be created in the North Sea. The North Sea is a shallow shelf sea where the tide flows over a sandy bed. Therefore, the presence of sand pits can influence the morphological behaviour of this seabed (chapter 4). The second application is offshore wind farms. We investigate the influence of offshore wind farms on the large-scale morphodynamics of the seabed. The need for sustainable energy is rising, and at the moment wind energy is one of the forms of renewable energy that can be harvested efficiently. We develop a morphodynamic model to investigate the effect of offshore wind farms on the seabed. By implementing the model in the GIS environment, the model allows us to calculate the effects of a wind <b>farm</b> using <b>site-specific</b> and <b>farm</b> design input parameters (chapter 5). By implementing idealized morphodynamic models in a GIS environment we are able to predict the occurrence of large-scale bed forms on the North Sea seabed.

Two main goals are to minimize overgrazing of sensitive areas and to maximize the quality of the product through enhanced traceability. An integrated precision grazing system is outlined with its components: sensors of animal position, behavior and physiological status, real-time transmission of information to a decision support system, and feed-back through a series of actuators.

Recent advances in the technologies and instrumentation available are reviewed briefly and linked to current livestock identification systems. The precision grazing vision is presented in full and the areas that need further research and development are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{challenge}} of converting global agricultural food, fiber and energy crop cultivation into an ecologically and economically sustainable production process requires {{the most efficient}} agricultural management strategies. Development, control and maintenance of these strategies are highly dependent on temporally and spatially continuous information on crop status at the field scale. This paper introduces {{the application of a}} process-based, coupled hydro-agroecological model (PROMET) for the simulation of temporally and spatially dynamic crop growth on agriculturally managed fields. By assimilating optical remote sensing data into the model, the simulation of spatial crop dynamics is improved to a point where <b>site-specific</b> <b>farming</b> measures can be supported. Radiative transfer modeling (SLC) is used to provide maps of leaf area index from Earth Observation (EO). These maps are used in an assimilation scheme that selects closest matches between EO and PROMET ensemble runs. Validation is provided for winter wheat (years 2004, 2010 and 2011). Field samples validate the temporal dynamics of the simulations (avg. R² = 0. 93) and > 700 ha of calibrated combine harvester data are used for accuracy assessment of the spatial yield simulations (avg. RMSE = 1. 15 t∙ha− 1). The study shows that precise simulation of field-scale crop growth and yield is possible, if spatial remotely sensed information is combined with temporal dynamics provided by land surface process models. The presented methodology represents a technical solution to make the best possible use of the growing stream of EO data in the context of sustainable land surface management...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the US SE Coastal Plain, {{adoption}} of <b>site-specific</b> <b>farming</b> has lagged behind {{that in the}} upper Midwest. While reasons for this may be both social and economic, {{it appears that the}} importance of the problem represented by yield variation on production fields needs to be quantified before adoption would be considered by many farm operators. Our objective was to document the severity, extent and persistence of yield variation for corn, wheat and soybean during normal production in this region. Farmer combines were fitted with commercial yield monitors to produce yield maps. Corn, wheat and soybean yields were mapped for three years on more than 4900 ha (12, 000 acres). For each cooperator, crop and year, summary statistics and cumulative yield distribution functions were also developed. Yield maps showed that substantial areas had yields either well below or above the mean for the cooperator-crop-year. For instance, 25 % of Cooperator A’s area had corn yields more than 30 % below the mean yield of 5. 06 Mg/ha and another 25 % had yields more than 31 % above that mean, which indicate the severity of yield variation. Variation from county to county had no consistent difference indicating that the extent of the variation is widespread. Variation was also persistent from year to year, with more than 50 % of the area in 15 of 17 fields having stable yields relative to the field mean. These data show the potential importance of variable-rate management in the region and also hint at the potential environmental implications. Key words: Yield monitor, yield map, yield distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} feasibility {{of three different}} fertilizer management strategies (constant rate, three-rate and multiple-rate technology) {{in the application of}} nitrogen fertilizer to corn are compared under different probability distributions for field fertility. A constant rate was more profitable than either variable-rate technology system for homogeneous fields with low fertility. The ap-plication area at which the relative profitability between systems changed was largely determined by the characteristics of the fertility distribution rather than by assumptions regarding costs. Variable-rate technology improves groundwater quality in low-fertility fields by reducing total fertilizer applied and in high-fertility fields by increasing corn yield. Key words: fertility distributions, net returns, precision farming, variable rate. Spatial information technology such as global positioning systems is rapidly being applied in agriculture. Known as precision agricul-ture, <b>site-specific</b> <b>farming,</b> or variable-rate technology, this technology collects and an-alyzes data for alternative locations, thereby permitting management decisions to vary by location. The technology recognizes the spa-tial variability inherent in most agricultural production processes. For example, in crop production, soil fertility can vary significantly within a field so that the typical nutrient man-agement strategy of applying a single rate of fertilizer will result in areas that are either under- or overfertilized. Variable-rate tech-nology allows farmers to apply the optimal rate for each location in the field, thereby im-proving efficiency in fertilizer use and poten-tially significantly decreasing residual nutrient loadings. The question surrounding whether the po-tential increase in gross returns and reduction in fertilizer expenses is sufficient to cover the investment costs of adopting variable-rate technology (VRT) remains unanswered.

40|$|When {{dealing with}} {{unmanned}} agricultural vehicles (remotely-controlled vehicles, robots), vision systems are a key-factor for implementing field-solutions having direct interactions with crops. Among {{all the possible}} information given by a vision system, the punctual estimation of the canopy volume is surely an interesting parameter: it {{is related to the}} crop vegetative status and, hence, it is fundamental for performing and setting-up properly some important field-operations (e. g., pruning/thinning, spraying). A system able to recognize the canopy volume can provide either the input-signals for implementing a robotic real-time <b>site-specific</b> <b>farming</b> system or relevant information for a proper crop management. However, there are many practical difficulties in the field implementation of such a system: complex canopy shapes, different colours, textures and illumination conditions with projected shadows. Terrestrial/aerial vision systems working on visible-light wavelengths and/or 2 D-images of crops, although capable of excellent performances, have a computationally-heavy post-processing; therefore, they are unsuitable for implementing low-cost real-time servo-actuated cropping systems (e. g., robotised sprayers). Instead, a vision system composed by two LiDAR sensors aligned vertically, scanning the same targets, could give a sort of stereoscopic vision, here named ‘‘lateral-linear-stereoscopic vision”. The aim of this study is assessing the opportunity to use such a system on an automatic or autonomous/ robotised implement by performing some preliminary tests in a controlled environment. The resulting system is independent of the lighting conditions (it works also in the dark), is highly reliable (no projected shadows) and data processing is very fast. Although further studies are required to overcome the issues that could arise in a future field implementation, this system has all the premises to be successfully embedded in an automatized monitoring system...|$|E
40|$|Yield Maps are a basic {{information}} source for <b>site-specific</b> <b>farming.</b> For sugar beet {{they are not}} available as in-situ measurements. This gap of information can be filled with Earth Observation (EO) data in combination with a plant growth model (PROMET) to improve farming and harvest management. The estimation of yield based on optical satellite imagery and crop growth modelling is more challenging for sugar beet than for other crop types since the plants ’ roots are harvested. These are not directly visible from EO. In this study, the impact of multi-sensor data assimilation on the yield estimation for sugar beet is evaluated. Yield and plant growth are modelled with PROMET. This multi-physics, raster-based model calculates photosynthesis and crop growth based on the physiological processes in the plant, including the distribution of biomass into the different plant organs (roots, stem, leaves and fruit) at different phenological stages. The crop variable used in the assimilation is the green (photosynthetically active) leaf area, which is derived as spatially heterogeneous input from optical satellite imagery with the radiative transfer model SLC (Soil-Leaf-Canopy). Leaf area index was retrieved from RapidEye, Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 7 ETM+ data. It could be shown that the used methods are very suitable to derive plant parameters time-series with different sensors. The LAI retrievals from different sensors are quantitatively compared to each other. Results for sugar beet yield estimation are shown for a test-site in Southern Germany. The validation of the yield estimation for the years 2012 to 2014 shows that the approach reproduced the measured yield on field level with high accuracy. Finally, it is demonstrated through comparison of different spatial resolutions that small-scale in-field variety is modelled wit...|$|E
