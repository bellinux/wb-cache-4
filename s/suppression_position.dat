40|$|Rodents are {{the most}} {{commonly}} used animal model in neuroscience. Remarkably, most methods for studying neural circuits target rodents as the primary animal model. Despite this, rodents are still largely overlooked in studies of higher-order perception and, in particular, vision where non-human primates are primarily used instead. Recent studies demonstrated that rodents are able to perform complex visual tasks and their visual system mimics that of primates. Indeed, the former appears to consist of multiple brain areas arranged hierarchically along two distinct visual pathways. To further study similarities between the visual systems of rodents and primates, we examined how repetition <b>suppression,</b> <b>position</b> and clutter tolerance evolves along a putative ventral visual pathway in rats. To do this, we recorded multi-unit spiking activity in primary visual cortex and a more downstream laterointermediate (LI) area of passively viewing, head-restrained Long Evans rats. Similar to primates, we observed a greater degree of repetition <b>suppression,</b> <b>position</b> and clutter tolerance, as reflected in better preservation of stimulus selectivity across experimental manipulations, in the more downstream area LI than primary visual cortex. All effects were present in the early (25 - 175 ms relative to stimulus onset) phase of the neural response, with the late (175 - 325 ms) phase showing no modulation. These findings, when assuming a further build-up of those effects along a putative ventral visual pathway in rats beyond the area LI, parallel those reported in primates. Importantly, as such these findings provide further evidence in support of rodents being a valid animal model to study vision. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe dosage {{effect of}} Y-chromosome {{heterochromatin}} on <b>suppression</b> of <b>position</b> effect variegation (PEV) {{has long been}} well-known in Drosophila. The phenotypic effects of increasing the overall dosage of Y heterochromatin have also been demonstrated; hyperploidy of the Y chromosome produces male sterility and many somatic defects including variegation and abnormal legs and wings. This work addresses whether the <b>suppression</b> of <b>position</b> effect variegation (PEV) is a general feature of the heterochromatin (independent of the chromosome of origin) and whether a hyperdosage of heterochromatin can affect viability. The {{results show that the}} suppression of PEV is a general feature of any type of constitutive heterochromatin and that the intensity of suppression depends on its amount instead of some mappable factor on it. We also describe a clear dosage effect of Y heterochromatin on the viability of otherwise wild-type embryos and the modification of that effect by a specific gene mutation. Together, our results indicate that the correct balance between heterochromatin and euchromatin is essential for the normal genome expression and that this balance is genetically controlled...|$|R

40|$|Presented {{here are}} {{findings}} describing the spatial-dependence of sensitivity and ion suppression effects observed with direct analysis {{in real time}} (DART). Continuous liquid infusion of dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP) revealed that ion yield hot spots did not always correspond with the highest temperature regions within the ionization space. For instance, at lower concentrations (50 and 100 μM), the highest sensitivities {{were in the middle}} of the ionization region at 200 °C where there was a shorter ion transport distance, and the heat available to thermally desorb neutrals was moderate. Conversely, at higher DMMP concentrations (500 μM), the highest ion yield was directly in front of the DART source at 200 °C where it was exposed to the highest temperature for thermal desorption. In matching experiments, differential analyte volatility was observed to play a smaller role in relative ion suppression than differences in proton affinity and the relative sampling positions of analytes. At equimolar concentrations sampled at the same <b>position,</b> <b>suppression</b> was as high as 26 × between isoquinoline (proton affinity 952 kJ mol 1, boiling point 242 °C) and p-anisidine (proton affinity 900 kJ mol 1, boiling point 243 °C). This effect was exacerbated when sampling positions of the two analytes differed, reaching levels of relative suppression as high as 4543. 0 ×[*]±[*] 1406. 0. To mitigate this level of relative ion <b>suppression,</b> sampling <b>positions</b> and molar ratios of the analytes were modified to create conditions in which ion suppression was negligible.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the dual {{use of a}} piezoelectric self-sensing actuator for both vibration suppression and structural health monitoring (SHM) applications. For vibration <b>suppression,</b> positive <b>position</b> feedback is used for control, where the impedance method or time series autoregressive models are utilized for structural damage detection in SHM. For this approach, only a single piezoelectric transducers element is employed {{to reduce the number}} of system components, while enhancing the structural performance. To validate this technique, an analytical model is first developed using the basic principles of PZT materials and the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. This analytical model is then experimentally verified on a cantilever beam and a three story bolted structure. This paper summarizes considerations needed to design such systems, techniques for control and signal processing, experimental procedures and results, as well as additional issues that can be used as a guideline for future investigations...|$|R
40|$|Future {{lightweight}} {{design in}} space structure technology {{has to pay}} more attention to vibration <b>suppression,</b> to <b>position</b> control, or, more generally, to structure-inherent adaptability. These properties are often called "intelligent" or "smart", ignoring the fact that only creatures can have mental abilities. Having adaptation mechanisms for every dynamic process, living nature indeed teaches us that it is inexpedient if technical structural systems dispense with adaptability. Vibration and stability phenomena are making performance restrictions in space systems more and more evident. The DLR project ARES (Actively Reacting Flexible Structures) intends to overcome these limitations by developing a new class of technical systems. The ARES concept essentially consists of two new technologies: new kinds of integrated sensors and actuators working as components lying in the structural load path, and adaptive controllers consisting of digital filters which are adptive in that they react against changing environmental influences as well as changes within the structure itself...|$|R

40|$|Single-copy human beta-globin transgenes {{are very}} {{susceptible}} to <b>suppression</b> by <b>position</b> effects of surrounding closed chromatin. However, these position effects are overcome by a 20 kbp DNA fragment containing the locus control region (LCR). Here {{we show that}} the 6. 5 kbp microlocus LCR cassette reproducibly directs full expression from independent single-copy beta-globin transgenes. By testing individual DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS) present in the microlocus cassette, we demonstrate that the 1. 5 kbp 5 'HS 2 enhancer fragment does not direct beta-globin expression from single-copy transgenes. In contrast, the 1. 9 kbp 5 'HS 3 fragment directs beta-globin expression in five independent single-copy transgenic mouse lines. Moreover, the 5 'HS 3 core element and beta-globin proximal promoter sequences are DNase I hypersensitive in fetal liver nuclei of these expressing transgenic lines. Taken together, these results demonstrate that LCR activity {{is the culmination of}} at least two separable functions including: (i) a novel activity located in 5 'HS 3 that dominantly opens and remodels chromatin structure; and (ii) a recessive enhancer activity residing in 5 'HS 2.

40|$|Electroencephalographic {{studies in}} humans have {{demonstrated}} that orienting of visual attention induces a decrease in oscillatory alpha-band activity (alpha-desynchronization) over cortical areas tuned to the attended visual space. This is interpreted as reflecting intentionally enhanced excitability of these areas to facilitate upcoming visual processing. However, the inverse mechanism might also apply. Brain areas that process task-irrelevant space might be actively suppressed by increased alpha-activity (alpha-synchronization) to protect against input of distracter information. In the present study, we demonstrate that such suppression mechanisms are highly selective and are taking place even without distracters {{that need to be}} ignored. During voluntary orienting of attention, we found alpha-synchronization to dominate over desynchronization, to be topographically specific for each of eight attention positions, and to occur over areas processing unattended space in a retinotopically organized pattern. This indicates that alpha-synchronization is an important component of selective attention, serving active <b>suppression</b> of unattended <b>positions</b> during visual spatial orienting...|$|R
40|$|Mutations {{have been}} {{examined}} in the 1500 interspersed Alu repeats of human DNA that have been sequenced and are nearly full length.

There is a good correlation of the <b>suppression</b> in different <b>positions,</b> and therefore the joint probability of absence of mutation at many pairs of such positions is significantly higher than that expected at random. The suppression of mutation appears to result from selection that is not due to requirements for Alu sequence replication.

40|$|The histone {{genes of}} {{wild-type}} Drosophila melanogaster are reiterated 100 – 150 times per haploid genome and {{are located in}} the segment of chromosome 2 that corresponds to polytene bands 39 D 2 - 3 to E 1 - 2. The influence of altered histone gene multiplicity on chromatin structure has been assayed by measuring modification of the gene inactivation associated with position effect variegation in genotypes bearing deletions of the 39 D-E segment. The proportion of cells in which a variegating gene is active is increased in genotypes that are heterozygous for a deficiency that removes the histone gene complex. Deletions that remove segments adjacent to the histone gene complex have no effect on the expression of variegating genes. <b>Suppression</b> of <b>position</b> effect variegation associated with reduction of histone gene multiplicity applies to both X-linked and autosomal variegating genes. Position effects exerted by both autosomal and sex-chromosome heterochromatin were suppressible by deletions of the histone gene complex. The suppression was independent of the presence of the Y chromosome. A deficiency that deletes only the distal portion of the histone gene complex also has the ability to suppress position effect variegation. Duplication of the histone gene complex did not enhance position effect variegation. Deletion or duplication of the histone gene complex in the maternal genome had no effect on the extent of variegation in progeny whose histone gene multiplicity was normal. These results are discussed with respect to current knowledge of the organization of the histone gene complex and control of its expression...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTo {{explore a}} visual scene we make many fast eye {{movements}} (saccades) every second. During those saccades {{the image of}} the world shifts rapidly across our retina. These shifts are normally not detected, because perception is suppressed during saccades. In this paper we study the origin of this saccadic suppression by examining the influence of luminance borders in the background on the perception of flashes presented near the time of saccades in a normally illuminated room. We used different types of backgrounds: either with isoluminant red and green areas or with black and white areas. We found that the ability to perceive flashes that were presented during saccades was suppressed when there were luminance borders in the background, but not when there were isoluminant color borders in the background. Thus, masking by moving luminance borders {{plays an important role in}} saccadic <b>suppression.</b> The perceived <b>positions</b> of detected flashes were only influenced by the borders between the areas in the background when the flashes were presented before or after the saccades. Moreover, the influence did not depend on the kind of contrast forming the border.

40|$|AbstractQuestion. How {{precisely}} can objects, {{located in}} different depth planes, {{be aligned to}} the same visual direction? Methods. Twenty normal observers were presented with vertical Vernier lines at various stereodisparities. They had to judge whether the lower, anterior line was located on the right- or left-hand side of the upper, posterior line. Results. Over a stereodisparity range from zero to 62 ″, the threshold for detecting a lateral offset between the Vernier lines remained at the “hyperacuity” level of about 7 ″. With larger stereodisparities, the threshold increased about fourfold, probably due to a mutual, partial <b>suppression</b> of the <b>position</b> signals from {{the right and left}} eyes. The reference point from which the observers judged the relative visual directions between stereodisparate objects was not located midway between the eyes; rather, it was often decentred towards the right or the left eye, meaning that the observers had an “ocular prevalence”. Their ocular prevalence was, however, not strong enough to {{have an effect on the}} Vernier acuity for stereodisparate objects. (Under pathological conditions like strabismic amblyopia, one should expect a 100 % prevalence of the good eye, implying that the Vernier acuity reaches the monocular level, irrespective of any depth difference between objects.) Conclusion. Vernier acuity decreases with increasing stereodisparity. Ocular prevalence, occurring frequently among persons with normal eyes, has no effect on Vernier acuity for stereodisparate objects. For a typical everyday viewing condition, the reduced Vernier acuity beyond a stereodisparity of 62 ″ means that, from a viewing distance of 40 cm, precision mechanics have to guide their instrument as close as 0. 4 mm to a workpiece, until they can utilise their best position acuity...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Heterochromatin is thought to be formed by transcription via RNA Pol II of aberrant/repeated regions such as those found in the centromeric regions that enter into the RNAi silencing pathway and guide chromatin modifications for gene silencing. We examined this issue in Drosophila. Our initial results indicate genetic and biochemical interactions between RNAi related components in Drosophila (dcr 2, aub, ago 2, hls and piwi) and the second largest subunit of RNA Pol II. The interaction between mutations in the RNAi silencing machinery and RNA pol II results in a strong <b>suppression</b> of PEV (<b>Position</b> Effect Variegation) indicating a possible effect on heterochromatin formation in Drosophila. The analysis of polytene chromosomes revealed a decrease in the H 3 -K 9 me 2 modification at the chromocenter in the double heterozygous (hlsE 616, hls 125, dcr 2 and RNA Pol II A 5) mutants when compared with wild type and single heterozygotes. In addition the double heterozygotes also showed mislocalisation of Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP 1). The results also indicated that the RNA Pol II and RNA silencing machinery components do not affect post-transcriptional gene silencing. In addition co-immunoprecipitation data indicate that RNA Pol II biochemically interacts with components of the RNA silencing machinery...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to investigate on precise positioning with a GPS and Galileo enabled chipset embedded in a smartphone. The analysis is carried out with code and carrier-based algorithms in different scenarios: simulated, stationary, pedestrian and vehicular. The areas investigated are precise positioning with single frequency, the benefits of multi-constellation GNSS and raw data quality provided by a smartphone. Currently the smartphones use only one frequency (L 1) : {{this is an important}} constraint {{in the design of the}} precise positioning algorithm mainly due to ionospheric effect. Hence, the work is based in two main algorithms: the first uses the carrier phase differential approach (Static or Kinematic) in conjunction of a reference GNSS networks; the second is based on the variometric approach using the VADASE algorithm, as the previous it uses the carrier phase but without external data. Modern GNSS chipsets are multi-constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, Beidou) and the increased number of satellites that can be tracked allows to increase the convergence time and to estimate the user's position very precisely. In the proposed work, at least the GPS+Galileo combination is considered. The purpose is to evaluate the benefit of tracking different GNSS constellations in terms of accuracy and convergence time. To develop software capable of this type of positioning, or perform these computations with existing software, pseudoranges and carrier-phase measurements are required. In principle, after the release of the N version of the Android operating system, the raw data are obtainable from a phone or tablet. However, from a technical point of view, the raw data, especially the carrier-phase, are not directly available in standard format and must be properly parsed. The paper analyses the main errors sources’ of the GNSS chipset embedded in smartphone. The primary error source on smartphones lies not in the GNSS chipset, which actually offers great performance in terms of tracking availability and codebased accuracy, but in the antenna, whose chief failing is its poor multipath <b>suppression.</b> High accuracy <b>positioning</b> requires a stable antenna position for referring the position. However, moving smartphones are constantly changing attitude (which affects the antenna gain also), altitude (e. g. when the smartphone is kept in hand along the body or in front of the face for reading) and obstruction conditions. In order to quantify the impact of these scenarios, tests with internal and external antenna have been conducted...|$|R

It is widely recognised that the failing heart is energy-starved, and that restoring energy homeostasis is a promising approach towards improving cardiac output. This thesis aims to address the role of energetics in the failing heart, by focussing on modulation of the creatine transporter (CrT). Creatine (Cr), together with the phosphocreatine shuttle, plays a vital role in maintaining energy supplies via ATP in times of high energy demand. Key to the regulation of intracellular [Cr] is the CrT, a Na+ and Cl- - dependent membrane transporter. Previous CrT genetic mouse models include a knockout model, found to still express cardiac CrT, and a cardiac-specific CrT overexpressing (OE) model with large variations in myocardial [Cr] between animals and Cr levels high enough to cause spontaneous hypertrophy. To overcome the shortfalls of this CrT-OE model, a novel in vivo model of temporal inducible expression of CrT is described, using a cardiac-specific tetracycline inducible (Tet-On) system. Ten transgenic lines (RCT) were created with a construct containing the CrT-HA (CrT cDNA with an haemagglutinin epitope tag), following successful doxycyline-inducibility in vitro. Eight lines showed germline transmission, with LV CrT OE achieved in an individual mouse that displayed double LV [Cr] compared to WT. Issues with the inducer line (rtTA) were ruled out by its use {{in the creation of a}} luciferase overexpressing mouse line; all mice tested demonstrated LV luciferase expression in response to doxycycline feeding. The failure to overexpress CrT could be attributed to position or copy number dependent <b>suppression,</b> or to <b>position</b> effect variegation in the case of the single OE mouse obtained. Subsequent work focussed on regulatory pathways in vitro in a cell line of mouse fibroblasts stably overexpressing CrT-HA. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) had been previously suggested to regulate CrT activity. Two N-linked glycosylation sites exist, in addition to the putative phosphorylation sites. Inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin led to decreased CrT activity, reflected by decreased Cr uptake capacity. Strategies to confirm the presence of phosphorylation were employed, including isolation of CrT-HA by immunoprecipitation and subsequent LC-MS / MS analysis to identify PTMs. Although the presence of CrT was confirmed in 5 different sized species- one previously unreported- inadequate sequence coverage prevented identification of any PTM sites. Tyrosine phosphorylation was not detected using a phosphospecific antibody on immunopurified CrT-HA. Candidate signalling pathways in vitro were then investigated to elucidate CrT regulation, namely the IGF 1 R signalling pathway. This study included a cardiomyocyte-like mouse cell line (HL- 1) in addition to 3 T 3 -CrT-HA. Exposure of cells to extracellular insulin, growth hormone and IGF- 1 led to increased Cr uptake of 125 % - 300 % of normal. Pharmacological inhibition of the downstream kinases PKA and PKC reduced the effect of insulin and GH, while PMA, sapintoxin (STX) and Gö 6976 induced CrT activity. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is also a candidate regulator of CrT, as incubation with rapamycin decreased Cr uptake in 3 T 3 -CrT-HA. Finally, a targeted approach on transcription factors in the 5 'UTR region of mouse CrT identified HEY 1 as a highly conserved site. In siRNA experiments, HEY 1 was found to exert a mild effect on CrT activity, suggesting that regulation at the transcriptional level merits further investigation. Together, this work has provided novel insights into the modulation of CrT in vitro, identifying molecular and pharmacological targets in a known therapeutic signalling pathway. Further work could potentially develop these findings by identifying candidate compounds that would increase CrT activity, potentially in a tissue-specific manner. </p...|$|R

Further work could potentially develop these findings by identifying candidate compounds that would increase CrT activity, potentially in a tissue-specific manner. 3 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
