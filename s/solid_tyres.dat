500|$|In spring 1904 the Great North began a motor omnibus {{service to}} Braemar, {{connecting}} with trains at Ballater. These early buses had <b>solid</b> <b>tyres</b> and a legal speed limit of , but were {{faster than the}} horse-drawn coaches they replaced. By 1907 buses connected with Great North train services and conveyed passengers to Strathdon, Midmar, Echt, Cluny Castle and Aberchirden, between Cock Bridge and Tomintoul a horse-drawn coach {{was used as the}} motor buses could not ascend the steep road. Services from Aberdeen connected with trains at , where a refreshment room was built. In 1914 the railway had 35 passenger road vehicles that, together with 15 five-ton lorries, worked [...] daily.|$|E
50|$|The first buses {{delivered}} in 1920 were twenty 31-seat Straker-Squire vehicles with <b>solid</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1900 {{they built}} their first motor car, a rustic-looking dogcart made of {{varnished}} wood and {{powered by a}} flat-twin 8hp engine with gear-change by [...] "Patent Combination Clutches" [...] and <b>solid</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{distribution}} network was established {{consisting of a}} few (initially) storage depots round the country, supplied by a small fleet of used lorries with <b>solid</b> <b>tyres</b> (tires), acquired from the War Disposals Board. These transported the fuel in war-surplus drums and cans of 2, 4 or 50 gallons.|$|E
50|$|Participation was {{restricted}} to French men and 99 of the 207 (or 280) participants finished. Michelin's Charles Terront won in 71 hours 22 minutes after passing Dunlop's Jiel-Laval as he slept during the third night. Both had suffered punctures in their pneumatic tyres, but still enjoyed an advantage over riders on <b>solid</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} either type had steel or wooden wheels, later followed by solid rubber tyres. Various developments, such as fully enclosed cabs and pneumatic tyres, were later tried by companies {{in a bid}} to compete with internal combustion engine-powered lorries. Some wagons built to run on <b>solid</b> <b>tyres</b> were later converted to pneumatic tyres.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} bicycle lamps were oil-powered {{and started}} to be manufactured in 1876 for the Ordinary (High-Bicycle) and <b>solid</b> <b>tyred</b> tricycles. From 1896 acetylene gas lighting for bicycles started to be introduced and later in 1899 acetylene gas lamps for the motor-car became popular. Their carbide lamps were powered by acetylene gas, produced by combining calcium carbide with water. The light given was very bright but the lamps required regular maintenance.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{features}} include <b>solid</b> rubber <b>tyres,</b> very strong construction, and thick rubber bumpers {{along the top}} and on the ends.|$|R

50|$|By 1890 the {{business}} had transferred to premises in Melksham in Wiltshire. Products {{at this time}} included <b>solid</b> <b>tyres,</b> conveyor belts and components for railways. By 1900 pneumatic tyres for bicycles were being produced, and by 1906 the first car tyres were advertised. In 1915 the company acquired Greenland Mill in Bradford on Avon (Wiltshire). In 1933 the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange.|$|E
50|$|While steam wagon use greatly {{diminished in}} the 1930s {{due to the}} effects of the Salter report, many wagons were {{converted}} to pneumatic tyres and saw later use. Another use, where wagons often retained <b>solid</b> <b>tyres,</b> was as tar sprayers. Steam wagons also saw use by local authorities into the 1950s. Standard Sentinel waggons were still in commercial use internally at Brown Bayley Steels during the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, the company, by then named Brook Victor Electric Vehicles, {{introduced}} a 3-ton platform truck, which came with pneumatic types, but {{an option for}} <b>solid</b> <b>tyres</b> was available. They also produced {{a small number of}} battery-electric locomotives for the [...] gauge Royal Ordnance Factory railway at Bishopton, Renfrewshire, four of which are preserved on the Almond Valley Light Railway, and one at the Moseley Railway.|$|E
5000|$|... 1869, The road-steamer {{built by}} Robert William Thomson of Edinburgh became famous because its wheels were shod with heavy <b>solid</b> rubber <b>tyres.</b>|$|R

50|$|Son of Edouard Pierre du Cros who was of French Huguenot {{descent and}} Maria Molloy he was educated at The King's Hospital, Dublin. He married Annie Jane Roy in 1866. Advised when aged 30 {{to take up}} sport {{for the sake of}} his health, he became Ireland's: boxing {{champion}} at two weights; fencing champion; founder and captain of a team which won the Irish Rugby championship and, having six sons by the time he reached his late-twenties, he formed them into a successful team of racing cyclists, The Invincibles, on <b>solid</b> <b>tyred</b> penny farthing bicycles. He was president of the Irish Cyclists' Association.|$|R
5000|$|The flour was {{originally}} distributed in 280 lb (127 kg) sacks piled high on horse-drawn drays. Later these {{were replaced by}} motor vehicles; a steam-driven [...] "Sentinel" [...] and, later, by Dennis lorries, the early models having <b>solid</b> <b>tyres.</b> Railways were also used for flour delivery. The company built up a fleet of flatbed lorries and bulk tankers {{to adapt to the}} transition from rail to road transport.|$|E
5000|$|In 1921, one {{complete}} trolleybus {{was shipped}} from England. This {{had the same}} chassis and propulsion but received a body made by Short Brothers. In 1922, the company purchased another seven Railless chassis with propulsion by English Electric (which had taken over Dick, Kerr & Co. in 1919), and fitted them with locally built bodies, to an improved design for which the solitary all-British-built vehicle may have served, in effect, as a pattern. [...] All of these early trolleybuses had <b>solid</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Metropolitan {{borough of}} Wandsworth bought a Manulectric Standon model in 1957, {{to assist in}} the {{maintenance}} of electric street lamps, as they replaced gas lamps. The 160 Amp-hour battery gave a range of 10 to 18 mi per day, enabling the operator to service between 35 and 45 lamp standards. Manulectric displayed a pedestrian controlled vehicle and a conventional driven vehicle at the 1958 Dairy Show.The fleet of Windsor and Eton Dairies included 4 Manulectric 13 cwt standing driver vehicles with <b>solid</b> <b>tyres</b> in 1963.|$|E
50|$|Wasini Island lies in {{southeast}} Kenya 3 km {{off the coast}} of the Indian Ocean, 75 km south of Mombasa, and 3 km opposite the harbour of the village Shimoni. It is approximately 7 km long and 3 km across. The island has only footpaths of sharp old coral or sand. There are no autocars, carts or bicycles. Cargo is transported by foot or by a wheelbarrow with a <b>solid</b> <b>tyre.</b> Transport is over the paths, or via the beaches, mainly consisting of coral and only passable with low tide, or by boat over the sea. Before 1963, in the British colonial time, there was an airstrip in the lagoon situated longitudinal south on the island; only small parts of tarmac are reminders of this history.|$|R
5000|$|The Trojan Utility Car went {{onto the}} market at £230, which was reduced to £125 in 1925, {{the same as a}} Model T Ford. Nothing was conventional. Rather than a chassis the car had a punt shaped tray which housed the engine and {{transmission}} below the seats. The transmission used a chain to drive the <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> shod wheels. The 1527-cc engine to the ingenious Hounsfield design was started by pulling a lever on the right of the driver. To prove how economical the car was to run, the company ran the slogan [...] "Can you afford to walk?" [...] and calculated that over 200 mi it would cost more in shoes and socks than to cover the distance by Trojan car.|$|R
5000|$|It {{opened its}} latest sales and service offices in Australia in Brisbane, in 2014 {{followed}} by another in Melbourne in 2015. Currently, GRI {{is one of the}} major tire manufacturers [...] operating in Sri Lanka, the largest producer of high-quality <b>solid</b> rubber <b>tyres</b> in the world.|$|R
50|$|The first {{motor bus}} service began on 30 March 1914 using six locally made Maudslay vehicles. These were open top double deckers with <b>solid</b> <b>tyres,</b> no {{windscreen}} and seats for 34 passengers, and each cost £739. The route was from Stoke Heath to the Fire Station in Hales Street. During {{the first week}} of operation, £107 4s 4d was taken in fares. A further service to Hearsall Lane started in May but both were short lived as the chassis were requisitioned by the War Office in September that year.|$|E
50|$|He hired {{his first}} bicycle, a safety bicycle with <b>solid</b> <b>tyres,</b> {{when he was}} 17 in 1887 His first ride was from Bradford to Otley and back. At his father’s insistence he then set out to tour England, an {{experience}} his father thought useful before his son started work. Wray bought a solid-tyred penny-farthing - the large-wheeled bicycle that the safety had replaced - and set out on that with no luggage and little money, sleeping rough {{when he had to}} or staying with friends and relatives. He rode between 700 and 800 miles. The experience guided the rest of his life.|$|E
50|$|From sunset to dawn {{a curfew}} was enforced. No lights were {{supposed}} to be visible. Windows which couldn’t be obscured with thick double curtains or full shutters, had to be blacked out. During the daytime, certain vehicles, such as doctors’ cars were allowed on the roads, but fuel was scarce. Some shop-keepers used vans running on gasogene to transport supplies, but the engines were weak. Even horses for wagons and carriages were difficult to find, as many had been requisitioned for use by the German Army. There were steam trains in limited circulation. People walked or used bicycles with <b>solid</b> <b>tyres,</b> since it was impossible to find any inner tubes. Therefore, there was,very little traffic on the roads.|$|E
30|$|The wheel {{tracking}} test {{is capable of}} generating the maximum shear stress and the maximum bending stress that occur when a moving wheel is either slightly offset from or directly over a crack, respectively. This produces mode I and mode II cracking. The {{wheel tracking}} machine was located in a temperature controlled room, which allows the effect of temperature on SAMI performance to be studied. The wheel tracker consists of a reciprocating table which moves forwards and backwards with a frequency of 0.8  Hz under the loaded wheel with a travel length of 225  mm. The <b>solid</b> <b>tyre</b> fitted to the wheel has an outside diameter of 200  mm and width of 50  mm. The test replicates {{what happens when a}} cracked pavement overlaid with and without interlayers (SAMIs) is trafficked.|$|R
25|$|A Garford bus was {{purchased}} from New Zealand Farmers Co-op in June 1920 {{with the intention}} that it would replace the Walker electric bus on the Templeton service. Fitted with weather blinds and <b>solid</b> rubber <b>tyres,</b> its ride quality was no more improved {{than that of the}} vehicle it replaced.|$|R
50|$|No {{spare wheel}} was carried, {{considered}} unnecessary {{because of the}} use of run-flat (nearly <b>solid)</b> rubber <b>tyres</b> rather than pneumatic types vulnerable to punctures. Despite hard tyres, independent coil suspension gave each wheel having approximately 8 inches (20 cm) vertical deflection and coil springs all round gave a remarkably comfortable ride.|$|R

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{armoured}} cars were also {{built on the}} Jeffery truck chassis in 1916 for use in British India. Forty {{were added to the}} [...] "Field Force" [...] that was operating to contain the Mohmand rising of Haji Mullah on the North West Frontier. The [...] "Mohmand blockade" [...] involved British armoured cars patrolling unpaved tracks between blockhouses. Maintenance of the cars was difficult as the ship carrying spares had been torpedoed. They were armed with a single Vickers machine gun. Although the four-wheel drive with independent transmission and wide range of gears should have been an advantage, the narrow <b>solid</b> <b>tyres</b> negated that and running at more than 12 mph caused problems with engine bearings.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1920s and 30s travel became easier, as a {{few people}} {{acquired}} motor-cycles, and cars and bus services were developed. Orange-coloured buses of United Automobile Services pioneered the route along the A140 until they were absorbed by Eastern Counties Omnibus Company in 1931. The Eastern Counties service was five buses daily, including Sundays. Lower Tasburgh was served by the buses of Mr Trudgil of Pulham St Mary. One bus ran each way on Wednesdays and Fridays, with two return journeys on Saturdays. The trip to Norwich called for either plumpness or fortitude, for the buses had wooden seats, and one was fitted with <b>solid</b> <b>tyres.</b> The return fare was nine old pence (less than four new pence).|$|E
50|$|The 1970s saw {{the start}} of {{substantial}} growth {{with the formation of}} companies in the areas of electrical motor manufacturing, agricultural machinery, hotels, clothing, seafood export, computer software and <b>solid</b> rubber <b>tyres,</b> and in 2000 Jinasena consists of 17 companies {{and is one of the}} largest conglomerates in Sri Lanka.|$|R

25|$|In 1917 the Board {{purchased}} {{its first}} bus and commenced a feeder service {{from the end}} of the Sockburn tram route to Templeton. The bus was a battery-powered vehicle with <b>solid</b> rubber <b>tyres</b> but proved to be so unreliable that it was rebuilt and converted to use a petrol engine. It was later joined by another petrol-powered bus.|$|R
