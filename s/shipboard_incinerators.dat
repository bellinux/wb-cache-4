50|$|One {{source of}} {{environmental}} stresses on maritime vessels recently {{has come from}} states and localities, as they assess the contribution of commercial marine vessels to regional air quality problems when ships are docked at port.For instance, large marine diesel engines are believed to contribute 7 percent of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions in Baton Rouge/New Orleans. Ships can also {{have a significant impact}} in areas without large commercial ports: they contribute about 37 percent of total area nitrogen oxide emissions in the Santa Barbara area, and that percentage is expected to increase to 61 percent by 2015. Again, there is little cruise-industry specific data on this issue. They comprise {{only a small fraction of}} the world shipping fleet, but cruise ship emissions may exert significant impacts on a local scale in specific coastal areas that are visited repeatedly. <b>Shipboard</b> <b>incinerators</b> also burn large volumes of garbage, plastics, and other waste, producing ash that must be disposed of. Incinerators may release toxic emissions as well.|$|E
40|$|In a {{continuing}} research program directed at developing technology for compact <b>shipboard</b> <b>incinerators</b> active control of fluid dynamics {{has been used}} to enhance mixing m incinerator afterburner (AB) experiments and increase the DRE for a waste surrogate. Experiments were conducted at power levels between 50 kW and 700 kW. This highest level is essentially full scale. The open loop active control system is based on the concept of combustion in periodic axi-symmetric vortices. Acoustic excitation was used to stabilize coherent vortices in the central air flow of a dump combustor configuration and waste gases mjected annularly at the dump. This leads to good mixing, a controlled yet lifted partially premixed flame, high DRE and low emissions. Tests with more realistic waste surrogate gases were undertaken. Nitrogen was used to dilute the ethylene and reduce the BTU content and an electric heater brought the waste surrogate gas temperature to more realistic levels (up to 1000 F). Even at BTU contents as low as 152 BTU/ft 3 ^^ctave^b^;n 0 ^ worked well with a strong vortex, a stable lifted blue flame, and low emissions (CO and ^ *^JÂ£ppm at a residence time of 104 msec). Then realistic waste off-gas chemistry was addressed using 640 F mixtures of CO!H 2 H 2 O, and N 2. Despite the low energy content (115 BTU/ft 3) the active control was still successfu...|$|E
