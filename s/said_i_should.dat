I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then I went off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E
500|$|During his {{lifetime}} Disraeli's opponents, {{and sometimes even}} his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction. Lord John Manners, in 1843 {{at the time of}} Young England, wrote, [...] "could I only satisfy myself that D'Israeli believed all that he <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be more happy: his historical views are quite mine, but does he believe them?" [...] Blake (writing in 1966) suggested that it is no more possible to answer that question now than it was then. Nevertheless, Paul Smith, in his journal article on Disraeli's politics, argues that Disraeli's ideas were coherently argued over a political career of nearly half a century, and [...] "it is impossible to sweep them aside as a mere bag of burglar's tools for effecting felonious entry to the British political pantheon." ...|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{needs to}} {{know there is a}} degree of dissatisfaction among the public. I think people want to see that EastEnders is {{populated}} by many different ethnic groups. Black people in real life run businesses, fall in and out of love, have fascinating and exciting lives. So why can't we in EastEnders. We are not all losers or nobodies so why can't the BBC show that?...I really felt so ineffectual as a character because I had nothing to get my teeth into - there were no great dramatic scenes or relationships. My character was never given anything meaningful to say and that was such a wasted opportunity. My son <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> get out of EastEnders because it wasn't doing me any good as an actress or as a black woman...I have got to speak out so that things can change." ...|$|E

2500|$|In October 2008, The Times {{reported}} that Lewis had {{turned down a}} seven-figure sum from Mohamed Al Fayed to open a Harrods sale. Lewis commented that she turned down the deal {{on the grounds that}} Harrods is the only UK department store that continues to stock clothing made from animal fur: [...] "It wasn't a million pounds that I was offered, as the papers reported, but even if it had been, I still would have turned it down". [...] "I got a lot of flak for that. There were people who <b>said</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have done it and given the money to charity, but that would have been such a contradiction." [...] She announced in October 2008 that she was in the [...] "bargaining period" [...] of launching her own ethical line of accessories through Topshop and that she was in the late stages of releasing her own perfume in Europe. Her perfume, Leona Lewis, was launched by LR in July 2009. In 2010, she set up a fashion company with her then-boyfriend, Lou Al-Chamaa, called LOA Clothing Ltd, which was dissolved in 2012.|$|E

[...] "But it's of no use to pretend that I will obey you. I can't do it.
