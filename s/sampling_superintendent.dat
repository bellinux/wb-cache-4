Superintendents were asked if their school district used SBM, composition of site councils, selection processes of council membership, authority granted, content of decisions, and impact on student achievement;Phase II compared different models of SBM and their impact on student achievement. Three school districts were selected with different models of SBM: superintendent-initiated SBM, school board-initiated SBM, and state-mandated SBM. Comparisons were made between the school districts in the following areas: granted authority, content of decisions, time spent on issues, elements of functioning councils, and impact on student achievement. Comparisons were also made between parents {{and other members of the}} councils regarding the perceived impact of the different SBM models on student achievement;Statistical procedures used for this investigation were ANOVA, Scheffe, Bonferroni, and chi-tests;Fifty-four percent of the superintendents responding to this survey indicated their school district did use SBM. The superintendent-initiated SBM was the most frequent form of SBM. Authority granted to SBM councils was most frequently curriculum, followed by budget and personnel. The findings from the more detailed examination of SBM councils showed that state-mandated SBM councils spent more tune on curriculum and had a larger impact on student achievement than councils from superintendent-initiated or school board-initiated SBM;Seventy-seven percent of the superintendents of SBM governance reported SBM to have 2 ̆ 2 some 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 moderate 2 ̆ 2 impact on student achievement.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what characteristics contribute to superintendent longevity in a school district for 10 years or more. A qualitative multiple case study was conducted using a sample from 11 % of Indiana school superintendents who remained in their districts for 10 years or more. This random <b>sample</b> included <b>superintendents</b> from various districts. Superintendents interviewed responded to a series of five questions that explored the characteristics of community politics, size of the district, superintendent leadership characteristics, community demographics, and support systems. During the qualitative multiple case study, more questions arose as a result of the interview process and were documented. As a result of this study, it was determined that community politics, district size, certain characteristics of leadership styles, changing demographics, and sufficient support systems were integral parts of a superintendency that had these superintendents remaining in a district in Indiana for 10 years or more. The mutually, well-developed relationships created in the different characteristics between the superintendents, their boards, schools and community created a symbiotic relationship necessary for superintendent longevity in their respective districts.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of the study were: (1) to examine the perceptions superintendents, principals, and teachers have relative to the utilization of scheduled preparation time; (2) to determine if teachers with more experience had a different perception of the utilization of scheduled teacher preparation time than less experienced teachers; (3) to determine if teachers had a preference when the preparation was scheduled; and (4) {{to determine if the}} use of preparation time for people interaction, preparation and planning tasks, administrative tasks, personal and co-educational tasks were perceived in the same way by superintendents, principals, and teachers. The preparation period is one of the standards used by the North Central Association for secondary school accreditation. The preparation period was recognized {{as a part of the}} teaching -load, was strongly recommended for each teacher, wan included in each teacher's schedule, and had to be included within the six-hour day. In order to compare perceptions of superintendents, principals, and teachers relative to utilization of preparation period, a questionnaire was developed for the study. In final form, the questionnaire was comprised of 34 items. Demographic data were also obtained from each group of respondents. A total of 1227 questionnaires was mailed. There were 975 usable questionnaires returned. The population comprised 50 Indiana secondary schools accredited by the North Central Association; the superintendents of each school corporation in which the 50 schools were located; the principals of each of the 50 schools; and 40 per cent of the teachers selected at random from each school. The 50 schools, located in 42 school corporations, were randomly selected from the official NCA roster of accredited secondary schools. The hypotheses for the study were stated in null form to facilitate testing and statistical treatment. For each population <b>sample</b> (<b>superintendents,</b> principals, and teachers) an absolute frequency was computed for questionnaire responses. Utilizing the absolute frequency, the median test and relative frequency was computed. The chisquare test was used to determine the level of significance. The hypotheses were rejected above the. 05 level of significance. Each hypothesis had five sub-parts. The acceptance or nonacceptance of the hypotheses was determined by the statistical significance of three of the five subparts. The study indicated most secondary teachers have assigned preparation time. From the 892 teacher questionnaires, two teachers indicated they did not have a preparation period. It can be concluded that guidelines have been established for teacher scheduled preparation time within the school day. To meet the needs of students, scheduled teacher preparation time should be within the school day. A vast majority of teachers utilized preparation time for students to make up tests, for students enrolled in independent study, and for student conferences. This requires the student to be in attendance and if all preparation time was before or after school, student attendance would be more difficult to attain. The data revealed a considerable range in the perceptions of superintendents, principals, and teachers in the utilization of preparation time for instructional and non-instructional responsibilities, but it can be concluded tasks related to students and instructional procedures were utilized the most often. Hall monitoring, lunch room supervision, extra curricular activities, and publications do not utilize a significant portion of teacher preparation time. Superintendents and school boards have provided for teacher preparation time free from monitoring non-instructional activities. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the perceived {{sources of stress}} experienced by superintendents in Connecticut public schools. The study also sought to determine the differences, if any, in the perceived sources of stress experienced by superintendents in high and low Educational Reference Groups (ERGs), a system used {{in the state of}} Connecticut to classify school districts based on socio-economic status. ^ Stages one and two of the Administrative Stress Cycle (Gmelch 2 ̆ 6 Swent, 1980) comprised the theoretical framework for the study. Two instruments, the Administrative Stress Index (ASI) and the Superintendent Stress Inventory (SSI) were used in this study. The ASI (Koch, Tung, Gmelch 2 ̆ 6 Swent, 1982) is a 35 -item instrument for measuring four factors of job-related stress: role-based, task-based, boundary-spanning, and conflict-mediating stress perceived by school administrators. The SSI was adapted from Blase 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) Teacher Stress Inventory, a qualitative instrument designed to collect interpretative data on work stress. The ASI was distributed to all superintendents in Connecticut public schools (n = 149). Using the SSI as protocol, interviews were conducted with a purposive <b>sample</b> of <b>superintendents</b> from the high and low ERGs (n = 16) to enhance the depth of the study. ^ Results showed that board relations, politics, personnel issues, workload, time, crisis management, complying with mandates, and public/community demands and criticism are the major sources of stress perceived by Connecticut superintendents. ^ Findings also indicated significant differences between superintendents in high ERGs and superintendents in low ERGs with respect to role-based stress, task-based stress, boundary-spanning stress, and conflict-mediating stress.

" Every 10 years, the AASA conducts a national study of American superintendents. A total of 1, 724 superintendents across the nation participated in the 1991 study. The major finding of this study was that large/urban district superintendents had characteristics significantly different from superintendents of smaller enrollment districts. Large/urban district superintendents were found to possess some characteristics similar to chief executive officers of large, private sector organizations. For example, as W. Edwards Deming recommends, large/urban district superintendents were more likely to involve community members in planning and decision making. They also tended to be team builders, and stress the quality of process to achieve quality products. Large/urban superintendents also were more apt to use research for problem solving and program planning. Large/urban superintendents entered administration at a younger age than their counterparts, had longer administrative careers, had higher academic degrees, and were more active in professional organizations.

Superintendent perceptions regarding the information-gathering and decision-making stages of evaluation, what preparation is adequate for a superintendent {{to serve as an}} evaluator, and in what ways district size affects evaluation procedures were also determined. ^ Interviews with public school superintendents were used to gather data. These data were coded and analyzed for interpretation, which resulted in identifying thirty-four categories of perceptions expressed by the superintendents.

40|$|This {{quantitative}} study examined Indiana public school superintendents‘ perspectives of efficacy toward the student dropout dilemma. A survey {{was administered to}} a random <b>sample</b> of Indiana <b>superintendents,</b> and an analysis was made to investigate whether superintendents in Indiana {{believe that there is}} an internal or external locus of control (efficacy) concerning the dropout issue. Further examination was made to determine if superintendent opinions towards efficacy differ by school geographic location (rural, suburban, town, metropolitan), socioeconomic status of the community (percent of students on free and reduced lunch), or superintendents‘ age. The study also compared superintendent opinions concerning the dropout issue with those of teachers and principals as reported in Bridgeland, Dilulio, and Balfanz (2009) to see if their opinions correspond. Analysis of variance was computed for the variables of interest to identify significant difference between groups. An ANOVA was run on each research question. A factorial ANOVA was then run to determine whether significant main or interaction effects exist between the independent variables. The statistical analysis showed moderate efficacy among Indiana superintendent concerning student dropouts. The ANOVA and Factorial ANOVA showed insufficient evidence to conclude that significant differences exist between different groups of superintendents based on geographic location, free and reduced lunch populations, or age of the superintendent. The examination of superintendent responses to survey questions showed similar responses to those of teachers and principals on the national study. A general discussion is presented on the conclusions of the research with recommendations made for reducing the dropout rate and further research on the topic.

Significant differences were found regarding (a) whether outside consultants were employed to assist with the district's strategic planning, (b) whether central office administrators participated in the district's planning process, (c) whether a sequence of steps was followed with a time frame for each step in the district's planning process, (d) whether someone other than the superintendent was responsible for the district's planning, (e) whether school district support staff participated in the district's planning process, and (f) whether students participated in the district's planning process. Also, a significant difference was found between large school district superintendents' and small school district superintendents' ratings of the effectiveness of strategic planning for improving management effectiveness. Finally, a correlation was observed between superintendents' ratings of strategic planning effectiveness and professional skill sets...|$|R

The job attitudes of public school superintendents were examined, using Herzberg's theoretical framework of motivator and hygiene factors. A researcher-developed questionnaire presenting thirty job situations was sent to a nationwide, random <b>sample</b> of 493 <b>superintendents.</b> The superintendents were asked to rate, on a five-point scale, the degree to which each variable was present in their jobs, and their perceived level of importance for each variable. Seventy-eight percent (388) of the questionnaires were returned. Cronbach alpha reliabilities of. 84 to. 96 were found for the two presence and two importance categories. Answers to the first four questions were determined through the use of means of responses. Respondents reported a high degree of presence for both motivator variables, X(') =(') 3. 99, and hygiene variables, X(') =(') 3. 81. The differences between these means was significant at the. 001 level. They also attached a high importance to both motivator variables, X(') =(') 4. 20, and hygiene variables, X(') =(') 4. 25. The differences between these means was significant at the. 002 level. Presence and importance of the motivator variables were correlated, r =. 680, and the correlation was significant at the. 001 level. In similar fashion, the presence and importance of the hygiene variables were correlated, r =. 644, and the correlation was significant at the. 001 level. Superintendents did not always feel that their jobs were as satisfying as they should be, and some dissatisfaction appeared to be present. Opportunities for study and reflection seemed to be the factors most associated with the lack of satisfaction. Lack of available time, job insecurity, and weak lines of communication seemed to be the factors most associated with actual dissatisfaction. The possibility that alternatives to Herzberg's theory may be useful in studying job satisfaction among superintendents was raised by factor analysis of the responses to the questionnaire items. Further study of superintendent job attitudes and of demands made upon superintendents' time was recommended...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if there is a relationship between greater than average superintendent turnover and the expectations for length of superintendent tenure held by both superintendents and the boards of education they serve. Superintendent and board member perceptions of the impact of frequent superintendent turnover on the educational process were also examined. The study was both descriptive and causal-comparative, making use of survey information supplied by a stratified random <b>sample</b> of both <b>superintendents</b> and board of education members serving in Illinois. Superintendent turnover provided the dependent variable for the study with superintendent and board member expectations supplying the independent variables for six research questions. Questionnaires were mailed to stable superintendents, mobile superintendents, and superintendents from volatile districts. In addition, questionnaires were mailed to board members from stable and volatile districts and to board members from districts which had hired a mobile superintendent. Frequency distributions of responses from superintendents and board members in stable situations were compared to those of superintendents and board members in volatile situations and to those of superintendents and board members in situations involving a mobile superintendent. Chi-square tests for independence were used in analysis of the data. The results indicated that the mobility patterns of all three superintendent types are clearly related to superintendents' expectations for length of tenure. Realistic expectations of board members for the length of their superintendent's tenure also reflected a relationship to superintendents' mobility patterns which may lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Both board members and superintendents saw frequent superintendent turnover as having a negative effect on districts and stability in the superintendency as having a positive effect on districts. In regard to superintendent mobility and district volatility, the study results indicated that, in Illinois, stable districts outnumbered volatile districts by more than 3 to 1, and stable superintendents outnumbered mobile superintendents by more than 14 to 1. Much of the superintendent turnover that does occur is the result of either retirement or the mutual understanding that many superintendencies are stepping stones or training grounds for bigger and better things...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to identify factors {{which lead to}} the selection of females as public school superintendents. Previous studies in current literature appeared to concentrate on negative aspects of female exclusion in administration. Four categories encompassing possible influential factors were studied. Those categories were, (1) family influence, (2) role models, (3) motivation, and (4) personal characteristics. In order to compare female perception of these factors, a random <b>sample</b> of male <b>superintendents</b> was selected to determine whether perceptions were similar or {{different from those of}} the female superintendents. In the family influence category, the male and female sample population considered themselves most like their fathers in character and personality while a smaller percentage of male and female respondents indicated a similarity to their mothers. In the Role Model category, both male and female superintendents generally attributed their career decisions to the influence of family and non-family role models, sponsors, and mentors. In the Motivation category, both sexes appeared to be highly motivated by the desire to influence policy, and to better themselves. The majority of both sexes also agreed that they have not yet reached their ultimate career goals in educational administration. In the category of Personal Characteristics, there was little, if any, difference between male and female respondents. The male and female superintendents, as separate and combined groups, ranked four personal characteristics in the same order of importance: (1) qualifications, (2) administration experience, (3) knowledge, and (4) education. On the whole, there does not seem to be a significant difference in any of the categories; however, in specific items within each category a significant difference can be observed. Several conclusions can be drawn following this study. Because existing literature on positive influential factors is limited, this can be considered a new area. The researcher is hesitant to generalize from the conclusions about the entire public school superintendent population. The literature reveals several studies have been done to find personal characteristics common to male and female administrators. Finally, one might conclude that most of the population of superintendents may be found to have the same characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The Purpose and Procedures. The {{primary purpose}} of this study was twofold: (1) to {{determine}} the present evaluation policies and practices used by Nebraska Class II and III school districts, and (2) to determine the current attitudes of superintendents and board members toward the formal evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance. ^ The literature dealing with the assessment of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance was reviewed to ascertain the practices and procedures currently being used and recommended. ^ A questionnaire was developed to obtain the information about current practices and prevailing attitudes toward formal evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance in Nebraska Class II and III school districts. A random <b>sample</b> of 182 <b>superintendents</b> and 182 board chairpersons was surveyed. ^ Major Findings of the Study. (1) Most Class II and III school districts in Nebraska do not formally evaluate the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance. (2) A combination of techniques and instruments were usually used to formally evaluate the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance. (3) The results of the formal evaluation were presented annually to the superintendent in executive session using a combination of oral and written reports. (4) Most school districts did not have a board policy governing the evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance. (5) There was limited support for the involvement of persons other than board members in the evaluation of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance. ^ Conclusions. This study strongly indicated a growing interest in formally evaluating the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance. However, the actual practice was not keeping pace with the expressed interest. Both superintendents and board chairpersons desired more information about job descriptions, performance standards, and suitable evaluation instruments. ^ The evaluation of the superintendent rests primarily with the board of education. However, the input of other individuals may be desirable. ^ The complexity of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s position strongly suggests that a detailed job description is essential to a successful evaluation program and the evaluation system should include an assessment of the superintendent 2 ̆ 7 s performance in all areas of responsibility. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} and analyze the perceptions of prospective secondary teachers and practicing secondary teachers regarding statements of teacher expectations. The relationship between the rank order of preferred responses to each statement by prospective teachers, practicing teachers, and superintendents was also examined. ^ The population for this study included school superintendents, practicing secondary teachers, and prospective secondary teachers. From these populations, the <b>samples</b> included 30 <b>superintendents,</b> 300 prospective teachers, and 264 practicing teachers. ^ A survey instrument including statements of teacher expectations was developed to collect data from the three sample groups. A panel of experts was used to validate the statements; twenty-nine statements were valided for use on the survey instrument. With 2 ̆ 2 Agree 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Disagree 2 ̆ 2 as the response format of the instrument, feedback received from the superintendents was used to determine which survey statements had a preferred response. Statements with no preferred response were excluded from the data analysis procedures. ^ Individuals selected for participation were mailed a copy of the survey instrument. The participants were directed to respond with 2 ̆ 2 Agree 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Disagree 2 ̆ 2 to each statement and return the completed instrument. ^ Two data analysis procedures were used in this study. First, a chi square test of homogeneity was computed to determine the relationship between the perceptions of prospective teachers and the perceptions of practicing teachers regarding the teacher expectation statements. Secondly, Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s coefficient of rank correlation was used to determine the significance between the rank order of preferred responses to the statements by prospective teachers, practicing teachers, and superintendents. ^ For twenty of the twenty-four statements included in the data analysis procedures, the responses of practicing teachers and prospective teachers were similar. Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank correlation coefficient indicated a significant positive relationship between the rank order of preferred responses. The results showed prospective teachers, practicing teachers, and superintendents generally agreed in their perceptions of statements regarding teacher expectations. ...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the perceived potential positive and negative outcomes of selected dimensions of educational vouchers in Illinois by public education providers. A survey instrument was developed by the researcher after a thorough study of the literature. The survey instrument was divided into six categories of questions: organization of educational voucher programs, administration and finance of educational voucher programs, minority issues under an educational voucher program, school improvement issues, private sectarian and non-sectarian school participation in an educational voucher program, and teacher-administrator participation in an educational voucher program. The population for this study included all Illinois public school superintendents, school board presidents, and Illinois Education Association presidents employed or elected in Illinois school districts for the 1991 - 1992 school year. A random <b>sample</b> of 300 <b>superintendents,</b> 300 school board presidents, and 250 association presidents was drawn. Completed surveys were returned by 195 superintendents for a 65 % response rate; 54 school board presidents for an 18 % response rate; and 44 association presidents for an 18 % response rate. The analysis of variance statistic was utilized to compare the responses of respondents within their own group. In all instances, there was no significant difference in their responses when analyzed by 13 demographic variables. The responses of all groups were quite similar. Responses to 5 questions (24, 33, 34, 35, and 38) showed significant differences at the. 05 level of confidence utilizing the chi-square statistic, only 2 questions (35 and 38) were significant in that the responses of the respondents were extremely different. Question 35 dealt with contractual rights of teachers under an educational voucher program and question 38 focused on teacher's professional autonomy and decision-making role under an educational voucher program. Public school board superintendents, school board presidents, and Illinois Education Association presidents strongly oppose the implementation of an educational voucher program in Illinois. These public education providers uniformly believe that vouchers would not solve many of the problems now faced by schools. Issues of finance and administration, minority rights, school improvement, private school participation, and teacher-administrator participation were considered. In general, respondents reported that educational vouchers would not solve many of the problems facing schools as reflected by these issues...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose for}} this study was to develop {{criteria}} and procedures for the improvement of evaluation of principals in Nebraska Public Schools. This study focused on three major areas: (1) Providing some answers to the question 2 ̆ 2 How can school districts improve their program of principal evaluation? 2 ̆ 2 (2) Generating and verifying a set of recommended criteria and procedures for evaluation of a building principal. (3) Perceptions of Nebraska public school administrators concerning criteria and procedures for principal evaluation were examined and analyzed. ^ A survey instrument, refined after validation by a jury of experts, was submitted to a random <b>sample</b> of 88 <b>superintendents</b> and 117 building principals. ^ Selected findings from data analysis are (1) the 2 ̆ 2 organizational ability 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 leadership skills 2 ̆ 2 were viewed unanimously by 100 percent of the respondents as essential qualities by building administrators. On the other hand 11. 7 percent of the superintendents and six percent of the principals perceived that the college or university attended by the principal had any relevance as a criterion relating to the effectiveness of a building administrator. (2) The superintendents and principals (at least 69 percent of each group) perceived that the superintendent (or central office personnel), principals from the local district, or 2 ̆ 2 an administrative team 2 ̆ 2 should be responsible for the design of the evaluation plan. Also, the superintendents and principals (at least 94 percent of each group) perceived that the superintendent (or central office personnel) should be involved in evaluating building administrators, and that principals 2 ̆ 7 self-evaluation {{should be part of the}} process. (3) Four demographic variables [...] district size, age, level of formal training, and educational administrative experience [...] considered in this study were found not to relate to the perceptions of the Nebraska public school administrators concerning criteria and procedures for principal evaluation. (4) Significant differences in group means were found in the perceptions of superintendents of various school district sizes concerning the criteria for evaluating building principals. In viewing the procedures for principal evaluation no significant differences in group means were found in the perceptions of the respondents. ^ The conclusions and recommendations based on findings from the literature and related research and data analysis are reported in this study. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the leadership characteristics of male and female high school principals and superintendents. The study addressed the questions, 2 ̆ 2 How did male superintendents compare to female superintendents in leadership characteristics? 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 How did male high school principals compare to female high school principals in leadership characteristics? 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 How did superintendents and high school principals compare in leadership characteristics? 2 ̆ 2 ^ The review of literature revealed that research on leadership and management went through three phases [...] (1) identifying specific traits of great leaders, (2) identifying the behaviors that would guarantee leadership effectiveness, and (3) identification of what effective leaders do in different circumstances. The prominent areas of leadership research examined were traits of leaders, leader and follower roles, the situational approach, contingency models, transactional and transformational leadership, and charismatic leadership. Visionary leadership was closely examined. The positions of high school principal and superintendent were described. ^ Data were collected by sending the Leadership Behavior Questionnaire (Sashkin, 1996) to a stratified random <b>sample</b> of all <b>superintendents</b> and high school principals in public schools in the United States. The 2 ̆ 2 self 2 ̆ 2 questionnaire was completed by each participant and a similar 2 ̆ 2 other 2 ̆ 2 questionnaire was completed by three others selected by the participant. Items were identified as to the degree they were true about the participant as a leader. ^ Analysis of the data showed no statistically significant difference between self and other scores for superintendents. High school principals rated themselves significantly lower than others rated them, with male high school principals having the lowest of all the eight visionary leadership total self scores reported. Female self scores were significantly higher than male self scores. No significance was indicated in the comparison of others 2 ̆ 7 scores for males and females. Both male and female high school principals and superintendents rated themselves significantly lower than others rated them. Female principals and superintendents rated themselves significantly lower than others rated them. Six of the ten highest scored and six of the ten lowest scored behaviors for male and female superintendents and high school principals matched, indicating more similarities than differences. ...|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the job satisfaction of district superintendents in Newfoundland in relation to the role pressures to which they were exposed and in relation to selected personality characteristics. Nine hypotheses were developed for the study. [...] Expectations for the superintendency role were collected from board members, business managers, principals and superintendents. A standardized personality test and a job satisfaction questionnaire were also administered to each superintendent. These instruments provided the information used in the testing of the various hypotheses. [...] Items for the role questionnaire were classified under five task areas: (l) Superintendent-School Board Relations; (2) Improving Educational Opportunity; (3) Obtaining and Developing Personnel; (4) Providing and Maintaining Funds and Facilities; and (5) Maintaining Effective Community Relations. The subjects were asked to indicate the degree to which they expected the superintendent to assume responsibility for each item. [...] For each of the twenty superintendents studied, expectations were recorded from six role senders [...] two board members, the board's business manager and three principals. The responses of a particular superintendent were then compared with the expectations of his role senders and indexes of role pressure were computed from the response discrepancies. [...] Job satisfaction was expressed as a cumulative score over the 46 items on the questionnaire. Superintendents were asked to indicate their feelings of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with various aspects of their present position. [...] One-way analysis of variance was used in testing the first six hypotheses while the final three necessitated the use of two-way analysis of variance. No significant differences were established in the expressed job satisfaction of superintendents in relation to the degree of total role pressure or in relation to the degree of role pressure from subordinates. Superordinate pressure was directly and significantly related to the superintendents' job satisfaction [...] i. e., higher pressure correlated with higher satisfaction. [...] The findings also revealed that anxiety level, introversion/extraversion and subduedness/independence did not exert a significant influence on the job satisfaction experienced by the position incumbents. The postulated interactions between level of role pressure and these personality factors were not supported. [...] It was concluded that the job satisfaction of those Newfoundland district <b>superintendents</b> <b>sampled</b> is determined by, among other factors, their own unique personalities, the situations in which they work, their expectations of the role they are to perform and the role expectations of incumbents of counter positions. The assumption that any relationship between job satisfaction and role pressure is monotonically inverse was not supported by the results. It was suggested that the relationship might be curvilinear and influenced both by the level of pressure and, more importantly, the individual's threshold for coping with this pressure. [...] It was further suggested that a more extensive application of role theory to the analysis of hierarchically structured organizations such as educational districts might lead to a better understanding of the functioning of these organizations and of the determinants of the effectiveness and satisfaction of the individual office incumbents. A written job description was proposed as an initial attempt to remove the ambiguity which clouds certain areas of the superintendency role...|$|R
