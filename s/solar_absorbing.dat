50|$|Cooling load {{profiles}} for UFAD {{systems and}} overhead systems are different, mainly {{due to the}} thermal storage effect of the lighter-weight raised floor panels compared to the heavier mass of a structural floor slab. The mere presence of the raised floor reduces {{the ability of the}} slab to store heat, thereby producing for the system with a raised floor higher peak cooling loads compared to the system without a raised floor. In the OH system, particularly in perimeter zones, part of the incoming solar heat gain is stored in the floor slab during the day, thus reducing peak zone cooling loads, and released at night when the system is off. In a UFAD system, the presence of the raised flooring transforms the <b>solar</b> <b>absorbing</b> massive floor slab into a lighter weight material, leading to relatively higher peak zone cooling loads. A modeling study based on EnergyPlus simulations showed that, generally, UFAD has a peak cooling load 19% higher than an overhead cooling load and 22% and 37% of the total zone UFAD cooling load goes to the supply plenum in the perimeter and interior, respectively.|$|E

30|$|The most {{plausible}} {{approach to}} thermal concentration is angular selectivity--only allowing light {{to be absorbed}} within a small range of angles. The {{reason is that the}} apparent size of the sun is {{only a small fraction of}} the sky--approximately 1 part in 46, 200 [8]. Several researchers have considered this in the context of photovoltaics [9] and thermophotovoltaics [6, 10]. Metamaterials, such as photonic crystals, offer unprecedented control over wavelength- and angle-dependent absorptivity. In such systems, photon resonances can be tailored to target particular frequencies and conserved wavevectors to provide pinpoint control over thermal emission. Such an approach can be applied to create selective <b>solar</b> <b>absorbing</b> surfaces for applications such as solar thermal electricity, solar thermoelectrics, and solar thermophotovoltaics. The critical figure of merit is generally the fraction of incident solar radiation capable of being captured as heat.

For certain materials, vacuum techniques are unsuitable for processing. Additionally, vacuum-based processes present high capital costs associated with equipment, and slow processing times. Atmospheric pressure solution based techniques are attractive and lend themselves to high-throughput processing using methods such as graphic patterning or roll-to-roll processing.

By controlling the degree of molecular mixing, the solar selective coatings can be tailored to have the combined properties of high solar absorptance,, and low infrared emittance,. On orbit, these combined properties would simultaneously maximize the amount of solar energy captured by the coating and minimize the amount of thermal energy radiated. Mini-satellites equipped with solar collectors coated with these cermet coatings may utilize the captured heat energy to power a heat engine to generate electricity, or to power a thermal bus that directs heat to remote regions of the spacecraft. Early work in this area identified the theoretical boundary conditions needed to operate a Carnot cycle in space, including the need for a solar concentrator, a solar selective coating at the heat inlet of the engine, and a radiator. 1 A solar concentrator that can concentrate sunlight by a factor of 100 is ideal.
