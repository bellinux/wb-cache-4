5|$|Daspletosaurus {{belongs in}} the <b>subfamily</b> Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae, along with Tarbosaurus, Tyrannosaurus and Alioramus. Animals in this <b>subfamily</b> are {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus than to Albertosaurus and are known– with the {{exception}} of Alioramus– for their robust build with proportionally larger skulls and longer femora than in the other <b>subfamily,</b> the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{has been}} {{classified}} into numerous families and subfamilies; in 1858 British entomologist Frederick Smith {{placed it in}} the family Poneridae, <b>subfamily</b> Myrmicidae. It {{was placed in the}} <b>subfamily</b> Ponerinae by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. This classification was short-lived, as Mayr reclassified the genus into the <b>subfamily</b> Myrmicinae three years later. In 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the newly established <b>subfamily</b> Myrmeciidae, family Myrmicidae. Smith, who had originally established Myrmicidae as a family in 1851, reclassified it as a <b>subfamily</b> in 1858. He would again treat it as a family in 1871. Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel initially treated Poneridae as a <b>subfamily</b> and classified Myrmecia as one of its constituent genera, but later placed it in Ponerinae. William H. Ashemad placed the genus in the <b>subfamily</b> Myrmeciinae in 1905, but it was later placed back in Ponerinae in 1910 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler. In 1954, Myrmecia was placed into Myrmeciinae; this would be the last time the genus would be placed into a different ant <b>subfamily.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus is {{classified}} as a theropod in the <b>subfamily</b> Tyrannosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. Other members include Tyrannosaurus and the earlier Daspletosaurus, both from North America, and possibly the Mongolian genus Alioramus. Animals in this <b>subfamily</b> are {{more closely related to}} Tyrannosaurus than to Albertosaurus and are known for their robust build with proportionally larger skulls and longer femurs than in the other <b>subfamily,</b> the Albertosaurinae.|$|E
50|$|The Coronin {{family is}} {{composed}} of twelve <b>subfamilies</b> which include: seven <b>subfamilies</b> that fall under vertebrates and five <b>subfamilies</b> that are composed of meteozas, fungi and amoeba.|$|R
5000|$|Thompson (2010) redefined <b>subfamilies</b> in the Spiraxidae, moving Euglandininae and Streptostylinae {{to become}} <b>subfamilies</b> of Spiraxidae. According to their work, {{there are three}} <b>subfamilies</b> within the Spiraxidae: ...|$|R
25|$|Two {{groups of}} <b>subfamilies</b> seem to exist: one {{containing}} many American and some Eurasian {{species in the}} Lampyrinae and Photurinae; and one, predominantly Asian, made up from the other <b>subfamilies.</b> While the <b>subfamilies</b> as understood here are, in general, monophyletic, a few genera {{still need to be}} moved for the <b>subfamilies</b> to accurately represent the evolutionary relationships among the fireflies.|$|R
5|$|Circulatory system: The osmotic {{pressure}} of the hemolymph of Theodoxus fluviatilis is 95mOsm. That is much lower value than in marine snails in the <b>subfamily</b> Neritinae. The {{osmotic pressure}} and the composiotion of ionts of the hemolymph of the <b>subfamily</b> Neritininae (where does the Theodoxus belong to) {{is similar to the}} hemolymph of the land snail family Helicinidae.|$|E
5|$|Dipsadinae is a <b>subfamily</b> {{of snakes}} {{within the family}} Colubridae that {{includes}} cat-eyed snakes, night snakes, and black-striped snakes.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the African river martin {{was the sole}} member of its genus and <b>subfamily</b> until the {{discovery}} of the white-eyed river martin, Pseudochelidon eurystomina, by Thai ornithologist Kitti Thonglongya in 1968. Although some authorities follow Brooke in placing that species in a separate genus Eurochelidon due to its significant differences from the African species, it remains a member of the same <b>subfamily.</b> Genetic studies confirmed that the two river martins form a distinct clade from the typical swallows in the Hirundininae <b>subfamily.</b>|$|E
50|$|Six <b>subfamilies</b> of Crassulaceae were {{described}} by Berger in 1930: Crassuloideae, Kalanchiodeae, Cotyledonoideae, Sempervivoideae, Sedoideae, and Echeveroideae. Though various revisions since have proposed four, three, and two <b>subfamilies,</b> many botanists still use Berger's classification, {{although some of}} the <b>subfamilies</b> are polyphyletic.|$|R

5|$|The {{opening of}} the stylophore leads {{directly}} into the atrium in certain species in the families Vitrinidae, Parmacellidae, Helminthoglyptidae, Bradybaenidae, Urocyclidae, Ariophantidae, and Dyakiidae. The {{opening of the}} stylophore can instead lead to the penis, {{as is the case}} in some species of Aneitinae (a <b>subfamily</b> of Athoracophoridae), Sagdidae, Euconulidae, Gastrodontidae and Onchidiidae. Alternatively, it can lead to the vagina, as in the case in some species of Ariopeltinae (a <b>subfamily</b> of Oopeltidae), Ariolimacinae (a <b>subfamily</b> of Ariolimacidae), Philomycidae, other species within the Bradybaenidae, and also in the Hygromiidae, Helicidae and Dyakiidae.|$|E

5|$|For much of {{the twentieth}} century the number of {{recognized}} ant <b>subfamilies</b> varied from seven to ten, with the Aneuretinae, Cerapachyinae, Leptanillinae, Myrmeciinae and Pseudomyrmecinae being variously treated as separate <b>subfamilies</b> or (at different times) subsumed within Dolichoderinae, Ponerinae, Dorylinae, Ponerinae, and Myrmicinae, respectively. In 2014, Brady et al. synonymized the army ant <b>subfamilies</b> and their closest relatives under Dorylinae; this clade, the dorylomorph <b>subfamilies,</b> previously also contained Aenictinae, Aenictogitoninae, Cerapachyinae, Ecitoninae and Leptanilloidinae.|$|R
25|$|Ant nest beetles (<b>subfamily</b> Paussinae) or paussines, {{some members}} of which are known also as flanged bombardier beetles, are a large <b>subfamily</b> within the ground beetles (Carabidae).|$|E
25|$|The Malagasy civet was to {{be placed}} in the <b>subfamily</b> Hemigalinae with the banded palm civets and then in its own <b>subfamily,</b> Fossinae, because of {{similarities}} with others in the group pointed out by Gregory, but it is now classified {{as a member of the}} <b>subfamily</b> Euplerinae, after Pocock pointed out more similarities with that one.|$|E
25|$|Other classifications have {{included}} Monotropoideae as a <b>subfamily</b> of Hypopityaceae, by August W. Eichler (1875), {{and as a}} <b>subfamily</b> of Pyrolaceae by Carl Georg Oscar Drude (1889); both classifications united the monotropes with the pyrolids in a single group. Over the next century, authors have variously treated this group as a distinct family or as a <b>subfamily</b> of the Ericaceae, though the trend from Margaret W. Henderson (1919) onward was toward the latter <b>subfamily</b> classification, albeit, the influential Cronquist and Dahlgren systems continued to treat the group as the family Monotropaceae, separate from the Ericaceae.|$|E
50|$|Bandel (2007) have {{established}} two new <b>subfamilies.</b> But he recognizes Naticopsinae at family level as Naticopsidae with newly created <b>subfamilies</b> in it.|$|R
40|$|Phylogenetic {{relationships}} among the Braconidae were examined using homologous 16 S rDNA gene sequence data. Analyses recovered the few well-supported relationships evident in this family from morphological analyses, viz the monophyly of the microgastroid complex of <b>subfamilies,</b> the monophyly of the cyclostome complex of <b>subfamilies</b> (= braconoids), a sister-group relationship between the Alysiinae and Opiinae, and a close relationship between the Helconinae and Blacinae. With respect to the braconoid complex of <b>subfamilies,</b> a sister-group relationship was recovered between Aphidiinae and Mesostoinae, and a clade composed of Gnamptodontinae + Histeromerinae + Rhyssalinae + Aphidiinae + Mesostoinae was also recovered. The Doryctinae and Rogadinae sensu lato (s. l.) were generally not resolved as monophyletic. With respect to the helconoid complex of <b>subfamilies,</b> a sister-group relationship was recovered between Sigalphinae and Agathidinae, whereas Neoneurinae fell out among other helconoid <b>subfamilies.</b> Other {{relationships among}} the helconoid <b>subfamilies</b> were unclear from these analyses. With respect to the microgastroid complex of <b>subfamilies,</b> our data conform to morphological estimates, recovering ((Microgastrinae + Miracinae) + Cardiochilinae) + Cheloninae. The topology of our trees suggests that the cyclostome <b>subfamilies</b> are a natural derived group, inferring that endoparasitism (not ectoparasitism) is the ancestral state for the Braconidae, unless all of the ectoparasitic ancestors of the helconoid + microgastroid <b>subfamilies</b> are now extinct.

25|$|In 1999, the ichneumonids {{were divided}} into 39 <b>subfamilies,</b> whose names and {{definitions}} have varied considerably. The phylogenetic relationships between the <b>subfamilies</b> are still unclear.|$|R
25|$|Monotropoideae, {{sometimes}} referred to as monotropes, are a flowering plant <b>subfamily</b> in the family Ericaceae. Members of this <b>subfamily</b> are notable for their mycoheterotrophic and non-photosynthesizing or achlorophyllous characteristics.|$|E
25|$|A few {{authorities}} still {{include the}} family Riodinidae within the Lycaenidae. The monotypic former <b>subfamily</b> Styginae represented by Styx infernalis from the Peruvian Andes {{has been placed}} within the <b>subfamily</b> Euselasiinae of the family Riodinidae.|$|E
25|$|Maternal {{care is a}} {{well-documented}} presocial {{behavior among}} tessaratomids. Egg guarding by adult females were first observed in 1991 by S. Tachikawa among Japanese species of the genera Pygoplatys (<b>subfamily</b> Tessaratominae) and Erga (<b>subfamily</b> Oncomerinae).|$|E
50|$|Hamamelidaceae {{contains}} 27-30 genera and 80-140 species {{distributed among}} {{five to six}} <b>subfamilies.</b> The <b>subfamilies</b> are Exbucklandioideae, Rhodoleioideae, Mytilarioideae, Disanthoideae, Hamamelidoideae, and Altingioideae, which has been elevated to a family Altingiaceae in some recent treatments. Many of the <b>subfamilies</b> are monotypic {{and the majority of}} the species lie within the Hamamelidoideae, which has 22 genera.|$|R
50|$|The {{family was}} {{formerly}} larger, with <b>subfamilies</b> Laemophloeinae, Silvaninae, and Passandrinae (and some tenebrionoid genera mixed in), but recent revisions {{have raised the}} <b>subfamilies</b> to family status.|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, {{there were}} about twenty-five genera divided into five <b>subfamilies</b> (Scissurellinae, Anatominae, Sutilizoninae, Temnocinclinae, Larocheinae) [...] Three of these <b>subfamilies</b> were later updated to family level.|$|R
25|$|The trogons {{are split}} into three subfamilies, each {{reflecting}} {{one of these}} splits, Aplodermatinae is the African <b>subfamily</b> and contains a single genus, Apaloderma. Harpactinae is the Asian <b>subfamily</b> and contains two genera, Harpactes and Apalharpactes. Apalharpactes, consisting of two species in Java and Sumatra, has only recently been accepted as a separate genus from Harpactes. The remaining <b>subfamily,</b> the Neotropical Trogoninae, contains the remaining four genera, Trogon, Priotelus, Pharomachrus and Euptilotis.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species in}} the <b>subfamily</b> Epilachninae are herbivores, and can be very {{destructive}} agricultural pests (e.g., the Mexican bean beetle). Again, in the <b>subfamily</b> Coccinellinae, members of the tribe Halyziini and the genus Tythaspis are mycophagous.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of Monotropa {{is responsible for}} the majority of the range of this <b>subfamily,</b> with other genera not having the same global distribution. The center of biodiversity for this <b>subfamily</b> is found in temperate western North America, along the northern and central California and Pacific Northwest coast and montane areas as far east as the Sierra Nevada-Cascade cordillera. Seven of the 10 genera usually recognized as members of this <b>subfamily</b> (excluding Pyroleae) occur there, with 6 of these occurring only in that region.|$|E
50|$|Although Roewer {{established}} numerous <b>subfamilies</b> {{for this}} group, {{most of these}} are unsupported. There are at least five great groups, whose boundaries do not coincide with these <b>subfamilies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Of the <b>subfamilies</b> of Nymphalidae, {{only the}} Morphinae and Satyrinae are {{possibly}} paraphyletic, but these two <b>subfamilies</b> form a strongly supported clade with the Charaxinae as sister group.|$|R
