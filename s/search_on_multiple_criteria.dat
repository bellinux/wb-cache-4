40|$|Many {{scientific}} applications generate large spatio-temporal datasets. A common way {{of exploring}} these datasets {{is to identify}} and track regions of interest. Usu-ally these regions are defined as contiguous sets of points whose attributes satisfy some user defined conditions, e. g. high temperature regions in a combustion simulation. At each time step, the regions of interest may be identified by first searching for all points that satisfy the conditions and then grouping the points into connected regions. To speed up this process, the searching step may use a tree based in-dexing scheme, such as a kd-tree or an octree. However, these indices are efficient only if the searches are limited to one or {{a small number of}} selected attributes. Scien-tific datasets often contain hundreds of attributes and sci-entists frequently study these attributes in complex com-binations, e. g. finding regions of high temperature yet low shear rate and pressure. Bitmap indexing is an effi-cient method for <b>searching</b> <b>on</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>criteria</b> simulta-neously. We apply a bitmap compression scheme to re-duce the size of the indices. In addition, we show that the compressed bitmaps can be used efficiently to perform the region growing and the region tracking operations. Anal-yses show that our approach scales well and our tests on two datasets from simulation of the autoignition process show impressive performance. ...|$|R

50|$|Multi-criteria {{recommender}} systems (MCRS) can {{be defined}} as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon <b>multiple</b> <b>criteria.</b> Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion values, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information <b>on</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>criteria</b> that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems.

We present an exploratory experiment into how people combine criteria. A main issue is potential inequality of the criteria’s importance.

40|$|We {{approach}} {{the problem of}} finding plans based <b>on</b> <b>multiple</b> optimization <b>criteria</b> from what would seem an unlikely direction: find one valid plan as quickly as possible, then stream essentially all plans that improve on the current best plan, searching over incrementally longer length plans. This approach would be computationally prohibitive for most planners, but we describe how, by using a concise trace of the search space, the PEGG planning system can quickly generate most, if not all, plans on a given length planning graph. By augmenting PEGG with a branch and bound {{approach the}} system is able to stream parallel plans that come arbitrarily close to a userspecified preference <b>criteria</b> based <b>on</b> <b>multiple</b> factors. We demonstrate in preliminary experiments on cost-augmented logistics domains that the system can indeed find very high quality plans based <b>on</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>criteria</b> over reasonable runtimes.
