5|$|Wagga Wagga is {{upstream}} from the Riverina plain in the mid-catchment {{range of the}} Murrumbidgee River in an alluvial valley confined by low bedrock hills. Much of Wagga Wagga is on heavy clay soils in a large drainage basin with a small catchment discharge point. Groundwater therefore cannot leave easily, leading to Wagga Wagga having a problem with waterlogged soil and soil <b>salination.</b> Urban <b>salination</b> in Wagga Wagga is now {{the subject of a}} large multi-pronged approach to prevent further <b>salination</b> and reclaim salt-affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{small areas}} were left unrestored, {{in order to}} {{maintain}} a physical record of the previous restorations that had taken place, for example, an area left with overpainting and candle wax, and another area demonstrating the attempt to counteract <b>salination</b> with oil.|$|E
5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by <b>salination,</b> animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the nameplates on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
25|$|Other historians {{point to}} soil <b>salination</b> as the culprit in {{the decline in}} agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The {{indirect}} effects of waterlogging and soil <b>salination</b> occur {{directly on the}} land being irrigated. The ecological and socioeconomic consequences take longer to happen but can be more far-reaching.|$|E
25|$|Aquifers in surface {{irrigated}} {{areas in}} semi-arid zones with reuse of the unavoidable irrigation water losses percolating {{down into the}} underground by supplemental irrigation from wells {{run the risk of}} <b>salination.</b>|$|E
25|$|The ions {{responsible}} for <b>salination</b> are: sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and chlorine (Cl-). Salinity {{is estimated to}} affect about {{one third of the}} earth’s arable land. Soil salinity adversely affects crop metabolism and erosion usually follows.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{resources}} of Gaza include arable land—about {{a third of}} the strip is irrigated. Recently, natural gas was discovered. Environmental problems include desertification; <b>salination</b> of fresh water; water-borne disease; soil degradation; lack of adequate sewage treatment; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources. The Gaza Strip is largely dependent on water from Wadi Gaza, which also supplies Israel.|$|E
25|$|Use of humic acids {{may prevent}} excess <b>salination,</b> {{especially}} given excessive irrigation. Humic acids can fix both anions and cations and eliminate them from root zones. Planting species that can tolerate saline conditions to produce surface cover can preserve soil salinity can be reduced. Salt-tolerant plants include saltbush, a plant found {{in much of}} North America and in the Mediterranean regions of Europe.|$|E
25|$|The community, {{which was}} founded on the right margin of the Arade River, and {{oriented}} towards the sea, is inserted in a region whose geography and physical characteristics justify a seafaring economy. Its maritime economy allowed the development of industries oriented towards <b>salination</b> of fish, the open-water fishing industry, conservation and canning, the construction of ships and transport. Further, the Arade basin permitted rural commerce associated with cultivation of carob, fig, almonds and the saw-milling/forestry industry (including cork), among others.|$|E
25|$|According to the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (previously South Pacific Regional Environment Programme), {{two small}} {{uninhabited}} Kiribati islets, Tebua Tarawa and Abanuea, disappeared underwater in 1999. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that sea levels will rise by about 50cm (20in) by 2100 {{due to global}} warming and a further rise would be inevitable. It is thus likely that within a century the nation's arable land will become subject to increased soil <b>salination</b> and will be largely submerged.|$|E
25|$|Salinity {{occurs on}} {{drylands}} from overirrigation and {{in areas with}} shallow saline water tables. Over-irrigation deposits salts in upper soil layers as a byproduct of soil infiltration; irrigation merely increases the rate of salt deposition. The best-known case of shallow saline water table capillary action occurred in Egypt after the 1970 construction of the Aswan Dam. The change in the groundwater level led to high salt concentrations in the water table. The continuous high level of the water table led to soil <b>salination.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since cotton is {{somewhat}} salt and drought tolerant, {{this makes it}} an attractive crop for arid and semiarid regions. As water resources get tighter around the world, economies that rely on it face difficulties and conflict, as well as potential environmental problems. For example, improper cropping and irrigation practices have led to desertification in areas of Uzbekistan, where cotton is a major export. In {{the days of the}} Soviet Union, the Aral Sea was tapped for agricultural irrigation, largely of cotton, and now <b>salination</b> is widespread.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the young}} {{geological}} age of the islands and atolls and high level of soil <b>salination</b> the flora of Kiribati is relatively poor. It contains about 83 indigenous and 306 introduced plants on Gilbert Islands, whereas the corresponding numbers for Line and Phoenix Islands are 67 and 283. None of these species are endemic, and {{about half of the}} indigenous ones have a limited distribution and became endangered or nearly extinct due to human activities such as phosphate mining. Coconut and pandanus palms and breadfruit trees are most common wild plants, whereas the five most cultivated crops are Chinese cabbage, pumpkin, tomato, watermelon and cucumber. Over eighty percent of the population participates in either farming or fishing.|$|E
25|$|Other criticisms {{center around}} the broader {{environmental}} impact of irrigation on both the ecosystem around the vineyard {{as well as the}} added strain on global water resources. While advances in drip irrigation has reduced the amount of waste water produced by irrigation, the irrigation of substantial tracts of land in areas like the San Joaquin Valley in California and the Murray-Darling Basin of Australia requires massive amounts of water from dwindling supplies. In Australia, the centuries-old practice of flood irrigation used in places like the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area caused severe environmental damages from water-logging, increase <b>salination</b> and raising the water tables. In 2000, the Australian government invested over A$3.6 million into research on how to minimize the damage caused by extensive irrigation. In 2007, concerns about ecological damage to the Russian River caused government officials in California to take similar measures to cut back water supplies and promote more efficient irrigation practices.|$|E
25|$|During glaciation, {{water was}} taken from the oceans to form the ice at high latitudes, thus global sea level dropped by about 110 meters, exposing the {{continental}} shelves and forming land-bridges between land-masses for animals to migrate. During deglaciation, the melted ice-water returned to the oceans, causing sea level to rise. This process can cause sudden shifts in coastlines and hydration systems resulting in newly submerged lands, emerging lands, collapsed ice dams resulting in <b>salination</b> of lakes, new ice dams creating vast areas of freshwater, and a general alteration in regional weather patterns on a large but temporary scale. It can even cause temporary reglaciation. This type of chaotic pattern of rapidly changing land, ice, saltwater and freshwater has been proposed as the likely model for the Baltic and Scandinavian regions, as well as much of central North America {{at the end of the}} last glacial maximum, with the present-day coastlines only being achieved in the last few millennia of prehistory. Also, the effect of elevation on Scandinavia submerged a vast continental plain that had existed under much of what is now the North Sea, connecting the British Isles to Continental Europe.|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} chapter, [...] "Fools' Paradise", {{the rise and}} fall of two civilisations are examined: Easter Island and Sumer. Both flourished, but {{collapsed}} as a result of resource depletion; both were able to visually see their land being eroded but were unwilling to reform. On Easter Island logging, in order to erect statues and build boats, destroyed their ecosystem and led to wars over the last planks of wood on the island. In Sumer, a large irrigation system, as well as over-grazing, land clearing, and lime-burning led to desertification and soil <b>salination.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Wetlands in El Salvador serve many crucial water {{management}} {{services such as}} flood control, groundwater replenishment, natural water purification, and are also productive fish and shrimp ecosystems. [...] The wetlands within the Bahía de Jiquilisco for example are primarily mangrove forests that serve to protect against tidal surges when hurricanes and tropical storms strike. Without these forests, tidal surges {{would lead to the}} <b>salination</b> of fresh groundwater further inland which would contaminate supplies for domestic and agricultural uses.|$|E
2500|$|The Gaza Strip has a hot {{semi-arid}} climate, {{with warm}} winters during which practically all the annual rainfall occurs, and dry, hot summers. Despite the dryness, humidity is high throughout the year. Annual rainfall {{is higher than}} in any other part of Egypt at around , but almost all of this falls between November and February. The terrain is flat or rolling, with dunes near the coast. The highest point is Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Auda), at [...] above sea level. Environmental problems include desertification; <b>salination</b> of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne diseases; soil degradation; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources.|$|E
2500|$|Radioactive or toxic {{chemical}} sites associated with its former defense industries and test ranges are {{found throughout the}} country and pose health risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution is severe in some cities; because the two main rivers which flowed into the Aral Sea have been diverted for irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a harmful layer of chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then picked up by the wind and blown into noxious dust storms; pollution in the Caspian Sea; soil pollution from overuse of agricultural chemicals and <b>salination</b> from poor infrastructure and wasteful irrigation practices ...|$|E
2500|$|Eucalypts draw a {{tremendous}} amount of water from the soil through the process of transpiration. They have been planted (or re-planted) in some places to lower the water table and reduce soil <b>salination.</b> Eucalypts have also been used as a way of reducing malaria by draining the soil in Algeria, Lebanon, Sicily, elsewhere in Europe, in Caucasus (Western Georgia), and California. Drainage removes swamps which provide a habitat for mosquito larvae, but can also destroy ecologically productive areas. This drainage {{is not limited to the}} soil surface, because the eucalyptus roots are up to [...] in length and can, depending on the location, even reach the phreatic zone.|$|E

50|$|The {{potential}} for soil <b>salination</b> {{is a large}} risk when choosing the placement of water wells. Soil <b>salination</b> is caused when the water table of the soil drops over time and salt begins to accumulate. In turn, the increased amount of salt begins to dry the soil out. This is a very detrimental problem because the increased level of salt in the soil can result in the degradation of soil and can be very harmful to vegetation.|$|E
