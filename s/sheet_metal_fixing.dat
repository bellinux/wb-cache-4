Blakely chose a somewhat simpler design using 14-gauge metal tubing with some boxing-in around the engine compartment. This frame was more three-dimensional than the frame used on the company's larger Bearcat and Bernardi models, and presumably stiffer. It did not, however, have <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>fixed</b> directly to frame members, a stiffening approach used around the transmission tunnel and passenger area in some designs similar to the Lotus Seven. Instead, a separate fiberglass body was mounted on the pre-fabricated chassis, bolting into place at several points. The Pinto donor's lower front A-arms {{were used in the}} front suspension, with factory-supplied upper A-arms. The rear suspension was built by cutting the donor's leaf springs in half, and mounting one left half and one right half behind the cab to suspend and locate the solid rear axle.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{introduce}} a new incremental sheet metal-forming process. By moving a hammering tool over a <b>sheet</b> of <b>metal</b> <b>fixed</b> in a frame, a three-dimensional workpiece can be produced without using any special die plate. Design/methodology/approach: This paper describes the exact procedure of the new process and the advantages in comparison with other flexible conventional and incremental forming processes. The hammering process in particular, will be considered with respect to material behavior and effects on the industrial robot. In addition, a special path generation for the incremental forming process and multiple robot tools with different drives constructed for the incremental forming process is shown. Findings: During the research {{it was discovered that}} complex geometries can be produced without any die plate and that a hammering tool with a mechanical eccentric should be used for the incremental forming process. Practical implications: As the forces on the handling equipment are very low compared with other forming processes, a common industrial robot can be used to move the hammering tool. Thus <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> parts can be produced with cost-effective equipment. Mainly, small and medium-sized enterprises can benefit from this new technology.

An adhesive that is thermally activatable at 20 degrees C is used as adhesive, which is finally hardened by heating after deforming. The components are fixed to each other where a minimum relative movement takes place during deforming. The adhesive surface of the components is coated with the adhesive before joining. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method comprises joining two <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> components {{with one another}} under interposition of an adhesive layer on two adhesive surfaces that lie on each other and then deforming such as deep-drawing, bending or pressing the fabricated composite body. An adhesive that is thermally activatable at 20 degrees C is used as adhesive, which is finally hardened by heating after deforming. The components are fixed to each other where a minimum relative movement takes place during deforming. The adhesive surface of the components is coated with the adhesive before joining. The adhesive is solidified but not hardened before the joining, so that the free surface of the component does not exhibit adhesive properties. The adhesive layer is made of adhesive film {{in the form of}} a glass fiber non-woven soaked with the adhesive. The adhesive is a two-component adhesive consisting of epoxide resin component and a hardener. A liquid mixture of the components is introduced on the adhesive surface of the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> components at a mixing temperature, which is less than the reaction temperature of the components and the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> components are joined and fixed with cooled adhesive. The adhesive is aqueous epoxide resin dispersion with hardeners, blocked polyurethane dispersion and/or dual-cure-system. The <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> components are <b>fixed</b> to each other in another way by using a welding point than over the adhesive layer before the plastic deformation, and are fixed to each other by locally partially hardening of the adhesive layer. The adhesive softens at a softening temperature, which is lower than the reaction temperature, and has a melt-adhesive property in the softened condition. The fixing step takes place by locally or completely heating over the softening temperature. The <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> component is initially punched and then the adhesive surface of the punched component is coated with the thermally activatable adhesive. The <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> component consists of a semi-finished product coated with the thermally activatable adhesive. The semi-finished product is a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> wound to a coil. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are included for: (1) a method for coating an adhesive surface of a semi-finished product with a thermally activatable adhesive; (2) a device for coating an adhesive surface of a semi-finished product with a thermally activatable adhesive; (3) a semi-finished product; and (4) a <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> component.
