50|$|Recovering {{from her}} mission on Mars, Sparta finds herself {{the guest of}} the <b>Space</b> <b>Board.</b> But {{relaxation}} is short-lived as she sets out on an interplanetary investigation — of the <b>Space</b> <b>Board</b> itself! Members of the Free Spirit, a religious cult intending {{to gain control of}} all the worlds of our galaxy, have infiltrated the <b>Space</b> <b>Board.</b> As the date of the manned mission into the clouds of Jupiter approaches, Sparta's suspicions grow. She is certain the mission has fallen {{into the hands of the}} cult, and she is determined to stop it.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the postal}} {{function}} was removed in 1983, the building functions {{only as a}} courthouse, with several of the historic courtrooms largely intact on the third floor. Although additional courtrooms have been added, all have been executed {{with a high level}} of craftsmanship, featuring solid wood full-height paneling and carved wood details. Many <b>secondary</b> <b>spaces</b> throughout the building have been rehabilitated and renovated over the years, but were carefully fitted with replications of the original wood details: solid wood base, chairrail, window sills and stools, door casings, and paneled doors. In many cases the original materials were cleaned or refinished and reinstalled. In many of the <b>secondary</b> <b>spaces</b> and hallways, modern dropped ceilings and fluorescent lighting have been added, concealing the original plaster ceiling.|$|R

30|$|<b>Secondary</b> storage <b>spaces</b> {{with very}} complex {{geometries}} are well developed in Ordovician carbonate reservoirs in the Tarim Basin, which {{is taken as}} a study case in this paper. It is still not clear how the <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> shape influences the P- & S-wave velocities (or elastic properties) in complex carbonate reservoirs. In this paper, three classical rock physics models (Wyllie timeaverage equation, Gassmann equation and the Kuster-Toksöz model) are comparably analyzed for their construction principles and actual velocity prediction results, aiming at determining the most favourable rock physics model to consider the influence of <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> shape. Then relationships between the P- & S-wave velocities in carbonate reservoirs and geometric shapes of <b>secondary</b> storage <b>spaces</b> are discussed from different aspects based on actual well data by employing the favourable rock physics model. To explain the influence of <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> shape on VP-VS relationship, it is analyzed for the differences of S-wave velocities between derived from common empirical relationships (including Castagna’s mud rock line and Greenberg-Castagna VP-VS relationship) and predicted by the rock physics model. We advocate that VP-VS relationship for complex carbonate reservoirs should be built for different storage space types. For the carbonate reservoirs in the Tarim Basin, the VP-VS relationships for f ractured, fractured-cavernous, and fractured-hole-vuggy reservoirs are respectively built {{on the basis of}} velocity prediction and <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> type determination. Through the discussion above, it is expected that the velocity prediction and the VP-VS relationships for complex carbonate reservoirs should fully consider the influence of <b>secondary</b> storage <b>space</b> shape, thus providing more reasonable constraints for prestack inversion, further building a foundation for realizing carbonate reservoir prediction and fluid prediction.|$|R
