5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{a fairly}} wide variety of animal species. Several hoofed mammals call the {{mountain}} home: mountain goats, Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer. Large carnivores include cougar, black bear, coyote, bobcat, and the Cascade mountain fox, an endemic subspecies of the red fox. There have also been sightings of wolverine and unconfirmed reports of wolves. Many small mammals also make Adams their home. <b>Squirrels</b> and chipmunks are numerous throughout the forest. Douglas <b>squirrels,</b> least chipmunks, and Townsend's chipmunks live throughout the forest with golden-mantled ground <b>squirrels</b> and California ground <b>squirrels</b> occupying drier areas as well. These <b>squirrels</b> are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive pine martens that also call Adams their home. Hoary marmots and pikas make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive snowshoe hare lives throughout the forest.|$|E
5|$|Flying <b>squirrels</b> {{and sugar}} gliders are much alike in their body plans with gliding wings {{stretched}} between their limbs, but flying <b>squirrels</b> are placental mammals while sugar gliders are marsupials, widely separated within the mammal lineage.|$|E
5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat. In the Rocky Mountains, red <b>squirrels</b> and crossbills (seed-eating birds) compete for seeds of the {{lodgepole}} pine. The <b>squirrels</b> get at pine seeds by gnawing through the cone scales, whereas the crossbills get at the seeds by extracting them with their unusual crossed mandibles. In areas where there are <b>squirrels,</b> the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for <b>squirrels</b> to get at the seeds. Conversely, where there are crossbills but no <b>squirrels,</b> the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds. The lodgepole's cones are in an evolutionary arms race with the two kinds of herbivore.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the most}} social of rodents are the ground <b>squirrels,</b> which {{typically}} form colonies based on female kinship, with males dispersing after weaning and becoming nomadic as adults. Cooperation in ground <b>squirrels</b> varies between species and typically includes making alarm calls, defending territories, sharing food, protecting nesting areas, and preventing infanticide. The {{black-tailed prairie dog}} forms large towns that may cover many hectares. The burrows do not interconnect, but are excavated and occupied by territorial family groups known as coteries. A coterie often consists of an adult male, three or four adult females, several nonbreeding yearlings, and the current year's offspring. Individuals within coteries are friendly with each other, but hostile towards outsiders.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs {{are used}} in the cuisine of Cuzco, Peru, in dishes such as cuy al horno, baked guinea pig. The {{traditional}} Andean stove, known as a qoncha or a fogón, is made from mud and clay reinforced with straw and hair from animals such as guinea pigs. In Peru, there are at any time 20 million domestic guinea pigs, which annually produce 64 million edible carcasses. This animal is an excellent food source since the flesh is 19% protein. In the United States, mostly <b>squirrels,</b> but also muskrats, porcupines, and ground hogs are eaten by humans. The Navajo people ate prairie dog baked in mud, while the Paiute ate gophers, <b>squirrels,</b> and rats.|$|E

5|$|Kutzer {{points out}} Timmy {{and his wife}} wear clothes, but the other <b>squirrels</b> and the bear do not. There is no {{apparent}} reason for this differentiation. She admits {{that this may be}} Potter's attempt to separate her anthropomorphized animals from her natural ones, but she believes the attempt fails on both narrative and artistic grounds. Logically, she argues, all the <b>squirrels</b> should wear (or not wear) clothes because they all live and behave in a natural manner: Timmy and Goody inhabit a nest in a tree (not a comfortable little house somewhere), and all the <b>squirrels</b> gather nuts for the coming winter. Except for Timmy having a wife, there is no clear distinction between natural and personified squirrel nature. In another stumbling block to logic, Timmy's red jacket appears then disappears then reappears in the illustrations with no basis either in the plot or Timmy's character, but apparently in Potter's personal need for a splash of colour here and there. In this case, Potter has allowed an external force to shape the tale rather than letting the tale find its own shape.|$|E

5|$|Red maple is a {{good choice}} of a tree for urban areas when there is ample room for its root system. Forming an {{association}} with Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi can help A. rubrum grow along city streets. It is more tolerant of pollution and road salt than Sugar Maples, although the tree's fall foliage is not as vibrant in this environment. Like several other maples, its low root system can be invasive and it makes a poor choice for plantings near paving. It attracts <b>squirrels,</b> who eat its buds in the early spring, although <b>squirrels</b> prefer the larger buds of the silver maple.|$|E
500|$|The Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey is {{a member}} of the family Cebidae, the family of New World monkeys {{containing}} <b>squirrel</b> monkeys, capuchin monkeys, tamarins and marmosets. Within the family Cebidae, it {{is a member}} of the subfamily Saimiriinae, the subfamily containing <b>squirrel</b> monkeys. It is one of five recognized species of <b>squirrel</b> monkey, and the only species occurring outside South America. The Central American <b>Squirrel</b> Monkey is placed in genus Saimiri (Voigt, 1831) along with all the other <b>squirrel</b> monkey species. Among the <b>squirrel</b> monkeys, the Central American <b>squirrel</b> monkey is most closely related to the common <b>squirrel</b> monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and the bare-eared <b>squirrel</b> monkey (Saimiri ustus) and these three species form the S. sciureus species group.
