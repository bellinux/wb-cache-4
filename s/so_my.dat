So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. <b>So</b> <b>my</b> involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E

500|$|Although Bond's {{life as a}} {{performer}} in the theatre had ended at age 44, she occasionally gave charity concerts thereafter. [...] Unlike Bond's first marriage, her second was a happy one. Initially reluctant to leave London, Bond reported, [...] "We entertained a good deal, and gave hunt lunches and shooting parties of our own, <b>so</b> <b>my</b> time was well filled up, and I missed London less than I could have believed." [...] She founded and directed the Newark Amateur Dramatic Society, an amateur dramatic club, whose performances supported local charities. [...] The couple also often visited London and did some travelling abroad.|$|E

500|$|Some of Soeman's {{characters}} are not identified as indigenous Indonesians, including Nona (her name being common among the ethnic Chinese) and Sir Joon (a Eurasian). This was, in part, {{a bid to}} attract readers of different cultural backgrounds, {{as well as those}} living in Singapore. It also served to soften Soeman's criticism. In an interview, Soeman recalled: [...] "My stories always challenged the stiff adat. So to show this, my characters were always outsiders, who could be better accepted if they went against adat. That was my strategy, as an author, <b>so</b> <b>my</b> stories could be accepted." ...|$|E

In an interview with Sherwin, Hughes stated, [...] "KMFDM have cornered the market in industrial post-modern angst and <b>so</b> <b>my</b> work reflects that." [...] Hughes said that initially he based {{his work on the}} music, which caused [...] "artistic block". Konietzko gave him more freedom to use whatever themes he wished, resulting in the cover to Money, which Hughes said [...] "was based upon my disillusionment with the street lifestyle I was experiencing at the time, and the art carries with it the implication that no matter what temptation lies in your path, you still gotta pay!" ...|$|E
500|$|In mid-September, a video {{surfaced}} of Romney speaking {{before a}} group of supporters in which he stated that 47percent of the nation pays no income tax, are dependent on the federal government, see themselves as victims, and will support President Obama unconditionally. Romney went on to say: [...] "And <b>so</b> <b>my</b> job is {{not to worry about}} those people. I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." [...] After facing criticism about the tone and accuracy of these comments, he at first characterized them as [...] "inelegantly stated", then {{a couple of weeks later}} commented: [...] "I said something that's just completely wrong."

No sequel was originally planned due to the game's poor sales; Iwata already started development on another game when the North American release Blaster Master sold well. The game's impact led Sunsoft to develop titles with similar top-down gameplay like [...] and Fester's Quest, the latter of whose main designer had helped design the characters for Blaster Master. Iwata incorporated many of the gameplay elements in the remake , which his goal was [...] "for players to recall and think back upon (the original) Blaster Master, and <b>so</b> <b>my</b> goal {{was to find a}} way to evoke that through this game." ...|$|E
500|$|Papa {{was born}} on March 10, 1987 to Kwaku and Gertrude Oppong and {{was brought up in}} the Pickering, Ontario area. Both of his parents were natives of Ghana in West Africa, and Papa began playing soccer. He could not skate, meaning he {{struggled}} with ice hockey, Canada's most popular sport. Oppong said, [...] "Soccer is really popular in Africa, <b>so</b> <b>my</b> dad got me into soccer. Basketball is more of my love. I was sitting down and watching Michael Jordan and Kobe and all of those guys when I was younger, and I had more of a passion for it." [...] He learned the basics of basketball with the Ontario Basketball's Scarborough, Ontario club team. Oppong attended Blessed Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary School in Scarborough. He helped the team win the provincial Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations (OFSAA) championship. He was also named Ontario Mr. Basketball.|$|E
500|$|... "From This Moment On" [...] {{was written}} during a soccer game in Italy. Twain once explained, “We were in Italy at a soccer game. My husband loves sports. I don’t know {{the game that}} well, <b>so</b> <b>my</b> mind drifted and I started writing.” Initially, Twain thought that [...] "From This Moment On" [...] would be perfect for singer Celine Dion; however, as Twain and Lange {{developed}} the song, they concluded that it would work best as a duet. While their first choice for the duet was Elton John, they chose country singer Bryan White. Twain later described White as [...] "the best male voice in country music. Beyond country music! He's an excellent singer. So {{he needed to be}} on this record, because the song soars. It demands that. It demands dynamics." [...] White explained that, by the time he went to the recording, the song was mostly finalized, and described it as 'extremely challenging' vocally.|$|E

500|$|In his 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush renewed {{his pledge}} {{to work toward}} diminished {{reliance}} on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production. Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling. However, the move was largely symbolic because {{there was still a}} federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, [...] "This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress." [...] Bush had said in June 2008, [...] "In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. <b>So</b> <b>my</b> administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production." ...|$|E
500|$|Initial first-run {{pressings}} of {{the international}} version of the Come On Over album during March 1998 featured White on the song, while subsequent pressings began featuring the song as a solo recording. [...] In early 1998, Mercury executives were informed that White {{would be unable to}} promote the song alongside Twain; therefore, Twain had to return to the studio to re-record White's parts on her own. According to White's spokesman at Asylum Records, [...] "We've certainly heard knocking on our door about [...] "From This Moment On" [...] being too contemporary for Bryan's sake; therefore, it is fine if they {{want to go to the}} Top 40 without him." [...] White later claimed that he had no hard feelings towards Twain for him being excluded from the international version of the song, stating, [...] "They're releasing this song as a pop record, and I'm not a pop artist, <b>so</b> <b>my</b> feelings aren't hurt." ...|$|E

[...] PopMatters's Evan Sawdey describes Lorde's vocals as being [...] "unique and powerfully intriguing". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard praises her vocals for being [...] "dynamic, smoky and restrained". Lester characterises Lorde's vocals as [...] "sweet, sultry and sour", while James Lachno from The Daily Telegraph details the singer's voice as [...] "twitchy electro". In an article for The A.V. Club, Kevin McFarland writes that [...] " [...] voice is the alpha and omega of her talent. She has the presence and vocal development of singers more than twice her age. Her voice isn't booming or overpowering, but rather mystifying and alluring, both floating on its own {{in a sea of}} reverb and digital blips and awash in an army of chorused overdubs." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Wood {{suggests}} in In Search of Shakespeare that sonnet 33 {{might have}} nothing to do with the so-called Fair Youth sonnets, that it alludes to the death of the poet's son, Hamnet in 1596 at age 11, and that there is an implied pun on [...] "sun" [...] and [...] "son": [...] "Even <b>so</b> <b>my</b> sun one early morn did shine, with all triumphant splendour on my brow; but out, alack, he was but one hour mine, the region cloud hath mask'd him from me now". If this is the case the link of sonnet 33 with sonnet 34, sonnet 35 and sonnet 36 would be entirely coincidental and spurious. Note that in sonnet 33 (1) there is no overt [...] "you" [...] or [...] "thou" [...] (contrary to most of the sonnets and in particular to sonnets 34, 35 and 36 which all three use [...] "thou") and (2) there is no mention of the supposed [...] "fault" [...] committed by the addressee towards the poet (as in sonnets 34 and 35) nor of the supposed [...] "guilt" [...] borne by the poet which may affect the addressee's reputation (as in sonnet 36).|$|E
500|$|When Tankersley was four, {{her father}} died by suicide, {{believed}} to be partly attributed to his defeat for renomination in 1924. [...] Her mother remarried in 1932 to Albert Gallatin Simms, a congressman from New Mexico, lawyer, and banker. Tankersley spent part of her childhood on her mother's Rock River dairy farm in Byron, Illinois, and later moved to the Southwest {{with her mother and}} stepfather, living at a ranch owned by Simms in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at first, and then moving in 1937 to the Trinchera Ranch, a [...] property in Colorado that her mother had purchased. Tankersley attended a boarding school in Virginia and spent summers in the West. Her love of horses in general and the Arabian horse in particular came from those years: [...] "Right away, my stepfather bought me a cow pony, and I wore it out... <b>So</b> <b>my</b> mother got me a [...] Arabian that I couldn't wear out." [...] She also showed horses on the East Coast in the 1930s. Her interest in Arabian horses led her to meet several major breeders of the time, including Jimmie Dean of Traveler's Rest, Roger Selby, W.R. Brown and Carl Raswan.|$|E
500|$|From the outset, Dallas was {{centered}} around {{the lives of the}} wealthy Ewing family who lived in Dallas, Texas. Once the show became a success after the initial run as a five-episode miniseries, the producers decided to expand the roles of certain characters. They introduced the parents of [...] Lucy Ewing (Charlene Tilton), who had not been shown on-screen until that point. Actress Joan Van Ark was contacted by series creator David Jacobs about joining the show. Her husband, John Marshall, convinced her to take the opportunity. In an interview for an episode of Celebrity Weddings, Van Ark said: [...] "At the time Dallas came up, I was doing two different jobs. They offered me to join Dallas, which would be shot in Dallas, Texas at Southfork. I read the script and it was buzzed about already...they were saying this was the hot new show.

500|$|... "Never Too Far" [...] is a mid-tempo ballad. The {{song was}} written and {{produced}} by Carey and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis; {{it was released}} as the second single from her first soundtrack album, Glitter (2001). It incorporates music from several musical instruments, including the piano, guitar and organ. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the song is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 62 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D3 to the high-note of Ab5. The song's chorus has a basic chord progression of Gsus2–G–G/F–Em7–G/D–C-G/B–Am7. Described as an [...] "adult-contemporary, slow-jam love song", the song's lyrics read [...] "Too painful to talk about it, so I hold it in / <b>So</b> <b>my</b> heart can mend and be brave enough to love again", speaking of emotions felt by the protagonist in the film. [...] "Never Too Far" [...] features [...] "a bed of synthesized strings, gentle drums and Spanish-style guitar" [...] as its primary instrumentation, and incorporates violin and keyboard notes prior to the first verse. According to Chuck Taylor from Billboard, Carey sings the lyrics with [...] "appreciable subtlety, gliding effortlessly" [...] through the song. It ends with a 15-second note that would [...] "evoke a satisfied sigh".|$|E

She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song.

It's what I've always done and what I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. <b>So</b> <b>my</b> label was amazing because they really let me have my hands in there.
