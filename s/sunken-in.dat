The eyes {{of the people of the}} School of Athens are <b>sunken-in</b> using this technique which causes the eyes to seem deeper and more pensive. Michelangelo used this technique as part of his trademark 'outlining' of his central figures within his frescoes.|$|E
2500|$|As stated, the {{position}} of maximal closure {{in the presence of}} teeth is referred to as maximum intercuspation, and the vertical jaw relationship in this position {{is referred to as the}} vertical dimension of occlusion. [...] With the loss of teeth, there is a decrease in this vertical dimension, as the mouth is allowed to overclose when there are no teeth present to block further upward movement of the mandible towards the maxilla. [...] This may contribute, as explained above, to a <b>sunken-in</b> appearance of the cheeks, because there is now [...] "too much" [...] cheek than is needed to extend from the maxilla to the mandible when in an overclosed position. [...] If this situation is left untreated for many years, the muscles and tendons of the mandible and the TMJ may manifest with altered tone and elasticity.|$|E
