2500|$|Abiogenic (formed by {{inorganic}} means) {{sources of}} oil have been found, {{but never in}} commercially profitable amounts.

2500|$|Officials in Bell {{paid more}} than [...] double the {{appraised}} value for a parcel of land that was never redeveloped.

The Los Angeles Times reported that Rizzo and former General Services Manager Eric Eggena negotiated its purchase for $1.35 million, despite its appraisal of $612,000. [...] "This is a real estate deal that ran amok", <b>said</b> <b>Larry</b> Kosmont, a Los Angeles real estate consultant. [...] "Essentially, they cooked the books on this".|$|E

2500|$|In many cases, sketch {{dialogue}} was {{not even}} written down, but simply indicated by describing a scene, as in, [...] "Sid does man coming home from business mad." [...] Sometimes, <b>said</b> <b>Larry</b> Gelbart, it was [...] "organized chaos," [...] and when watching the writers create from offstage, felt, [...] "...it was a religious experience." [...] To Mel Brooks, [...] "it was a zoo. Everyone pitched lines at Sid. Jokes would be changed fifty times." [...] Naturally there were some explosive episodes: [...] "Mr. Caesar once dangled a terrified Mr. Brooks from an 18th-story window until colleagues restrained him. With one punch, he knocked out a horse that had thrown his wife off its back, a scene that Mr. Brooks replayed in his movie Blazing Saddles." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruce Merrill, {{professor}} {{of media and}} mass communications at Arizona State University, claimed, [...] "I really think that [...] negativism, the attack mode was {{one that does not}} play well with women and independents." [...] Many observers felt that Obama had to simply avoid stumbles or mistakes in order to succeed in the debate. This was reflected in another professor's sentiments: [...] "I didn't think Obama was as comfortable this time as he was in the other two debates, but I didn't really hear any gaffe, any major mistake," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Larry</b> Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Sabato added, [...] "he might even be judged the winner." [...] Times Mark Halperin graded McCain's performance an A- and Obama's performance a B.|$|E
2500|$|Among his {{strengths}} as {{a player}} are that he is extremely fast and explosive, [...] "quick-footed" [...] with [...] "great feet", [...] "a superb forehand", and what John McEnroe has referred to as [...] "great racket speed"; he is [...] "a hard worker and a natural leader." [...] He also runs everything down. [...] "He's got a great heart", <b>said</b> <b>Larry</b> Stefanki, who coached Andy Roddick and has previously worked with John McEnroe, Marcelo Ríos, Fernando González and Tim Henman. [...] "A lot of players today are fast and fit, but just don't seem to play every point at 100%. [...] It's like they're almost on cruise control and then want to play hard {{when it gets to}} 4-all or 5-all", Stefanki said. [...] "I think because Jesse's so small and he doesn't want to give any free points, he tries every point 100%. That's a big asset out there." [...] At 5' 9" [...] and 150 pounds, Levine is smaller than most professional tennis players.|$|E
