5|$|The {{kinetic energy}} of an {{expanding}} supernova remnant can trigger <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> by compressing nearby, dense molecular clouds in space.

5|$|The rate of <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> in the Milky Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy {{producing}} {{only about}} one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b> Should this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|No known {{globular}} clusters display active <b>star</b> <b>formation,</b> {{which is consistent}} with the view that {{globular clusters}} are typically the oldest objects in the Galaxy, and were among the first collections of stars to form. Very large regions of <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> known as super star clusters, such as Westerlund 1 in the Milky Way, may be the precursors of globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|The {{wealth of}} galaxies at {{different}} stages of their evolution also allowed astronomers to estimate the variation in the rate of <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> over the lifetime of the Universe. While estimates of the redshifts of HDF galaxies are somewhat crude, astronomers believe that <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> was occurring at its maximum rate 8–10 billion years ago, and has decreased by a factor of about 10 since then.|$|E
5|$|This violent {{collision}} formed {{most of the}} galaxy's (metal-rich) {{galactic halo}} and extended disk. During this epoch, <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> {{would have been very}} high, to the point of becoming a luminous infrared galaxy for roughly 100 million years. Andromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy had a very close passage 2–4 billion years ago. This event produced high levels of <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk– even some globular clusters– and disturbed M33's outer disk.|$|E

5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. <b>Star</b> <b>formation</b> {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b> A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E
5|$|The {{future of}} the Andromeda and Milky Way galaxies may be interlinked: in about five billion years, the two could {{potentially}} begin an Andromeda–Milky Way collision that would spark extensive new <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} that {{globular}} clusters contain {{some of the first}} stars to be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear.

5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b> A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E
5|$|Galaxies come {{in three}} main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A {{slightly}} more extensive description of galaxy types {{based on their}} appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Hydroxyl megamasers {{occur in}} the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and {{appear to be a}} marker in the stage of the {{formation}} of galaxies. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> in LIRGs takes place. At redshifts of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers. Detection of hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies would allow precise determination of the redshift, and aid understanding of <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> in these objects.|$|E
50|$|A {{technetium}} star, or {{more properly}} a Tc-rich star, {{is a star}} whose stellar spectrum contains absorption lines of the light radioactive metal technetium. The most stable isotope of technetium is 98Tc with a half-life of 4.2 million years, which is too short a time to allow the metal to be material from before the <b>star's</b> <b>formation.</b> Therefore, the detection in 1952 of technetium in stellar spectra provided unambiguous proof of nucleosynthesis in stars, {{one of the more}} extreme cases being R Geminorum.|$|R
2500|$|In November 2010, {{using the}} Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, two {{gigantic}} gamma-ray bubbles, spanning about 25,000 light-years across, were detected {{at the heart}} of our galaxy. These bubbles of high-energy radiation are suspected as erupting from a massive black hole or evidence of a burst of <b>star</b> <b>formations</b> from millions of years ago. They were discovered after scientists filtered out the [...] "fog of background gamma-rays suffusing the sky".

40|$|Several {{hundred million}} years after the Big Bang, the Epoch of Reionisation(EoR) started as the photons from the first objects ionised neutral baryons in the Universe. The {{observations}} such as the Gunn-Peterson troughs in quasar absorption spectra and the linear polarisation of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB) impose strong constraints on reionisation models of the EoR. Recent data provide the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity of galaxies up to redshift 10. However, the observation of <b>star</b> <b>formations</b> in low mass galaxies is still not practicable. Their <b>star</b> <b>formations</b> are expected to be suppressed by the increase of ionised baryons and greatly affect the reionisation models. We develop a flexible pipeline which utilises the Munich Semi-Analytic Model of galaxy formation, L-Galaxies, and a semi-numerical modelling of cosmic reionisation. This combination allows us to create a self-consistent reionisation simulation in computational models of galaxy formation. We use this pipeline on a high resolution cosmological Nbody simulation to produce the redshift evolution of the star forming galaxies during the EoR. Comparisons of the properties of mock galaxies and the growth of ionised hydrogen bubbles suggest that the reionisation history heavily depends on the suppression models used in the modeling of dwarf galaxy formation. During this research, some numerical flaws of merger tree generation algorithms were identified. We investigated the origins of these problems and present suggestions for solving them...|$|R

5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, produce new generations of stars {{as long as}} they have dense {{molecular}} clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once stars have converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> will come to an end.|$|E
5|$|Such {{large-scale}} {{interactions are}} rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size become less common.

5|$|The Hubble {{classification}} system rates elliptical galaxies {{on the basis}} of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter. Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b> Instead they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements because <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> ceases after the initial burst.
