40|$|Stirling Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) {{are being}} {{developed}} as an option to provide power on future space science missions where robotic spacecraft will orbit, flyby, land or rove. A Stirling Radioisotope Generator (SRG) could offer space missions a more efficient power system that uses one fourth of the nuclear fuel and decreases the thermal footprint compared to {{the current state of}} the art. The Stirling Cycle Technology Development (SCTD) Project is funded by the RPS Program to developing Stirling-based subsystems, including convertors and controller maturation efforts that have resulted in high fidelity hardware like the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG), Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC), and ASC Controller Unit (ACU). The SCTD Project also performs research to develop less mature technologies with a wide variety of objectives, including increasing temperature capability to enable new environments, improving system reliability or fault tolerance, reducing mass or size, and developing advanced concepts that are mission enabling. Active vibration reduction systems (AVRS), or "balancers", have historically been developed and characterized to provide fault tolerance for generator designs that incorporate dual-opposed Stirling convertors or enable <b>single</b> <b>convertor,</b> or small RPS, missions. Balancers reduce the dynamic disturbance forces created by the power piston and displacer internal moving components of a single operating convertor to meet spacecraft requirements for induced disturbance force. To improve fault tolerance for dual-opposed configurations and enable <b>single</b> <b>convertor</b> configurations, a breadboard AVRS was implemented on the Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC). The AVRS included a linear motor, a motor mount, and a closed-loop controller able to balance out the transmitted peak dynamic disturbance using acceleration feedback. Test objectives included quantifying power and mass penalty and reduction in transmitted force over a range of ASC operating parameters and mounting conditions. All tests were performed at three different piston amplitudes, 3. 0 mm, 3. 75 mm, and 4. 5 mm. Overall, the transmitted force was reduced to 2 % of the total unbalanced force by actively balancing out only the first fundamental frequency, with balancer motor power remaining under one watt. The test results will be used to guide future balancer designs...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Space Exploration Policy has {{established}} a vision for human exploration of the moon and Mars. One option for power for future outposts on the lunar and Martian surfaces is a nuclear reactor coupled with a free-piston Stirling convertor at a power level of 30 - 40 kWe. A 25 kW convertor {{was developed in the}} 1990 s under the SP- 100 program. This system consisted of two 12. 5 kWe engines connected at their hot ends and mounted in tandem to cancel vibration. Recently, NASA began a new project with Auburn University to develop a 5 kWe, <b>single</b> <b>convertor</b> for use in such a possible lunar power system. Goals of this development program include a specific power in excess of 140 We/kg at the convertor level, lifetime in excess of five years and a control system that will safely manage the convertors in case of an emergency. Foster-Miller, Inc. is developing the 5 kWe Stirling Convertor Assembly. The characteristics of the design along with progress in developing the system will be described...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a general method for the analysis of integrated a. c. and d. c. systems under normal, but not necessarily balanced, steady state operation. Phase component three phase system modelling is reviewed and the relationship of the well known symmetrical components to the three phase modelling is discussed. Using as a reference the single phase fast decoupled algorithm the modifications required to produce an efficient three phase fast decoupled load flow are described. It is demonstrated that the three phase fast decoupled load flow displays all the characteristics of the original single phase version. <b>Single</b> phase balanced <b>convertor</b> modelling is reviewed and several techniques for the integration of such models with the single phase fast decoupled load flow are developed and their performance is compared. The methods for <b>single</b> phase <b>convertor</b> modelling are extended to allow unbalanced convertor operation to be analysed. The integration of the unbalanced convertor model into the three phase fast decoupled load flow is described. Convergence properties are examined and detailed results given. The extension of steady state analysis techniques to the consideration of harmonic frequencies is discussed. The unbalanced convertor model is used as a basis to enable the harmonic interaction of d. c. convertors and the a. c. system to be studied...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the modelling {{of the major}} sources of harmonic distortion in electrical transmission systems, especially those of relevance to the New Zealand power system. The harmonics generated by the operation of a. c. /d. c. convertors are modelled using an interactive algorithm. The algorithm is applied {{to a number of}} test systems and verified using a transient convertor simulation program. A harmonic admittance matrix model of a single phase traction system is derived and used to assess the effect of propossed harmonic filters. In this case the three phase iterative algorithm had to be modified to be able to model the locomotive's <b>single</b> phase <b>convertors.</b> Synchronous machines are modelled using a harmonic Norton equivalent, derived from the d-q axes differential equations. The case of this model yields harmonic impedances consistent with existing models and demonstrates the well known, but greatly ignored, phenomenon of harmonic conversion. The modelling of harmonic conversion is shown to significantly modify the harmonic flows under certain system conditions...|$|R
40|$|Analytic {{modeling}} of several heat exchanger concepts to couple the SP- 100 nuclear reactor primary lithium loop and the Space Stirling Power Convertor (SSPC) was performed. Four 25 kWe SSPC's {{are used to}} produce the required 100 kW of electrical power. This design work focused on the interface between a single SSPC and the primary lithium loop. Manifolding to separate and collect the four channel flow was not modeled. This work modeled two separate types of heat exchanger interfaces (conductive coupling and radiative coupling) to explore their relative advantages and disadvantages. The minimum mass design of the conductively coupled concepts was 18 kg or 0. 73 kg/kWe for a <b>single</b> 25 kWe <b>convertor.</b> The minimum mass radiatively coupled concept was 41 kg or 1. 64 kg/kWe. The direct conduction heat exchanger provides a lighter weight system because {{of its ability to}} operate the Stirling convertor evaporator at higher heat fluxes than those attainable by the radiatively coupled systems. Additionally the conductively coupled concepts had relatively small volumes and provide potentially simpler assembly. Their disadvantages were the tight tolerances and material joining problems associated with this refractory to superalloy interface. The advantages of the radiatively coupled designs were the minimal material interface problems...|$|R
40|$|In April 2009, NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) {{formed an}} {{integrated}} product team (IPT) {{to develop a}} Small Radioisotope Power System (SRPS) utilizing a single Advanced Stirling Convertor (ASC) with passive balancer for possible use by the International Lunar Network (ILN) program. The ILN program is studying the feasibility of implementing a multiple node seismometer network to investigate the internal lunar structure. A single ASC produces approximately 80 W(sub e) and could potentially supply sufficient power for that application. The IPT consists of Sunpower, Inc., to provide the single ASC with balancer, The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) to design an engineering model <b>Single</b> <b>Convertor</b> Controller (SCC) for an ASC with balancer, and NASA GRC to provide technical support to these tasks {{and to develop a}} simulated lunar lander test stand. A controller maintains stable operation of an ASC. It regulates the alternating current produced by the linear alternator of the convertor, provides a specified output voltage, and maintains operation at a steady piston amplitude and hot end temperature. JHU/APL also designed an ASC dynamic engine/alternator simulator to aid in the testing and troubleshooting of the SCC. This paper describes the requirements, design, and development of the SCC, including some of the key challenges and the solutions chosen to overcome those issues. In addition, it describes the plans to analyze the effectiveness of a passive balancer to minimize vibration from the ASC, characterize the effect of ASC vibration on a lunar lander, characterize the performance of the SCC, and integrate the single ASC, SCC, and lunar lander test stand to characterize performance of the overall system...|$|E

The single ASC with a passive balancer, simulated lunar lander test stand, and SCC were delivered to GRC and were tested as a system. The testing sequence at GRC included SCC fault tolerance, integration, electromagnetic interference (EMI), vibration, and extended operation testing. The SCC fault tolerance test characterized the SCCs ability to handle various fault conditions, including high or low bus power consumption, total open load or short circuit, and replacing a failed SCC card while the backup maintains control of the ASC. The integrated test characterized the behavior of the system across a range of operating conditions, including variations in cold-end temperature and piston amplitude, including the emitted vibration to both the sensors on the lunar lander and the lunar surface. The EMI test characterized the AC and DC magnetic and electric fields emitted by the SCC and single ASC. The vibration test confirms the SCCs ability to control the single ASC during launch. The extended operation test allows data to be collected over a period of thousands of hours to obtain long term performance data of the ASC with a passive balancer and the SCC. This paper will discuss the results of each of these tests...|$|E
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE), Germantown, Maryland, Stirling Technology Company (STC), Kennewick, Washington, and NASA Glenn Research Center are {{developing}} a free-piston Stirling convertor for a high-efficiency Stirling Radioisotope Generator for NASA Space Science missions. This generator is being developed for multimission use, including providing electric power for unmanned Mars rovers and for deep space missions. STC is developing the 55 -W Technology Demonstration Convertor (TDC) under contract to DOE. Glenn is conducting an in-house technology project to assist in developing the convertor for readiness for space qualification and mission implementation. As part of this effort, a Stirling Research Laboratory was established to test the TDC's and related technologies. A key task is providing an independent verification and validation of the TDC performance. Four TDC's are now being tested at Glenn. Acceptance testing has been completed for all convertors, and in general, performance agreed well with that achieved by STC prior to the delivery of the convertors. Performance mapping has also been completed {{on two of the}} convertors over a range of hot-end temperatures (450 to 650 C), cold-end temperatures (80 to 120 C), and piston amplitudes (5. 2 to 6. 2 mm). These test data are available online at [URL] The TDC's can be tested in either a horizontal orientation with dual-opposed convertors or in a vertical orientation with a <b>single</b> <b>convertor.</b> Synchronized dual-opposed pairs are used for dynamically balanced operation that results in very low levels of vibration. The Stirling Research Laboratory also supports launch environment testing of the TDC's in Glenn's Structural Dynamics Laboratory and electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic compatibility characterization and reduction efforts. In addition, the TDC's will be used for long-term endurance testing, and preparations are underway for unattended operation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} recent {{thermal model}} {{results of the}} Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG). The three-dimensional (3 D) ASRG thermal power model was built using the Thermal Desktop(trademark) thermal analyzer. The model was correlated with ASRG engineering unit test data and ASRG flight unit predictions from Lockheed Martin's (LM's) I-deas(trademark) TMG thermal model. The auxiliary cooling system (ACS) of the ASRG is {{also included in the}} ASRG thermal model. The ACS is designed to remove waste heat from the ASRG {{so that it can be}} used to heat spacecraft components. The performance of the ACS is reported under nominal conditions and during a Venus flyby scenario. The results for the nominal case are validated with data from Lockheed Martin. Transient thermal analysis results of ASRG for a Venus flyby with a representative trajectory are also presented. In addition, model results of an ASRG mounted on a Cassini-like spacecraft with a sunshade are presented to show a way to mitigate the high temperatures of a Venus flyby. It was predicted that the sunshade can lower the temperature of the ASRG alternator by 20 C for the representative Venus flyby trajectory. The 3 D model also was modified to predict generator performance after a <b>single</b> Advanced Stirling <b>Convertor</b> failure. The geometry of the Microtherm HT insulation block on the outboard side was modified to match deformation and shrinkage observed during testing of a prototypic ASRG test fixture by LM. Test conditions and test data were used to correlate the model by adjusting the thermal conductivity of the deformed insulation to match the post-heat-dump steady state temperatures. Results for these conditions showed that the performance of the still-functioning inboard ACS was unaffected...|$|R
