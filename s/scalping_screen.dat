50|$|Foreign body {{contamination}} is {{unwanted material}} that {{differs from the}} virgin material going over and through the screen. It can be anything ranging from tree twigs, grass, metal slag to other mineral types and composition. This contamination occurs {{when there is a}} hole in the <b>scalping</b> <b>screen</b> or a foreign material's mineralogy or chemical composition differs from the virgin material.|$|E
40|$|Issue: The {{wood waste}} {{delivered}} to a processing facility typically contains a certain quantity of small-sized wood (chips and chunks), fines, and small contaminants {{mixed in with}} the larger pieces of wood waste. This material can cause problems for the processing facility. The small-sized wood and fines complicates manual sorting activities because they overwhelming sorters with a many individual pieces that hide internal contaminants, which appear upon the conveyor. The wood fines are also typically mixed with dirt and grit contaminants. The combination of fines, dirt, and grit tend to cause excessive wear on material-handling and size-reduction equipment, thus creating excessive equipment maintenance requirements. Finally, the small contaminants can be easily missed by manual and automated contaminant removal systems before the size reducing process. Failure to remove these small contaminants could lead to excessive requirements on equipment maintenance and degrade the quality of the end-product. Best Practice: This Best Practice recommends the removal of small-sized wood, fines, and small contaminants from wood waste incoming into a processing facility. A disc <b>scalping</b> <b>screen</b> is one type of equipment that processors can use to perform this function. Following is a description of this equipment: Disc Scalping Screen: Disc scalping screens are designed to align with a chain or belt conveyor of the sam...|$|E
50|$|Common {{applications}} include separation used in {{the process}} industry, food industry, chemical industry and pharmaceuticals. This includes screening, classification, sifting, fiber recovery, filtration, and <b>scalping.</b> Gyratory <b>screening</b> is capable of separating finer materials as compared to other methods, and is therefore more suitable to treat fragile materials. Several applications in respective industries are shown in the table below.|$|R
40|$|We report here a 7 -month-old baby {{presenting}} {{with a large}} paraganglioma {{arising from}} {{the right side of}} neck and extending to the <b>scalp.</b> Catecholamine <b>screening</b> was within normal limits. Ultrasound of the abdomen, CT-scan, and whole body MRI excluded any other coexisting neuroendocrine tumor. The tumor was treated by radical excision, and the resultant soft tissue defect was resurfaced using a pectoralis major muscle flap with split skin grafting. There has been no recurrence or metastasis during the 2 -year follow up. To the best of our knowledge, this is the youngest reported patient with paraganglioma of the neck. Surgical excision of paraganglioma is feasible and curative in the absence of metastasis...|$|R
40|$|Electroencephalographic (EEG) {{recordings}} are, {{most of the}} times, {{corrupted by}} spurious artifacts, which should be rejected or cleaned by the practitioner. As human <b>scalp</b> EEG <b>screening</b> is error-prone, automatic artifact detection {{is an issue of}} capital importance, to ensure objective and reliable results. In this paper we propose a new approach for discrimination of muscular activity in the human scalp quantitative EEG (QEEG), based on the time-frequency shape analysis. The impact of the muscular activity on the EEG can be evaluated from this methodology. We present an application of this scoring as a preprocessing step for EEG signal analysis, in order to evaluate the amount of muscular activity for two set of EEG recordings for dementia patients with early stage of Alzheimer’s disease and control age-matched subjects...|$|R
40|$|Hair loss or {{alopecia}} is {{a common}} and distressing clinical complaint in the primary care setting and can arise from heterogeneous etiologies. In the pediatric population, hair loss often presents with patterns that are {{different from that of}} their adult counterparts. Given the psychosocial complications that may arise from pediatric alopecia, prompt diagnosis and management is particularly important. Common causes of alopecia in children and adolescents include alopecia areata, tinea capitis, androgenetic alopecia, traction alopecia, trichotillomania, hair cycle disturbances, and congenital alopecia conditions. Diagnostic tools for hair loss in children include a detailed history, physical examination with a focused evaluation of the child’s hair and <b>scalp,</b> fungal <b>screens,</b> hair pull and tug test, and if possible, light microscopy and/or trichoscopy. Management of alopecia requires a holistic approach including psychosocial support because treatments are only available for some hair loss conditions, and even the available treatments are not always effective. This review outlines the clinical presentations, presents a diagnostic algorithm, and discusses management of these various hair loss disorders...|$|R
