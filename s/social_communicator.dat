40|$|This article {{proposes a}} Half-shift model to {{simultaneously}} achieve the mutually reinforcing goals of creative work and <b>social</b> contribution. Science <b>communicators</b> are closely examined {{as one of}} the possible conduits to implement this model. Intensifying global competition requires work places and social settings to be more efficient and less flexible, making it difficult for professionals to gain satisfaction from being creative and contributing to society through their paid work. After a closer examination, the author proposes a Half-shift model as a new way to achieve a more balanced work environment. The Half-shift model looks at combining paid work and unpaid work in conterminous areas. The research shows that the keys for promoting this model are changes in work rules and professionals' personal motivation for work. It is hoped that this article provides a conceptual framework {{for the development of a}} Half-shift model, and contributes to its implementation...|$|R

Many organizations are doing incredible work to fight social injustice and oftentimes few people understand the issues. I want to show how communication can revitalize ministry and {{get the word out}} through promotional materials, graphic design and writing. These are examples of marketing tactics in a ministry setting. My goal is to show how creative communication strategies can ignite passion in the public and bring people into involvement.

40|$|Abstract. Communicative {{competence}} {{is the ability}} to send messages which promote attainment of goals while maintaining <b>social</b> acceptability. Competent <b>communicators</b> attempt to align themselves with each others goals and methods to produce a smooth, productive and often enjoyable dialogue. The aim of this research was to investigate self-perceived communicative competence (SPCC) of students of Engineering Management in General English and English for Specific Purposes (ESP). A longitudinal study was carried out starting with the first year students at the Faculty of Technical Sciences in Novi Sad and was repeated with the same sample of students during their second and third year of study. Participation was voluntary and took place during regular class time. The measure of communicative competence employed was the Self-perceived Communication Competence Scale. The results of the study indicated that differences in SPCC between the years do exist. The SPCC gradually improved between the first, the second and the third year. The research was also motivated by gaining better overview of the teaching activity. An anonymous questionnaire provided many useful hints and ideas for further work and thus, language teacher made a thorough analysis of the overall teaching procedure. However, it is essential to get some feedback and talk to students in order to evaluate both them and ourselves as well as the teaching syllabus. Key words: communicative competence, self-perception, teaching ESP...|$|R

40|$|Consumer-generated product reviews have proliferated online. Driven by {{the notion}} that customers’ {{decision}} to purchase a product is influenced by the information they obtain from online customer reviews, this thesis examines the impact of online customer reviews on purchase intention. To do so, the research integrates traditional communication theories, in particular social communication by Hovland (1948), with the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to build a theoretical model. Importantly, the model draws on Cheung and Thadani’s (2010) literature review on individual-level eWOM research, concluding that there is no existing study simultaneously examining the impact of all the elements of <b>social</b> communication (<b>communicator,</b> stimuli and response) on purchase intention. This study outlines a research framework that can provide insight into this area. The thesis provides a thorough review of the state of research in eWOM. Based on the review, five hypotheses where developed and tested using a 2 (high involvement vs. low involvement x 2 (high argument quality vs. low argument quality) x 2 (disclosure of source vs. no disclosure of source) experimental design. The model is investigated quantitatively and the empirical testing was carried out by developing two scenarios, two hotel reviews, and one reviewer profile in order to manipulate argument quality, involvement and source credibility. A total of 253 respondents participated in the experiment. The main finding of the study is that the quality of online customer reviews has a positive effect on consumers’ purchasing intention. The study was not able to reveal any significant main effect of source credibility, meaning that a reviewer’s virtual credential is neither a significant nor a sufficient indicator that readers systematically or heuristically use to evaluate eWOM messages. Overall, this suggests that source credibility might have a different role in a CMC context and underlines the notion that people deliberate on the credibility of eWOM {{to a greater extent than}} traditional WOM when seeking online product recommendations. Moreover, the study failed to produce any significant interaction effects, as argument quality and source credibility did not interact with the subjects’ degree of involvement. This stands in contrast with the multiple roles postulated by the ELM framework. These findings have implications for online sellers in terms of how to manage their online customer reviews...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} {{information}} landscape, {{there are numerous}} channels for consumers to find information on issues pertaining to food safety. The rise in popularity of <b>social</b> media makes <b>communicators</b> question {{the extent to which}} resources should be allocated to these channels in order to reach new segments or audiences which are hard to reach through more traditional dissemination channels. A segmentation approach was used to identify groups of consumers based on their inclination to use different channels to seek information about food-related risks, including traditional media, online media and social media. In the wake of the 2011 Escherichia coli contamination crisis, the study focused on a bacterial contamination of fresh vegetables. Results were obtained through an online survey among 1264 participants from eight European countries in September 2012. Four segments were identified: ‘a high cross-channel inclination’ (24 %), ‘an established channel inclination’ (31 %), ‘a moderate cross-channel inclination’ (26 %) and ‘a low cross-channel inclination’ (19 %). Results show that social media can act as a complementary information channel for a particular segment, but {{that it is not a}} substitute for traditional or online media. Individuals who showed an inclination to use social media in conjunction with other channels considered it more important to be well informed, were more motivated to find additional information, were more sensitive to risks in general and perceived the likelihood of a food incident in the future to be larger. The ‘high cross-channel inclination’ segment contained relatively younger and more Southern European participants...|$|R
