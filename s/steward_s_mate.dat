40|$|As a {{socially}} monogamous species, humans generally have one committed romantic partner at a time, but sometimes engage in infidelity. Previous research has related infidelity to individual difference traits, including global assessments of “mate value” (relative {{value as a}} romantic partner on the “mating market”).

The results confirm a negative relationship between one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> overall <b>mate</b> value and one 2 ̆ 7 s intention to commit an infidelity, and also identify four distinct mate value components (agreeableness/commitment, surgency, emotional stability, and physical attractiveness) that uniquely predict infidelity intention. Two of these factors, surgency (for women) and agreeableness/commitment (for men), positively predict anticipated infidelity. Additionally, the results indicate that men 2 ̆ 7 s but not women 2 ̆ 7 s infidelity intention is better predicted by the combination of their own and their partner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mate</b> value.

As a result, when confidence was lost in Mates' mutual fund and investors wanted to cash out, redemptions had to be suspended for a while, which the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission condoned.|$|R

40|$|LEKS, {{on which}} males defend small {{clustered}} mating territories, may have evolved {{because of the}} unusual opportunities they provide for female choice of mating partners, and several studies of lek-breeding animals have demonstrated correlations between the mating success of males and their phenotype or behaviour. However, these could arise because (1) females select mates {{on the basis of}} male phenotypic traits; (2) males interfere with each other 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mating</b> attempts; or (3) females show preferences for particular mating territories, and larger or stronger males are more likely to win access to these territories. Here we report that when fallow bucks on a traditional lek were experimentally induced to change their territories, differences in the mating success of bucks persisted, whereas differences in the position of their territories relative to the centre of the lek did not.

40|$|In {{order to}} respond {{appropriately}} to external stimuli, e. g. odours in the environment,insects have to evaluate these stimuli {{in a context}} of relevance and need. These decisions are, in turn, based on internal physiological status, such as mating status. In the cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis, mating induces profound physiological changes that alter the behavioural output to fit with the current needs of the animal. In female <b>S.</b> littoralis, <b>mating</b> switches the behavioural attraction from food sources to oviposition sites and concurrently down- and up-regulates olfactory neuron sensitivity. This switch in olfactory sensitivity is correlated with a transient increase in dopamine levels in the primary olfactory brain centres, the antennal lobes. In male <b>S.</b> littoralis, <b>mating</b> induces a transient behavioural and olfactory inhibition towards female-emitted sex pheromone as well as to mating site-related odours. However, responses towards food sources remain constant. The shift in olfactory responsiveness is not correlated with changes in dopamine levels, but may be regulated by neuropeptides expressed in the olfactory system. Distribution patterns of 6 of the most abundant neuropeptides reveal distinct differential expressions within the antennal lobe glomerular array, providing the possibility for selective and state-dependent modulation of the olfactory system...|$|R

5|$|The devotee Pundalik, thrower of {{the brick}} (see Legend below), {{is a major}} {{character}} in the legends of Vithoba. He is commonly perceived to be a historical figure, connected with the establishment and propagation of the Vithoba-centric Varkari sect. Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar considers Pundalik to be {{the founder of the}} Varkari sect and the one who promulgated the sect in Maratha country. Stevenson (1843) goes further, suggesting he might have been a Jain or a Buddhist, since Varkari tradition is a combination of Jain and Buddhist morals, and Vithoba is viewed as Vishnu in his form as Buddha. Frazer, Edwards and P.R. Bhandarkar (1922) all suggest that Pundalik tried to unify Shiva and Vishnu, and that this sect originated in Karnataka. Ranade (1933) thinks that Pundalik, a Kannada saint, was not only the founder of the Varkari sect but also the first great devotee or first high priest of the Pandharpur temple. Upadhyaya supports the priest theory but declines the Kannada origin theory. According to M. <b>S.</b> <b>Mate,</b> Pundalik was instrumental in coaxing the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana to build the Pandharpur temple to Vishnu, placing him in the early 12thcentury. Other scholars like Raeside (1965), Dhanpalvar (1972), and Vaudeville (1974) have questioned the historicity of Pundalik altogether, and dismissed him as a mythical figure.|$|R
