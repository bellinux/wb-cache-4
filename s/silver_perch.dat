5|$|Native <b>Silver</b> <b>perch</b> and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. <b>Silver</b> <b>perch</b> stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish in the last three decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Environmental Protection Agency has {{designated}} the Corpus Christi Bay system as an estuary of national significance. More than 234 {{species of fish}} {{are found in the}} bay, including the Gafftopsail catfish, Hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic cutlassfish, Black drum, Red drum, Southern flounder, Crevalle jack, Ladyfish, Inshore lizardfish, Atlantic midshipman, <b>Silver</b> <b>perch,</b> Pinfish, Smooth puffer, Scaled sardine, Bighead searobin, Sand seatrout, Spotted seatrout, Sheepshead, Gray snapper, Common snook, and the Tripletail.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod is {{the apex}} aquatic {{predator}} in the rivers of the Murray-Darling basin, and will eat almost anything smaller than itself and anything in its way, including finned fishes such as smaller Murray cod, golden perch, <b>silver</b> <b>perch,</b> bony bream, eel-tailed catfish, western carp gudgeon, and Australian smelt and introduced fish such as carp, goldfish, and redfin (English perch), {{as well as}} crustaceans such as yabbies, freshwater shrimp, and Murray crayfish. Fish compose {{the majority of the}} diet of mature Murray cod in lowland river and impoundment habitats, and that Murray cod are apex predators in these habitats. Murray cod have also been known to eat ducks, cormorants, freshwater turtles, water dragons, snakes, mice, and frogs. The observations of the recreational fishermen fishing for Murray cod with surface lures at night reveal that the popular description of Murray cod as a demersal ambush predator is only partially correct. While this behaviour is typical during the day, at night, Murray cod are active pelagic predators, venturing into shallow waters and frequently taking prey from the surface.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} amount of the farm land is set aside for student plots. Part of practical agriculture lessons involves students growing and maintaining their own crops, and a practical mark worth 10% of their yearly mark is awarded {{at the end of}} term. Mature crops in the students' assigned plots of land are then the students' to take home. In addition to its use for educational purposes, the farm also supplies a wide variety of agricultural produce including: Cattle - Angus stud, paraded annually at the Castle Hill Show by the Cattle Group, and sold at Camden Sales yard; Sheep - First-cross Ewes & Prime Lambs; Eggs - Free-range eggs; Poultry Meat - Broilers raised and sold onsite, Oranges - Washington Navel; Peaches - Flordagold and Sherman's Red varieties; Sweet Corn - Shimmer variety; James Ruse Gold Rose - A privately crossbred rose variety the rights were donated to the school in 1999 in celebration of its 40 years of teaching; Apiary - Honey sold on-site in jars; and Macadamia Nuts. Various groups of students have been set up to look after these, such as the Poultry Squad and a Weather Watcher group to maintain farm records. In the past, the farm also housed Merino and Border Leicester sheep, named the Sharlea Sheep. It was replaced by the Aquaculture venture, <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> and a crayfish growing system. Now some students also participate in making peach jam and sorbet after the peach harvest.|$|E

500|$|In 1877, United States Fish Commissioner Spencer Fullerton Baird {{requested}} that West Virginia introduce the Chinook salmon into its streams. The West Virginia Fish Commission's [...] "first and most expensive efforts" [...] involved the hatching and stocking {{of the salmon}} in West Virginia's streams. To accomplish this feat, White designed and built charcoal raceways to culture the salmon. The salmon were released into the South Branch Potomac River where they flourished and were caught by fishermen from Romney to Washington, D.C. The salmon introduced by White and the commission migrated to the Chesapeake Bay, but {{did not return to}} West Virginia's streams to spawn. Between 1877 and 1882, the West Virginia Fish Commission successfully hatched and distributed salmon, trout, black bass, shad, carp, gray bass, pike perch, <b>silver</b> <b>perch,</b> jack, and blue catfish, as well as mill pond roach as food for the bass. In a report to the United States Fish Commission {{on the quality of the}} hatchery's carp, White wrote: [...] "One small scale carp, accidentally killed in draining the pond, was fried as pan-fish, eaten in my family, and pronounced good." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Silver</b> <b>perch</b> are omnivorous, {{feeding on}} insect larvae, molluscs, annelid worms and algae. The {{importance}} of vegetative {{matter in the}} diet of <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> is still debated. <b>Silver</b> <b>perch</b> appear primarily to be a low-order predator of small aquatic invertebrate prey, with occasional intakes of small fish and vegetative matter.

50|$|The American <b>silver</b> <b>perch,</b> Bairdiella chrysoura, is an American fish. Widespread on {{the eastern}} seaboard, the <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> is {{commonly}} caught by inshore anglers in search of larger species.

50|$|As {{recently}} as the 1970s, <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> abounded in the entire Murray-Darling Basin, vast though it is. Since then, however, they have undergone a mysterious, rapid and catastrophic decline. <b>Silver</b> <b>perch</b> have now declined close {{to the point of}} extinction in the wild. Based on simple catchment area estimates, the <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> has disappeared from 87% of its former range. Only one sizeable, clearly viable and self-sustaining population now survives in their natural range, in the central reaches of the Murray River. For these reasons, the Australian federal government has listed wild <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> as critically endangered under national environmental law. <b>Silver</b> <b>perch</b> are bred extensively in aquaculture but these domesticated strains and populations are of little use in ensuring the species' survival in the wild.|$|E
50|$|An {{inventory}} of the fauna in 1997 documented some 55 species, which was considered a relatively high diversity. Most prevalent was freshwater gastropods, caddisflies, leeches, and beetles. Common fishes are <b>perch,</b> <b>silver</b> bream, roach, and zander; but burbot, European smelt, and eel have also been reported. Zander, grass carp, and trout have been introduced. Angling is thus popular in the lake. Crayfish plague struck the lake in 1978 but signal crayfish were reintroduced in 1984.|$|R

50|$|Astelia alpina called {{pineapple}} grass, <b>silver</b> astelia, or <b>perching</b> lily is {{a commonly}} found species in alpine and subalpine areas of Tasmania and the Australian Alps. It is a perennial herb that typically dominates its environment by growing in dense clusters, called mats, in alpine bogs. There are two subspecies: Astelia alpina var. novae hollandiae from New South Wales and Victoria and Astelia alpina var. alpina endemic to Tasmania. Both subspecies appear {{very similar to}} each other. The species was originally described by Robert Brown.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for {{the catastrophic}} decline of <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> are only {{partially}} understood. Dams, weirs and river regulation and the virtual removal of spring floods {{appear to have}} removed the conditions <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> need to breed and recruit successfully on a large scale. Weirs are also believed to have blocked the migrations of spawning adults and juveniles, which are important to maintain populations over the lengths of rivers. Weirs also kill most drifting <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> larvae that pass through them, if they are of an undershot design (which, unfortunately, most are). Recent studies that has proven more than 90% of <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> passing through undershot weirs are killed. And without doubt, weirs trap drifting <b>silver</b> <b>perch</b> eggs (and larvae) as well, where they are either diverted down irrigation offtakes, resulting in eventual death, or sink into fine weir pool sediments and die.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as each lake {{developed}} its own steady summer tourism, recreational fishermen {{who sought to}} increase their catches began to introduce new fish species, and these eventually overwhelmed the native <b>silver</b> trout. Yellow <b>perch,</b> which eat trout eggs, and lake trout, which hold the same ecological niche, as well as eat and hybridize with other char species, were particularly devastating. Other species were also introduced that {{have proved to be}} devastating to native trout species in other waters, the rainbow trout, brown trout, Atlantic salmon, and rainbow smelt.|$|R
50|$|The wide delta of Kuban, {{with its}} {{abundant}} estuaries, is especially rich in plankton and benthos. There are about 400 species of zooplankton, including rotifers, copepods, cladocerans, mollusks, worms, etc., providing abundant food for fish. The fish fauna of the Kuban {{differs from that}} of the nearby Don and Volga rivers and contains more than 65 species from 16 families. They are dominated by the genera Gobio, Romanogobio, Squalius and Chondrostoma and contain species and genera such as carp, Prussian carp, roach, bream, <b>silver</b> bream, pike, <b>perch,</b> ruffe, Chalcalburnus, Sprattus, Mugil and others. Some species such as silver carp and grass carp were acclimatized in the last decade.|$|R
40|$|The {{artificial}} {{breeding of}} marine fish in China {{has been developed}} {{over a period of}} more than 50 years. Both species diversity and fry production have greatly increased since the 1980 s. By the year 2000, at least 52 species belonging to 24 families of marine fish had been successfully bred. Large quantities of cultured fry can meet the needs of both sea cage culture and pond culture for most species. Fish fry production has entered a period of sustainable. development. The number of artificially produced fry of large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea) exceeded 1. 3 billion in year 2000. The species for which more than 10 million fry is produced annually through aquaculture are: red drum (Sciaenops ocellatus), Japanese sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicus), redeye mullet (Liza haematocheila), cuneate drum (Nibea miichthioides), red seabream (Pagrosomus major), milkfish (Chanos chanos) and three-banded sweetlip (Plectorhynchus cinctus). Several millions of artificial fry are cultured annually for the following species: Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), black porgy (Sparus macrocephalus), <b>silver</b> sea <b>perch</b> (Lates calcarifer), Russell's snapper (Lutjanus russelli), javelin grunt (Pomadasys hasta), miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy), Chinese black sleeper (Bostrichthys sinensis) and skewband grunt (Hapalogenys nitens). Fishes belonging to the family Sciaenidae are now the major species for artificial propagation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Forage fish play an {{important}} role in wasp-waist ecosystems like that of the San Juan Archipelago. These small fish, including the Pacific sand lance, <b>silver</b> surf <b>perch,</b> and Pacific herring, regulate the flow of energy through the trophic levels of this marine ecosystem, from the plankton to the larger predatory fish, sea birds, and marine mammals. Gut content analyses reveal that Pacific sand lance and Pacific herring feed primarily on calanoid copepods, while the surf perch has a more varied diet. Pacific sand lance and Pacific herring had low values on Levins’ standardized measure of niche breadth, indicating a narrow dietary breadth characteristic of a specialized diet. Surf perch had a higher value, indicating a wider dietary breadth and more generalist feeding approach. Morista’s measure of niche overlap was used to quantify dietary overlap between the species. Pacific sand lance and Pacific herring had a high rating, which could indicate competition for the same prey items. Both of these species’ dietary overlap with surf perch was much lower, suggesting little competition for prey items. The diet composition of surf perch exhibited significant temporal variation. The diet composition of Pacific sand lance did not exhibit significant temporal variation, but did exhibit significant spatial variation between Jackson Beach and the sand wave channel. By quantifying these measures of compositional, temporal, and spatial variation in forage fish diets, we can now better understand the types of resource partitioning that are influencing trophic exchange in the San Juan Archipelago...|$|R
