5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-70 the San Rafael <b>Swell</b> was relatively inaccessible and not well known or explored. There were, however, a few efforts to protect the <b>swell</b> as early as 1935. Since {{the construction}} of the freeway the number of visitors to the <b>swell</b> has increased significantly, as the <b>swell</b> can now be accessed by automobile. As such, several groups are increasing efforts for protected status of the area, via National Park, National Monument or wilderness designation.|$|E
5|$|Octave couplers, which add {{the pipes}} an octave above (super-octave) or below (sub-octave) each note that is played, may operate on one {{division}} only (for example, the <b>Swell</b> super octave, which adds the octave above {{what is being}} played on the <b>Swell</b> to itself), or act as a coupler to another keyboard (for example, the <b>Swell</b> super-octave to Great, which adds to the Great manual {{the ranks of the}} <b>Swell</b> division an octave above what is being played).|$|E
5|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside the <b>swell.</b> At the summit is another view area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the <b>swell</b> until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the <b>swell.</b> The eastern descent features one brake check area and two runaway truck ramps to aid trucks down. About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the <b>swell,</b> the San Rafael Reef. Just as the highway exits the <b>swell</b> it passes {{to the north of}} Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits the <b>swell</b> near Green River.|$|E
50|$|Due to deep-water {{channels}} on {{both sides}} of the Bukit Peninsula, <b>swells</b> are mainly found there. Strong currents make for larger <b>swells</b> at low tide. During these lower tides and large <b>swells,</b> the Peak, Racetracks, and Temples are all under white water, and Bombie and Outside Corner take the <b>swells,</b> creating 15 ft waves. At high tide, small <b>swells</b> will be more prevalent, creating barrels.|$|R
50|$|The Marshallese {{recognized}} {{four main}} ocean swells: the rilib, kaelib, bungdockerik and bundockeing. Navigators focused on effects of islands in blocking <b>swells</b> and generating counterswells to some degree, but they mainly concentrated on refraction of <b>swells</b> {{as they came}} in contact with undersea slopes of islands and the bending of <b>swells</b> around islands as they interacted with <b>swells</b> coming from opposite directions. The four types of ocean <b>swells</b> were represented in many stick charts by curved sticks and threads.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} the Interstate Highway System was in the {{planning}} stages, no paved road had yet entered the San Rafael <b>Swell.</b> The established highway through the area was US-6/US-50 which, like the railroad, entered Utah from Colorado and turned north around the <b>swell.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Robert S. Dietz and {{his colleagues}} first {{identified}} the <b>swell</b> behavior. It was suggested that the cause was mantle upwelling. Later work pointed to tectonic uplift, caused by reheating within the lower lithosphere. However, normal seismic activity beneath the <b>swell,</b> as well as lack of detected heat flow, caused scientists to suggest dynamic topography as the cause, in which {{the motion of the}} hot and buoyant mantle plume supports the high surface topography around the islands. Understanding the Hawaiian <b>swell</b> has important implications for hotspot study, island formation, and inner Earth.|$|E
5|$|Some {{portions}} of I-70 over the Pavant Range and Wasatch Plateau were opened to traffic before the portion over the San Rafael <b>Swell.</b> These portions were temporarily signed as State Route4. The portion over the San Rafael <b>Swell</b> opened to traffic in 1970, finally making the Utah portion of I-70 a drivable route.|$|E

50|$|As DESRON 11 {{began their}} {{exercise}} {{run down the}} California coast, {{they made their way}} through these <b>swells</b> and currents. While the squadron was traveling through these <b>swells</b> and currents, their estimations of speed and bearing used for dead reckoning were being affected. The navigators aboard the lead ship USS Delphy did {{not take into account the}} effects of the strong currents and large <b>swells</b> in their estimations. Since the navigators in the lead ship USS Delphy did not account for the current and <b>swells</b> in their estimations, the entire squadron was off course and positioned near the treacherous coastline of Honda Point instead of the open ocean of the Santa Barbara Channel. Coupled with darkness and thick fog, the <b>swells</b> and currents caused by the earthquake in Japan made accurate navigation nearly impossible for the USS Delphy. The geography of Honda Point, which is completely exposed to wind and waves, created an extremely deadly environment once the unusually strong <b>swells</b> and currents were added to the coastline.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Swells</b> {{are often}} created by storms long {{distances}} {{away from the}} beach where they break, and the propagation of the longest <b>swells</b> is only limited by shorelines. For example, <b>swells</b> generated in the Indian Ocean have been recorded in California after {{more than half a}} round-the-world trip. This distance allows the waves comprising the <b>swells</b> to be better sorted and free of [...] as they travel toward the coast. Waves generated by storm winds have the same speed and will group together and travel with each other, while others moving at even a fraction of a metre per second slower will lag behind, ultimately arriving many hours later due to the distance covered. The time of propagation from the source t is proportional to the distance X divided by the wave period T. In deep water it is [...] where g is the acceleration of gravity. [...] As an example, for a storm located 10000 km away, <b>swells</b> with a period T=15 s will arrive 10 days after the storm, followed by 14 s <b>swells</b> another 17 hours later.|$|R

This allows devices that are installed in the power system damage. Therefore, we have generated voltage sags and <b>swells</b> to simulate events that occur in power systems for virtual reality. In this paper, voltage sags and <b>swells</b> generator (SSG) using the principles by d-, q-axis can be arbitrary control of the magnitude and phase of the injection voltage. The simulation results can confirm, the SSG can generate the arbitrary voltage sags/swells with in phase, phase lead or phase lag...|$|R

40|$|Numerical wave {{models are}} {{powerful}} tools for investigating global wave climate. Here a global wave hindcast is employed {{to estimate the}} global pattern of crossing <b>swells.</b> However, the global patterns of crossing <b>swells</b> derived from the model {{are different from those}} derived from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wave mode products of quasi-linear inversion, indicating one of them is questionable. The comparison shows that the first two most energetic <b>swells</b> inversed by SAR are often not in accordance with the first two most energetic <b>swells</b> in the model, and this will have a large impact on the statistics of the data. Before this problem is solved, SAR wave products of quasi-linear inversion should be treated with care in wave climate studies...|$|R
5|$|An {{important}} {{area of research}} concerned the Wigner effect. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the graphite moderator can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure.

5|$|In 1979 Peter Galton and James A. Jensen {{described}} a fragmentary femur {{belonging to a}} hadrosauroid discovered in Arches National Park. Utah. Various hadrosauroid teeth had also been found in quarries of small vertebrates in the western region of the San Rafael <b>Swell,</b> near Castle Dale in Emery County, Utah; they were described in 1991 by J. Michael Parrish. Subsequently, in 1993, Carole Jones and her husband Ramal Jones discovered fragmentary bones in a fossil site located in the northwestern region of the <b>Swell.</b> They brought the site {{to the attention of}} Donald Burge, director of the institution then called the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum (CEUM). The site, which is formally known as CEUM Locality 42em366v, would subsequently be named Carol's Site (sic) in her honour. The fossils, stored under the specimen number CEUM 9758, represent the partial remains of an adult hadrosauroid, including parts of the skull, vertebrae, ischium, and leg. CEUM 5212, a partial skull and forelimb from an adult, was found nearby in CEUM Locality 42em369v. CEUM 8786, a left femur from an adult, was discovered later in Carol's Site, and was not described until 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{prolonged}} westward {{track of}} Hurricane Fefa produced <b>swells</b> {{of up to}} 15feet (4.5m) in height. The <b>swells</b> hit eastward facing beaches along the island of Hawaii. The <b>swells</b> washed debris and sea water onto coastal roads near Punaluu Black Sand Beach, resulting in the roads being closed following the storm. Southwestern Maui experienced rough surf, as well. Despite being a weak tropical depression and a tropical wave while moving through the Hawaiian Islands, Fefa produced locally strong wind gusts of up to 50mph (80km/h) in the islands of Hawaii and Maui.|$|R
30|$|It is {{noticed that}} the HVRT codes are defined for the voltage <b>swells</b> in steady state and they only address the {{symmetrical}} situations. Voltage <b>swells</b> can occur due to the removal of large loads, shunt capacitor energization and so on [10, 11, 12]. Unfortunately, the loads are unbalanced in general [13], and switching operations of circuit breakers in the transmission lines and the shunt capacitors are not synchronous either [14]. Thus, voltage <b>swells</b> during the practical fault recovery change with transients and unbalances. Such phenomena largely increase the ride-through difficulties in the RECS.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{information about the}} criteria {{to be used for}} predicting the extreme load and fatigue damage on an FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) system in complicated wave conditions in areas such as those of West Africa and Offshore Brazil where both sea and <b>swells</b> exist and propagate in different directions. The analysis criteria for predicting the extreme response applicable to an FPSO at an intended site and in transit conditions are presented. More importantly, various stress cycle counting methods have been utilized for accurate fatigue damage prediction of the FPSO structural components under the combined waves and <b>swells.</b> The random loading due to the combined waves and <b>swells</b> is assumed to be a combination of two narrowbanded Gaussian processes. The resultant fatigue damage due to the waves and <b>swells</b> is then evaluated by introducing the appropriate stress cycle counting correction. Utilizing the environmental data, which include <b>swells</b> and waves propagating in different directions, the analysis results of extreme load response and fatigue damage calculations are presented. The background information about the analysis results is provided...|$|R
