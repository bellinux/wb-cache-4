This account was issued just after Attlee had replaced Churchill as Prime Minister, and was the only official statement on the British contribution for fifteen years.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the <b>statements</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> prosecutions of persons because of their sexual orientation, {{the head of the}} delegation said that homosexuality is a purely private matter, with a long history in Senegal, and is not in itself a cause for prosecution. The prosecutions referred to occurred only when the homosexual relations took place in public and were of an obtrusive nature, therefore placing them in conflict with morality and religion. Concerning decriminalization, it is necessary to take account of the culture, and avoid exacerbating the rejection of homosexuals and endangering their lives.|$|E
25|$|Excited utterances: <b>Statements</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> startling {{events or}} {{condition}} made while the declarant {{was under the}} stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. This is the exception that may apply to the 'police officer' scenario listed above. The victim's cries of help were made under the stress of a startling event, and the victim is still under {{the stress of the}} event, as is evidenced by the victim's crying and visible shaking. An excited utterance {{does not have to be}} made at the same time of the startling event. A statement made minutes, hours or even days after the startling event can be excited utterances, so long as the declarant is still under the stress of the startling event. However, the more time that elapses between a startling event and the declarant's statement, the more the statements will be looked upon with disfavor.|$|E
2500|$|Harriet Lowe was {{attacked}} while {{in bed with}} Louis Besumer. As is mentioned previously, Lowe was hacked above her left ear and found unconscious {{at the scene of}} the crime before she was rushed to Charity Hospital. Lowe became the center of a media circus, as she continually made scandalous and often false <b>statements</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> both the attacks and the character of Louis Besumer, some of which are described in the preceding description. The Times-Picayune sensationalized Lowe and her outspoken nature upon discovering that she was not the wife of Besumer, but his mistress. [...] A Charity Hospital source discovered the scandal, when Besumer asked to be directed to the room of [...] "Mrs. Harriet Lowe," [...] and was inevitably denied access as no woman by that name was a patient. [...] Besumer's legal wife arrived from Cincinnati in the days immediately following the discovery, which further inflamed the ongoing drama. [...] Lowe further gained media attention as she repeatedly made statements which voiced her dislike of the New Orleans chief of police, as well as her reluctance to comply with police questioning. [...] After the truth of her marital status was revealed publicly, Lowe told reporters from the Times-Picayune that she would no longer aid the police in their investigation, as she suspected that it had been Chief Mooney who first informed the press of the scandal. [...] Despite the scandal, and her delirious statements which suggested that Besumer was a German spy, Lowe returned to the home she shared with Besumer weeks after the attack. [...] One side of her face was partially paralyzed due to the severity of the attack. [...] Lowe died August 5, 1918, just two days after doctors performed surgery in an effort to repair her partially paralyzed face. [...] Just prior to her death, Lowe told authorities that she suspected it was Louis Besumer who had attacked her.|$|E

2500|$|Outside of patch notes, Hello Games had {{effectively}} gone {{silent on}} social media right after the game's release up until {{the announcement of the}} Foundation update in late November 2016. Murray, who used the Hello Games' Twitter account with some frequency before release, had not been visible online for the first two months following the game's release. In the announcement of this update, Hello Games admitted to being [...] "quiet" [...] but have been paying attention to the various criticisms levelled at the game. [...] Schreier from Kotaku and Ben Kuchera of Polygon commented that some of the negative player reaction was {{due to a lack of}} clarification on these apparently missing features from either Hello Games or Sony in the weeks just after release, with Kuchera further stating that with the silence from either company, [...] "the loudest, most negative voices are shouting unopposed" [...] and leading to a strong negative perception of the game. Kuchera later wrote that many of the issues in the lead-up and follow-up to No Man's Skys release, whether by choice or happenstance, provide many lessons on the importance of proper public relations. Kuchera specifically pointed to the decision to withhold review copies and an apparent lack of public relations (PR) to manage <b>statements</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> what features would be in the game. Kuchera also noted that many people had taken the hype generated by the press only to be disappointed by the final game, and that consumers did have ways to evaluate the game following its release before they purchased the title. Sony president Shuhei Yoshida admitted that Hello Games did not have [...] "a great PR strategy" [...] for No Man's Sky, in part for lacking a dedicated PR staff to manage expectations, but still support the developers as they continue to patch and update the game. Jesse Signal, writing for the Boston Globe noted that some of the hype for No Man's Sky may be attributed to game journalists themselves for getting too excited about the game, positing [...] "Had journalists asked certain questions at certain times, perhaps it would have been more difficult for Hello Games to make promises it couldn’t deliver on." ...|$|E

60|$|It must be remembered, however, {{in respect}} to all such <b>statements</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> the {{efficiency}} of the bow and arrow, that the force with which an arrow can be thrown depends not upon any independent action of the bow, but altogether upon the strength of the man who draws it. The bow, in straightening itself for the propulsion of the arrow, expends only the force which the man has imparted to it by bending it; so that the real power by which the arrow is propelled is, after all, the muscular strength of the archer. It is true, a great deal depends on the qualities of the bow, and also on the skill of the man in using it, to make all this muscular strength effective. With a poor bow, or with unskillful management, a great deal of it would be wasted. But with the best possible bow, and with the most consummate skill of the archer, it is the strength of the archer's arm which throws the arrow, after all.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Viewed indeed {{from that}} {{position}} which {{was occupied by}} ancient philosophers, the existing contrarieties between nations might well appear inexplicable, and intellectual powers {{might seem to be}} the exclusive heritage of particular nations. But Christianity leads us to distinguish between the nature of man as he came fresh from the hands of his Creator, and that natural propensity to sin which he has inherited in consequence of his fall from original innocence. It teaches that as God has [...] "made of one blood all nations to dwell together {{on the face of the}} whole earth," [...] and has given in virtue of this common origin one common nature destined to be pure and holy and divine, so, by virtue of Redemption and Regeneration, the image of God may be restored in all, and whatever is the result of his depravity therefore may be overcome. And this seems to be the answer to all <b>statements</b> <b>relating</b> <b>to</b> the want of capacity in certain nations of the earth for the reception of Divine Truth, that every man, because he is a man, because he is a partaker of that very nature which has been taken into the Person of the Son of God, may by the grace of God be awakened to the sense of his true life, of his real dignity as a redeemed brother of Christ.|$|E

30|$|The {{qualitative}} data analysis was a two-step process. First, we used descriptive coding (Saldaña 2013, p. 87) to categorize data by basic theoretical ideas that were relevant from our literature review. Our coding tree started with “self-efficacy,” “achievement emotions,” and “situational interest” {{as the major}} coding categories under which other codes emerged both from theory and the data itself. Under the “self-efficacy” codes, <b>statements</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> beliefs about progress and ability to complete tasks were all coded. We also coded <b>statements</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> effort as a sub-code under self-efficacy, because students’ self-reflections regarding their own effort were often tied to their sense of efficacy overall. Under the “achievement emotions” codes, we again sorted stated emotions as either positive or negative in valence, high or low in activation, and activity or outcome related. Finally, under the “situational interest” codes, we coded any <b>statements</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> “hooks” or triggers that described students’ initial topical attention, as well as statements regarding enjoyment, persistence, continuity, and overall engagement.|$|R
