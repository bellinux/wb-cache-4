40|$|Specifications {{of state}} {{machines}} in CafeOBJ are called equational theory specifications (EQT <b>Specs)</b> {{which are based}} on equational logic, and in Maude are called rewrite theory specifications (RWT <b>Specs)</b> {{which are based on}} rewriting logic. The translation from EQT <b>Specs</b> to RWT <b>Specs</b> achieves the collaboration between CafeOBJ’s theorem proving facilities and Maude’s model checking facilities. However, translated specifications by existing strategies are of inefficiency and rarely used for model checking in practice. This paper defines a specific class of EQT <b>Specs</b> called EADS <b>Specs,</b> and proposes a strategy for the translation from EADS <b>Specs</b> to RWT <b>Specs.</b> It is proved that translated specifications by the strategy are more efficient than those by existing strategies...|$|R

In 2006, German-based Yager Development pitched a cover-based shooter to publisher 2K Games, who rejected the original concept of futuristic soldiers without Dubai as a setting.
