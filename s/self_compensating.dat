40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design and}} manufacturing method for a new surface <b>self</b> <b>compensating</b> hydrostatic bearing. A lumped resistance model was {{used to analyze the}} performance of the bearing and provide guidance on laying out the bearing features. One arrangement of bearing features was cut into a flat sheet of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene which was then formed into a cylindrical shape. The shaped plastic was adhered to an aluminum housing then connected to a pump. Experimental data shows that the lumped resistance model provides a good estimation of the bearing performance. After validating the analytical model, sensitivity studies were conducted to predict changes in the bearing performance due to manufacturing variances. The results of the model indicate the design is extremely robust. by Anthony Raymond Wong. Thesis (S. M.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2012.

40|$|A {{comparison}} between active and passive sensing of soil moisture over vegetated areas is studied via scattering models. In active sensing three contributing terms to radar backscattering can be identified: (1) the ground surface scatter term; (2) the volume scatter term representing scattering from the vegetation layer; and (3) the surface volume scatter term accounting for scattering from both surface and volume. In emission three sources of contribution {{can also be}} identified: (1) surface emission; (2) upward volume emission from the vegetation layer; and (3) downward volume emission scattered upward by the ground surface. As ground moisture increases, terms (1) and (3) increase due to increase in permittivity in the active case. However, in passive sensing, term (1) decreases but term (3) increases for the same reason. This <b>self</b> <b>compensating</b> effect produces a loss in sensitivity to change in ground moisture. Furthermore, emission from vegetation may be larger than that from the ground. Hence, the presence of vegetation layer causes a much greater loss of sensitivity to passive than active sensing of soil moisture...|$|E

Currently, a remotely operated vision based camera {{is used to}} track a particular target whilst the USV approaches the intended target. While the USV is in motion, the hydrodynamic forces and mechanical vibrations {{makes it difficult for}} the operator to lock on to the target at all times. This thesis addresses this issue through the development of a <b>self</b> <b>compensated</b> motion controller that uses geo-pointing to track and lock onto a target at all times. The disturbance data as captured by the onboard IMU sensor is used to establish parameters for the compensator. The compensated pan tilt angles are fed to the vision based camera through a PID controller.

40|$|Abstract:-A novel {{high and}} low speed output buffer circuit is {{proposed}} for Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface applications. Operation principles of this novel buffer are developed based on slew rate control and delayed turn-on technique. The mechanism for slew rate control is process variation <b>self</b> <b>compensating.</b> So, both precise rise and fall times of the output signal have been obtained for low speed operation. Moreover, the pull-up and pull-down output drivers are divided into several sub-drivers in parallel with the delayed turn-on characteristics. Therefore, the change of rate of di/dt decreases. And the simultaneous switching noise, based on simulations, are reduced from maximum overshoot 3. 47 V to 3. 36 V and maximum undershoot from- 0. 427 V to- 0. 068 V, respectively. This proposed output buffer design is low cost due to its easy realization in a digital CMOS process. The disclosed output buffer has been integrated in a complete USB transceiver circuit. Based on measured silicon data, satisfactory functions of the whole USB application IC have been obtained...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{studies the}} problem of calculating the {{electric}} field of the 110 kV electric lines of CSCPL (Controlled <b>Self</b> <b>Compensating</b> Power Lines) type. The potential of electrical conductors is determined by a system of equations for voltages {{taking into account the}}re phase shift at every moment of time. set of values of the voltages in the system, taking into account the phase shift of the voltage vectors in time. We dispose the possibilities that ensure to calculate the linear values of capacity and inductance of the line knowing the electric field characteristics for a given geometry. The electric line with the horizontal placement of wires is studied. The repartition of the electric field for the limited domain of a square with sides of 100 x 100 m, the edges of which have zero values of potential is determined. To obtain a numerical solution of Dirichlet formulated problem we will consider the domain as a set of small triangles. As the approximate solution of the formulated problem, we will consider the piecewise-defined function, which must be continuous in the domain and of linear nature on each triangle. To calculate the electric fields when changing the phase shifting angle for voltages of conductors displaced close {{to each other in the}} 0 - 1800 frequency band and of different values of discretization time on the period of fundamental wave of voltage, the method of finite volumes has been used. The results of numerical calculation of the character of repartition of the potential in the field of the line for different values of time and of a phase shift of the vectors of applied voltages to the conductors of close phases for the 110 kV line of CSCPL type have been showed...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} challenge of designing robust integrated circuits in the deep sub micron regime {{in the presence of}} lithography process variability. By extending and combining existing process and circuit analysis techniques, flexible software frameworks are developed to provide detailed studies of circuit performance in the presence of lithography variations such as focus and exposure. Applications of these software frameworks to select circuits demonstrate the electrical impact of these variations and provide insight into variability aware compact models that capture the process dependent circuit behavior. These variability aware timing models abstract lithography variability from the process level to the circuit level and are used to estimate path level circuit performance with high accuracy with very little overhead in runtime. The Interconnect Variability Characterization (IVC) framework maps lithography induced geometrical variations at the interconnect level to electrical delay variations. This framework is applied to one dimensional repeater circuits patterned with both 90 nm single patterning and 32 nm double patterning technologies, under the presence of focus, exposure, and overlay variability. Studies indicate that single and double patterning layouts generally exhibit small variations in delay (between 1 - 3 %) due to <b>self</b> <b>compensating</b> RC effects associated with dense layouts and overlay errors for layouts without self-compensating RC effects. The delay response of each double patterned interconnect structure is fit with a second order polynomial model with focus, exposure, and misalignment parameters with 12 coefficients and residuals of less than 0. 1 ps. The IVC framework is also applied to a repeater circuit with cascaded interconnect structures to emulate more complex layout scenarios, and it is observed that the variations on each segment average out to reduce the overall delay variation. The Standard Cell Variability Characterization (SCVC) framework advances existing layout-level lithography aware circuit analysis by extending it to cell-level applications utilizing a physically accurate approach that integrates process simulation, compact transistor models, and circuit simulation to characterize electrical cell behavior. This framework is applied to combinational and sequential cells in the Nangate 45 nm Open Cell Library, and the timing response of these cells to lithography focus and exposure variations demonstrate Bossung like behavior. This behavior permits the process parameter dependent response to be captured in a nine term variability aware compact model based on Bossung fitting equations. For a two input NAND gate, the variability aware compact model captures the simulated response to an accuracy of 0. 3 %. The SCVC framework is also applied to investigate advanced process effects including misalignment and layout proximity. The abstraction of process variability from the layout level to the cell level opens up an entire new realm of circuit analysis and optimization and provides a foundation for path level variability analysis without the computationally expensive costs associated with joint process and circuit simulation. The SCVC framework is used with slight modification to illustrate the speedup and accuracy tradeoffs of using compact models. With variability aware compact models, the process dependent performance of a three stage logic circuit can be estimated to an accuracy of 0. 7 % with a speedup of over 50, 000. Path level variability analysis also provides an accurate estimate (within 1 %) of ring oscillator period in well under a second. Another significant advantage of variability aware compact models is that they can be easily incorporated into existing design methodologies for design optimization. This is demonstrated by applying cell swapping on a logic circuit to reduce the overall delay variability along a circuit path. By including these variability aware compact models in cell characterization libraries, design metrics such as circuit timing, power, area, and delay variability can be quickly assessed to optimize for the correct balance of all design metrics, including delay variability. Deterministic lithography variations can be easily captured using the variability aware compact models described in this dissertation. However, another prominent source of variability is random dopant fluctuations, which affect transistor threshold voltage and in turn circuit performance. The SCVC framework is utilized to investigate the interactions between deterministic lithography variations and random dopant fluctuations. Monte Carlo studies show that the output delay distribution in the presence of random dopant fluctuations is dependent on lithography focus and exposure conditions, with a 3. 6 ps change in standard deviation across the focus exposure process window. This indicates that the electrical impact of random variations is dependent on systematic lithography variations, and this dependency should be included for precise analysis...|$|E
2500|$|Cabinets {{need to be}} {{maintained}} on a regular schedule. During this certification check, the airflow and the filter capacities are verified. The filters have a limited lifespan - determined by the air quality within the laboratory space {{and the amount of}} particles and aerosols generated inside the BSC' work zone. As these filters load, the internal fan is required to do more work to push/pull the same volume of air through them. Newer cabinets measure the air flow constantly and <b>self</b> <b>compensate</b> fan performance to ensure constant volumes of air moving through the filters and the cabinet. If the flow drops below desired performance an audio and visual alarm will alert the operator. Changing the filter should be limited to trained persons as the filter is potentially contaminated. This can be done either after the cabinet has been decontaminated using a gaseous procedure (using Formaldehyde, Chlorine Dioxide or Vaporized Hydrogen Peroxide) or a [...] "bag-in/bag-out" [...] procedure.|$|R

40|$|Narrow {{bandpass}} filters {{have historically}} been designs of quarter waves at the passband wavelength, and have been monitored at the turning points using the passband wavelength. By direct monitoring at the passband wavelength, errors {{have been shown to}} be primarily <b>self</b> <b>compensated,</b> and have allowed much better performance than could otherwise be expected. The turning points are difficult to detect precisely and accurately because the change in transmittance with thickness becomes zero at the desired termination point. By proper design with non-quarter-wave layers, essentially the same spectral performance can be achieved by layer terminations that are far enough from turning points to be significantly more sensitive termination points. The design approach is to maintain the optical thickness of the reflector layer pairs at one half-wave of the passband wavelength, but change the ratio of the optical thicknesses of the high and low index layers. These can be adjusted enough so that the thicker layers contain two turning points and the last turning point in the layer can be more accurately and precisely determined. The error compensation benefit from the historic method should be maintained. This leads to potentially improved control during deposition and monitoring of narrow bandpass filters...|$|R

We discuss the evolutionary consequences of disturbance on plant mating systems, and in particular whether reproductive assurance through <b>selfing</b> effectively <b>compensates</b> for reduced outcrossing. The extent to which disturbance reduces pollinator versus mate availability could generate diverse selective forces on reproductive traits.

We report here the identification of a self-compensation behavior in a variety of ferromagnetic Sm intermetallics via the fingerprint of a shift in the magnetic hysteresis (M-H) loop from the origin. Such an attribute, designated as exchange bias in the context of ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic multilayers, accords these compounds a potential for niche applications in spintronics. We also present results on magnetic compensation behavior on small Gd doping (2. 5 atomic percent) in one of the Sm ferromagnets (viz. SmCu(4) Pd).

40|$|Self-control devices, such as {{rehabilitation}} programs, group commitment, {{and informal}} fines, can make time-inconsistent smokers better off. Health economists {{have used this}} result to argue in favor of cigarette taxes that restrain smoking. However, taxes alone are not Pareto-improving overall, because they benefit today's smoker {{at the expense of}} her future selves, who have less demand for self-control. We suggest an alternative class of taxation policies that provide selfcontrol and benefit a smoker at every point in life. Smokers could be allowed to purchase smoking licenses' when they start to smoke, and in exchange commit their future <b>selves</b> to face <b>compensated</b> cigarette taxes. We show that this scheme which could be made voluntary improves the welfare of current and future smokers, generates positive revenue for the government, and can be made incentive-compatible. Similar schemes can also be envisioned to address problems of timeinconsistency in other contexts. ...|$|R
5000|$|In any case, {{even if it}} is true {{that every}} {{possible}} outcome occurs in some world, it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred (even if the total number of worlds with each type of outcome is infinite, it is still possible to assign a different measure to different infinite sets). The physicist David Deutsch, a strong advocate of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, has argued along these lines, saying that [...] "By making good choices, doing the right thing, we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives. When you succeed, all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too. What you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen."

50|$|The {{classical}} {{definition of}} a closed loop system for human movement comes from Jack A. Adams (1971) : „ A closed loop system has feedback, error detection and error correction as key elements. There is a reference that specifies the desired value for the system, and {{the output of the}} system is fed back and compared to the reference for error detection and, if necessary corrected..... A closed loop system is <b>self</b> regulating by <b>compensating</b> for deviating from the reference.”Most movements that are carried out during day-to-day activity are formed using a continual process of accessing sensory information and using it to more accurately continue the motion. This type of motor control is called feedback control, as it relies on sensory feedback to control movements. Feedback control is a situated form of motor control, relying on sensory information about performance and specific sensory input from the environment in which the movement is carried out. This sensory input, while processed, does not necessarily cause conscious awareness of the action. Closed loop control is a feedback based mechanism of motor control, where any act on the environment creates some sort of change that affects future performance through feedback. Closed loop motor control is best suited to continuously controlled actions, but does not work quickly enough for ballistic actions. Ballistic actions are actions that continue to the end without thinking about it, even when they no longer are appropriate.Because feedback control relies on sensory information, it is as slow as sensory processing. These movements are subject to a speed/accuracy trade-off, because sensory processing is being used to control the movement, the faster the movement is carried out, the less accurate it becomes.|$|R
