5000|$|Aricia icarioides {{has been}} {{classified}} {{in at least}} four different genera since it was named by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1852. It started out in Lycaena, was transferred to Icaricia by [...] Nabokov (Hodges et al., 1983), moved to Aricia by Bálint and Johnson (1997), merged with some other genera in the <b>supergenus</b> Plebejus by Gorbunov (2001), which was accepted by Opler & Warren (2003), however, Lamas (2004) among others use Aricia. Synonymy, subgenera, and subspecies vary considerably depending on the author.|$|E
40|$|The author {{shows that}} several groups of species can be {{distinguished}} in the genus or <b>supergenus</b> Liolaemus Wiegmann, outside the subgenus Ortholaemus already recognized (Laurent, 1983 a). The typical subgenus Liolaemus sensu stricto includes most Chilean species a few Argentinian and some Bolivian and Peruvian forms. An Argentinian group which includes most Argentinian, Bolivian and Peruvian species (several undescribed), can be named Eulaemus Girard, 1854. A Patagonian primitive group includes L. kingi, L. archiforus and L. ruizleali; its name could be Rhytidodeira Girard, 1957. The genus Vilcunia Donoso-Barrios and Cei can be considered another subgenus comprising, besides V. silvanae and V. periglacialis, L. lineomaculatus Boulenger. Lastly the southermost species, L. magellanicus, constitutes by itself a monotypical group related to Vilcunia. Asociación Herpetológica Argentina (AHA...|$|E
40|$|A {{cytogenetic}} analysis, {{including the}} karyotype, C-bands, silver-stained nucleolus organizer regions and genome size, {{was performed on}} the recently discovered species, Karsenia koreana, the first plethodontid salamander from Asia. The karyotype consists of 14 pairs of bi-armed chromosomes, with no evidence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. C-banding reveals a concentration of heterochromatin at the centromeres as well as at interstitial locations. The smallest chromosome (pair number 14) has symmetrical interstitial C-bands in each arm, resembling chromosome no. 14 of North American species of its sister group taxon, <b>supergenus</b> Hydromantes. A comparative analysis of C-band heterochromatin and silver-stained nucleolus organizer regions of Karsenia and other plethodontid genera reveals that chromosomal evolution may have featured chromosome Frepatterning_ within the context of conserved chromosome number and shape in this clade. Genome size is correlated with geographic distribution in plethodontids and appears to have important phenotypic correlates as well. The genome size of Karsenia is relatively large, and resembles that of the geographically closest plethodontids from western North America, especially species of the genus Hydromantes. The biological significance of thes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Plethodontids, a {{monophyletic}} group, comprise {{about 60}} % of living salamanders. Many have a tongue {{that may be}} projected rapidly and for a distance up to half the body length. Previous {{studies have focused on}} the functional morphology of the projectile tongue and the comparative morphology of the feeding system in the family. Here we present a working hypothesis for the phylogeny of plethodontids and a scenario for the evolution of tongue feeding based on the phylogenetic hypothesis. Primitive and derived states are identified and transformation series proposed for 30 char-acters. Four alternative phylogenetic hypotheses are presented. Our choice of a preferred phy-logenetic hypothesis is based on consideration of conflicting characters and tongue projection mechanics. The preferred hypothesis is not 'the most parsimonious, in a strict technical sense, because several homoplasious characters appear (on functional grounds) to be closely associated with attainment of tongue projectility, which itself has evolved several times. In our hypothesis the bolitoglossines and plethodontines are sister taxa. They in turn are the sister taxon of the hemidactylines, and this grouping is the sister taxon of the desmognathines. Within the boli-toglossines, Batrachoseps is the sister taxon of the Neotropical genera (<b>supergenus</b> Bolitoglossa) ...|$|E
40|$|Although {{salamanders}} {{are characteristic}} amphibians in Holarctic temperate habitats, in tropical regions they have diversified evolutionarily only in tropical America. An adaptive radiation centered in Middle America occurred {{late in the}} history of a single clade, the <b>supergenus</b> Bolitoglossa (Plethodontidae), and large numbers of species now occur in diverse habitats. Sublineages within this clade decrease in number from the northern to southern parts of Middle America, and in Costa Rica, there are but three. Despite this phylogenetic constraint, Costa Rica has many species; the number of salamander species on one local elevational transect in the Cordillera de Talamanca may be the largest for any such transect in the world. Extraordinary variation in sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b within a clade of the genus Bolitoglossa in Costa Rica reveals strong phylogeographic structure within a single species, Bolitoglossa pesrubra. Allozymic variation in 19 proteins reveals a pattern largely concordant with the mitochondrial DNA phylogeography. More species exist than are currently recognized. Diversification occurs in restricted geographic areas and involves sharp geographic and elevational differentiation and zonation. In their degree of genetic differentiation at a local scale, these species of the deep tropics exceed the known variation of extratropical salamanders, which also differ in being less restricted in elevational range. Salamanders display “tropicality” in that although speciose, they are usually local in distribution and rare. They display strong ecological and physiological differentiation that may contribute importantly to morphological divergence and species formation...|$|E
40|$|Virus {{taxonomy}} {{has received}} little {{attention from the}} research community despite its broad relevance. In an accompanying pa-per (C. Lauber and A. E. Gorbalenya, J. Virol. 86 : 3890 – 3904, 2012), we have introduced a quantitative approach to hierarchically classify viruses of a family using pairwise evolutionary distances (PEDs) {{as a measure of}} genetic divergence. When applied to the six most conserved proteins of the Picornaviridae, it clustered 1, 234 genome sequences in groups at three hierarchical levels (to which we refer as the “GENETIC classification”). In this study, we compare the GENETIC classification with the expert-based picornavirus taxonomy and outline differences in the underlying frameworks regarding the relation of virus groups and genetic diversity that represent, respectively, the structure and content of a classification. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce two novel diagrams. The first connects the genetic diversity of taxa to both the PED distribution and the phylogeny of picornavi-ruses. The second depicts a classification and the accommodated genetic diversity in a standardized manner. Generally, we found striking agreement between the two classifications on species and genus taxa. A few disagreements concern the species Human rhinovirus A and Human rhinovirus C and the genus Aphthovirus, which were split in the GENETIC classification. Furthermore, we propose a new <b>supergenus</b> level and universal, level-specific PED thresholds, not reached yet by many taxa. Since the species threshold is approached mostly by taxa with large sampling sizes and those infecting multiple hosts, it may represent an upper limit on divergence, beyond which homologous recombination in the six most conserved genes between two picornaviruses might not give viable progeny...|$|E
