It is widely accepted that the Brown problem is a general term of investigating subjects in various science fields relevant to the Markov process, such as the material science, the information science, the life science, the social science, and so on. The extended diffusion equations are used for various sciences fields. In that case, they sometimes have a <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> of their concerned elements, for example, such as a local equilibrium relation between native defects in silicon crystal in the material science or between predation and prey in the life science.

40|$|In {{resource}} constrained {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) it {{is important}} to utilize energy efficiently. Data dissemination is mainly responsible for the consumption of energy in sensor nodes (SNs).

In this paper, a Tier based Energy Efficient protocol (TBEE) providing <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> mobility in WSNs has been proposed. TBEE protocol has been designed so that fewer SNs located nearer to the dissemination point (DP) respond to the sinks message for grid formation thereby reducing message overheads. TBEE exploits an improved approach of communication amongst the SNs so that the collisions are reduced. TBEE efficiently handles the movement of the sinks and sources in the network and reduces the overheads associated with their mobility.

40|$|The marine {{nitrogen}} (N) inventory {{is controlled}} by the interplay of nitrogen loss processes, here referred to as denitrification, <b>and</b> nitrogen <b>source</b> processes, primarily nitrogen fixation. The apparent stability of the marine N inventory on time scales longer than the estimated N residence time, suggests some intimate balance between N <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> <b>sources.</b> Such a balance may be perceived easier to achieve when N <b>sinks</b> <b>and</b> <b>sources</b> occur in close spatial proximity, and some studies have interpreted observational evidence for such a proximity as indication for a stabilizing feedback processes.

Contrary to current notion, a balanced N inventory requires a regional separation of N <b>sources</b> <b>and</b> <b>sinks.</b> This can be brought about by factors that reduce the growth of diazotrophs, such as iron, or by factors that affect the fate of the fixed nitrogen remineralization, such as dissolved organic matter dynamics.

40|$|Zea mays plants kept at ambient (ca 375 ppm) and {{elevated}} CO₂ (ca 650 to 700 ppm) {{were used to}} examine the possibility of a symplasmic loading, unloading and transport pathway in dark-adapted and illuminated (200 μmolm⁻²sec⁻¹) <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> leaves. 5, 6 -carboxyfluorescein diacetate was introduced into the mesophyll cells and symplasmic transfer observed 3 h after application. In <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> leaves exposed to ambient CO₂ and illuminated at 200 molm- 2 sec- 1, the fluorescence front was observed approximately 3 cm from the point of application, while in dark-adapted plants, the fluorescence front was observed approximately 1 cm from the point of application. Under elevated CO₂ conditions the fluorescence front in illuminated plants appeared to transport faster moving approximately 5 cm from the point of application, and in dark-adapted plants, only 3 cm from the point of application. Based on the increase in 5, 6 -CF accumulation under elevated CO₂ conditions, the present study suggests that there was an increase in capacity for assimilate loading and transport under elevated CO₂ conditions. In source leaves, 5, 6 -CFDA was taken up into the mesophyll cells, loaded symplasmically and transported basipetally. In sink leaves 5, 6 - CFDA was taken up from basal mesophyll and after symplasmic loading, was transported acropetally where it was offloaded into the younger immature sink region. Transport in the sieve tubes was confirmed by using aniline blue, which was applied 3 h after 5, 6 -CF transport. Aniline blue coupled with 5, 6 -CF transport studies showed that the sieve tubes of both cross and longitudinal veins are involved in symplasmic unloading, loading and transport processes in <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> leaves. Apoplasmic uptake of 5, 6 -CFDA by cut leaves showed that after apoplasmic transport via the transpiration stream, 5, 6 -CFDA was offioaded to the xylem parenchyma where it was metabolically cleaved, releasing fluorescent 5, 6 -CF into the xylem parenchyma. Transverse sections cut after 3 h of uptake were observed after 120 and 180 min suggesting that a retrieval of solutes occurs from the xylem to the xylem parenchyma, bundle sheath, phloem parenchyma and to the th in-walled sieve tubes. It was not possible to determine if the thick-walled sieve tubes were involved or if they took up 5, 6 -CF. Given the available data on loading and offioading of assimilates in <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> leaves respectively, this study demonstrated that a slow symplasmic pathway exists from the mesophyll to the phloem, and that offloading from the phloem in sink leaves can occur via a symplasmic route...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyse the accumu-lation of amino acid in source and sink tissues of {{variegated}} Coleus blumei Benth. leaves during an extended exposure to salinity stress. The imposed stress resulted in a reduction in shoot height and leaf size, as well as a reduction in total protein and nitrogen content in both the <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> tissues. At the same time, accumulation of low molecular weight nitrogen-containing compounds in Coleus leaves was observed, which peaked within the first 10 d of exposure to salinity, and then declined, but remained slightly elevated for the remainder of the study. A number of amino acids were found to accumulate in both the <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> tissues, including arginine, asparagine, and serine. A larger proportion of asparag-ine and less arginine was observed in the sink tissue than the source tissue of the salinity-stressed plants. This difference may reflect the mobility of these compounds in the phloem. No proline was found to accu-mulate in either the source or sink tissue during the exposure to salinity.

40|$|Publis 013 -agap- 074 The {{ability to}} {{assimilate}} C and allocate non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) {{to the most}} appropriate organs is crucial to maximize plant ecological or agronomic performance. Such C source and sink activities are differentially affected by environmental constraints. Under drought, plant growth is generally more sink than source limited as organ expansion or appearance rate is earlier and stronger affected than C assimilation. This favors plant survival and recovery but not always agronomic performance as NSC are stored rather than used for growth due to a modified metabolism in source and sink leaves. Such interactions between plant C and water balance are complex and plant modeling can help analyzing their impact on plant phenotype. This paper addresses the impact of trade-offs between C <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> activities and plant production under drought, combining experimental and modeling approaches. Two contrasted monocotyledonous species (rice, oil palm) were studied. Experimentally, the sink limitation of plant growth under moderate drought was confirmed {{as well as the}} modifications in NSC metabolism in source and sink organs. Under severe stress, when C source became limiting, plant NSC concentration decreased. Two plant models dedicated to oil palm and rice morphogenesis were used to perform a sensitivity analysis and further explore how to optimize C <b>sink</b> <b>and</b> <b>source</b> drought sensitivity to maximize plant growth.
