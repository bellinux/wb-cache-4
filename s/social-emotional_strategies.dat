30|$|By and large, social-emotional {{development}} programmes {{for early}} childhood are mainly formulated {{on the basis}} of interpersonal interactions that take place between the adults and children in those programmes (Durlak et al. 2011). There are different curriculum models focusing on promoting the social-emotional development and school readiness of young children, one of which is the Wisconsin Pyramid Model for Supporting Social Emotional Competence in Infants and Young Children. Developed by two national centres in the United States, the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning (CSEFEL) and the Technical Assistance Center on Social Emotional Interventions (TACSEI) in the US, this model provides a multidimensional framework that promotes the social-emotional well-being of children (Hemmeter et al. 2014). It includes systems and policies to ensure an effective workforce, provision of support for children through nurturing and responsive relationships and high-quality learning environments, prevention of risky behaviour through some targeted <b>social-emotional</b> <b>strategies,</b> and provision of early interventions for children with risky behaviour (Hemmeter et al. 2014). The Mayor–Salovey model is an information processing model that helps to operate the cognitive and emotional systems. It focuses on enhancing children’s capacity to move from emotional perception to integration, understanding, and finally management (Salovey et al. 2000). The social emotional learning (SEL) model describes a process for life skill learning, and focuses on reinforcing positive behaviours and reducing negative behaviours. Positive behaviours include the improvement of social-emotional skills, attitudes towards interpersonal relationships, and behaviour within a classroom. Negative behaviours include reducing conduct problems and emotional distress (Durlak et al. 2011; Greenberg et al. 2003). However, the main focus of these programmes is on the children, and tends to overlook the importance of teachers and parents in child behaviour. Only a few programmes have also emphasised the enhancement of social-emotional well-being in teachers and parents in order become “changing agent[s]” to young children under their care.|$|E
40|$|Universal classroom-based {{social skills}} and {{violence}} prevention training is currently a topic of widespread interest. Although {{there is a growing}} body of empirical support for some existing social skills programs, less is known about contributions of specific program components to intervention outcomes. Empathy training is one common component of social skills curricula that has been subject to relatively little research. The current study is a single-school quasi-experimental investigation of Second Step empathy training effects on 57 first- and fourth-graders. Dependent variables included self-reported empathy, teacher-reported social skills, teacher-reported problem behaviors, and fourth-graders 2 ̆ 7 self-reported social skills. The study also explored teachers 2 ̆ 7 use of <b>social-emotional</b> teaching <b>strategies,</b> assessed with a brief self-report frequency measure, and their perceptions of program effects and procedures, solicited in follow-up interviews. Results suggest that intervention and comparison students, as a group, did not differ in pre-post effects on quantitative measures of empathy, social skills, or problem behaviors. However, additional exploratory analyses suggest that first grade intervention students may have maintained pre-intervention levels of teacher-reported social skills, while first grade comparison students declined. Intervention teachers reported an increase in use of <b>social-emotional</b> teaching <b>strategies</b> and positive perceptions of program effects and procedures. Strengths and limitations of the study as well as implications for future research and practice are discussed. ...|$|R
