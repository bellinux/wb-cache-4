25|$|Pakistani women lack {{social value}} and status because of {{negation}} of {{their roles as}} producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male {{members of the family}} are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the public arena, while female members are imparted domestic <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in the public arena. This situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills while others have. What does seem clear is that the socially anxious perceive their own social <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E

500|$|Once coded, the team's game systems did {{not work}} as intended. Prototypes of the systems and of certain {{missions}} were built {{near the beginning of}} development, which revealed some of the team's planning mistakes. For example, the early tests of the conversation system and user interface were flawed, but the team had time to revise them before the game's release. The team also found augmentations and <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less interesting than they had seemed in the design document. Colleagues from other companies—such as Doug Church, Rob Fermier, Marc LeBlanc, and Gabe Newell—noticed and pointed out these deficiencies in game [...] "tension" [...] when they played the prototype. In response, Harvey Smith substantially revised the augmentations and skills. Production milestones served as wake-up calls for the game's direction. A May 1998 milestone that called for a functional demo revealed that the size of the game's maps caused frame rate issues, {{which was one of the}} first signs that maps needed to be cut. A year later, the team reached a milestone for finished game systems that Spector nicknamed the [...] "Wow, these missions suck" [...] milestone, which led to better estimates for their future mission work and to the reduction of the 500-page design document to 270 pages. Spector recalled Smith's mantra on this point: [...] "less is more".|$|E
500|$|While some of {{the larger}} mines {{provided}} separate eating areas for bal maidens, others obliged male and female workers to eat together, a cause of consternation among some observers concerned that exposure to the [...] "coarse joking" [...] and [...] "rude behaviour" [...] of men had a negative effect on the [...] "modesty and delicacy" [...] expected of women. Other contemporary concerns were that heavy protective clothing led them to be unfeminine, that working in the constant view of men caused the bal maidens to have an unhealthy interest in their own appearance and attractiveness, that spending long hours at work meant {{that they did not have}} time to learn the <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good housewives. [...] (Barham's 1841 investigations found no evidence to the claim that bal maidens grew up to be poor housewives, concluding that [...] "they are for the most part tender mothers and industrious wives [...] the laborious occupations to which they have been inured make household duties appear comparatively light".) Other contemporary observers noted that bal maidens were generally good natured and well behaved, and often devoutly religious, but it is well-documented that bal maidens typically took great pride in their own appearance and clothing. Many contemporary observers commented on the high fashion of the clothing worn by bal maidens on Sundays and holidays; although the disposable income of a bal maiden was low, they would sometimes form [...] "dress clubs" [...] to buy fashionable clothing which they would take turns wearing.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers were {{in favor}} of Storm of Zehirs focus on {{exploration}} and the ability to postpone or ignore the game's main storyline, and they compared the gameplay to older role-playing video games such as Icewind Dale II and Fallout. GameZone's reviewer said [...] "This is a game that harkens back to the good old days of adventure D video-gaming", and IGN said [...] "this feels like an homage to the old school D games of the past". [...] The ability to handcraft an entire party instead of just the main character was welcomed, with GameSpot's reviewer noting [...] "Rather than playing as a solo hero chosen for some great destiny, you roll up a party of four average joes just like you did way back when in D classics like the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale franchises," [...] (It should be noted that Baldur's Gate did not actually contain the ability to create the entire party in single player mode; however, in multiplayer, this was possible) [...] and IGN saying [...] "There's a strange kind of nerd joy when it comes to creating a D party". [...] Reviewers also appreciated the [...] "Party Conversation System", which allows typically underutilized social <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used by the entire party during conversation. [...] GameSpy said [...] "It's a terrific convention in which the game responds not to one but to every member of an adventuring party.

2500|$|The captivity storylines took a {{different}} route by using the characters of Ziva and Michael Rivkin to symbolize the [...] "two Israels American policy makers have faced over the years". Ziva is [...] "the cooperative and quiet Israeli, who has the technical and personal <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of enormous assistance in achieving the mission" [...] while Rivkin is [...] "bright and pro-American, {{but in this case}} tough, aggressive, thinks he knows {{what is best for the}} United States better than the Americans, is sly and wily, and he doesn't heed the advice of his American counterparts". Both are received differently by the American agents—Ziva is respected and trusted by her colleagues; Rivkin is an object of suspicion. Steven L. Spiegel, Director of the Center for Middle East Development and Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), drew parallels between their interactions with their American counterparts and those of prominent Israeli politicians. Ziva, he reasoned, could be likened to Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, or Ehud Olmert in that she is able to agree with the American agencies on a more basic, fundamental level. Rivkin, he continued, was more like Yitzhak Shamir.|$|E
2500|$|Patriarchal values heavily {{govern the}} social {{structure}} in Pakistani society in the rural areas. In comparison, urban centers {{of the country as}} well as semi-peripheral regions are slowly moving towards shifting gender roles that are more inclusive. Around 70% of working women in Pakistan work outdoors according to the Asian Development Bank policy brief on female workforce participation in Pakistan 2016. The general perception of culturally traditional gender roles that, specifically, a woman is expected {{to take care of the}} home as wife and mother, whereas the male dominates outside the home as a breadwinner, are questionable in certain sectors. In agricultural work, within rural areas, both men and women work in the fields and are expected to contribute equally to household work. In a survey by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics 2013-2014, it was reported that 26% of women are in the labor force ( [...] approximately 15 million). There is a traditionally conceptual idea of segregation of men and women into two distinct worlds. However, this materializes differently in different parts of the country. Only in the most of rural-isolated regions in the country [...] is this idea of gender roles strictly followed. Poverty is one of the major factors in unequal household resources allocation in the favor of sons due to their role in society outside the home. Therefore, education for boys is prioritized over girls, because it is perceived that boys must be equipped with educational skills to compete for resources in the public arena; while girls have to specialize in domestic <b>skills</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good mothers and wives. Hence, education is not perceived as being important for girls.|$|E
