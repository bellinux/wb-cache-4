40|$|Abstract: <b>Streptozocin</b> {{has been}} shown to be useful in the {{clinical}} treatment of malignant neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. The poor prognosis for patients having malignant tumors of pancreas suggests the investigation and development of new therapeutics. Nine analogs to <b>streptozocin</b> are determined by in silico physicochemical analysis and generation of structures by modeling from functional group isosteres. In these analogs is preserved the alkylating nitrosourea moiety, however, the covalently bonded substituent has significant hydrogen bonding sites and may include a ring structure. Analogs retain a broad range in lipophilicity, having a range of Log P from- 2. 798 (hydrophilic) to 3. 001 (lipophilic). Standard deviation of molecular masses is only 12. 6 % of the group mean, so a small alteration in size occurs which is also reflected by only a 15. 5 % deviation in molecular volumes. <b>Streptozocin</b> and seven analogs show zero violations of the Rule of 5 which suggests favorable bioavailability. All compounds showed at least seven hydrogen bond acceptors with a strong positive correlation between hydrophilicity to the total number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors. Analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) and discriminant analysis determined that <b>streptozocin</b> is highly similar to all nine analogs. However hierarchical cluster analysis and K-means cluster analysis were able to elucidate patterns of associations and differentiation among the ten compounds.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{attempted}} to identify changes in gene expression which are associated with neuropathic pain using subtractive suppression hybridization analysis of the lumbar spinal cord of animals suffering <b>streptozocin</b> induced diabetic neuropathy. Using this approach, we found a significant up-regulation of several key components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. These findings were confirmed by Western blot analysis, which demonstrated that the levels of active ERK 1 and 2 correlated {{with the onset of}} streptozocin-induced hyperalgesia. Intrathecal administration of the selective MAPK/ERK-kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 198306 dose-dependently (1 – 30 μg) blocked static allodynia in both the <b>streptozocin</b> and the chronic constriction injury (CCI) models of neuropathic pain. The antihyperalgesic effects of PD 198306, in both the <b>streptozocin</b> and CCI models of neuropathic pain, correlated with a reduction in the elevated levels of active ERK 1 and 2 in lumbar spinal cord. Intraplantar administration of PD 198306 had no effect in either model of hyperalgesia, indicating that changes in the activation of ERKs and the effect of MEK inhibition are localized to the central nervous system. In summary, we have demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the development of neuropathic pain is associated with an increase in the activity of the MAPK/ERK-kinase cascade within the spinal cord and that enzymes in this pathway represent potential targets for the treatment of this condition...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Type 1 {{diabetes}} (T 1 D) {{is caused}} by an autoimmune disorder that destroys pancreatic beta islet cells. Little is known about how T 1 D affects susceptibility to Candida infection. The present study was done to establish T 1 D in older, obese mice and then to use this T 1 D model to standardize a Candida albicans infection. Methods: Study 1 :Swiss Webster female mice (17 - 18 weeks old) were given increasing doses intraperitoneally of <b>streptozocin</b> (140 mg/kg- 180 mg/kg), which targets beta islet cells, to determine what dose would produce T 1 D (urinary glucose level of 2. 0 by testing with Diastix strips). Study 2 : Following onset of T 1 D on day 12, mice (n= 4 - 5 /Group) were challenged with 9. 8 X 10 ex 3 to 1. 1 X 10 ex 6 C. albicans and monitored to d 28 for morbidity. Results: Mice began to show T 1 D on day 9 - 10 following <b>streptozocin</b> treatment, which was maintained up to d 28 in surviving mice. 140 mg/kg <b>streptozocin</b> produced T 1 D in these mice without any mortality and then used to produce T 1 D in mice subsequently challenged with different doses of C. albicans. Survival was 50 % for 2. 6 X 10 ex 4 yeast and 40 % for 9. 8 X 10 ex 3 yeast; survival was 0 % for 1. 2 X 10 ex 5 or 1. 1 X 10 ex 6 yeast. Conclusion: A T 1 D model can be produced in older, obese mice without mortality following administration of 140 mg/kg <b>streptozocin,</b> and a lethal infection with C. albicans can then be established in these mice with a challenge dose of about 5 X 10 ex 5 yeast.

The {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the anti-diabetic activity of commercially available extract of these herbal plants in <b>streptozocin</b> induced diabetic rats and its comparison to standard antidiabetic drug glibenclamide. Methods: The study was carried out with albino rats of either sex weighing between 100 - 150 gm. All the rats were intraperitonially injected with 35 mg/kg of <b>streptozocin</b> in citrate buffer. Blood glucose was estimated after 1 week high fat diet and rats having blood glucose > 200 mg/dl were considered diabetic and included in further study. They were divided into 6 groups of 6 rats each. Six groups were given different interventions as distilled water (which were control rats), Tinospora cordifolia extract low dose (200 mg/kg/day), Tinospora cordifolia extract high dose (400 mg/kg/day), Phyllanthus emblica extract low dose (200 mg/kg/day), Phyllanthus emblica extract high dose (400 mg/kg/day) and standard drug glibenclamide (0. 6 mg/kg/day). All the rats received allocated drugs for further 6 weeks. Blood glucose was measured every 2 weeks till the end of sixth weeks by glucose-oxidase method.

40|$|Skeletal muscle glucose {{transport}} is {{altered in}} diabetes in humans, {{as well as}} in rats. To investigate the mechanisms of this abnormality, we measured glucose transport Vmax, the total transporter number, their average intrinsic activity, GLUT 4 and GLUT 1 contents in skeletal muscle plasma membrane vesicles from basal or insulin-stimulated <b>streptozocin</b> diabetic rats with different duration of diabetes, treated or not with phlorizin. The glucose transport Vmax progressively decreased with the duration of diabetes. In the basal state, this decrease was primarily associated with the reduction of transporter intrinsic activity, which appeared earlier than any change in transporter number or GLUT 4 and GLUT 1 content. In the insulin-stimulated state, the decrease of transport was mainly associated with severe defects in transporter translocation. Phlorizin treatment partially increased the insulin-stimulated glucose transport by improving the transporter translocation defects. In conclusion, in <b>streptozocin</b> diabetes (a) reduction of intrinsic activity plays a major and early role in the impairment of basal glucose transport; (b) a defect in transporter translocation is the mechanism responsible for the decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose transport; and (c) hyperglycemia per se affects the insulin-stimulated glucose transport by altering the transporter translocation...|$|E

Plasma insulin, endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), norepinephrine (NE), aldosterone, and angiotensin II levels were measured. AT 1 receptor, ET- 1, and ETA receptor mRNA expression in the aorta was evaluated by real-time PCR. Results. After 9 months, systolic blood pressure (SBP) in high-fat diet group was {{higher than in the}} normal control group (155. 4 ± 1. 6 vs. 132. 1 ± 5. 3 mmHg, P< 0. 01). The levels of plasma insulin in high-fat diet group were higher than in normal control group (116. 63 ± 12. 31 μIU/mL versus 29. 10 ± 4. 92 μIU/mL, P< 0. 01). High-fat diet group also exhibited higher plasma levels of ET- 1, NE, aldosterone, and angiotensin II,and a lower 24 h urinary sodium excretion than the normal control group (P< 0. 05). The expression of AT 1 receptor, ET- 1 and ETA receptors in the aorta in the high-fat diet group was greater than in the normal control group (P< 0. 05). <b>Streptozocin</b> treatment reduced SBP by an average of 20. 9 ± 3. 3 mmHg (P< 0. 05), and reduced insulin level from 110. 63 ± 14. 86 μIU/mL to 39. 45 ± 6. 59 μIU/mL (P< 0. 01). The <b>streptozocin</b> group also showed a higher level of urine sodium excretion, and a lower level of plasma ET- 1 and NE than in the high-fat diet control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions. Hyperinsulinemia following high-fat diet is associated with an elevation in blood pressure. Sodium retention, increased plasma endothelin- 1 and noradrenaline, as well as activation of renin-angiotensin system may all contribute to the blood pressure elevation...|$|E

Platinum-based chemotherapy has been the cornerstone of treatment for the poorly differentiated tumors. However, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors are quite chemoresistant and therapy options are limited. Octreotide analogs and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are widely acceptable treatments due to substantial efficacy and tolerable toxicity. On the contrary, monotherapy or combinations of the only approved cytotoxic agent <b>streptozocin</b> with other drugs have been almost abandoned because of excessive toxic events. In recent years, the combination of capecitabine and temozolomide has emerged as the most promising and efficacious treatment. The oral route of administration and the substantial improvement in the outcomes with manageable toxicity are the major advantages.

40|$|In islet transplantation, nonimmunological {{factors such}} as limited growth {{capacity}} or increased death rate could reduce the beta cell mass in the graft and lead to failure of the transplant. We studied the evolution of beta cell replication and mass after transplantation of insufficient, minimally sufficient, or excessive islet tissue. <b>Streptozocin</b> diabetic C 57 BL/ 6 mice received 150 or 300 syngeneic islets under the kidney capsule and normal mice received 300 islets. In <b>streptozocin</b> diabetic mice 300 islets restored normoglycemia; beta cell replication in transplanted islets was similar to replication in normal pancreas and beta cell mass in the graft remained constant. In contrast, 150 islets were insufficient to achieve normoglycemia; beta cell replication was increased initially but not by 18 or 30 d despite persistent hyperglycemia, and beta cell mass fell progressively. When islets were transplanted into normal recipients, beta cell replication remained normal but beta cells underwent atrophy and mass in the graft was substantially reduced. Therefore, with a successful islet transplant, in diabetic mice beta cell replication and mass remain constant. In contrast, when insufficient islet tissue is transplanted an initial increase in beta cell replication can not compensate for a decline in beta cell mass. When excessive islet tissue is transplanted, beta cell mass is reduced despite normal beta cell replication...|$|E

To determine whether this inability is due to inadequate insulin replacement, we studied fasted streptozocin-induced diabetic Lewis rats either untreated or after islet transplantation under the kidney capsule. Plasma glucose was increased in untreated diabetics and normalized by the islet transplantation (110 +/- 5, 452 +/- 9, and 102 +/- 3 mg/dl in controls, untreated diabetics, and transplanted diabetics, respectively). Plasma membrane and intracellular microsomal membrane vesicles were prepared from hindlimb skeletal muscle of basal and maximally insulin-stimulated rats. Islet transplantation normalized plasma membrane carrier-mediated glucose transport Vmax, plasma membrane glucose transporter content, and insulin-induced transporter translocation. There were no differences in transporter intrinsic activity (Vmax/Ro) among the three groups. Microsomal membrane GLUT 4 content was reduced by 30 % in untreated diabetic rats and normal in transplanted diabetics, whereas the insulin-induced changes in microsomal membrane GLUT 4 content were quantitatively similar in the three groups. There were no differences in plasma membrane GLUT 1 among the groups and between basal and insulin stimulated states.

Insulin resistance was induced by a 20 -d continuous intravenous infusion of nicotinic acid (NA). Normal animals showed compensatory increases in several measures of insulin secretion (fasting insulin [FI], acute insulin response to arginine [AIRarg], acute insulin response to glucose [AIRgluc], and glucose potentiation slope [delta AIRarg/delta G]), with no net change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAtc). STZ- 40 animals showed compensatory increases in FI, AIRarg, and AIRgluc, but delta AIRarg/delta G failed to compensate. Although FPG remained normal in this group during NA infusion, HbA 1 c rose significantly. STZ- 200 animals failed to show compensatory changes in both AIRgluc and delta AIRarg/delta G, with both HbA 1 c and FPG rising. These animals showed a paradoxical inhibition of insulin secretion in response to intravenous glucose during NA infusion, {{at a time when}} they were hyperglycemic. These data indicate that a significant degree of insulin resistance does not cause hyperglycemia in the presence of normal B cell function but, in animals with reduced B cell mass and superimposed insulin resistance, the degree of hyperglycemia is proportional to the degree of pancreatic B cell dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{there is}} {{evidence}} that diabetes affects seizure susceptibility, the underlying mechanism has not been completely understood. Several studies also suggest a pivotal role for KATP channels in the seizure modulation. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the seizure threshold induced by pentylenetetrazole in diabetic mice at different times (3 days, 1 – 8 weeks) after induction of diabetes with <b>streptozocin</b> and to examine the possible role of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in this manner. Our data showed a time-dependent alteration in the threshold in diabetic mice, reaching a peak on week 2 after <b>streptozocin</b> injection and declining significantly afterwards. The seizure threshold in 8 -week diabetic mice was even lower than control levels, though the difference was not significant. The KATP channel opener cromakalim (0. 1 – 30 μg/kg, i. p.) significantly increased the seizure threshold in control mice. Although the KATP channel blocker glibenclamide (0. 5, 1 mg/kg) had no effect, it prevented the effects of the potent dose of cromakalim (30 μg/kg) on seizure threshold in control mice. Glibenclamide (1 mg/kg, i. p.) also decreased the seizure threshold in 2 -week diabetic mice to the control levels which was blocked by pre-treatment with cromakalim (10 μg/kg, i. p.). Cromakalim (10 μg/kg, i. p.) significantly increased the seizure threshold in 8 -week diabetic mice which was inhibited by pre-treatment with glibenclamide (1 mg/kg, i. p.). We demonstrated a time-dependent alteration in the pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure threshold in diabetic mice. This phenomenon might be due to the probable alteration in the KATP channel functioning during the diabetic condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between neurofilament expression and/or phosphorylation in the proximal versus distal compo-nents of the sensory peripheral neuraxis was studied {{and related to}} disorders in structure and function of the distal axon of <b>streptozocin</b> (STZ) -induced diabetic rats studied for 14 weeks. The ability of neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) to prevent abnormalities in neurofilament biol-ogy was also investigated. Compared with age-matched controls, neurofilament heavy (NF-H) (3. 3 -fold) and neurofilament medium (NF-M) (2. 5 -fold), but not neu-rofilament light (NF-L), subunits accumulated in the proximal axon of sensory neurons of the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in untreated diabetic rats. Neuro-filament accumulation was prevented by NT- 3. Small-and large-diameter sensory neurons exhibited elevate...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{experimental}} diabetes in rodents {{induced by the}} p-cell toxin <b>streptozocin</b> {{have shown that the}} insulin-resistant glucose transport of peripheral tissues (muscle and adipose) in these animals can be ascribed in part to a pretranslational reduction of the major insulin-sensitive glucose transporter (GLUT 4) in these tissues. Because a central feature of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is an impaired ability of insulin to enhance glucose disposal in skeletal muscle, we examined the hypothesis that reduced expression of GLUT 4 is a characteristic finding in the skeletal muscle of subjects with NIDDM. Biopsies of skeletal muscles were obtained from 17 patients with NIDDM and 10 lean and 9 obese nondiabetic subjects. Among the diabetic subjects...|$|E
30|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} SD rat {{models were}} prepared {{according to the}} previous report [4, 10]. Thirty specimens of eight-week-old male rats were lightly anesthetized. The rats were randomly divided into three groups: the normal control group (n[*]=[*] 10), diabetic control group (n[*]=[*] 10), and MSC treatment group (n[*]=[*] 10). <b>Streptozocin</b> (STZ, Sigma–Aldrich S 1030) was dissolved in 0.1 -M citrate at pH 4.5 and was immediately injected into the abdominal cavities of the diabetic control group and MSC treatment group at a dose of 60 mg/kg. The normal control group received the same dose of citrate buffer injection. One week later, fast plasma glucose (FPG) amounts of all rats were examined, and those rats with plasma glucose concentration FPG[*]≥[*] 16.5 mmol/l were considered as diabetic rats.|$|E
40|$|Current {{analgesic}} {{therapy is}} dominated by NSAIDs and opiates, however these agents have limited efficacy {{in the treatment of}} neuropathic pain. The novel anticonvulsant agent gabapentin (Neurontin) {{has been shown to be}} an effective treatment for neuropathic pain in the clinic. Recent studies have demonstrated that gabapentin selectively interacts with the α 2 δ subunit of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) which may be important in its mechanism of action. Previous studies have identified a gabapentin analogue, 3 -methyl gabapentin, that stereoselectively interacts with the α 2 δ subunit of VDCCs. Thus, whilst (1 S, 3 R) 3 -methyl gabapentin binds to the α 2 δ protein with high affinity (IC 50 = 42 [*]nM), the corresponding (1 R, 3 R) isomer is 300 times weaker (Bryans et al., 1998 : J. Med. Chem., 41, 1838 – 1845). The present study examines the activity of diastereoisomers of 3 -methyl gabapentin in two rat models of neuropathic pain to assess the importance of an interaction with the α 2 δ subunit of VDCCs. (1 S, 3 R) 3 -methyl-gabapentin dose-dependently (10 – 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.) blocked the maintenance of static allodynia in the rat <b>streptozocin</b> and Chung models of neuropathic pain with MEDs of 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1. This isomer also dose-dependently blocked the maintenance of dynamic allodynia in both models with respective MEDs of 30 and 100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1. In contrast, (1 R, 3 R) 3 -methyl gabapentin (100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, p. o.) failed to block either static or dynamic allodynia in the <b>streptozocin</b> model. It is concluded that these data further support the hypothesis that the α 2 δ subunit of VDCCs plays an important role in the maintenance of mechanical hypersensitivity in models of neuropathic pain...|$|E
40|$|Diabetics have {{a higher}} {{incidence}} of urinary tract infection (UTI), are infected with a broader range of uropathogens, and more commonly develop serious UTI sequelae than nondiabetics. To better study UTI in the diabetic host, we created and characterized a murine model of diabetic UTI using the pancreatic islet β-cell toxin <b>streptozocin</b> in C 3 H/HeN, C 3 H/HeJ, and C 57 BL/ 6 mouse backgrounds. Intraperitoneal injections of <b>streptozocin</b> were used to initiate diabetes in healthy mouse backgrounds, as defined by consecutive blood glucose levels of > 250 mg/dl. UTIs caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UTI 89), Klebsiella pneumoniae (TOP 52 1721), and Enterococcus faecalis (0852) were studied, and diabetic mice were found to be considerably more susceptible to infection. All three uropathogens produced significantly higher bladder and kidney titers than buffer-treated controls. Uropathogens did not have as large an advantage in the Toll-like receptor 4 -defective C 3 H/HeJ diabetic mouse, arguing that the dramatic increase in colonization seen in C 3 H/HeN diabetic mice may partially be due to diabetic-induced defects in innate immunity. Competition experiments demonstrated that E. coli had a significant advantage over K. pneumoniae in the bladders of healthy mice and less of an advantage in diabetic bladders. In the kidneys, K. pneumoniae outcompeted E. coli in healthy mice but in diabetic mice E. coli outcompeted K. pneumoniae and caused severe pyelonephritis. Diabetic kidneys contained renal tubules laden with communities of E. coli UTI 89 bacteria within an extracellular-matrix material. Diabetic mice also had glucosuria, which may enhance bacterial replication in the urinary tract. These data support that this murine diabetic UTI model is consistent with known characteristics of human diabetic UTI and can provide a powerful tool for dissecting this infection in the multifactorial setting of diabetes...|$|E

Treatment with <b>streptozocin</b> resulted in a dramatic subjective and objective tumor response in this patient. Plasma VIP concentration fell into the normal range after four courses of treatment, diarrhea ceased after the third course of therapy, and measurable tumor mass markedly decreased during that same period of time. The patient remains in clinical remission with no evidence of tumor regrowth 18 months after the beginning of treatment. In this patient, plasma VIP measurements were an excellent marker of tumor activity and correlated well with objective disease measurements and clinical response...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—During hypoinsulinemia, when cardiac glucose {{utilization}} is impaired, {{the heart}} rapidly adapts to using more fatty acids. One {{means by which}} this is achieved is through lipoprotein lipase (LPL). We determined the mechanisms by which the heart regulates LPL after acute hypoinsulinemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We used two differ-ent doses of <b>streptozocin</b> (55 [D- 55] and 100 [D- 100] mg/kg) to induce moderate and severe hypoinsulinemia, respectively, in rats. Isolated cardiomyocytes were also used for transfection or silencing of protein kinase D (PKD) and caspase- 3. RESULTS—There was substantial increase in LPL in D- 55 hearts, an effect that was absent in severely hypoinsulinemic D- 100 animals. Measurement of PKD, a key element involved in increasing LPL, revealed that only D- 100 hearts showed an increase in proteolysis of PKD, an effect that required activatio...|$|E
