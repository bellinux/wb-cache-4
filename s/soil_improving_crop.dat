It is particularly beneficial because of its resistance to root-knot nematodes and is also a <b>soil</b> <b>improving</b> <b>crop</b> via nitrogen fixation. The Sunnhemp Research Station of Uttar Pradesh further researched Crotalaria juncea’s genotypic impact on fibre yield. Four different genotypes of Crotalaria juncea were observed for three years to determine which genotype would yield in a high fibre yield. Important data that was collected across the plant genotypes include height (cm), basal diameter (mm), green biomass weight (q/ha), fibre weight (q/ha), and stick weight (q/ha). Out of the four genotypes, namely SUIN-029, SUIN-080, SUIN-037, and SUIN-043, SUIN-029 was superior in resulting in a high fibre yield. [...] This genotype can even be used as a template for future breeding.|$|E

Vermicomposting is the process of conversion of organic wastes by earthworms to valuable humus like material which is used as a natural soil conditioner.

The country faces the soil fertility problems in different regions that can be managed by the use of available organic resources. In addition, the use of expensive chemical fertilizers that reduce the soil fertility can be minimized by developing the on-farm compost methods that help the farmers to use locally available resources.|$|R

In the alternative cropping systems study established in 1995, crop yields for organic system without any chemical input were 30 - 40 % lower than the conventional system with high inputs. But, lower input costs plus price premiums for organic produce normally more than offset lower yields, resulting in favourable economic performance and energy efficiency. Legume, green manure and compost manure helped to replace nutrients lacking in the <b>soil</b> and <b>improved</b> <b>crop</b> yields. In the organic system, amount of P removed in crop exceeded that of P replaced and this can be a major yield limiting factor. In amendments experiments, there was small effect of granular rock phosphate fertilizer and/or Penicillium bilaiae in increasing soil P level and crop yield in the application year. Other findings suggested the use of elemental S fertilizer, gypsum, manure, wood ash or alfalfa pellets to improve nutrient availability, and yield and quality of produce.

The Jift:soil 1 : 12 treatment and 4 L m - 2 Zebar treatment increased grain yield and biological yield of the faba bean crop.

Representative of four soils from Dalori, Chad-basin, Jimtilo, and Domboa-road areas of Maiduguri {{were selected for}} the study. The four land uses studied were cultivations of orchard, cereal, and leguminous crops alongside bare soil which served as a control. They are representatives of land use practices found throughout Maiduguri and its surrounds. The samples were subjected to rainfall from stationary rainfall simulator. Results showed runoff volumes, soil loss and soil erodibility varied with land use types and locations. Runoff volumes, soil loss and soil erodibility were all higher in cereal crop-cultivated lands, and least in leguminous-crop cultivated lands. Parallel to that, runoff, soil loss and soil erodibility were highest from soils taken from Dalori area, and they were least from soils collected from Chad basin area.

Two field experiments, one in 1999 and one in 2000, were conducted to study the influence of fertiliser placement, timing of inter-row hoeing, and driving speed on the weeding effect on different weed species and crop growth. Placement of fertiliser below the <b>soil</b> surface <b>improved</b> <b>crop</b> growth and grain yield in both years compared with placement on the surface, but weeds surviving hoeing were not more suppressed by the <b>improved</b> <b>crop</b> growth. Timing was not important in the one experiment, whereas hoeing twice with beginning in early April was most effective in the other experiment where weed growth over the winter had been vigorously. Driving speed had no influence on either the weeding effect or the yield, except for one case where increasing speed reduced the effect against well-developed weeds. As compared to non-weeded reference treatments, inter-row hoeing reduced total weed biomass by 60 - 70 % and tap-rooted and erect weed species in particular by 50 - 90 %. Sowing at 240 mm row spacing yielded less than 120 mm (Danish standard), and inter-row hoeing for winter wheat needs to be adapted to narrower row spacing to avoid such yield declines...|$|R

40|$|Soil drying and re-wetting (DRW) {{occurs at}} varying {{frequencies}} and intensities during crop production, and is deliberately used in water-saving irrigation techniques that aim to enhance crop water use efficiency. Soil drying not only limits root water uptake which can (but not always) perturb shoot water status, but also alters root synthesis of phytohormones and their transport to shoots to regulate leaf growth and gas exchange. Re-wetting the soil rapidly restores leaf water potential and leaf growth (minutes to hours), but gas exchange recovers more slowly (hours to days), probably mediated by sustained changes in root to shoot phytohormonal signalling. Partial rootzone drying (PRD) deliberately irrigates {{only part of}} the rootzone, while the remainder is allowed to dry. Alternating these wet and dry zones (thus re-wetting dry <b>soil)</b> substantially <b>improves</b> <b>crop</b> yields compared with maintaining fixed wet and dry zones or conventional deficit irrigation, and modifies phytohormonal (especially abscisic acid) signalling. Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) of rice can also improve yield compared with paddy culture, and is correlated with altered phytohormonal (including cytokinin) signalling. Both PRD and AWD can <b>improve</b> <b>crop</b> nutrition, and re-wetting dry soil provokes both physical and biological changes which affect soil nutrient availability. Whether this alters crop nutrient uptake depends on competition between plant and microbes for nutrients, with the rate of re-wetting determining microbial dynamics. Nevertheless, studies that examine the effects of soil DRW on both crop nutritional and phytohormonal responses are relatively rare; thus, determining the cause(s) of enhanced crop yields under AWD and PRD remains challenging...|$|R

Many short-term effects of biochar on soil chemical and biological properties may be explained by the observed increase of soil pH, largely reported in the recent scientific literature for acid or neutral soils.

Using batch reactors and column leaching experiments, we examined the response of a wood-derived biochar pyrolyzed at 450 °C to the addition of various quantities of HNO 3 or NaOH. Our results enable to identify both the dissolution of biochar’s mineral phases, e. g. calcite and Si/Al oxides, and cation exchange at the surface of biochar as the two major mechanisms explaining biochar’s buffering capacity. The importance of these mechanisms vary in dependence with time and pH evolution.
