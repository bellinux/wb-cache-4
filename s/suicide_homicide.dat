25|$|Based {{on a study}} {{released}} by Dallas Women's Foundation, sex trafficking of young girls {{is not an isolated}} phenomenon, but a widespread criminal activity in Texas. The research found that 740 girls under age 18 were documented being marketed for sex during a 30-day period in Texas, of whom 712 of these girls were being marketed through Internet classified web sites and 28 were being marketed through escort services. More information concluded from the research is that there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are women killed in domestic violence with former or current husbands, intimate partners or boyfriends in Texas over an entire year. There are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are females of all ages who died from complication due to AIDS in one year in Texas. And finally, there are more girls being trafficked for sex in Texas during one month than there are teen girls who died by <b>suicide,</b> <b>homicide,</b> and accidents in the state in one year.|$|E

40|$|Background: Homicides {{followed}} by the suicide of the perpetrator are a rare yet very serious form of interpersonal violence which occurs mainly in partnerships and families. It typically leads to widespread public interest and unease. No systematic research on <b>homicide</b> <b>suicide</b> has ever been conducted in the Netherlands. Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the nature and incidence of <b>homicide</b> <b>suicide</b> in the Netherlands in the period 1992 2005, using cases reported in both national and regional newspapers. Results: On the basis of newspaper accounts, <b>homicide</b> <b>suicide</b> occurred on average seven times per year during this time period. Spousal/consortial <b>homicide</b> <b>suicide</b> was predominant, {{followed by}} <b>homicide</b> <b>suicide</b> involving the perpetrator’s own children and familicide suicide. The perpetrators across all categories of <b>homicide</b> <b>suicide</b> were predominantly male; the victims were predominantly women and children. Firearms were used in the majority of the <b>homicides</b> and subsequent <b>suicides.</b> Conclusion: The domestic nature of <b>homicide</b> <b>suicide</b> events is discussed. Future research should aim to incorporate multiple methods in order to assess accurately the epidemiology of <b>homicide</b> <b>suicide</b> in the Netherlands...|$|R

40|$|Abstract * This review {{analyzes}} a body {{of research}} conducted by Lester and his colleagues {{in the last ten years}} on the effects of limiting access to lethal methods for <b>suicide</b> and for <b>homicide.</b> Results provide evidence that limiting access to a preferred method of committing <b>suicide</b> and <b>homicide</b> has a preventive effect, more clearly so for <b>suicide</b> than for <b>homicide.</b> However, there was also evidence that some switching of method may take place after limiting access to one method, again more clearly for <b>suicide</b> than for <b>homicide.</b> However, the body of research as a whole indicates that this line of investigation may prove fruitful in the future for documenting the impact of restricting access to lethal implements in the prevention of crime, and of other social and public health problems...|$|R

50|$|The beetle {{is black}} or dull and usually hairy. The species is often found {{underneath}} dead animals that have decomposed {{for several days}} to weeks. Their eating habits can cause a dead animal to become just a skeleton.

The adults generally arrive within 5 to 11 days following an animal's death. The larvae develop for five to seven weeks, and the adult beetles live for four to six months.|$|E
40|$|A longstanding debate {{focuses on}} whether <b>suicide</b> and <b>homicide</b> rates walk {{hand in hand}} or whether they are {{reciprocally}} related. Much {{of the research on}} this issue investigates whether <b>suicide</b> or <b>homicide</b> predominates in certain geographic areas or whether they trend together over time. We theorize that the degree of social integration and social regulation associated with birth cohorts is negatively related to both of these forms of lethal violence. We develop a common explanation for shifts in the age distributions of <b>homicide</b> and <b>suicide</b> in the United States from 1930 to 2000. In this context, <b>suicide</b> rates and <b>homicide</b> rates walk hand in hand and their parallel movements are associated with two variables linked to social integration and regulation. Research on <b>suicide</b> and <b>homicide</b> often appears in different venues and within different scholarly traditions.

5000|$|In 1877, Gilbert {{published}} Them Boots, another {{description of}} characters from the lowest class of society, {{as well as}} The City. Pursuing another favourite theme, the dangers of drink, Gilbert also published in 1877 Nothing but the Truth, an unvarnished picture {{of the effects of}} intemperance, and example of his many writings about the dangers of alcohol. 1879 saw the publication of Mrs. Dubosq's Bible, about a French Huguenot group in Spitalfields in the 18th century, and the possession of a 1650 Geneva Bible by a poor person. In 1880, Memoirs of a Cynic was a protest against cruelty and hypocrisy. This was followed in 1881 by Modern Wonders of the World, or the new Sinbad, a series of 10 stories told to London children by Hassan, the son of an Egyptian slave dealer. His last book, published in 1882, Legion, or the modern demoniac, returns to Gilbert's campaign against drink, which, he illustrated, leads to [...] "crime, profligacy, <b>suicide,</b> <b>homicide,</b> brutality, cruelty, pauperism, idiocy and insanity." ...|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{was first}} {{detected}} in human organs and fetal tissues {{in the late}} 19th century. In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of <b>suicides,</b> <b>homicides</b> and the arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, {{as well as with}} growth and transforming factors.

50|$|In general, Senior Peer Counseling {{volunteers are}} trained to provide one-on-one, (counselor and client) {{confidential}} counseling to other persons 50 {{years of age or}} older. The counseling sessions are goal-oriented or supportive and are in general one hour per week. The sessions are held in the client's home, a senior citizen center, or another confidential setting and are closely supervised by professionals, i.e., psychologists, marriage and family therapists, or social workers, who intervene, as appropriate, with suggestions about how to handle situations with clients or to provide resources.Confidentiality is only broken in exceptional circumstances, such as when there is suspected child or elder abuse or when the client reports he or she is at risk of <b>suicide,</b> <b>homicide,</b> or grave disability. In these events, counselings have specific reporting instructions to assure the safety of everyone concerned.Referrals to Senior Peer Counseling programs are often made by Adult Protective Services agencies, home health workers, hospitals, social workers, registered nurses, senior housing, or other agencies serving senior citizens.
