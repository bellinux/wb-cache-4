The <b>wire</b> <b>patterns</b> were transferred to the photoresist material by spatially selective electron beam exposure on the Ag nanocrystal wire shadowmask. Monte Carlo simulation was done to estimate the electron stopping power for the Ag nanocrystal shadowmask at low voltage...|$|R

Each junction forms a switch and the junction has a functional dimension in nanometers. The <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> selectively {{has at least}} two different voltage states, ranging from a 0 state to a 1 state, wherein there is an asymmetry {{with respect to the}} direction of current flow from the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> through one junction compared to another junction such that current flowing through one junction into (out of) the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> can open (close) while current flowing through the other junction out of (into) the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> can close (open) the switch, and wherein there is a voltage threshold for switching between an open switch and a closed switch. Further, methods are provided for latching logic values onto nanowiresin a logic array, for inverting a logic value, and for restoring a voltage value of a signal in a nano-scale wire.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} design rule correct routing, i. e. the avoidance of illegal <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns</b> during routing. These illegal <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns</b> are due to the set of design rules accompanying each specific technology. To avoid software tuning for different technologies, the routing space is modelled as a grid graph, and all design rules are {{described in terms of}} the grid graph, including rules that describe illegal <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns.</b> The problem of finding valid, (i. e. containing no illegal <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns)</b> minimum cost connections is shown to be NP [...] complete, even for single nets. Although this restriction occurs in most technologies, literature does not mention any routing algorithm capable of handling these situations correctly. Two heuristics are presented to solve the routing problem, both ensuring all paths found to be valid. 1 Introduction We are developing a generic layout system [3][4][7], in the sense that apart from the network to be laid out, also information a [...] ...|$|R

The study at hand is proposed {{to provide a}} new method and to introduce procedure {{to the design of}} <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> for a car seat heater for Kongsberg Automotive, KA. KA is a Norwegian company and a global provider of engineering, design, and manufacture for seat comfort, driver and motion control systems, fluid assemblies, and industrial driver interface products. The method that currently is used in the company to create a <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> is neither sufficient enough nor automated. In order to design the <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern,</b> at first procedure is handled by the designer. Secondly, car seat heater 2 D layout is imported and then, the dimensions of the elements are defined as constraints. Then VBA codes are opened and the program is run. The result will be a <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> in different 2 D layouts. To make the design process easier, we have modeled five different layouts; <b>wiring</b> <b>pattern</b> of one element, two elements, three elements, five elements (with two back sides) and one element trapezoidal 2 D layout. The algorithm written in VBA (Visual basic for application) creates the pattern according to the dimensions of the elements which are used as inputs to define constrained parameters. The created macros are simple to use and easy to modify, independent from the programming knowledge. The user is only responsible with parameter input and running the program.

50|$|Another {{source of}} ground noise is also caused by unequal induced current. If a {{positive}} <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> and negative <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> travel different physical paths to the amplifier input then {{the differences in}} induced currents will arrive at the amplifier input terminals as differences which will be amplified. Thus {{it is imperative that}} the positive and negative <b>signal</b> <b>wires</b> are dressed out {{in such a way as}} to ensure that they both experience equal induction from outside sources. Two popular methods include using coaxial wire (both conductors have the same axis of rotation everywhere they exist, and thus have similar inductive experiences), and twisted pair where the two conductors have the same axis of rotation (but don't always exist in the same path).|$|R

In particular, thin-walled drift tubes ("straws"), which are currently being attached to large detector units of several tens of square meters of surface, need to be equipped with wire locators along their <b>signal</b> <b>wires.</b> A wire locator has been developed together with an insertion device, especially for medium-sized drift tube systems, which significantly reduces the production time and avoids the danger of applying epoxy glue to the <b>signal</b> <b>wire.</b> The wire locator is being inserted in one single time-saving production step together with the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> itself. The proposed design is being compared to the rigid wire locators in use in the COMPASS straw tracking system at CERN. The investigation comprises both wire- centering capability and influence on the efficiency of adjacent detector regions, demonstrating the competitive performance of the proposed new system. Its sufficient mechanical reliability could be shown by means of an X-ray tomography; the attractively small influence on the drift field was determined in a test measurement using a silicon tracking system in a hadron beam.

The levers were grouped together in a building known as a [...] "signal box" [...] (UK & Australia) or [...] "interlocking tower" [...] (US). In the UK multiple <b>signal</b> <b>wires</b> were grouped together, and in station areas were commonly routed beneath platform faces just above rail level.

Multiple-neurite intersections were formed by a directed growth of neurites toward neurite intersections, they facilitated target switching by axons, and their frequency was elevated by activity through NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors. Thus, clustering and strengthening of synaptic connections by activity-reinforced multiple-neurite convergence may serve to imprint information onto <b>wiring</b> <b>patterns</b> and synaptic maps...|$|R
