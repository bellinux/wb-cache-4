25|$|Op-amps are {{designed}} {{to operate in the}} linear mode with negative feedback. Hence, an op-amp typically has a lengthy recovery time from saturation. Almost all op-amps have an internal compensation capacitor which imposes <b>slew</b> <b>rate</b> limitations for high frequency signals. Consequently, an op-amp makes a sloppy comparator with propagation delays that can be as long as tens of microseconds.|$|E
25|$|An {{operational}} amplifier can, if necessary, {{be forced to}} act as a comparator. The smallest difference between the input voltages will be amplified enormously, causing the output to swing to nearly the supply voltage. However, it is usually better to use a dedicated comparator for this purpose, as its output has a higher <b>slew</b> <b>rate</b> and can reach either power supply rail. Some op-amps have clamping diodes on the input that prevent use as a comparator.|$|E

The system was designed to fit either the M197 20mm three barreled cannon or the XM188 30mm three barreled cannon. In practice the M197 was the standard fit and the XM188 was not adopted for service.

25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} chip such as LM339 {{is designed to}} interface with a digital logic interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog to digital converter). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. <b>Slew</b> <b>rate</b> has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E

2500|$|Slewing: The amplifier's {{output voltage}} reaches its maximum rate of change, the <b>slew</b> <b>rate,</b> usually {{specified}} in volts per microsecond. When slewing occurs, further {{increases in the}} input signal {{have no effect on}} the rate of change of the output. Slewing is usually caused by the input stage saturating; the result is a constant current [...] driving a capacitance [...] in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its frequency compensation); the <b>slew</b> <b>rate</b> is limited by [...]Slewing is associated with the large-signal performance of an op-amp. [...] Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10. [...] Let the input be a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1 V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] After 10x amplification, the output should be a 10 V, [...] 100kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding <b>slew</b> <b>rate</b> of 1 V per microsecond. [...] However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5 V per microsecond <b>slew</b> <b>rate</b> specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5 V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5 V, 100kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10 V, 100kHz sawtooth.Next consider the same amplifier and 100kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100 mV rather than 1 V. [...] After 10x amplification the output is a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth with a corresponding <b>slew</b> <b>rate</b> of 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] In this instance the 741 with its 0.5 V per microsecond <b>slew</b> <b>rate</b> will amplify the input properly.Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000 V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5-100 V per microsecond. [...] For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a <b>slew</b> <b>rate</b> of 13 V per microsecond. [...] As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op-amps have low slew rates. [...] As an example, the LT1494 micropower op-amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001 V per microsecond <b>slew</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

This might give rise to a large constant current in the reverse direction for a short time while the diode is reverse biased. The magnitude of such a reverse current is determined by the operating circuit (i.e., the series resistance) and the diode is said to be in the storage-phase.

Research suggests that crushed recycled glass may be used effectively as a filter medium in systems of this type. Tests using pilot column filters indicate that when prepared and placed properly, the filtration abilities of crushed recycled glass are comparable to those of natural sand.
