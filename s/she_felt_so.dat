25|$|According to Woolf's memoirs, {{her most}} vivid {{childhood}} memories were not of London but of St Ives, Cornwall, {{where the family}} spent every summer until 1895. The Stephens' summer home, Talland House, looked out over Porthminster Bay, and is still standing, though somewhat altered. Memories of these family holidays and impressions of the landscape, especially the Godrevy Lighthouse, informed the fiction Woolf wrote in later years, most notably To the Lighthouse. She describes why <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> connected to Talland House in a diary entry dated March 22, 1921.|$|E
25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood {{the impact of their}} journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the boys' pet secret-agent platypus, Perry, {{breaks into}} the [...] of his foe, the evil Dr. Doofenshmirtz, only to {{discover}} that he is only putting a birthday party for his 16-year-old daughter Vanessa. Doofenshmirtz explains that he has been trying to give out the best birthday parties for her, but failed for some reasons, as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> extremely unhappy about her birthdays all her life (this was evident of several birthday photos that Doofenshmirtz shows to Perry in his wallet). Seeing this, Perry agrees to set aside his rivalry and help Doofenshmirtz prepare for the party.|$|E
60|$|For an hour {{they stood}} talking. Dolores said but little. <b>She</b> had <b>felt</b> no shyness with the stalwart sailor, but to this youth {{who had done}} her such signal service <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> unable <b>so</b> frankly to express her {{feelings}} of thankfulness.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{she wanted}} to go away. It {{occurred}} to her, like a miracle, that she might go away into another world. <b>She</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> doomed up here in the eternal snow, as if there were no beyond.|$|R

500|$|Angelou and {{her brother}} lived with their {{grandmother}} and her son, Uncle Willie, until Angelou was thirteen. [...] They briefly visited their mother in St. Louis, but {{at the age of}} eight Angelou was raped, and in retaliation the rapist was killed by members of her family. [...] <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> guilty for his death that she chose to stop talking to everyone but Bailey for several years. [...] They were sent back to Stamps, but when Bailey turned 14, they returned to their mother's care in San Francisco for his protection. [...] At first, Angelou was resistant and angry towards her mother for abandoning her and Bailey, choosing to call her [...] "Lady", and it took her several years to warm to her.|$|E
500|$|After English {{actor and}} comedian Russell Brand {{divorced}} Perry in late December 2011, {{she was so}} distraught over the event that she considered committing suicide. Greg Wells, who assisted Perry with the composition of [...] "By the Grace of God", commented on the situation: [...] "I think <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> kicked {{in the head and}} so publicly embarrassed at being divorced by a text message". After overcoming her suicidal thoughts and initial shock, she felt prompted to create a [...] "darker" [...] project as compared to her previous albums. Instead, she channelled the entire divorce event into [...] "By the Grace of God", in which its lyrics depict Perry battling against her suicidal thoughts while lying on her bathroom floor. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Perry spoke on how she felt during the breakup: [...] "Imagine what you go through. Imagine what happens when you go through a break up. We all go through break ups and we all get very depressed and desperate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although Cixi was {{generally}} in good health, according to palace records she suffered from reproductive health issues. Although {{she was the}} Xianfeng Emperor’s favorite concubine she had difficulties getting pregnant. In 1856 she finally {{gave birth to her}} only son, the future Tongzhi Emperor. According to medical files kept in the imperial palace, Cixi may have had difficulty conceiving because she suffered from a gynecological disease. In 1900 when she fled from the forces of the Eight-Power Alliance and escaped to Taigu, Shanxi, she fell into ill health due to a flare up of that disease. She was given a medicine called Dingkun dan 定坤丹 — [...] "Pill for settling kun", in which kun, a trigram from the Yijing, represents Earth but also women — which had been designed more than a century earlier for the women of the Qianlong Emperor's palace. After taking Dingkun Dan for a few days she {{is said to have been}} cured and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> grateful she had a plaque created to praise that drug.|$|E
60|$|Noel {{went up to}} the nursery, {{and stole}} in. A {{night-light}} was burning, Nurse and baby were fast asleep. She tiptoed through into her own room. Once there, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> suddenly <b>so</b> tired that she could hardly undress; and yet curiously rested, as if with that rush of emotion, Cyril and the past had slipped from her for ever.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Whitney {{burst into}} tears. She had kept up all day, {{sustained}} partly by indignation, and partly {{by the desire}} that Reuben should not see that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it; but the thought that all the village would believe Reuben guilty had cut her to the heart, and <b>she</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> unwilling to face anyone that, as soon as Mrs. Ellison had left, she had closed the shutters of her little shop; but she broke down, now, from her relief at hearing that someone besides herself believed the boy to be innocent.|$|R
60|$|If it was ridiculous, and if {{with her}} sense of the ridiculous <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>so,</b> <b>she</b> was unable to take it lightly, or to make him take it lightly. At some faint gleams which passed over her face he felt himself invited to regard it less seriously; {{but he did not}} try, even provisionally, and they fell into a silence that neither seemed to have the power of breaking.|$|R
60|$|But {{she paid}} small heed to his warning. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> light, so active, {{it seemed she}} could not tire.|$|E
60|$|Nettie {{realized}} that her task must be undertaken now, and wondered that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> quietly and almost mercilessly collected.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Prime at {{the moment}} said nothing; but when next she spoke her words showed her {{intention}} of having her things {{brought back to the}} cottage on the next day. I think it must be felt that Rachel had won the victory. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>so</b> herself, and was conscious that no further attempt would be made to carry her off to Dorcas meetings against her own will.|$|R
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her with a {{momentary}} fervor of interest and admiration which made Sydney (so gratefully and so guiltlessly attached to him) tremble with pleasure; he even stepped forward as if to approach her, checked himself, and went back again among his guests. Now, {{in one part of the}} room, and now in another, she saw him speaking to them. The one neglected person whom he never even looked at again, was the poor girl to whom his approval was the breath of her life. Had <b>she</b> ever <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> unhappy as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> now? No, not even at her aunt's school! ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Ruth tells Harry {{the reason}} she turned his {{proposal}} down was not because she didn't love him but that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that after <b>so</b> many years together they didn't need to display their feelings in such a way.|$|R
60|$|She laughed. She was not beautiful, but <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> at that moment. She {{glanced up}} at him, full of love and gratefulness.|$|E
60|$|Not {{for years}} had Billie Dore felt embarrassed, but <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> now. She judged herself unworthy {{to be the}} {{recipient}} of these very private confidences.|$|E

60|$|Rose {{came near}} going on. If she had, {{it would have}} lost her a good friend. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> that and <b>so,</b> when the Doctor {{put an arm around}} her to lead her back to the desk, she yielded, but she was still palpitating with the heat of her wrath.|$|R
60|$|He {{held her}} face between his two hands, and indeed {{it seemed as}} if he could not satiate his soul with looking into her eyes. In the midst of so much sorrow, such misery and such deadly fear, never had Marguerite <b>felt</b> quite <b>so</b> happy, never had <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> him <b>so</b> {{completely}} her own. The inevitable bodily weakness, which of necessity had invaded even his splendid physique after a whole week's privations, had made a severe breach in the invincible barrier of self-control with which the soul of the inner man was kept perpetually hidden behind a mask of indifference and of irresponsibility.|$|R
60|$|Many {{were the}} men who had looked in admiration at Virginia Maxon in the past, but never, <b>she</b> <b>felt,</b> with eyes <b>so</b> clean and brave and honest. There was no guile or evil in them, and because of it she {{wondered}} all the more that she could not face them.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} Miss Hepzibah so forgetful before," [...] said the patriarch to himself. [...] "She {{must have had}} a dinner yesterday,--no {{question}} of that! She always has one, nowadays. So where's the pot-liquor and potato-skins, I ask? Shall I knock, and see if she's stirring yet? No, no,--'t won't do! If little Phoebe was about the house, I should not mind knocking; but Miss Hepzibah, likely as not, would scowl down at me out of the window, and look cross, even if <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> pleasantly. <b>So,</b> I'll come back at noon." ...|$|R
60|$|Ethelberta {{was greatly}} perturbed by this meeting. After {{retracing}} her steps a short distance, <b>she</b> still <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> distressed and unpresentable that she resolved {{not to allow}} Lord Mountclere to see her till the clouds had somewhat passed off; it was but a bare act of justice to him to hide from his sight such a bridal mood as this. It was better to keep him waiting than to make him positively unhappy. She turned aside, and went up the valley, where the park merged in miles of wood and copse.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> {{sorry for}} him. He looked such a boy, with the angry {{tears in his}} clear blue eyes, and that little childish quivering of the kind, strong, sulky mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} him to come," [...] said Alvina simply. But a deep flush began to mount her face. She {{did not know where}} it came from, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> cold. And she wanted to cry.|$|E
60|$|They were {{interrupted}} {{by the sound of}} the car. There was Birkin. Ursula was surprised that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>so</b> lit up, that she became suddenly so free from the problems of grey homes in the west.|$|E
6000|$|When a {{woman says}} she never will forgive a man, she always has a {{condition}} of forgiveness in her heart.

2500|$|Crying {{and with}} compassion, {{she began to}} think about the {{foreskin}} of Christ, where it may be located [...] And behold, soon <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> with the greatest sweetness on her tongue a little piece of skin alike the skin in an egg, which she swallowed. After she had swallowed it, <b>she</b> again <b>felt</b> the little skin on her tongue with sweetness as before, and again she swallowed it. And this happened to her about a hundred times. And when <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>so</b> frequently, <b>she</b> was tempted to touch it with her finger. And when she wanted to do so, that little skin went down her throat on its own. And it was told to her that the foreskin was resurrected with the Lord on the day of resurrection. And so great was the sweetness of tasting that little skin that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> in all [...] limbs and parts of the limbs a sweet transformation.|$|R
60|$|Usually at {{the weekly}} hops Maggie kept {{a spot on}} the wall warm with her back. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> and showed <b>so</b> much {{gratitude}} whenever a self-sacrificing partner invited her to dance that his pleasure was cheapened and diminished. She had even grown used to noticing Anna joggle the reluctant Jimmy with her elbow as a signal for him to invite her chum to walk over his feet through a two-step.|$|R
