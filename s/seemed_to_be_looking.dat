25|$|The Church {{had been}} {{practically}} abandoned {{for some years}} and was in a bad state of delapidation, but the beautiful carved work {{that had been done}} by William Bernard Sears, soon after the church was built, had not then been molested. My mother used to sit in the church and read the Lord's Prayer and Ten Commandments over the Chancel, and admire the gilded dove that Mr. Sears had placed high over the Pulpit. The 'Eye' which he also had made <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at her no matter where she sat.|$|E
25|$|In early 2009, French forces {{embarked}} on a significant campaign which aimed to retake an eastern Alasay District that the Taliban has controlled for the previous year. Alasay district is a strategic goldmine: it lies along a primary infiltration route {{into and out of}} Pakistan, it provides easy access to Kabul in an easily defensible primary valley (there are two other valleys in Alasay District), and it is mostly populated by the ethnic minority the Pashai and some Nuristani. In a French-led NATO force initiated, the operation was a success initially, due to reaching out to locals beforehand, they retook the entire valley with a single casualty over a single day of fighting. Almost immediately, the Afghans of the valley welcomed the French, and things <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> up. However, they didn’t stay. Much as in previous efforts to “sweep” the province, the French were dragged into other tasks, like protecting the main highway that travels the province from north to south through the volatile Tagab Valley. As a result, Alasay fell back to Taliban later that year and the security situation in the province deteriorated. It was that same tug-of-war all over again, with the residents of Alasay left frustrated and less safe than ever before. As 2009 progressed, bigger and bigger chunks of the province came under the sway of the insurgency, leading the provincial capital being more or less under curfew from the militants. By 2010, the French had stopped liaising with their Afghan Army counterparts, and the Provincial Reconstruction Team had ceased most of its operations.|$|E
2500|$|Between {{leaving the}} Moments and joining The Small Faces, Steve Marriott joined The Checkpoints. Chris Clements: [...] "He {{actually}} approached us (The Checkpoints) {{and said he}} needed to fulfill some gigs that were pending. This was in 1965, he was {{with us for a}} couple of months. We rehearsed at The Kentish Drovers in the Old Kent Road in South London. He got us to learn James Brown numbers, which at the time we weren't very up in. One particular memory sticks in my mind. When we rehearsed with him, he almost spoke the words of the song, rather than sang the words. He was listening to us, making sure we got the backing right, so he didn't put himself out vocally. But when we did the first gig with him, out came this fantastic soul voice, we all looked at each other, and our mouths fell open! When doing the gigs, we would pick him up outside the Brewery in Romford road Essex. He always had a small case with his harmonicas in. His harmonica playing was excellent. Our transport at that time was a converted ambulance, and Steve would always sit up front with the owner driver, (a man in his early 50s) rather than sit in the back talking to us. He {{seemed to me to be}} a bit of a loner. Even when I had a conversation with him, he always <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> past me, as though in a hurry to be somewhere else. He was quite a heavy smoker as I recall. We did various venues in Essex, around the Basildon area. He had no guitar, he would use our lead guitarist's red Fender Strat. Steve would put many guitar breaks in the James Brown songs. So we would all huddle around our drummer Gary Hyde who would watch Steve. When Gary stopped, we stopped, when Gary started, we started, so by using those tactics the gigs went well. We had photos taken at the various venues at that time, I wish someone would dig them out from wherever, I would love to see them." ...|$|E

60|$|Brown <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> hard at him, {{but they}} sat in shadow, and Austin was glad of it.|$|E
60|$|Louise was silent. Her {{hesitation}} became momentous. Her eyes <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> {{through the}} walls. Sophy watched her breathlessly.|$|E

6000|$|... "And {{what more}} could you have said?" [...] agreed Smith approvingly. [...] "Tell me, did these gentlemen appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> gay and light-hearted, or did they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for someone with a hatchet?" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin moved uneasily in his seat. He {{drew his}} club-foot {{a little further}} back; Felix <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at it absently.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wyatt looked steadfastly at his companion. His {{fingers were}} restlessly {{stroking}} his chin, his eyes <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> through his visitor.|$|E

6000|$|... "Just like you, Edmund," [...] laughed Dora. [...] "You {{will always}} <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> right through at the upright sprays, though all the solid weight of Hume, Gibbon, and Rollin {{is in front}} of them." ...|$|R
50|$|Upon Miguel Hidalgo's {{death the}} army {{declined}} {{and the future}} <b>was</b> not <b>looking</b> very promising. Guerrilla warfare <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the main line of attack. The army was now {{under the command of}} Vicente Guerrero. This war did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> good for those fighting for independence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning," [...] said Sammy Jay, {{and tried}} very hard to make his voice sound smooth and pleasant, a very hard thing for Sammy to do, for his voice, you know, is {{naturally}} harsh and unpleasant.

60|$|That {{was about}} all the {{explanation}} Leland ever got, but in another moment or two the trooper, who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at him curiously, spoke again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{spoke to}} him but he didn't answer. His eyes <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at {{something}} I couldn't see. His face was set, like a dead man's.|$|E
60|$|Neither at the service, nor afterwards, did I see {{a single}} Jew, for the fallen of that race <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looked</b> after by their fellow religionists. Moreover, the Jews do not drink to excess. Foreigners, also, are {{comparatively}} scarce at Blackfriars {{and in the other}} Shelters.|$|R
5000|$|At dinner, Jonas speaks {{increasingly}} frankly {{about his}} personal life and talks about masturbating to re-dos of sex from his earlier relationships. Throughout the meal, Liam becomes suspicious of how fondly Ffion <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at Jonas, and he is especially suspicious when she laughs at Jonas' jokes.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Sheasby as Bert Ford, a local yobbo {{who always}} <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for a fight. His {{suspicion}} of outsiders and religious intolerance make Sarah a natural target, {{as are the}} Italian Poletti family. Bert disappears under mysterious circumstances, but his unknown fate continues to haunt his former victims.|$|R
60|$|She was {{suddenly}} pensive. Her eyes <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> {{out of the}} restaurant. Sophy was exchanging amenities with a little party of friends at the next table.|$|E
60|$|Vont rose {{slowly to}} his feet. His knees were trembling. He <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> into a mist. His hands shook as he laid them on David's shoulders.|$|E
60|$|I {{never felt}} so bally {{conspicuous}} in my life. I huddled down in my seat and wished I could turn my collar up. Everybody <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Those fellows <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for trouble," [...] remarked the boy, as he glided over them, [...] "and it wouldn't {{be exactly}} healthy for an enemy {{to get in}} their way. But I haven't time to stop, so I'm not likely to get mixed up in any rumpus with them." ...|$|R
60|$|The inn is {{the only}} house in Marosfalva which boldly faces the street, all the others <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> at it over their shoulders, the front of one house facing the back of its neighbour, {{with a bit of}} garden or yard between, and so on, the whole kilomètre length of the street.|$|R
50|$|Damon {{has decided}} to leave town, but through the early episodes of Season 4 <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> for reasons <b>to</b> stay. Meredith Fell <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> one who convinces him in 'The Rager' to stay to help Elena with her {{transition}} to Vampire. Indeed, a renewed conflict over ideology {{and what sort of}} Vampire Elena will become drives Damon and Stefan apart.|$|R
6000|$|... “Morbleu! monsieur, {{you give}} me too much Majesty,” said the prince; who had now risen up and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> to one of us to help him to his coat. But neither stirred.|$|E

6000|$|... "Really, I don't know," [...] I {{answered}} undecidedly. [...] "There is a {{great deal}} of truth in what you have been saying.
