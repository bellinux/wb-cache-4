5|$|On November 26, 2011, NASA's Mars Science Laboratory {{mission was}} {{successfully}} launched for Mars. Curiosity successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> of {{past or present}} life on Mars.|$|E
5|$|By October 2, 2001, the <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> {{and remains}} was {{complete}} {{and the site}} {{was turned over to}} Pentagon officials. In 2002, the remains of 25 victims were buried collectively at Arlington National Cemetery, with a five-sided granite marker inscribed with the names of all the victims in the Pentagon. The ceremony also honored the five victims whose remains were never found.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the {{assumption}} of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River. Largely because of the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited {{became part of the}} Cat Tien National Park in 1992.|$|E

5|$|The Ahnenerbe (Ancestral Heritage Organization) {{was founded}} in 1935 by Himmler, and {{became part of the}} SS in 1939. It was an {{umbrella}} agency for more than fifty organizations tasked with studying the German racial identity and ancient Germanic traditions and language. The agency sponsored archaeological expeditions in Germany, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Tibet, and elsewhere to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> of Aryan roots, influence, and superiority. Further planned expeditions were postponed indefinitely {{at the start of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|While {{previous}} {{games in}} the series focus on defense attorneys, Ace Attorney Investigations has the player control prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, who investigates five cases that tie together to form an overarching story about a smuggling ring. The game consists of investigation phases, in which the player investigates crime scenes in <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence,</b> and rebuttal phases, in which they confront other characters, to hear what they think has happened; the player is able to use evidence to find contradictions in the characters' statements, {{to get closer to}} the truth.|$|E
5|$|Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), a Mutual UFO Network member, {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} abducted by aliens throughout his life. After meeting with FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Fenig was abducted once again, and {{thought to have}} been lost entirely. Several years later, Fenig is found dead amongst the victims of an airplane crash. Investigating the disaster, Mulder and his partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) learn that the airplane crashed after being intercepted by a military jet—and possibly by an alien spacecraft. Mulder's <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> of such a craft leads to him diving to the bottom of Great Sacandaga Lake to find it; while Scully is ambushed by an assassin seeking to kill a military witness, leading to her colleague Pendrell (Brendan Beiser) being shot.|$|E

5|$|The lone {{surviving}} Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, {{has been}} a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites. Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, {{as well as on}} the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign. The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the rewards of royal service during Henry's reign.|$|E

25|$|Although {{planetary}} geologists {{are interested}} in studying all aspects of other planets, a significant focus is to <b>search</b> <b>for</b> <b>evidence</b> of past or present life on other worlds.
