In order to account for such unknown <b>signal</b> <b>sources,</b> we introduce a new definition, referred to as virtual dimensionality (VD) in this paper. It {{is defined as the}} minimum number of spectrally distinct <b>signal</b> <b>sources</b> that characterize the hyperspectral data from the perspective view of target detection and classification. It is different from the commonly used intrinsic dimensionality (ID) {{in the sense that the}} <b>signal</b> <b>sources</b> are determined by the proposed VD based only on their distinct spectral properties. These <b>signal</b> <b>sources</b> may include unknown interfering sources, which cannot be identified by prior knowledge. With this new definition, three Neyman–Pearson detection theory-based thresholding methods are developed to determine the VD of hyperspectral imagery, where eigenvalue...|$|R

25|$|The {{common emitter}} (or common source, common cathode, etc.) {{is most often}} {{configured}} to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the <b>signal</b> <b>source,</b> though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a novel technique {{that can be}} used as an indicator of the number of active <b>signal</b> <b>sources</b> in convolutive <b>signal</b> mixtures. The technique is designed so that the number of sources is estimated using only recorded signals and some marginal information, such as possible minimum and maximum triggering frequencies of sources, but no information on mixing matrix, other parameters of <b>signal</b> <b>sources,</b> etc. Our research is based on the convolution kernel compensation method (CKC), which is a blind source separation method. First, a correlation matrix of the recorded signals is estimated. Next, a measure of the global activity of the <b>signal</b> <b>sources,</b> called activity index, is introduced. The exact analytical model of the activity index variance was derived for the purpose of the estimation of the number of <b>signal</b> <b>sources.</b> Using the analytical model, the number of active <b>signal</b> <b>sources</b> can be estimated if some a priori marginal information is available. We evaluated these marginal parameter values in extensive simulations of compound signals. The number of sources, their lengths, signal-to-noise ratio, source triggerings, and the number of measurements were randomly combined in preselected ranges. By using the established marginal parameter values and increasing extension factors, the model of the activity index variance was deployed to estimate the number of <b>signal</b> <b>sources.</b> The estimation results using synthetic signal mixtures are very promising.

[...] EMG signal acquisition is dependent on distance from the electrode to the muscle fiber, so placement is imperative. [...] The transducer used to detect the signal is an EMG electrode than transforms the bioelectric signal from the muscle to a readable electric signal.

2500|$|Inertial {{navigation}} systems used {{a cluster}} of gyroscopes and accelerometers to determine accelerations relative to inertial space. After a gyroscope is spun up in a particular orientation in inertial space, the law of conservation of angular momentum requires that it retain that orientation as long as no external forces are applied to it. [...] Three orthogonal gyroscopes establish an inertial reference frame, and the accelerators measure acceleration relative to that frame. The accelerations, along with a clock, can then be {{used to calculate the}} change in position. Thus, inertial navigation is a form of dead reckoning that requires no external input, and therefore cannot be jammed by any external or internal <b>signal</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{non-inverting}} input of the operational amplifier needs {{a path for}} DC to ground; if the <b>signal</b> <b>source</b> does not supply a DC path, or if that source requires a given load impedance, then the circuit will require another resistor from the {{non-inverting input}} to ground. When the operational amplifier's input bias currents are significant, then the DC source resistances driving the inputs should be balanced. [...] The ideal value for the feedback resistors (to give minimal offset voltage) will be such that the two resistances in parallel roughly equal the resistance to ground at the non-inverting input pin. [...] That ideal value assumes the bias currents are well matched, {{which may not be}} true for all op-amps.|$|E
