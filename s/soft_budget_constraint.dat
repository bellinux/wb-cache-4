Our results suggest that the probability of finding <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> importantly depends on the degree of competition within the sector and on the ownership of the firm. Ownership structure in Bulgaria however, has no additional explanatory power once firms are loss-making.

40|$|Why {{are so many}} EU {{countries}} {{currently in}} dire fiscal straits? A popular explanation is that monetary unification led to bailout expectations, which in turn resulted in <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> and over-borrowing. This paper investigates the validity of this explanation by studying {{the effects of the}} Maastricht treaty and the introduction of the Euro on public deficits. To identify the causal effects of these last two stages of EMU, we apply the difference- in-difference methodology to a dataset that covers 26 OECD countries (including all EU- 15 countries) over the 1975 - 2009 period. The estimations suggest that the effect of the EMU on deficits is limited to the so-called PIIGS countries. The signing of the Maastricht treaty triggered a reduction of deficits in this group of countries. Once the Euro had been introduced, the PIIGS expanded their deficits – but only to pre Maastricht levels. In other words, the Euro led to <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints,</b> and the PIIGS exploited these <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> to some extent (but not excessively).

40|$|I {{put forward}} a new {{theoretical}} framework to analyze the relationship between <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> syndrome and the economic performances of firms. It differs from the existing theoretical framework, à la Dewatripont and Maskin (1995), in the <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> literature. In this paper, <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> syndrome arises when firms {{that are expected to}} lose money are financed. The paper highlights a trade-off between hard and soft budget constraints. While soft budget constraints may compromise firms ’ incentives to improve performances, an all-out effort to harden budget constraints may put macro stability at risk, especially for economies suffering from allocative inefficiency. Based on this trade-off, the paper shows that a transition from centralized financing to decentralized financing in fact compromises firms ’ incentives to improve their performances, whereas a transition from centralized financing to a dual track system enhances efficiency. In the dual track system, budget constraints are soft in the centralized track but the macro stability of the economy is assured as a result. The macro stability enhances the disciplinary effect of hard budget constraints in the decentralized track, which in turn promotes firms’ incentives to improve performances.

40|$|The <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} that a firm expects {{to survive in the}} future when it is financially insolvent. This is widely {{recognized as one of the}} important reasons for the inefficiency and, eventually, the collapse of contemporary socialist economies. The purpose of this paper is to explore the cause of the <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> in a formal way. Using a comparative setting which includes botht he socialist system and the market system, I show that public ownership of capital is a sufficient condition for the <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraint.</b> the intuition is that under public ownership of capital, the firm (which consists of labor and management) retains its control right regarding the disposition of the capital. thus, the ex post termination decision of the firm's investment project is socially efficient, which means that so long as the financial loss is not as big as the potential loss of human capital due to the termination of the firm, the firm should survive. This gives rise to the <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraint.</b> Similarly, the "hard" budget constraint occurs under private ownership, where the firm can be excluded from the termination decision. Next, I show that ex ante, the <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraint</b> is inefficint while the "hard" budget constraint can be efficient, since given limited liability, the only way to discourage the firm from proposing bad projects is by threatening to incur losses to the human capital when the project indeed is bad. Furthermore, it is shown that public ownership of capital causes excessive (relative to the socially optimal level) demand for investment in socialist economies, while private ownership of capital results in under-investment in market economies. Such phenomena have been widely recognized in comparative economics...|$|E

40|$|Public {{schools in}} Chile receive a per-student subsidy {{depending}} on enrollment, and are managed by local governments that operate under <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints.</b> In this paper, we study {{the effects of}} this system on per-student expenditures. Per-student expenditures on rural areas are 30 % higher than in urban areas. We find that about 75 % of this difference {{is due to the fact}} that rural public schools are significantly smaller and thus do not benefit from economies of scale. Besides, we also show that in our preferred estimates about 50 % of the students in rural areas could be moved to schools that could exploit economies of scale – i. e., these students could attend bigger schools traveling at most an hour day a day in total. We show that even if we use conservative average speed rates or control for transportation, utility and infrastructure costs, there is a sizeable share of students that could be consolidated. We argue that local governments that have <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> do not consolidate these schools giving the existing potential because of political factors: closing schools is harmful for mayors in electoral terms. Consistent with this claim, we find that a decrease in the degree of political competition in areas with better access to non-voucher transfers from the central government (i. e. with <b>softer</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints)</b> decreases the extent of the inefficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{a survey}} of 3, 300 firms in 25 {{transition}} countries {{to shed light on}} the factors that influence restructuring by firms and their subsequent performance as measured by growth in sales and in sales per employee over a three-year period.

We go on to analyse the impact on performance of ownership, <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints,</b> the general business environment and a range of measures of the intensity of competition as perceived by a firm. We find that competition has an important and non-monotonic effect on the growth of sales and of labour productivity: some degree of perceived market power is associated with higher sales growth, but competitive pressure is also important. A similar non-monotonic effect is found upon firms’ decisions to develop and improve their products, but market power has an unambiguously negative impact on purely defensive (cost-reducing) restructuring activity. New firms have grown very fast, but among old firms ownership per se has no significant relationship to performance (though state-owned firms have engaged in significantly less development of new products). <b>Soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints</b> have a broadly negative and the business environment a broadly positive impact on restructuring and performance. competition, restructuring, privatisation, <b>soft</b> <b>budget</b> <b>constraints,</b> business environment...|$|R
