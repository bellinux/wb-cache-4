25|$|The young knight ventures {{to ferret}} out various objects for the {{creation}} of a <b>special</b> <b>ring</b> that would grant him an immunity from Morgana's black magic, who knows of his mission and will try to eliminate him. With the ring on, Gawain finally goes off on the journey to rid the world of Morgana, who has hidden in a forbidding fortress on the island of Lyonesse. On the way there, Morgana shows up to kill Gawain's companion, her former servant named Helie. Once in Morgana's castle, Gawain gets captured and is sentenced to death, but manages to escape after defeating a giant snake. He then works to overcome Morgana and slay her vampire bodyguard Ragnar. Ultimately, Gawain is unable to end Morgana's life, but the witch's own Faerie minions help him imprison her inside Lyonesse. She swears vengeance while he returns to Camelot as a hero to join the Order of the Round Table.|$|E

Magic is also applied to everyday life; for example, stuffed toys are able to talk. Users of magic must wear a <b>special</b> <b>ring</b> which controls their powers, and are urged to blend in with society. Despite Nursery Rhyme being set in the future, Japan's culture is depicted as unchanged for the most part.

40|$|Motivated by Cauchy's {{functional}} equation f(x+y) =f(x) +f(y), we study in § 1 <b>special</b> <b>rings,</b> namely, rings for which every endomorphism f of their additive group {{is of the}} form f(x) ≡ax. In § 2 we generalize to R algebras (R a fixed commutative ring) and give a classification theorem when R is a complete discrete valuation ring. This result has an interesting consequence, Proposition 12, for the theory of <b>special</b> <b>rings...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Klonoa: Empire of Dreams {{works like}} a typical 2D sidescroller with the player moving Klonoa left or right on a {{scrolling}} screen while defeating enemies using his [...] "wind bullet", a <b>special</b> <b>ring</b> that can shoot a small gust of wind forward and draw an enemy in, allowing Klonoa to lift them over his head. [...] From this position, he can either throw them straight forward like a projectile, taking out any enemy they hit, or he can perform a double-jump, allowing him to reach places he couldn't normally. [...] In addition to enemies, Klonoa can also pick up large square blocks and place them wherever the player chooses. [...] By holding the jump button after Klonoa has left the ground, Klonoa flaps his ears and can float in mid-air for a short duration, which also somewhat increases his jumping height.|$|E
60|$|That morning I {{got up from}} my breakfast, {{pushing the}} chair back, and rang the bell violently, or perhaps I should say resolutely, or perhaps I should say eagerly, I do not know. But manifestly {{it must have been}} a <b>special</b> <b>ring</b> of the bell, a common sound made impressive, like the ringing of a bell for the raising of the curtain upon a new scene. It was an unusual thing for me to do. Generally, I dawdled over my breakfast and I solemn took the trouble to ring the bell for the table to be cleared away; but on that morning for some reason hidden in the general mysteriousness of the event I did not dawdle. And yet I was not in a hurry. I pulled the cord casually and while the faint tinkling somewhere down in the {{basement}} went on, I charged my pipe in the usual way and I looked for the matchbox with glances distraught indeed but exhibiting, I am ready to swear, no signs of a fine frenzy. I was composed enough to perceive after some considerable time the matchbox lying there on the mantelpiece right under my nose. And all this was beautifully and safely usual. Before I had thrown down the match my landlady's daughter appeared with her calm, pale face and an inquisitive look, in the doorway. Of late it was the landlady's daughter who answered my bell. I mention this little fact with pride, because it proves that during the thirty or forty days of my tenancy I had produced a favourable impression. For a fortnight past I had been spared the unattractive sight of the domestic slave. The girls in that Bessborough Gardens house were often changed, but whether short or long, fair or dark, they were always untidy and particularly bedraggled as if in a sordid version of the fairy tale the ashbin cat had been changed into a maid. I was infinitely sensible of the privilege of being waited on by my landlady's daughter. She was neat if anaemic.|$|E
