40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore English women's {{experiences}} of cervical screening result communication. DESIGN: Qualitative study consisting of seven focus groups conducted between May 2005 and April 2006. PARTICIPANTS: 33 {{women with a}} range of screening results (normal, inadequate, borderline and abnormal) who had recently been for cervical screening, and five women who had attended a colposcopy appointment for the first time following screening. SETTING: Three <b>screening</b> <b>centres</b> (Hampshire, Reading and Sheffield) and one colposcopy clinic (Oxford) in England. RESULTS: Unsatisfactory result communication (eg, delivery of out-of-date and conflicting information) {{on the part of both}} <b>screening</b> <b>centres</b> and primary care teams was highlighted. Variable levels of general practitioner involvement in screening result provision were experienced; result-giving strategies included personal as well as generic letters and telephone calls. Means for improving women's understanding of abnormal results were described including the use of diagrams to explain the progression of cell changes, the provision of updates regarding any changes in cell abnormalities between screening tests (ie, lesion progression or regression) and contact with a knowledgeable "intermediary" outside primary care. CONCLUSIONS: The timely provision of appropriate information is an important aspect of any screening programme. Our findings suggest that there is scope for improvement in both the delivery and content of cervical screening result notifications. Regular review of patient result-giving strategies on the part of <b>screening</b> <b>centres</b> and general practices could help ensure that screening programme standards for written information are met. Enhanced communication between primary care teams and <b>screening</b> <b>centres</b> could facilitate the provision of consistent and clear result messages thereby improving women's cervical screening experiences...|$|R

40|$|Eye {{tracking}} {{has been}} used during face categorisation and identification tasks to identify perceptually salient facial features and infer underlying cognitive processes. However, viewing patterns are influenced {{by a variety of}} gaze biases, drawing fixations to the <b>centre</b> of a <b>screen</b> and horizontally to the left side of face images (left-gaze bias). In order to investigate potential interactions between gaze biases uniquely associated with facial expression processing, and those associated with screen location, face stimuli were presented in three possible screen positions to the left, right and centre. Comparisons of fixations between screen locations highlight a significant impact of the <b>screen</b> <b>centre</b> bias, pulling fixations towards the <b>centre</b> of the <b>screen</b> and modifying gaze biases generally observed during facial categorisation tasks. A left horizontal bias for fixations was found to be independent of screen position but interacting with <b>screen</b> <b>centre</b> bias, drawing fixations to the left hemi-face rather than just {{to the left of the}} screen. Implications for eye tracking studies utilising centrally presented faces are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The European Lead Factory is {{operational}} since 2013 and {{consists of}} two main components: the Joint European Compound Library and the European <b>Screening</b> <b>Centre.</b> Together these elements provide a platform for pharmaceutical researchers in Europe to identify drug discovery starting points, by connecting innovative drug targets to high-quality small molecules. The result is defined in a ‘hit list’: a number of compounds that show affinity for the target. The compounds on those lists can either be used as probes to better understand biological pathways or as starting points for lead discovery efforts for novel drugs. These hits can be further optimised outside of the European Lead Factory, for affinity but also for drug-like properties as selectivity, solubility and metabolism in the human body. The ultimate goal is that these candidate drugs will solve unmet medical needs when fully approved as drug by the authorities.|$|E

Following a two-day hearing in Edinburgh during September 2016, the charges against Cafferkey were dismissed and she was cleared of any wrongdoing. The disciplinary panel was told {{that she had been}} impaired by illness at the time and heard evidence about how the Public Health England <b>screening</b> <b>centre</b> at Heathrow Airport had been unprepared for a large influx of passengers and that it was [...] "busy, disorganised and even chaotic". BBC Scotland reporter Philip Sim wrote: [...] "It now seems as if the case against Pauline Cafferkey had fallen apart before the hearing even began - raising questions as to why she had to go through it in the first place". In November 2016, a second panel criticised fellow volunteer senior nurse Donna Wood for suggesting [...] "let's put it down as 37.2 and get out of here and sort it out later". Wood was suspended for two months for failing to alert the authorities about Cafferkey's condition. Hannah Ryan, the doctor that agreed to record the incorrect temperature, was suspended for one month by the Medical Practitioners Tribunal in March 2017.|$|E
5000|$|The purge {{was planned}} before Japanese troops landed in Singapore. The {{military}} government {{section of the}} 25th Army had already drawn up a plan entitled [...] "Implementation Guideline for Manipulating Overseas Chinese" [...] on or around 28 December 1941.9 This guideline stated that anyone who failed to obey or co-operate with the occupation authorities should be eliminated. It {{is clear that the}} headquarters of the 25th Army had decided on a harsh policy toward the Chinese population of Singapore and Malaya {{from the beginning of the}} war. According to Onishi Satoru,10 the Kempeitai officer in charge of the Jalan Besar <b>screening</b> <b>centre,</b> Kempeitai commander Oishi Masayuki was instructed by the chief of staff, Suzuki Sosaku, at Keluang, Johor, to prepare for a purge following the capture of Singapore. Although the exact date of this instruction is not known, the Army headquarters was stationed in Keluang from 28 January to 4 February 1942 ...Clearly, then, the Singapore Massacre was not the conduct of a few evil people, but was consistent with approaches honed and applied in the course of a long period of Japanese aggression against China and subsequently applied to other Asian countries. To sum up the points developed above, the Japanese military, in particular the 25th Army, made use of the purge to remove prospective anti-Japanese elements and to threaten local Chinese and others to swiftly impose military administration.|$|E

The project draws together experts from major Australian museums, libraries and <b>screen</b> <b>centres</b> to examine the evolution in digital contentcreation and social media. It explores whether organizations can become active in content generation ('new literacy'), and thereby be linked into new modes of distribution, calling into being 'new audiences'. The paper presents interim findings of the project, describing the theories and methodologies developed to investigate the rise of social media and, more broadly, digital content creation, within cultural institutions...|$|R
