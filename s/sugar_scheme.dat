Two field {{experiments}} were conducted at two different sites for one season (1992 / 93) {{in order to}} {{study the effects of}} iron, manganese, zinc and their combinations on growth and yield of sugarcane at Kenana <b>Sugar</b> <b>Scheme.</b> The experimental design used was a randomized complete block with four replications. Sulfates of iron, manganese and zinc were used as foliar fertilizers at concentrations of 200 ppm for iron and zinc and 100 ppm for manganese. Half of the fertilizer dose was applied when the crop was four months old, and the other half was applied when the crop was six months old, and the control was sprayed with distilled water only. All the treatments received 415 kg/ha urea fertilizer (46 % nitrogen) as nitrogen source and 108 kg/ha triple superphosphate (48 % P 2 O 5) as a source of phosphorus. Data were recorded on the growth and yield of sugarcane crop. The results showed that the lowest stalk height was obtained with treatments receiving iron fertilizer. The highest stalk diameter value was obtained in plants sprayed with zinc. The application of manganese or zinc and their combinations resulted in higher values of cane yield than the control.

In this study, the gated pipe (hydro-flume) for furrow irrigation was {{compared with the}} conventional open field head ditch irrigation system concerning the volume of irrigation water applied to the field, irrigation efficiencies, the time of cutoff, water and irrigation time saved and the irrigation production efficiency (IPE). To achieve these objectives, two commercial cane fields having the same furrow lengths (2100 m) and slopes were chosen. The study shows that in the open field head ditch irrigation, the irrigation water added was 69. 1 mm in the top, 75. 7 mm {{in the middle and}} 66. 1 mm in the end of the furrow. Whereas, the irrigation water added in the gated pipe system was 132. 7 mm, 46. 1 mm and 101. 9 mm, respectively. The present study indicates that the gated-pipe system has a high value of application efficiency (79 %- 88 %) compared with the open field head ditch (69 %- 71 %). The percent of deep percolation (PDP) for the gated-pipe sys-tem is greater than the PDP obtained under open field head ditch irrigation conditions. Also the percent of runoff (PRO) is higher under the open field head ditch system and the water con-veyance efficiency for the open field head ditch is 88 %.

40|$|Summary. In vitro {{studies of}} CREB {{glycosylation}} {{found that the}} transactivation potential of CREB is inhibited by glycosylation. Whether O-GlcNAc glycosylation is sufficiently dynamic {{to play a role}} in cellular activity has been addressed by several previous studies performed in pancreatic �-cell lines [1 - 6]. The pancreatic cells were chosen as a model system because of the high levels of OGT and O-GlcNAc glycosylation present in b-cells [5, 7]. Our work using cultured pancreatic cells has shown that CREB glycosylation is indeed dynamic and capable of effecting a decrease in CREB-dependent transcription. CREB is O-GlcNAc Glycosylated in Pancreatic Islets and Cultured Pancreatic Cell Lines. O-GlcNAc proteins from primary rat islets were biotinylated using a chemoenzymatic approach, in which an engineered �- 1, 4 -galactosyltransferase (Y 289 L GalT) enzyme was utilized to selectively tag O-GlcNAc proteins with a ketogalactose <b>sugar</b> (<b>Scheme</b> 5 - 1) [8, 9]. Once transferred, the ketone functionality on UDP analogue 1 was reacted with an amino-oxy biotin analogue, thereby permitting chemiluminescence detection of the O-GlcNAc modification following immunoprecipitation of CREB (Fig. 5 - 1 A). Strong and selective biotinylation of CREB was observed (Fig. 5 - 1 B), indicating that CREB is O-GlcNAc glycosylated in the pancreas. 8081 It should be noted that the chemoenzymatic tagging method was essential, as conventional 3 H-labeling with GalT successfully detected the modification on CREB but was much less sensitive, requiring weeks for detection (data not shown).

40|$|This report {{compares the}} production, market and trade {{outcomes}} of two alternative policy scenarios, namely expiry of EU sugar quotas in 2015 / 16 and {{extension of the}} current <b>sugar</b> quota <b>scheme.</b> All other EU policy measures pertaining to the sugar sector, and to agriculture more generally, are assumed the same in both scenarios. The year of comparison is 2020. The CAPRI model {{was used for the}} simulations. The report begins with a description of beet and sugar production within the EU, and outlines the policies applied in the sugar sector within the EU’s Common Agricultural policy. This is followed by a description of the workings of the EU market for sugar. A theoretical model is used to summarise the main functional relationships in the EU sugar market and related markets, and the EU’s trade in sugar, from which a number of theory-based predictions about the impacts of quota expiry are derived. There is then a very brief overview of the CAPRI model and the way it has been used in this study. Isoglucose quotas will expire along with sugar quotas, and there is much speculation about the extent of potential competitive substitution between the two sweeteners, which has until now been neutralised by the quota arrangements. Sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain greater insight into this issue. Two additional quota-expiry scenarios were run, in which isoglucose was assumed to take a 10 % and a 20 % share of the sweetener market at the expense of sugar. The main findings are: •	production of sugar beet and white sugar increases by around 4 %,. •	there is little net impact on the production of cereals, •	total ethanol production hardly changes, but the importance of sugar as an ethanol feedstock declines by a few percentage points, •	raw sugar imports from high-cost third countries decline very substantially, but those from the low-cost producer Brazil decrease only slightly, •	EU sugar exports fall, •	EU human consumption of sugar increases only marginally, despite a fall of 15 - 16 % in beet prices for sugar for internal human consumption, •	there is a very small positive welfare change, although income accruing to sugar beet producers falls by over 17 %,JRC.

This report summarizes the work performed at Sandia during Fiscal Year 1999 through Fiscal Year 2001 with aqueous systems. Work with alcohol based systems is summarized in part 1 of this report. Our study of lignin depolymerization by aqueous NaOH showed that the primary factor governing the extent of lignin conversion is the NaOH:lignin ratio. NaOH concentration is at best a secondary issue. The maximum lignin conversion is achieved at NaOH:lignin mole ratios of 1. 5 - 2. This is consistent with acidic compounds in the depolymerized lignin neutralizing the base catalyst. The addition of CaO to NaOH improves the reaction kinetics, but not the degree of lignin conversion. The combination of Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } and CaO offers a cost saving alternative to NaOH that performs identically to NaOH on a per Na basis. A process where CaO is regenerated from CaCO{sub 3 } could offer further advantages, as could recovering the Na as Na{sub 2 }CO{sub 3 } or NaHCO{sub 3 } by neutralization of the product solution with CO 2. Model compound studies show that two types of reactions involving methoxy substituents on the aromatic ring occur: methyl group migration between phenolic groups (making and breaking ether bonds) and the loss of methyl/methoxy groups from the aromatic ring (destruction of ether linkages). The migration reactions are significantly faster than the demethylation reactions, but ultimately demethylation processes predominates...|$|R
