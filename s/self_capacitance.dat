We define and study three different {{models of the}} capacitance matrix C_r⃗,r⃗': Model A includes only mutual capacitances; Model B includes mutual and <b>self</b> <b>capacitances,</b> leading to exponential screening of the electrostatic fields; Model C includes a dense matrix C_r⃗,r⃗' that is constructed approximately from superposition of an exact analytic solution for the capacitance between two disks of finite radius and thickness. In the latter case the electrostatic fields decay algebraically. For comparison, we have also evaluated the full capacitance matrix using the MIT fastcap algorithm, good for small lattices, {{as well as a}} corresponding continuum effective-medium analytic evaluation of a finite voltage disk inside a zero-potential plane. In all cases the effective C_r⃗,r⃗' decays algebraically with distance, with different powers. We have then calculated current voltage characteristics for DC+AC currents for all models. We find that there are novel giant capacitive fractional steps in the I-V's for Models B and C, strongly dependent on the amount of screening involved. We find that these fractional steps are quantized in units inversely proportional to the lattice sizes and depend on the properties of C_r⃗,r⃗'. We also show that the capacitive steps are not related to vortex oscillations but to localized screened phase-locking of a few rows in the lattice.

40|$|Abstract —Power {{consumption}} and delay {{are two of}} the most important constraints in current-day on-chip bus design. The two major sources of dynamic power dissipation on a bus are the <b>self</b> <b>capacitance</b> and the coupling capacitance. As technology scales, the interconnect resistance increases due to shrinking wire-width. At the same time, spacing between the interconnects decreases resulting in an increase in the coupling capacitance. This, in turn, leads to stronger crosstalk effects between the interconnects. In Deep Sub-Micron technology the coupling capacitance exceeds the <b>self</b> <b>capacitance,</b> which, in turn, cause more power {{consumption and}} delay on the bus. Recently, the interest has also shifted to minimizing peak power dissipation. The reason being that higher peak power leads to an undesired increase in switching noise, metal electromigration problems and operationinduced variations due to non-uniform temperature on the die. Thus, minimizing power consumption and delay are the most important design objectives for on-chip buses. Several bus encoding schemes have been proposed in the literature for reducing crosstalk. Most of these encoding techniques use spatial redundancy that requires additional transmission wires on the bus. In this paper, a new temporal encoding scheme is proposed...|$|E

The corresponding quantum partition function is expressed in different calculationally convenient ways within its path-integral representation. The phase diagram is analytically studied using a WKB renormalization group (WKB-RG) plus a self-consistent harmonic approximation (SCHA) analysis, together with non-perturbative quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Most of the results presented here pertain to the superconductor to normal (S-N) region, although some results for the insulating to normal (I-N) region are also included. We find very good agreement between the WKB-RG and QMC results when compared to the experimental data. To fit the data, we only used the experimentally determined capacitances as fitting parameters.

40|$|The {{electronics}} in {{the automotive}} industry is facing a new era where safety critical functions are electrified, as for example drive-by-wire technology. At {{the same time as}} the number of electrical loads in the vehicles is increasing, the time to market is decreasing. Full scale prototypes of a vehicle are often only available at a late stage in the development process where changes are rather costly. This implies that prediction and simulation of a system are of importance and are useful already at an early stage of the development process. There are economic benefits that can be gained by prediction and simulation of the system such as: reduction of time to market, virtual tests, virtual prototypes and optimization of electronic circuits with respect to safety margins of filters. The high number of electrical loads in the vehicle leads to different cable harnesses routed along the body and chassis of the vehicle. These cable harnesses will contain both power conductors and communication conductors, routed close together. When conductors are routed close to each other, a signal on one conductor can interfere with the signal on another conductor. This phenomenon is called crosstalk. Crosstalk can increase the noise levels, create unplanned spikes or destroy data on nearby conductors. Hence it should always be a prime suspect in an electromagnetic interference investigation or a candidate for prediction. Crosstalk between two conductors is coupled by the mutual inductance and capacitance. When these parameters are known, the crosstalk can be estimated by using a circuit simulation. The mutual inductance and capacitance between the conductors as well as the <b>self</b> inductance and <b>capacitance</b> of each conductor depend on the surrounding environment. This implies that the conductor layout is an important factor when it comes to designing a system that is robust against crosstalk. This thesis focuses on estimation of the parasitic components in a system with two conductors and a ground structure. Since the parasitic components are affected by the conductor layout, five different layouts are investigated. The parameters are estimated by using analytical calculations, electromagnetic simulations with the software CableMod and measurements. An approximate method for fast analytical calculations is proposed and evaluated. The parameter values estimated with the different methods are compared in the thesis. The values yielded from the accurate analytical calculation and the simulations agree well. Some of the measured values deviate from the theoretical values, and it is shown that the differences emanate from the fact that the theoretical models do not exactly describe the measurement setup. The different parameter setups from the different estimation methods and the investigated conductor layouts are employed in circuit simulations in the software LTSpice/ Switchercad III. The circuit simulations show that the proposed approximate analytical calculation method is sufficient to use for prediction of crosstalk and comparison between different conductor layouts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{electric}} field coupling from ICs to cables or enclosures {{is proportional to}} the source voltage, source frequency and the <b>self</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the IC structure. The product of these three values is a quantity that effectively represents the strength of an {{electric field}} source independent of the structure(s) that it may couple to.

The product of these quantities is also a scalar value and represents an IC’s ability to couple to cables and enclosures through a magnetic field. These electric and magnetic “moments ” can be used to characterize an IC’s ability to couple noise to its external environment. These moments depend on local geometric parameters such as the circuit board dimensions, IC package structure, presence of heatsinks, etc., but they are independent of system parameters such as cable and enclosure geometries.

40|$|Abstract At the {{physical}} layer of Network-on-Chip (NoC) implementations, blocks and switches are already as-signed and inter block connections {{have to be}} planned. Most of the inter block connections will consist {{of a large number}} of long parallel wires. Such wires usually have signicant re-sistance and (coupling as well as <b>self)</b> <b>capacitance.</b> As such, these wires may severely limit the achievable performance. The performance may (and usually is) improved by buffer-ing, i. e. the insertion of restoring electronics to avoid the quadratic dependence (caused by the product of r and c per unit length) of the delay on wire length. The main contribution of this paper is in providing an optimization approach for the throughput on such buffered NoC wires. By extending our work of [2], we provide a methodology to optimize the throughput under buffer area constraints. It appears that in that case the highest through-put can be obtained using sub-maximal density congura-tions with greater than minimum wire spacing and width. Moreover, the results show that a signicant saving on Si area for buffering need only cost a moderate decrease of throughput. For example, a specic experiment for a 0 : 18 µm technology yields 90 % of the absolute maximum throughput using only 30 % of the corresponding buffer area. I...|$|E
40|$|Even in {{the absence}} of Coulomb {{interactions}} phase fluctuations induced by quantum size effects become increasingly important in superconducting nano-structures as the mean level spacing becomes comparable with the bulk superconducting gap. Here we study the role of these fluctuations, termed "quantum capacitance", in the phase diagram of a one-dimensional (1 D) ring of ultrasmall Josephson junctions (JJ) at zero temperature by using path integral techniques. Our analysis also includes dissipation due to quasiparticle tunneling and Coulomb interactions through a finite mutual and <b>self</b> <b>capacitance.</b> The resulting phase diagram has several interesting features: A finite quantum capacitance can stabilize superconductivity even in the limit of only a finite mutual-capacitance energy which classically leads to breaking of phase coherence. In the case of vanishing charging effects, relevant in cold atom settings where Coulomb interactions are absent, we show analytically that superfluidity is robust to small quantum finite-size fluctuations and identify the minimum grain size for phase coherence to exist in the array. We have also found that the renormalization group results are in some cases very sensitive to relatively small changes of the instanton fugacity.

The 2 x 2 RLGC matrices of 2 -coupled microstrip line were extracted from various measurements. First, LCR-meter {{was used to}} extract the values of <b>self</b> <b>capacitance</b> (Cs), mutual capacitance (Cm). It was assumed in this extraction step that two lines are perfectly same. Second, TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) was used to extract the value of self inductance (Ls). In this extraction step, the TDR source was only applied {{to one of two}} lines and other line was static. Third, PHOEMICS optimization program was used to extract the other RLGC parameters from S-parameter values measured by using 2 -port VNA measurements. Each RLGC parameter was extracted from the related S-parameter and its frequency range. Comparison of the simulated S-parameter by using extracted RLGC parameters with those from 2 -port VNA measurements reveals a maximum difference of 4. 5 dB and 5. 4 dB for S 21, S 41, respectively. An approach to determine the tap-coefficients of a feed-forward equalizer (FFE) without the error accumulation was proposed. The simple-minded method of taking the negative values of the pulse response as the FFE tap-coefficients generated the accumulated error terms. This error accumulation was induced because the added components for FFE compensation also experienced the intersymbol interference (ISI). For the channel with the pre-cursor components, the situation became worse and the error terms were more accumulated. Thus, an analytic method was needed to decide the FFE tap-coefficients, which guaranteed no error terms accumulated from the time points up to the data-period times the number of tap-coefficients. In this way, the accumulated error terms were significantly reduced compared to the simple-minded method. The proposed method was applied to a FR 4 PCB transmission line with the length ranging from 40 cm to 100 cm, and with the non-zero pre-cursor components at the data rate of 5 Gbps. The proposed method achieved the voltage eye-opening of 46 % and 50 % for the 2 -tap and 4 -tap FFE, respectively, with the channel length of 100 cm, while the simple-minded method gave a zero voltage eye-opening...|$|E
