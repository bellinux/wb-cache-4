40|$|This paper {{argues that}} current efforts {{to study and}} {{advocate}} {{for a change in}} <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> to reduce their climate and other environmental impacts often ignore the political, social, and bodily implications of <b>energy</b> <b>technology</b> choices. Framing renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> exclusively in terms of their environmental benefits dismisses important questions about how energy infrastructures can be designed to correspond to democratic forms of socio-politics, forms of social organization that involve independence in terms of meeting energy needs, resilience in terms of adapting to change, participatory decision making and control, equitable distribution of knowledge and efficacy, and just distribution of ownership. Recognizing technological choices as political choices brings explicit attention to the kinds of socio-political restructuring that could be precipitated through a renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technology</b> transition. This paper argues that research on energy transitions should consider the political implications of technological choices, not just the environmental consequences. Further, emerging scholarship on energy practices suggests that social habits of energy usage are themselves political, in that they correspond to and reinforce particular arrangements of power. Acknowledging the embedded politics of technology, as the decades’ old concept of soft path technologies encourages, and integrating insights on the politics of technology with insights on technological practices, can improve future research on energy policy and public perceptions of energy systems. This paper extends insights regarding the socio-political implications of energy paths to consider how understandings of <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> as constellations of embedded bodily practices can help further develop our understanding of the consequences of <b>energy</b> <b>technologies,</b> consequences that move beyond environmental implications to the very habits and behaviors of patterned energy usage, which are themselves arguably political. This paper calls for future research that involves explicit examination of the relationship between technologies, socio-political distributions of power and access to energy resources, the social organization of energy practices, and options for energy transitions not just in terms of energy source, but also in terms of scale, design, and modes of ownership and control. <b>soft</b> <b>energy</b> paths; appropriate technology; energy transitions; renewable energy; energy politics; energy practice...|$|R

40|$|To provide {{and improve}} {{national}} energy security and low-carbon green energy economy, as a government-supported research institute related to developing new and renewable <b>energy</b> <b>technologies,</b> including <b>energy</b> efficiency, Korea Institute of Energy Research (KIER) needs {{to establish a}} long-term strategic <b>energy</b> <b>technology</b> roadmap (ETRM) in the hydrogen economy sector for sustainable economic development. In this paper, we establish a strategic ETRM for hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> in the hydrogen economy considering five criteria: economic impact (EI), commercial potential (CP), inner capacity (IC), technical spin-off (TS), and development cost (DC). As an extended research, we apply the integrated two-stage multi-criteria decision-making approach, including the hybrid fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) model, to assess the relative efficiency of hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> in order to scientifically implement the hydrogen economy. Fuzzy AHP reflects the vagueness of human thought with interval values, and allocates the relative importance and weights of four criteria: EI, CP, IC, and TS. The DEA approach measures the relative efficiency of hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> for the hydrogen economy with a ratio of outputs over inputs. The result of measuring the relative efficiency of hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> focuses on 4 hydrogen technologies out of 13 hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies.</b> KIER has to focus on developing 4 strategic hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> from economic view point {{in the first phase}} with limited resources. In addition, if energy policy makers consider as some candidates for strategic hydrogen technologies of the other 9 hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technology,</b> the performance and productivity of 9 hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> should be increased and the input values of them have to be decreased. With a scientific decision-making approach, we can assess the relative efficiency of hydrogen <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> efficiently and allocate limited research and development (R&D) resources effectively for well-focused R&D. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.
