40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to explore the}} relationship between different forms of knowledge {{and the kinds of}} activity that arise from them within child protection <b>social</b> <b>work</b> practice. The argument that <b>social</b> <b>work</b> is more than either ‘science’ or ‘art’ but distinctly ‘practice’ is put through a historical description of the development of Aristotle’s views of the forms of knowledge and Hannah Arendt’s later conceptualisations as detailed in The Human Condition (1958). The paper supports Arendt’s privileging of Praxis over Theoria within <b>social</b> <b>work</b> and further draws upon Arendt’s distinctions between Labour, Work and Action to delineate between different forms of <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>activity.</b> The author highlights dangers in <b>social</b> <b>work</b> relying too heavily on technical knowledge and the use of theory as a tool in seeking to understand and engage with the people it serves and stresses the importance of a phenomenological approach to research and practice as a valid, embodied form of knowledge. The argument further explores the constructions of service users that potentially arise from different forms of <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>activity</b> and cautions against over-prescriptive use of ‘outcomes’ based practice that may reduce the people who use services to products or consumables. The author concludes that <b>social</b> <b>work</b> action inevitably involves trying to understand humans in a complex and dynamic way that requires engagement and to seek new meanings for individual humans...|$|R

Drawing on a naturally occurring conversation between a social worker and two service users two claims are made. First, that despite concerns with uncertainty in late modernity, some features of interaction remain inherently certain. These include (1) Materiality, the setting and its participants are taken as real; (2) Identity, participants engage on the basis that they are who they say they are; (3) Taken for granted aspects of social organization; for example, that all participants can hold a conversation until shown otherwise; and, (4) Historicity, referring to a preexisting set of accounts, justifications, reasons and communicative orderings. Second, these ‘background expectancies’ provide the resource for topic seeking and non-routine practices that may be necessary to <b>social</b> <b>work</b> such as ‘authorized breaching’ of the domestic sphere and private life...|$|R

Fifty-eight patients were evaluated regarding their stay {{in the department of}} surgery, use of care and resumption of <b>social</b> and <b>work</b> <b>activities</b> within the first year after intestinal resection. Data were obtained from medical records and answers to a medical questionnaire. Forty patients replied to the questionnaire. Mean length of stay in the department of surgery was 16 +/- 9 days. Length of stay was positively correlated to non-elective surgery, colonic resection, presence of fistulae or abscesses, and {{to the creation of a}} stoma. Main interval between surgery and resumption of work was 11 +/- 8 weeks. Only one patient was unable to return to work because of the disease. Seventy per cent of the patients who went back to work said that their quality of life was improved after surgery in comparison with their preoperative status.
