The beaches in the area are exceptionally popular during the summer months which generates a vast amount of economic benefits for the area. By monitoring the water quality it safeguards the environment and the tourism industry. Which in the long run makes it environmentally sustainable and economically sustainable. Additionally the council identifies and keeps a register of the contaminated land use in the area. They do this to protect the people that currently live there and also to protect those that live there in the future. Once these contaminated areas have been identified the council then carry out a clean-up operation of that specific area, this ensures that the region stays as environmentally friendly as possible, this will warrant their environmental sustainability. Another step in ensuring environmental sustainability is the new and improved recycling service implemented in July 2014. They aim to make it easier for households to recycle more materials at the kerbside more often. They implemented colour coded boxes for different materials known as recycle plus (+). The council drives to increase recycling by encouraging local communities to get involved. They have also introduced another sustainable scheme across small villages within the borough known as [...] "The Big Bin Swap" [...] which encourages more people to make the switch <b>sorting</b> <b>waste</b> into smaller wheelie bins, in places where recycling rates are low.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the waste management system at Kaunas University of Technology, surveys the <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> habits of its community, {{both students and}} employees, and analyses the reasons and factors influencing <b>waste</b> <b>sorting</b> and non-sorting. The introduction of a separate paper waste collection system {{has made it possible}} {{to reduce the amount of}} mixed waste by 25 % during the first three months of its functioning. 58 % of employees and 45 % of students sort some of their waste partly, 23 % of employees and 11 % of students <b>sort</b> all their <b>waste.</b> 8 % of employees and 19 % of students <b>sort</b> their <b>waste</b> sometimes. 8 % of employees and 24 % of students do not <b>sort</b> <b>waste</b> at all. 77 % of employees and 66 % of students think that the main problem caused by waste generation is pollution of the environment. Therefore willingness to reduce an impact on it is the main reason for sorting, while a lack of conditions to keep separated recyclable refuse and a lack of nearby containers are main factors that are distracting people from source-sorting. Growth of environmental awareness and formation of sorting habits that are transmitted to family members are identified as the strengths. Lack of conditions for sorting (e. g. no place to keep <b>sorted</b> <b>waste</b> at home, insufficiently developed waste collection infrastructure), mistrust in a <b>sorted</b> <b>waste</b> collection system (e. g. belief that <b>sorted</b> <b>waste</b> goes to a landfill), and lack of information are the weaknesses. The opportunities comprise development of a convenient waste collection infrastructure, introduction of economic incentives and rise of further awareness. Identified threats for sorting at the source that discourage source sorting are the following: a developed infrastructure will not satisfy real needs; sorting will not become financially rewarding; improper decisions about a waste management system and waste treatment practices made at the state level, no real use of sorting.

40|$|Cosmo City was {{established}} as a pilot project to integrate the low, middle and high income communities to live together and share common resources like schools, medical facilities, churches and shopping centres. Over a period of seven years, waste management has become a problem leading to littering, illegal dumping and overfilling of skips. Perceptions of waste management in different income households were studied. The specific objectives were, willingness of households to separate waste from source, health concerns emanating when one interacts with waste at the sources, effect of incentives on household’s willingness to separate waste from source, household’s opinion on including the waste pickers in the formal waste management system. Data was collected using structured questionnaire and interviews. The results indicated that 30 % of low income households, 23 % of middle income households and 10 % of high income households recycle waste. The study revealed that 78 % of low income households, 78 % of middle income households and 80 % of high income households were willing to sort waste from source. Overall results showed about 20 % drop when <b>sorting</b> <b>waste</b> without incentives was suggested. 52 % of low income households, 55 % middle income households and 48 % high income households rated hygiene as the major health concern on <b>sorting</b> <b>waste</b> from source. 85 % of low income households, 77 % of low income household, 71 % of middle income and 78 % of high income households support the incorporation of waste pickers in the formal waste management system. The results related to perceptions of the community on waste management suggest that the three different communities are {{willing to participate in}} waste management and support the incorporation of the waste pickers in the formal waste management system. In general this study should serve as a guideline for legislation, policy and regulations formulation. Integrated solid waste management that involves waste pickers and separation of waste from source can help with job creation, boosts the economy and deviate waste from landfilling to recycling.
