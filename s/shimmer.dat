Three miles of the Fox River, which Silver Springs empties into, flows through the park's north end.|$|E

She received her title match on September 11, 2010, on Volume 33, but {{was defeated}} by Eagles. The following day on Volume 36 Melissa pinned Eagles to win an eight-woman elimination tag team match, where she, Ayako Hamada, Ayumi Kurihara and Serena Deeb defeated Eagles, Daizee Haze, Sara Del Rey and Tomoka Nakagawa. On October 2, 2011, at Volume 43, Melissa defeated Kana to become the number one contender to the <b>Shimmer</b> Championship. Later that same day on Volume 44, Melissa defeated Madison Eagles to become the fourth <b>Shimmer</b> Champion. During her title celebration, she was attacked from behind by Nicole Matthews. Melissa made her first two title defenses on March 17, 2012, defeating Nicole Matthews on Volume 45 and Portia Perez on Volume 46. The following day, after successfully defending the <b>Shimmer</b> Championship against Jessie McKay on Volume 47, Melissa lost the title to Saraya Knight on Volume 48. After pinning Knight to win a ten-woman elimination tag team match on October 28 at the tapings of Volume 50, Melissa was granted a rematch for the <b>Shimmer</b> Championship the following day on Volume 52, but was defeated after being hit with the title belt. On April 6, 2013, at the Volume 53 internet pay-per-view (iPPV) in Secaucus, New Jersey, Melissa defeated Knight in a steel cage match to win the <b>Shimmer</b> Championship for the second time. Melissa made her first successful title defense a week later on April 13 at Volume 54, where she defeated Mercedes Martinez. Later that same day on Volume 55, Melissa made another successful title defense against Courtney Rush. The following day on Volume 56, Melissa made her third and final title defense of the weekend by defeating Kalamity.

Melissa initially submitted Danger for the win, but the decision was reversed when Melissa turned heel and refused {{to let go of}} the hold after the match. Post-match, the evil Melissa completed her heel turn by attacking Hamada. On October 19 at Volume 58, Melissa made her fourth successful title defense against Leva Bates. Post-match Melissa attacked both Bates and the retired Allison Danger, before being chased away by LuFisto. Later that same day, after another successful defense against Hiroyo Matsumoto on Volume 59, Melissa was again run off by LuFisto, who was, as a result, named the next challenger for her <b>Shimmer</b> Championship. The title match between Melissa and LuFisto took place on the following day's Volume 60 and saw Melissa retain the title. Following the match, Melissa was taken to a local hospital, where she received ten stitches above her left eye. As a result, Volume 61 became the first Volume in <b>Shimmer</b> history, which did not feature a Cheerleader Melissa match. On April 5 at the Volume 62 iPPV in New Orleans, Louisiana, Melissa successfully defended the <b>Shimmer</b> Championship against LuFisto in a two out of three falls match, following outside interference from Mercedes Martinez. A week later on Volume 64, Melissa made another successful title defense against Japanese wrestler Yumi Ohka. On April 13, Melissa first successfully defended the <b>Shimmer</b> Championship against Mia Yim on Volume 65, before teaming with Mercedes Martinez to unsuccessfully challenge the Global Green Gangsters (Kellie Skater and Tomoka Nakagawa) for the <b>Shimmer</b> Tag Team Championship on Volume 66.

25|$|Melissa Anderson (born August 17, 1982) is an American {{professional}} wrestler, {{better known}} by her ring name Cheerleader Melissa. She {{is best known}} for her work in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where she worked as Alissa Flash and Raisha Saeed. She is currently performing on the independent circuit for promotions such as Pro Wrestling Revolution and <b>Shimmer</b> Women Athletes, where she is a former two-time <b>Shimmer</b> Champion. In 2013, Anderson was ranked #1 in Pro Wrestling Illustrateds annual Top 50 Females list.|$|E
40|$|Giant honeybees (Apis dorsata) nest in {{the open}} and have {{therefore}} evolved a variety of defence strategies. Against predatory wasps, they produce highly coordinated Mexican wavelike cascades termed â€˜shimmeringâ€™, whereby hundreds of bees flip their abdomens upwards. Although {{it is well known}} that <b>shimmering</b> commences at distinct spots on the nest surface, it is still unclear how <b>shimmering</b> is generated. In this study, colonies were exposed to living tethered wasps that were moved in front of the experimental nest. Temporal and spatial patterns of <b>shimmering</b> were investigated in and after the presence of the wasp. The numbers and locations of bees that participated in the <b>shimmering</b> were assessed, and those bees that triggered the waves were identified. The findings reveal that the position of identified trigger cohorts did not reflect the experimental path of the tethered wasp. Instead, the trigger centres were primarily arranged in the close periphery of the mouth zone of the nest, around those parts where the main locomotory activity occurs. This favours the â€˜special-agentsâ€™ hypothesis that suggest that groups of specialized bees initiate the <b>shimmering...</b>|$|R

25|$|Von Eerie's {{participation}} in Shimmer's October 2013 tapings was highlighted by her feud with Saraya Knight, which built to a 3 Stages of Hell match on October 20 at Volume 61, where Von Eerie was victorious over the former <b>Shimmer</b> Champion.|$|E
25|$|Their feud {{was picked}} up the {{following}} year for <b>Shimmer</b> Women Athletes at Volume 23 in May 2009. The company preluded the match with a video package showing their matches in Europe and announced that the winner {{would go on to}} face the <b>Shimmer</b> Champion at a later event. Towards the end of the bout, Annie Social came to the ring to distract Anderson allowing Wesna to use her CB4 Driver to pick up the victory. Wesna lost her championship match at Volume 25 and, owing to the controversy of their previous match, Anderson wrestled Wesna again in Volume 26 in a Knockout/Submission match where Anderson picked up the victory, making them level once more.|$|E

25|$|These {{series of}} bouts {{against each other}} did not stop them teaming {{together}} when they main evented Volume 17 on April 26, 2008, taking on an erstwhile enemy of Anderson again {{in the form of}} Sara Del Rey, alongside her Dangerous Angels partner Allison Danger. This time it was Melissa making the pinfall after an Air Raid Crash. Despite these string of successes, the tag team did not compete during the Volume 21 tag team gauntlet for the <b>Shimmer</b> Tag Team Championship, but they reunited when MsChif was threatened by both Kong and Del Rey for her <b>Shimmer</b> Championship. With both Kong and Del Rey wanting title shots, the two tag teams were actually booked for a contendership match for the Tag Team Championship during Volume 24 on May 2, 2009, which Anderson and MsChif lost. After this loss, Anderson went on a four match winning streak, including avenging a loss to Wesna Busic (see above). On April 10, 2010, at the tapings of Volume 29, Anderson and MsChif received a shot at the <b>Shimmer</b> Tag Team Championship, but were defeated by the defending champions Nicole Matthews and Portia Perez. The team's two back-to-back tag team losses led to Melissa dissolving her team with MsChif in order for her to focus on her singles career.|$|E
