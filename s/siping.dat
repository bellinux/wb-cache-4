On February 26 Lin reorganized his forces as the Northeastern Field Army and began preparations {{to return and}} take <b>Siping,</b> whose garrison had been transferred elsewhere by Chen Cheng and never re-strengthened. Lin began the general assault on the city on March 13, and took the town one day later. The capture of <b>Siping</b> ended Lin's Winter Offensive. The KMT nearly lost all of Manchuria {{by the end of}} the campaign and suffered 156,000 casualties, most of which survived as prisoners of war that were indoctrinated and recruited into Lin's forces. By the end of winter 1948 the Kuomintang had lost all of its territory in the Northeast, except for Changchun, Shenyang, and an area connecting the rail line from Beiping to those cities.|$|E

25|$|After {{the victory}} of the Summer Offensive, Lin's forces gained the {{initiative}} and Kuomintang defensive strategy became static and reactionary. Lin ordered his forces to besiege <b>Siping,</b> but they suffered very high casualties and made little progress, partially due to the defenders' strong entrenched position and air support, and due to the attackers' poor artillery support (Lin only had seventy pieces of artillery around <b>Siping).</b> Lin's forces broke into the city twice and engaged in street-to-street fighting, but were driven back both times with heavy casualties. By June 19, Lin's assault troops had become increasingly exhausted, and Lin began to rotate them to prevent them from becoming completely ineffective. On June 24, Nationalist reinforcements arrived from the south to lift the siege. Lin recognized {{that he did not have}} enough manpower left to defeat them, and on July 1, he ordered his forces to retreat back to the north of the Songhua River.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{surrender}} of Japan in 1945, the Chinese Civil War resumed in full-fledged fighting. In the spring of 1946 the Chinese Communists were active in Manchuria. A crack People's Liberation Army unit of 100,000 strong under the Communist Gen. Lin Biao occupied a key railroad junction at <b>Siping.</b> Kuomintang forces could not dislodge them after several attempts; Chiang Kai-shek then sent Bai to oversee the operation. After some redeployment, Nationalist forces were able to decisively defeat Lin's forces after a two-day pitched battle. This {{was to be the}} first major victory for the Kuomintang in the 1946-49 stage of the civil war before the fall of mainland China to the Chinese Communists.|$|E
2500|$|The Communists {{suffered}} over 30,000 {{losses at}} <b>Siping,</b> {{and may have}} suffered a desertion rate of over 20% during the withdrawal, while the Nationalist garrison at <b>Siping</b> fell from 20,000 to slightly over 3,000 before the siege was broken. Lin volunteered to write a self-criticism after the defeat. He also criticized his commander at <b>Siping,</b> Li Tianyou, for demonstrating poor tactics and for lacking [...] "revolutionary spirit". Despite the army's setbacks he reorganized the army, combining surviving regiments and raising local militia forces {{to the status of}} regular units. By the fall of 1947, he had 510,000 soldiers under his command, approximately equal to Nationalist forces in the region.|$|E

2500|$|The communists planned their offensives at two fronts.

[...] The Western and Eastern Manchurian Independent Divisions would strike toward Village of the Zheng Family (Zhengjia Tun, 郑家屯) and regions east of Jilin City, and the goal was to take more urban centers from the enemy.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of earlier defeats, the nationalists changed their {{strategy}} by focusing on defending the strategic major cities such as Changchun, Shenyang and <b>Siping,</b> and both sides set their sights on <b>Siping,</b> the traffic hub of northeast China. [...] The nationalist divided the city into five defensive zones, tasking the 71st Army and the 54th Division of the 13th Army as the main defenders. [...] The communists massed the 1st Column, the 17th Division of the 6th Column, and the Western Manchurian 3rd Independent Division to assault the city, while four columns totaling 10 Division, 5 independent Divisions, and 2 cavalry Divisions were deployed {{to the north and}} south of the city to stop any enemy reinforcement.|$|E

This environmental chamber study compared physiological responses of volunteers exercising in MOPP 0, MOPP 1, and MOPP 4 with equivalent <b>SIPE</b> configurations, including <b>SIPE</b> 4 with and without ambient air microclimate cooling (MCC). Responses to all uniforms were compared over 100 minutes of continuous treadmill walking at 30.0 deg C, 50% rh. Responses to MOPP 4 and <b>SIPE</b> 4 with no cooling were also compared over 100 minutes at 18.5 deg C, 50% rh. Responses to MOPP 4 and <b>SIPE</b> 4 MCC were compared over four hours of intermittent work-rest cycles at 30.0 deg C, [...]50% rh. There were no differences between MOPP 0 and <b>SIPE</b> 0, MOPP 1 and <b>SIPE</b> 1, and MOPP 4 and <b>SIPE</b> 4 with no cooling (in both environments) [...] Core temperature, skin temperature, heat storage, and heart rate were lower in <b>SIPE</b> 4 MCC than in MOPP 4; while evaporative cooling was greater in <b>SIPE</b> 4 MCC than in MOPP 4. Three volunteers completed the 4-hour tests in <b>SIPE</b> 4 MCC with similar advantageous trends apparent from the cooling. It is concluded that the <b>SIPE</b> clothing did not increase thermal strain compared to equivalent MOPP levels, and MCC, (although increasing uniform weight by approximately 10 kg) reduced thermal strain at 30.0 deg Celsius.|$|R

2500|$|When {{the communists}} learned that another eight {{nationalist}} divisions sent from Shenyang were pushing toward <b>Siping</b> (city) in three fronts {{parallel to the}} railway, the communists changed their strategy. [...] Instead of attempting to gain {{the control of the}} city, it was decided to kill as many enemy troops as possible so the attack on <b>Siping</b> was stopped and a total of nine communist divisions were gathered to face the nationalist Newly Organized 6th Army at the right. [...] On June 29, 1947, the communist force managed to inflict heavy damage on its target, with the 169th Division and the 22nd Division of the nationalist Newly Organized 6th Army were completely wiped out at the Sable Skin Village (Diaopi Tun, 貂皮屯) and Weiyuan Bunker (Weiyuan Bao, 威远堡) regions, while the 14th Division of the Newly Organized 6th Army lost an entire regiment at Lotus Street (Lianhua Jie, 莲花街) region.

[...] However, the fleeing nationalists were intercepted by the communist 6th Column, Eastern Manchurian Independent Division, the 1st Independent Division and 2nd Independent Division at the Peaceful River (Taipingchuan, 太平川) region. [...] By June 3, 1947, the last remnant of the nationalist 21st Division of the 60th Army was annihilated at the town of Jichang (吉昌). [...] By this time, the communists had managed to successfully eradicate nationalist from regions south of Jilin City and Changchun, and east of <b>Siping</b> (city), controlling the region between Changchun and Shenyang.

2500|$|Along {{with the}} 39th Army, the 113th Rifle Corps was {{transferred}} east {{with the end}} of the war in Europe. From 9 August, the corps fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.

2500|$|For {{the sake}} of {{bargaining}} with the Kuomintang in peace negotiations in 1946, Mao ordered Lin to assemble his army to take and defend key cities, which was against the previous strategy of the Red Army. Lin disagreed with this position, but was ordered by Mao to draw the KMT into a decisive battle and [...] "not give an inch of land" [...] around <b>Siping,</b> Jilin. In April 15, Lin orchestrated an ambush and forced KMT forces there to withdraw with heavy casualties. When the local KMT commander, Du Yuming, launched a counterattack on April 18, Mao ordered the troops there to hold the city indefinitely. The fighting continued until Mao finally allowed Lin to withdraw on May 19, which Lin did immediately, barely saving his army from encirclement and destruction.|$|E

[...] In the meantime, the communist 1st Column and the Independent 1st Division ambushed the nationalist reinforcement from Changchun on the eastern bank of Xinkai River (新开河), while the communist Western Manchurian Independent 3rd Division launched its offensives on Glass Mountain (Boli Shan, 玻璃山) and Twin Mountain (Shuang Shan, 双山) to the north of Village of the Zheng Family (Zhengjia Tun, 郑家屯), thus tying up the local nationalist garrison, the 87th Division of the 71st Army.|$|E

[...] Seizing on the opportunity, the communists were quick to exploiting the internal division among nationalist forces and planned another round of offensives.
