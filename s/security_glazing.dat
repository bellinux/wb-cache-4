50|$|Many gun safes {{sold in the}} UK {{are tested}} to BS BS7558/92, the British Standard for gun safes. The British Home Office {{recommends}} that new cabinets should conform to this standard. Glass fronted cabinets are legal in the U.K, provided the <b>security</b> <b>glazing</b> comply with BS5544 requirements and have no more weak spots than a full steel cabinet.|$|E
50|$|Polycarbonate (PC) {{thermoplastics}} {{are known}} under trademarks such as Lexan, Makrolon, Makroclear, and arcoPlus. They are easily worked, molded, and thermoformed for many applications, such as electronic components, construction materials, data storage devices, automotive and aircraft parts, check sockets in prosthetics, and <b>security</b> <b>glazing.</b> Polycarbonates {{do not have}} a unique resin identification code. Items made from polycarbonate can contain the precursor monomer bisphenol A (BPA).|$|E
5000|$|The main {{entrance}} lobby, hall floors, Wickham Street side entrance lobby, stair treads and landings in both stairwells are in pale gold and white terrazzo with black terrazzo borders to the floors. Two large plaster rosette pateras {{lie to the}} upper corners of the main lobby to {{each side of the}} elliptical moulded arch with large scroll keystone which separates the lobby from the hall. This opening has now been glazed and contains a <b>glazed</b> <b>security</b> door. The main stair doglegs off the hall and has a grooved silky oak handrail and 6"x6" [...] stop chamfered silky oak newels with sunk necking and domed caps. Ornamental consoles decorate the flat arched openings to the stairwell. The plaster ceilings to the lobby and hall are decorated with a border figure of tied bundles of straight twigs. The Wickham Street entrance stairwell has similar detailing but is narrower.|$|R
50|$|EN 1063, or CEN 1063, is a <b>security</b> <b>glazing</b> {{standard}} {{created by}} the European Committee for Standardization for measuring the protective strength of bullet-resistant glass. It is commonly {{used in conjunction with}} EN 1522 (Euronorm standard for Bullet Resistance in Windows, Doors, Shutters and Blinds) to form a ballistic classification system by which armored vehicles and structures are tested and rated. A similar classification system primarily used in the United States is NIJ Standard 0108, the U.S. National Institute of Justice's Standard for Ballistic Resistant Protective Materials which includes glass and armor plate.|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will focus}} on industry test methods and standards {{used to evaluate the}} performance of <b>security</b> <b>glazing</b> or glazing systems. Specific standards include two ASTM standards: ASTM F 1642 (airblast loadings), ASTM F 1233 (ballistics and physical attack); as well as the UL standards for burglary resistant glazing and bullet resistant glazing. These standards enable building owners and designers to better understand the performance of <b>security</b> <b>glazing</b> as a means of reducing the risk of personal injury and physical damage to a facility. The U. S. State Department is engaged in an active embassy construction program that specifies the blast performance of security windows. Although th...|$|E
40|$|MIL-HDBK- 1013 / 12 This {{handbook}} {{provides guidance}} to ensure that appropriate physical security considerations {{are included in the}} selection of glazing systems. The handbook is divided into two main parts: the introduction and analysis, and includes six supporting appendixes. The introduction begins with a section on the purpose and scope of the handbook and explains how to use it. A second section describes the different types of security glazings available. The final section characterizes aggressor threats and tactics that are applicable to glazing selection. The analysis discussion provides an overview and five other sections: ballistics, bomb, and forced entry attack analyses; environmental analysis; and cost analysis. The sections on attack analyses set minimum requirements and evaluate performance of glazing systems against the three tactics considered. The environmental analysis section provides a list of environmental effects to evaluate when incorporating <b>security</b> <b>glazing</b> systems into a facility. The cost analysis section provides procedures to estimate procurement and installation costs for a variety of glazing systems. The appendixes cover process charts, <b>security</b> <b>glazing</b> planning and analysis worksheets, Safevue procedures, risk analysis, examples, and cross-sections. The first appendix provides an introduction to process chart structures. The second appendix contains worksheets for use with selection and risk analysis procedures. The third appendix provides procedures for using the computer program Safevue. The fourth appendix includes an overview of risk analysis and three other sections: assets, design basis threat, and level of protection. This appendix assists in defining security requirements {{at the start of a}} project for efficient and costeffective integration into the total design. The section o...|$|E
