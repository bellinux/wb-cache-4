They were alone, but as they {{approached}} she learned from the talk of the natives that surrounded them that they possessed a considerable following that was camped outside the village. They were coming to palaver with The Sheik.|$|R

5000|$|The role of Maureen {{was written}} {{specifically}} for 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds, and {{was her first}} speaking role in a film.

Reynold's mother eventually solved the problem by having her daughter's ears pinned back surgically.|$|R

She stopped and <b>stuck</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in our door. She certainly was good-looking. But I knew how Joe Granberry stood with her.

But the two parties did not see one another that night, for one camped on one side of the hill while the other camped on the opposite side. But the next morning, the Frogman thought he would climb the hill and see what was on top of it, and at the same time Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, also decided to climb the hill to find if the wicker castle was visible from its top. So she <b>stuck</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> over an edge just as the Frogman's head appeared over another edge, and both, being surprised, kept still while they took a good look at one another.|$|E

500|$|In March 2013, {{a two-part}} hip hop track {{entitled}} [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was released onto Beyoncé's Soundcloud account.

This was melded with a Timbaland-produced second half, [...] "I Been On", that makes prominent use of a pitch-distorted vocal as a homage to the Houston hip hop scene. Michael Cragg of The Guardian described the song as [...] "brilliantly odd", commending its loud, abrasive production, while Pitchforks Lindsay Zoladz noted the song's assertiveness and believed it served as an introduction of what was to come. [...] "Bow Down/I Been On" [...] was perceived as a significant departure from Beyoncé's existing catalogue, particularly for its aggressive nature. The song's atmosphere and its controversial [...] "Bow down, bitches" [...] refrain drew a mixed reaction from those who questioned whether the lyric was aimed at women or merely a moment of braggadocio.

50|$|Following Louise's funeral, Amy {{meets with}} Miss Johnson on the house's roof, whereupon she claims how someone could have entered unseen {{but does not}} {{elaborate}} on this. That night, Miss Johnson unwittingly drinks a glass of hydrochloric acid that had been substituted for her usual glass of water on her nightstand. Amy comes across her, and hears her hint to the window before she dies; the nurse doesn't believe she committed suicide, and wonders if she was hinting to how the acid was switched for the water. After spending a day sending telegrams, Poirot brings everyone together and reveals that both women were murdered by Dr Leidner, who is in reality Frederick Bosner. In {{the aftermath of the}} train crash, Bosner came across the body of the real Erich Leidner, and seeing that his face had been disfigured, stole his identity in order to escape the authorities. His deeply possessive nature over Louise led him to write letters to her in her handwriting, to discourage her from other relationships, eventually remarrying her twelve years later when she could no longer recognise him. Upon seeing her fall in love with his friend, Richard Carey, he decided to murder her to ensure no-one else could have her. Poirot reveals how the murder was committed from the rooftop; after attracting Louise's attention with a mask he used on previous nights, Bosner dropped a heavy stone quern from above, the moment she <b>stuck</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> out of her window, before pulling it back up with a rope he tied to it. Visiting her room on the pretense of checking his wife, he then proceeded to move her body and the rug away from the window, before closing it, using Amy as part of his alibi to divert suspicion away from him. Miss Johnson was murdered, merely because she had figured out how Louise was killed; her hint was towards Louise's window, and not her own, as Amy had mistakenly believed.|$|E

Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament. Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and all pronounced the effect [...] "quite easy and fine". Meg's high-heeled slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it, and Jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed <b>stuck</b> straight into <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> which was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.|$|R

The awful process of human {{relationships}}, love and marital relationships especially.

All the bitterness of the conflict with this devil of an amiable spouse, who has got herself so <b>stuck</b> in <b>her</b> own <b>head.</b> It is terrible to be young.--But one fights one's way through it, till one is cleaned: the self-consciousness and sex-idea burned out of one, cauterized out bit by bit, and the self whole again, and at last free.|$|R
