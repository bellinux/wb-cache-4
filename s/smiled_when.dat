2500|$|At Loudon in the July race, Busch {{started in}} the front row {{alongside}} former teammate Brad Keselowski. After brother Kyle led 53 laps of the event, Kurt dominated the race leading for 102 laps and driving in the top ten. With about 75 laps left in the race Busch again crashed with Ryan Newman. Busch's crew fixed the car before the restart and got back on the track, but finished about 20 laps down. Kyle Busch, who finished in second spot in the race, stood up for Kurt as well as drivers such as David Gilliland, Danica Patrick and Kenseth. With his brother, Kyle spent the post-race ceremonies insulting Ryan Newman for his part in the accident. Kyle said to reporters [...] "I really hate that Kurt got tore up. He was the class of the race but man just stupidity. Ryan Newman is the biggest stupid idiot out there and is a big ogre. But we are all glad that he is out of a job." [...] It had been previously announced at nearly {{the same time as the}} post-race ceremonies, that Ryan Newman would not be a part of Stewart-Haas Racing in 2014. Newman just <b>smiled</b> <b>when</b> he heard these words and said [...] "They are both a heck of talent and both are good kids off the track but when they are on the track they are both not so bright. We'll leave it at that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Israel, through Unit 8200, {{has been}} speculated to be the country behind Stuxnet in many media reports and by experts such as Richard A. Falkenrath, former Senior Director for Policy and Plans within the US Office of Homeland Security. Yossi Melman, who covers {{intelligence}} for the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz and {{is writing a book}} about Israeli intelligence, also suspected that Israel was involved, noting that Meir Dagan, the former (up until 2011) head of the national intelligence agency Mossad, had his term extended in 2009 because he was said to be involved in important projects. Additionally, Israel now expects that Iran will have a nuclear weapon in 2014 or 2015 – at least three years later than earlier estimates – without the need for an Israeli military attack on Iranian nuclear facilities; [...] "They seem to know something, that they have more time than originally thought", he added. Israel has not publicly commented on the Stuxnet attack but confirmed that cyberwarfare is now among the pillars of its defense doctrine, with a military intelligence unit set up to pursue both defensive and offensive options. When questioned whether Israel was behind the virus in the fall of 2010, some Israeli officials broke into [...] "wide smiles", fueling speculation that the government of Israel was involved with its genesis. American presidential advisor Gary Samore also <b>smiled</b> <b>when</b> Stuxnet was mentioned, although American officials have indicated that the virus originated abroad. According to The Telegraph, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that a video celebrating operational successes of Gabi Ashkenazi, retiring IDF Chief of Staff, was shown at his retirement party and included references to Stuxnet, thus strengthening claims that Israel's security forces were responsible.|$|E
