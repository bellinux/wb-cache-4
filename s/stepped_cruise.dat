50|$|In 1981, {{after a good}} {{experience}} with the GT8 Geamatic, which was delievered in 1971, a further series of ten vehicles were commissioned with service numbers 205-214 on the route to Landwasser. The high-floor uni-directional trams were delivered with the white and red Freiburg livery and have two front headlights. The seats are arranged transversely in the diagram 2+1 instead of the mechanical <b>stepped</b> <b>cruise</b> control of earlier trams. The second series used {{for the first time}} a direct current controller, which was operated via set point transmitter. It allows a largely jerk-free acceleration and deceleration. Compared to the first series, which had scissor pantographs , the second series had single-arm pantographs.|$|E
50|$|As an {{aircraft}} burns fuel it gets lighter and can cruise higher {{where it is}} generally more efficient. <b>Step</b> climbs or <b>cruise</b> climbs facilitate this. VNAV can determine where the <b>step</b> or <b>cruise</b> climbs (where the aircraft drifts up) should occur to minimize fuel consumption.|$|R
5000|$|Wingsails are of {{two basic}} constructions that create an airfoil, [...] "soft" [...] (fabric-shaped) and [...] "hard" [...] (rigid-surfaced). L. Francis Herreshoff pioneered a {{precursor}} rig that had jib and main, {{each with a}} two-ply sail with leading edges attached to a rotating spar. The C Class Catamaran class has been experimenting and refining wingsails in a racing context since the 60s. Englishman, John Walker, explored the use of wingsails in cargo ships and developed the first practical application for sailing yachts in the 1990s [...] Wingsails have been applied to small vessels, like the Optimist dinghy and Laser, to cruising yachts, and most notably to high-performance multihull racing sailboats, like USA-17. The smallest craft have a unitary wing that is manually <b>stepped.</b> <b>Cruising</b> rigs have a soft rig that can be lowered, when not in use. High-performance rigs are often assembled of rigid components and must be stepped (installed) and unstepped by shore-side equipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Step</b> and <b>cruise</b> climbs are not {{normally}} applicable to lower-flying aircraft propelled by conventional piston engines with propellers or turboprops, since their performance characteristics {{may be very}} different from those of turbofan or jet engined aircraft. In fact, the most efficient altitude for a small general aviation aircraft may be only a few thousand feet above the ground, and increasing altitude may diminish efficiency rather than improve it (propellers tend to lose efficiency in thinner air, and many small general aviation aircraft lack supercharging, effectively decreasing the engines compression ratio, and therefore efficiency, as the aircraft climbs into more rarified atmosphere).|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Winglet Technology, {{with the}} help of Cessna, began flight testing epoxy/graphite {{elliptical}} winglets on a Citation X. Flight testing was nearing completion in late 2008, with FAA supplemental type certification expected in 2009. The winglets increase range by 150 nm, lower fuel burn by 4-5%, improve hot and high performance as well as climb rate, permitting a climb to flight level 430 in 22 minutes, as opposed to 26 minutes without the modification. Climb to flight level 450 at maximum takeoff weight is possible without a <b>step</b> climb. <b>Cruise</b> speed at altitude is expected to increase by 15 knots, and maximum takeoff weight will increase by 1200 lbs (545 kg). Excluding installation, the kit's projected cost is $395,000.|$|R
40|$|Valkyrie {{has been}} widely billed as the first of Tom <b>Cruise’s</b> <b>steps</b> back into the A-list stratosphere. After all the couch-jumping, manager-firing, studio-hopping, Scientology-spouting weirdness, Tom has {{apparently}} decided to get his career back on track (despite {{the fact that it}} is arguably in quite good shape, with the star sporting a recent Golden Globe nomination for his quite hilarious turn in Ben Stiller’s Tropic Thunder). Valkyrie is indeed a very serious and sombre film, and despite the fact that it’s backed by a healthy budget, it is a film that is all about performances, so with all of that in mind, it does seem like a decent choice for an actor bent on returning to centre stage...|$|R
40|$|A {{compromise}} solution to increase flight efficiency in cruise, but without penalising capacity (or even safety), would be perhaps to remove (or relax) the minimum {{rate of climb}} (ROC) constraint and/or to reduce {{the height of the}} <b>step</b> climbs in <b>cruise.</b> In this paper, the benefits (in terms of total operating costs) and the associated impact on the air traffic management (ATM) of such “relaxed cruise” operations are quantified for a representative medium-haul aircraft under different scenarios, by means of an in-house trajectory optimisation software. Results show that by reducing the minimum ROC from 500 to 300 ftmin- 1, whilst keeping the step climb height according to current reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) standard would give a good compromise between cost savings and impact on the ATM.

In the quarterfinals, he was halted with a 13-21, 15-21 loss to Kanta Tsuneyama of Japan.Ginting then participated at the 2014 BWF World Junior Championships in Alor Setar, Malaysia where he won a boys' singles bronze medal after bowed out in the semifinal to Shi Yuqi of China for 19-21, 15-21. He also competed at the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing, China and brought home a bronze medal after beating Aditya Joshi of India in the bronze-final match with a straight games 21-17, 21-16. In addition to competing in some international challenge tournaments, he also played in the BWF Grand Prix tournaments such as Chinese Taipei Open, Vietnam Open and Indonesian Masters.|$|R
40|$|A {{universal}} improved nonlinear longitudinal {{model of}} hypersonics developed by Langley lab is adopted. For the input/output (I/O) linearizing model, a sliding mode controller with index approach law as its reach method is designed. This method can solve the uncertainty problem and is insensitive to disturbance of outside interference. The simulation for tracking the height step and velocity <b>step</b> order at <b>cruise</b> conditions shows the sliding mode controller with index approach law boosts the tracking speed {{by more than}} 50 percent {{when compared with the}} controller with sign function as its reach law. In addition, the sliding controller with index approach law can eliminate steady state error which exists with the sign function method.

40|$|With the {{objective}} of reducing the flight cost {{and the amount of}} polluting emissions released in the atmosphere, a new optimization algorithm considering the climb, cruise and descent phases is presented for the reference vertical flight trajectory. The selection of the reference vertical navigation speeds and altitudes was solved as a discrete combinatory problem by means of a graph-tree passing through nodes using the beam search optimization technique. To achieve a compromise between the execution time and the algorithm’s ability to find the global optimal solution, a heuristic methodology introducing a parameter called “optimism coefficient was used in order to estimate the trajectory’s flight cost at every node. The optimal trajectory cost obtained with the developed algorithm was compared with the cost of the optimal trajectory provided by a commercial flight management system(FMS). The global optimal solution was validated against an exhaustive search algorithm(ESA), other than the proposed algorithm. The developed algorithm takes into account weather effects, <b>step</b> climbs during <b>cruise</b> and air traffic management constraints such as constant altitude segments, constant cruise Mach, and a pre-defined reference lateral navigation route. The aircraft fuel burn was computed using a numerical performance model which was created and validated using flight test experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{trajectory}} optimization {{is being}} looked {{as a way}} of reducing flight costs, fuel burned and emissions generated by the fuel consumption. The objective of this work is to find the optimal trajectory between two points. To find the optimal trajectory, the parameters of weight, cost index, initial coordinates, and meteorological conditions along the route are provided to the algorithm. This algorithm finds the trajectory where the global cost is the most economical. The global cost is a compromise between fuel burned and flight time, this is determined using a cost index that assigns a cost in terms of fuel to the flight time. The optimization is achieved by calculating a candidate optimal cruise trajectory profile from all the combinations available in the aircraft performance database. With this cruise candidate profile, more cruises profiles are calculated taken into account the climb and descend costs. During <b>cruise,</b> <b>step</b> climbs are evaluated to optimize the trajectory. The different trajectories are compared and the most economical one is defined as the optimal vertical navigation profile. From the optimal vertical navigation profile, different lateral routes are tested. Taking advantage of the meteorological influence, the algorithm looks for the lateral navigation trajectory where the global cost is the most economical. That route is then selected as the optimal lateral navigation profile. The meteorological data was obtained from environment Canada. The new way of obtaining data from the grid from environment Canada proposed in this work resulted in an important computation time reduction compared against other methods such as bilinear interpolation. The algorithm developed here was evaluated in two different aircraft: the Lockheed L- 1011 and the Sukhoi Russian regional jet. The algorithm was developed in MATLAB, and the validation was performed using Flight-Sim by Presagis and the FMS CMA- 9000 by CMC Electronics – Esterline. At the end of this work a new method of calculating the missed approach fuel burned and its emissions is developed and explained. This calculation was performed using an emissions database and a Visual Basic for applications code in Excel...|$|R
