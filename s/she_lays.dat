5|$|The spermatophores usually remain {{embedded}} {{near the}} mouth of the female. Mating usually occurs well before spawning, but may also happen on the spawning grounds themselves. In those cases, the male will stay near the female's side as <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> eggs.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the adult male Eurasian sparrowhawk loses {{a small amount}} of weight while feeding his mate before <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> eggs, and also when the young are large and require more food. The weight of the adult female is highest in May, when laying eggs, and lowest in August after {{the breeding}} cycle is complete. A study suggested that the number of eggs and subsequent breeding success are dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male is feeding her.|$|E
5|$|Ally then sings as <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> in the sand, moving sensually as an {{attractive}} man {{comes out of}} the water towards her. The camera fades to Lauren, who sings the bridge as she stands next to a background of rocks, as a take of another man is shown. The group is then scattered in different spots standing in a large rock formation, where shots of Dinah alone are spliced as she sings the chorus. Normani shares the chorus, as she sings on top of the rock cliff, shown earlier in the video. Camila seductively lays down and grabs her hair, in similarity to Ally. Several men approach the girls as they arrive in a convertible Jeep Wrangler. They greet and socialize with each other.|$|E
60|$|Here <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> breathless {{watching}} the lion; but the beast gave {{no indication that}} he had heard aught to arouse his suspicions. Again she rolled over, gaining a few more feet and again <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> in rigid contemplation of the beast's back.|$|R
50|$|And down in {{the sand}} <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> rolling about.|$|R
60|$|There <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> helpless--her {{authority}} set at naught; her person {{outraged by}} a brutal attack--there <b>she</b> <b>lay,</b> urged to action by every reason that a resolute woman could have for asserting her power, and avenging her wrong--without a creature {{to take her}} part, without an accomplice to serve her purpose.|$|R
5|$|The female {{song thrush}} builds a neat {{cup-shaped}} nest lined with mud and dry grass in a bush, tree or creeper, or, {{in the case}} of the Hebridean subspecies, on the ground. <b>She</b> <b>lays</b> four or five bright glossy blue eggs which are lightly spotted with black or purple; they are typically 2.7x2.0 centimetres (0.79x1.06in) in size and weigh 6.0grammes (0.21oz), of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs alone for 10–17days, and after hatching a similar time elapses until the young fledge. Two or three broods in a year is normal, although only one may be raised in the north of the range. On average, 54.6% of British juveniles survive the first year of life, and the adult annual survival rate is 62.2%. The typical lifespan is three years, but the maximum recorded age is 10years 8months.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Jo {{is furious}} to {{discover}} that all the chickens have been slaughtered. Blaming a local fox, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> traps for the animal and goes after it with a rifle, assisted by Jessica and Kator. When the hunt fails, Kator tracks and kills the fox {{on his own and}} presents it to Jessica and Jo as a trophy. The trio celebrate with a champagne party for which Jo dresses Kator in drag. A subsequent game of hide-and-seek brings out more of the hunter in Kator. Later, Jo is disturbed to find the fox carcass stripped bare and realises that the animal was not caught in a trap as she and Jessica thought. Jessica angrily rejects her warnings about Anders, interpreting Jo's fear as jealousy and revealing that she knows the truth about Simon.|$|E
5|$|Nominate T. merula may {{commence}} breeding in March, but {{eastern and}} Indian races are {{a month or}} more later, and the introduced New Zealand birds start nesting in August (late winter). The breeding pair prospect for a suitable nest site in a creeper or bush, favouring evergreen or thorny species such as ivy, holly, hawthorn, honeysuckle or pyracantha. Sometimes the birds will nest in sheds or outbuildings where a ledge or cavity is used. The cup-shaped nest is made with grasses, leaves and other vegetation, bound together with mud. It is built by the female alone. <b>She</b> <b>lays</b> three to five (usually four) bluish-green eggs marked with reddish-brown blotches, heaviest at the larger end; the eggs of nominate T. merula are 2.9×2.1centimetres (1.14×0.93in) in size and weigh 7.2grammes (0.25oz), of which 6% is shell. Eggs of birds of the southern Indian races are paler than those from the northern subcontinent and Europe.|$|E

5|$|Tess, {{awakening}} {{on a table}} {{inside a}} laboratory, is greeted by the parallel universe version of Lionel Luthor (John Glover), who reveals that Lex took his imperfect clones' best pieces and assembled them to create a perfect clone of himself. Lionel attempts to use Tess's heart to bring Lex back to life, but she breaks free and shoots Lionel during her escape. Lionel makes a deal with Darkseid to bring his son to life in exchange for Lionel's soul. Clark tracks Tess to the Luthor Mansion, where he is confronted by Lex. Clark apologizes {{for not being able}} to save Lex, but declares that he will always be there to stop him in the future. Oliver confronts Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey, dispatching them with three arrows. At LuthorCorp, Tess confronts Lex, who reveals that he always knew that she was his sister and that he used her. Lex embraces Tess, and stabs her in the stomach as he tells her he loves her, claiming to be saving her from becoming like him. As <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> dying, she infects Lex with a neurotoxin that erases all of his memories within 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E
25|$|Lucilia cuprina also {{causes the}} {{condition}} known as 'sheep strike'. The female fly locates a sheep {{with an open}} wound in which <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> her eggs. The emerging larvae cause large lesions on the sheep, which {{may prove to be}} fatal.|$|E

6000|$|Afterwards madness {{fell upon}} Nada, my daughter, and <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> {{in the cave}} for days and nights, nor knew ever how long <b>she</b> <b>lay.</b> And with her madness came visions, for she dreamed that the dead One whom Galazi had told her of sat once more aloft in his niche {{at the end of}} the cave and spoke to her, saying:-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{allowed the}} old woman to lead her gently to her bedchamber, where within the narrow alcove <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> all that night tossing upon the silken {{mattress}} that was stuffed with eiderdown. Sleep would not come to her, and hour after hour <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> there, her eyes fixed into the darkness on which, at times, her fevered fancy traced a glowing cross.|$|R
25|$|Members of the Royal Family have {{presided over}} {{military}} ceremonies, including Trooping the Colours, inspections of the troops, and anniversaries of key battles. When the Queen is in Canberra, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> a wreath at the Australian War Memorial. In 2003, the Queen acted in her capacity as Australian monarch when she dedicated the Australian War Memorial in Hyde Park, London.|$|E
25|$|The {{queen bee}} {{is able to}} control the sex of the eggs <b>she</b> <b>lays.</b> The queen lays a fertilized (female) or unfertilized (male) egg {{according}} to the width of the cell. Drones are raised in cells that are significantly larger than the cells used for workers. The queen fertilizes the egg by selectively releasing sperm from her spermatheca as the egg passes through her oviduct.|$|E
25|$|The queen lays {{less than}} 1.5 eggs per day on average. <b>She</b> <b>lays</b> eggs {{parallel}} {{to the construction of}} the cells. She may lay two eggs in the same cell, even if there are open cells—in this case, only one egg develops. However, no more than 20% of the cells are empty at a time. However, a queen does not reuse cells once an egg has occupied them.|$|E

25|$|H. bolina {{is known}} for {{maternal}} care, with the females guarding leaves where eggs have been laid. Males are also very territorial and site fidelity increases with age. Territories that enhance the detection of females are preferred. The female hovers over a plant to check for ants which will eat her eggs. After selecting a plant which has no ants on it, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> at least one but often two to five eggs on the undersides of the leaves.|$|E
25|$|The males fly {{every night}} {{of their lives}} in search of females, whereas the females only fly on the first night. Thereafter, the females release {{pheromone}}s to attract males. Since the pheromone is carried by the wind, males tend to travel up the concentration gradient, i.e., toward the source. During flight, they are subject to predation by bats. The males guard the female from other males until <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> the eggs. The female lays about 2,000 pale-green ovoid eggs about 1mm in length into crevices in bark with her ovipositor.|$|E
25|$|The {{stationary}} phase, which lasts {{about two}} to three weeks, begins when the larvae pupate. From this point on, the prey that were previously fed to the larvae are now fed exclusively to the queen. The abdomen (gaster) of the queen swells significantly, and <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> her eggs. At {{the end of the}} stationary phase, both the pupae emerge from their cocoons (eclosion) and the next generation of eggs hatch so the colony has a new group of workers and larvae. After this, the ants resume the nomadic phase.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> a {{long time}} there, glad of her escape, and then she sat up listening.|$|R

25|$|Male {{cuttlefish}} challenge {{one another}} for dominance and the best den during mating season. During this challenge, no direct contact is usually made. The animals threaten each other until one of them backs down and swims away. Eventually, the larger male cuttlefish mate with the females by grabbing them with their tentacles, turning the female so that the two animals are face-to-face, then using a specialized tentacle to insert sperm sacs into an opening near the female's mouth. The male then guards the female until <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> the eggs a few hours later.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the mite's cycle depends on species and {{environment}} but normally lasts two to 12 months. The number of cycles in a year depends on the region. For example, in a temperate region, there might only be three per year, but in tropical regions the cycle might be continuous all year long. Adult harvest mites overwinter in protected places such as slightly below the soil. Females become active in the spring, and once the ground temperature is regularly above , <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> eggs in vegetation, up to 15 eggs per day. The eggs are round and are dormant for about six days, after which the nonfeeding prelarvae emerge, with only three pairs of legs. After about six days, the prelarva grows into its larval stage.|$|E
25|$|Males {{fertilize}} females only by traumatic insemination {{into the}} structure called the ectospermalege (the organ of Berlese, however the organ of Ribaga, {{as it was}} first named, was first designated as an organ of stridulation. These two names are not descriptive, so other terminologies are used). On fertilization, the female's ovaries finish developing, which suggests that sperm plays a role other than fertilizing the egg. Fertilization also allows for egg production through the corpus allatum. Sperm remains viable in a female's spermathecae (a better term is conceptacle), a sperm-carrying sack, {{for a long period}} of time as long as body temperature is optimum. The female lays fertilized eggs until she depletes the sperm found in her conceptacle. After the depletion of sperm, <b>she</b> <b>lays</b> a few sterile eggs. The number of eggs a C. lectularius female produces does not depend on the sperm she harbors, but on the female's nutritional level.|$|E
60|$|That was {{his answer}} to the {{wavering}} and nobility of Ellen. And she in her turn had no answer to make. She crept away into the corner behind the curtain, and there on her couch in the semidarkness <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> with strained heart, and a resurging, unconquerable tumult in her mind. And <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> there {{from the middle of}} that afternoon until the next morning.|$|R
60|$|All the restlessness gone then, and all {{the sweet}} {{patience}} of her natural disposition purified by the resignation of her soul, <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> upon her bed through the whole round of changes of the seasons. <b>She</b> <b>lay</b> upon her bed through fifteen months. In all that time, her old cheerfulness never quitted her. In all that time, not an impatient or a querulous minute can be remembered.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>lay</b> {{down in the}} {{afternoon}} and tried to sleep; but her brain was inexorably alert, and <b>she</b> <b>lay</b> making inventory of all the pleasant things she was to leave for that ugly fate she had insisted on. A swarm of fancies gave every detail of the parting dramatic intensity. Amidst the poignancy of her regrets, her shame for her recreancy was sharper still.|$|R
