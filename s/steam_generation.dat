25|$|Aside from {{physical}} or chemical analyses {{to determine the}} handling and pollutant profile of a coal, the energy output of a coal is determined using a bomb calorimeter which measures the specific energy output of a coal during complete combustion. This is required particularly for coals used in <b>steam</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
25|$|To aid combustion, {{liquefied}} sulfur (140–150°C) is sprayed {{through an}} atomizing nozzle to generate fine drops of sulfur {{with a large}} surface area. The reaction is exothermic, and the combustion produces temperatures of 1000–1600°C. The significant amount of heat produced is recovered by <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> that can subsequently be converted to electricity.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a {{provision}} {{was added to}} the LCFS that allows refiners to receive credits for the deployment of innovative crude production technologies, such as carbon capture and sequestration or solar <b>steam</b> <b>generation.</b> Solar thermal enhanced oil recovery is a form of enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which is key to harvesting California’s heavy crude. Currently, California uses EOR to help produce about 60% of its crude output. By using solar power instead of natural gas to create steam for EOR, solar <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> reduces the amount of emissions produced during oil extraction, thus lowering the overall carbon intensity of crude. California currently has two solar EOR projects in operation, one in McKittrick, operated by LINN Energy (formerly Berry Petroleum) using enclosed trough technology from GlassPoint Solar, and another in Coalinga operated by Chevron Corporation using BrightSource Energy power tower technology. CARB is currently considering an amendment to allow upstream operators to receive credits for deploying innovative crude production technologies.|$|E
50|$|School 87 was {{constructed}} in 1915 to house Technical High School, which had been previously been housed at 102 Elm Street in School 11. The building was unique {{in that it was}} the only public school in Buffalo history to provide its own power and electricity by way of <b>steam</b> <b>generations</b> powered by high pressure boilers. These boilers provided electricity not only for Technical High, but for School 32, located {{across the street from the}} building.

25|$|By the 1920s most of {{the nine}} mines on the Line of Lode had their own steam powered {{electrical}} generators to power the surface and underground workings. As Broken Hill is in a desert with little water and virtually no fuel, <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> was an expensive option. In 1927 {{a plan for a}} central power generating facility was proposed by F. J. Mars, consulting electrical engineer with the Central Mine. The proposed powerhouse would provide electricity and compressed air.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{range from}} {{residential}} buyers to huge industrial consumers mining the oil sands, operating pipelines and milling forest products. On the supply side, generators range from wind farms east of Crowsnest Pass to oilsands plants and other petroleum processing facilities which generate marketable electricity surplus {{to their own}} needs, to coal-fired plants near Edmonton. Because of lower altitude, cooler temperatures, greater supplies of water for cooling and <b>steam</b> <b>generation,</b> and large near surface supplies of thermal coal, central Alberta is thermodynamically {{the best place in}} Alberta to generate hydrocarbon-fuelled electricity.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Ballard {{investigated}} {{the wreck of}} RMS Lusitania off the Irish coast. It had been struck by a torpedo, whose explosion {{was followed by a}} second, much larger one. The wreck had been depth charged by the Royal Navy several years after the sinking, so it was difficult for Ballard to a do a forensic analysis. He determined the boilers were intact, and speculated the second explosion may have been caused by coal dust. Others have questioned this hypothesis. He has not ruled out the possibility of cold seawater contacting superheated water in the ship's <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> plant.|$|E

25|$|Ramp {{is defined}} as the rate of change in {{temperature}} over time, expressed in degrees per second. The most commonly used process limit is 4°C/s, though many component and solder paste manufacturers specify the value as 2°C/s. Many components have a specification where the rise in temperature should not exceed a specified temperature per second, such as 2°C/s. Rapid evaporation of the flux contained in the solder paste can lead to defects, such as lead lift, tombstoning, and solder balls. Additionally, rapid heat can lead to <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> within the component if the moisture content is high, resulting in the formation of microcracks.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, Pacific Rolling Mills {{was joined}} in the Potrero by the City Gas Company, a coal {{gasification}} plant built to supply gas for lighting the city. Coal (and later fuel oil) <b>steam</b> <b>generation</b> was used to generate heat, power and electricity. The gas plant in the Potrero was for many years {{the largest and most}} important gas manufacturing plant in San Francisco. Construction began in 1870 on lots between Humboldt and Sierra streets (later renamed). Originally a coal-gas works, Springer water-gas generators were added in 1888. By 1905, PG had consolidated much of the power generation in the state, including the Potrero works. After the 1906 removal of the coal-gas retorts, the Potrero plant became an oil-gas facility. For fifty years the Potrero plant used gasification to drive steam turbines and power the city of San Francisco.|$|E

50|$|Silica is a {{contaminant}} that is {{detrimental to}} microelectronics processing {{and must be}} maintained at sub-ppb levels. In <b>steam</b> power <b>generation</b> silica can form deposits on heat-exchange surfaces where it reduces thermal efficiency.

40|$|Financial {{analysis}} of an ethanol/electricity cogeneration plant indicates a rapid payback of investment {{and a high}} internal rate of return. This is primarily because cogeneration of <b>steam</b> for <b>generation</b> of electricity and biomass conversion to ethanol results in increased engineering efficiency compared to alternative ethanol alone production processes.
