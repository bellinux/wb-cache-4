40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{alignment}} of the bar in a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) experiment plays a significant role in producing a good clean signal. In this paper, numerical simulations using ANSYS-LSDYNA are employed to comprehensively study the effects of bar misalignment in producing a distorted signal. There are six major types of bar misalignment that are commonly experienced: offset of neutral axis, uneven support height, non-parallel impact face, bar straightness, dome and cone impact face shapes. The numerical simulations are divided into two main sections, i. e. bar calibration and conventional SHPB testing. The distorted signal generated by misalignment produces unreliable data analysis and is mainly due to the presence of a flexural mode of vibration. Recommendations on <b>selecting</b> <b>bar</b> specifications to minimize the deviation of results are presented...|$|E

50|$|However, the Bell System Type B {{crossbar}} switch of the 1960s {{was made in}} the largest quantity. The majority were 200-point switches, with twenty verticals and ten levels of three wires, Each <b>select</b> <b>bar</b> carries ten fingers so that any of the ten circuits assigned to the ten verticals can connect to either of two levels. Five <b>select</b> <b>bars,</b> each able to rotate up or down, mean a choice of ten links to the next stage of switching. Each crosspoint in this particular model connected six wires. The vertical off-normal contacts next to the hold magnets are lined up along the bottom of the switch. They perform logic and memory functions, and the hold bar keeps them in the active position as long as the connection is up. The horizontal off-normals {{on the sides of the}} switch are activated by the horizontal bars when the butterfly magnets rotate them. This only happens while the connection is being set up, since the butterflies are only energized then.|$|R

40|$|Study objective: Multiple {{studies have}} found that, {{compared}} with employees in other settings, workers in bars and restaurants {{have been exposed to}} high levels of secondhand smoke, putting them at increased risk for health complications. Among these bar employees are many women of low socioeconomic status (SES). Smoke free workplace ordinances have been extended to bars and restaurants in cities and states throughout the USA; some bars, however, continue to be out of compliance with these laws. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the relation between bartender gender and smoke free workplace compliance in bars. Design: This paper reports on analyses of observational data on compliance with smoke free workplace policy in 121 randomly <b>selected</b> <b>bars</b> together with qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with bartenders and patrons in bars. Setting: San Francisco County bars. Main results: Findings from this research showed that smoke free policy non-compliance was associated with bars in which women were bartenders, increasing their tobacco exposure compared with male bartenders. In interviews, although some female bartenders expressed ambivalence toward the smoke free ordinance, many others described experiencing positive health and social consequences when the bars i...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 51) The {{purpose of}} this graduate project is to propose a comprehensive lighting design and color selection for a bar restaurant environment. The approach is based on design guidelines corresponding to the literature review and the restaurant???s problems.

The main lighting and color problem were defined: The restaurant has only one type of recessed lighting with a dimming system, and paint colors were selected based on the owner???s personal preference {{in order to create}} a new environment every year. This project provides lighting design and color selection guidelines based on the literature review and the existing problems. These guidelines were taken into consideration to design the <b>selected</b> <b>bar</b> restaurant area, consisting of the entrance, dining room, and bar, of a restaurant located at Chatsworth, California. Therefore, this project offered a new lighting layout and used the recommended foot- candles to create the atmosphere.

5000|$|Crossbar {{switches}} use switching matrices {{made from}} a two-dimensional array of contacts arranged in an x-y format. These switching matrices are operated {{by a series of}} horizontal bars arranged over the contacts. Each such [...] "select" [...] bar can be rocked up or down by electromagnets to provide access to two levels of the matrix. A second set of vertical [...] "hold" [...] bars is set at right angles to the first (hence the name, [...] "crossbar") and also operated by electromagnets. The <b>select</b> <b>bars</b> carry spring-loaded wire fingers that enable the hold bars to operate the contacts beneath the <b>bars.</b> When the <b>select</b> and then the hold electromagnets operate in sequence to move the bars, they trap one of the spring fingers to close the contacts beneath the point where two bars cross. This then makes the connection through the switch as part of setting up a calling path through the exchange. Once connected, the select magnet is then released so it can use its other fingers for other connections, while the hold magnet remains energized {{for the duration of the}} call to maintain the connection. The crossbar switching interface was referred to as the TXK or TXC (telephone exchange crossbar) switch in the UK.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To measure {{exposure}} to second-hand smoke (SHS) in New Zealand bars {{before and after}} comprehensive smoke-free legislation enacted on 10 December 2004. Methods: Cotinine is the main specific metabolite of nicotine and a well-established biomarker for SHS exposure. We measured cotinine levels in saliva of non-smoking volunteers before and after a 3 h visit to 30 randomly <b>selected</b> <b>bars</b> in 3 cities across the country. Two measures of cotinine before the smoke-free law change during winter and spring 2004, and two follow-up measurements in the same volunteers and venues during winter and spring 2005, were included. Results: Before the smoke-free law change, in all bars and in all volunteers, {{exposure to}} SHS was evident with an average increase in saliva cotinine of 0. 66 ng/ml (SE 0. 03 ng/ml). Increases in cotinine correlated strongly with the volunteers' subjective observation of ventilation, air quality and counts of lit cigarettes. However, even venues that were judged to be ''seemingly smoke free'' with ''good ventilation'' produced discernable levels of SHS exposure. After the law change, there remained some exposure to SHS, but at much lower levels (mean saliva cotinine increase of 0. 08 ng/ml, SE 0. 01 ng/ml). Smoking indoors in bars was almost totally eliminated: in 2005 only one lit cigarette was observed in 30 visits. Conclusions: Comprehensive smoke-free legislation in New Zealand seems to have reduced exposure of bar patrons to SHS by about 90 %. Residual exposures to SHS in bars do not result from illicit smoking indoors. Full Tex...|$|R

To {{maintain}} the unique and extravagant style of the event, different ticket categories are available: a fixed {{number of tickets}} called “Style Tickets” are available at half price and are for those who meet the dress code of the Life Ball Style Bible. The costumes should correspond {{to the theme of}} the Ball. These are also the only guests—besides the stars—who are allowed to walk down the red carpet, which leads from Ringstrasse Boulevard across city hall square to the main stage in front of Vienna’s city hall. In the run-up to the 2008 Ball, Gery Keszler voiced the wish that guests try to be less provocative and more creative. As Chris Lohner put it: [...] "A penis is not yet a costume". Guests can apply for Style Tickets on the Style Bible webpage. Guests in normal evening attire pay the full ticket price. In 2001, a ticket sales system in which interested parties register in a raffle for tickets via text message was introduced. Usually, as many as 60,000 ticket registrations are received within the two-day sales period. The lucky ticket winners in both categories are selected randomly from all applications. A small number of tickets is issued through various campaigns (e.g., Life Ball Warm Up, eBay auctions, types of raffles where the ticket win is hidden in condom packages that are sold in <b>selected</b> <b>bars</b> and restaurants, a.s.o.)
