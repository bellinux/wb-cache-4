There are less invasive means of imaging the biliary tree including transabdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound. If the biliary system is obstructed, PTC {{may be used}} to perform biliary drainage until a more permanent solution for the obstruction is performed (e.g. surgery). Additionally, self expanding metal stents can be placed across malignant biliary strictures to allow palliative drainage. Percutaneous placement of metal stents can be utilised when therapeutic ERCP has been unsuccessful, anatomy is altered precluding endoscopic access to the duodenum, or where there has been separation of the segmental biliary drainage of the liver, allowing more <b>selective</b> <b>placement</b> of metal stents.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the relative benefits and cost-effectiveness of treating iliac arterial occlusive disease with various interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was analyzed in a hypothetical cohort {{of patients with}} intermittent claudication caused by an iliac arterial stenosis. primary stent placement, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), and PTA with <b>selective</b> stent <b>placement</b> were analyzed. Reduction {{in the risk of}} failure after primary stent placement versus that after PTA with <b>selective</b> stent <b>placement,</b> quality of life, and cost data were derived from results of a randomized, controlled trial. Complication rates, patency results, and the reduction in risk of failure were derived from a published meta-analysis. RESULTS; PTA with <b>selective</b> stent <b>placement</b> yielded equivalent complication rates. patency results, and quality-of-life outcomes compared with those of primary stent cement, and the latter cost $ 957 less (95 % confidence interval = $ 726, $ 1, 188). PTA with selective-stent placement was more expensive than PTA alone but yielded higher patency results (relative risk of long-term failure, 0. 61; 95 % confidence interval = 0. 49, 0. 75) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (0. 2 quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained) and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $ 20, 000 per QALY gained.

40|$|Background and aims: Competition is an {{important}} force shaping plant communities. Here we test the hypothesis that high overall root length density and <b>selective</b> root <b>placement</b> in nutrient patches, as two alternative strategies, confer competitive advantage in species mixtures. Methods: We performed a full-factorial pairwise competition experiment with eight grassland species in soil with homogeneously distributed nutrients, or with nutrients concentrated in a single patch. We measured species-specific relative growth rate, root length density, <b>selective</b> root <b>placement,</b> and ion uptake rates of all species in monocultures and in mixtures. Results: Grasses showed higher specific root length overall and forbs a higher <b>selective</b> root <b>placement</b> in the nutrient patch. However, relative growth rate and root length density were more strongly related to competitive ability (measured as relative yield per plant), with little distinction between grasses and forbs. Conclusions: Our results suggest that short-term competitive success was related to fast growth and high root densities, irrespective of nutrient heterogeneity. Developing a large root mass quickly may overwhelm the importance of other traits in the establishment phase of plants, although these other traits {{may prove to be}} important in the long run. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ethylene is {{a strong}} {{controller}} of root development, {{and it has been}} suggested that it is involved in the increase of lateral root development in nutrient-rich soil patches (<b>selective</b> root <b>placement).</b> Here, this contention was tested by comparing <b>selective</b> root <b>placement</b> of an ethylene-insensitive transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) genotype (Tetr) with that of wild-type (Wt) plants. - Wt and Tetr plants were grown in pots with locally increased nitrate or phosphate concentrations, after which the root growth patterns were compared with those of plants grown in pots with homogeneous nutrient distribution. - Tetr plants responded to nutrient patches in a similar way to Wt plants, by placing their roots preferentially at locations with higher nutrient content, and other aspects of plant morphology were also not greatly influenced by ethylene insensitivity. The response of both Wt and Tetr plants to high-nitrate patches was considerably stronger than to locally high phosphate, suggesting that the two responses are not linked in any functional or regulatory way. - As the response to nutrient patches was similar in ethylene-sensing and ethylene-insensitive plants, it is concluded that <b>selective</b> root <b>placement</b> in response to nitrate or phosphate is, at least in tobacco, not mediated or modified by ethylene actio...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{assess the}} quality of life in {{patients}} with iliac artery occlusive disease, we compared primary stent placement versus primary angioplasty followed by <b>selective</b> stent <b>placement</b> in a multicenter randomized controlled trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quality-of-life assessments were completed by 254 patients in a telephone interview. Assessment measures consisted of the RAND 36 -Item Health Survey 1. 0, time tradeoff, standard gamble, rating scale, health utilities index, and EuroQol- 5 D. The interviews were performed before treatment and after 1, 3, 12, and 24 months. When the 2 treatments were compared, no significant difference was observed (P> 0. 05).

40|$|A {{technique}} for shape-selective directed assembly of anisotropic, deformable, chemically-identical microcomponents onto patterned rigid templates based on {{shape and size}} differences is modeled and demonstrated. The assembly method not only controls the <b>selective</b> <b>placement</b> of the components, but also aligns the components with the assembly sites. Unlike the assembly of isotropic (spherical) microcomponents, in which only size differences {{can be used to}} discriminate among chemically-identical components to achieve <b>selective</b> <b>placement,</b> differences in both shape and size can enable selectivity in the assembly of anisotropic (non-spherical) microcomponents. The present selective directed assembly is driven by shape-matching to a microfabricated template to provide selectivity, uniform chemical surface functionalization to promote assembly, and megasonic excitation to prevent assembly into poorly shape-matched binding sites. A theoretical framework quantifies the predicted selectivity of this approach and predicts that it will be effective for many material combinations, including hydrogels and bio-compatible polymers. Experiments demonstrate successful directed assembly of cylindrical, hydrogel colloidal microcomponents with 26 μm mean diameter and 50 μm length into silicon templates patterned with hemicylindrical assembly sites. During the assembly, tapered microcomponents with 150 μm length and a nominal diameter of 26 μm that decreases along the components’ lengths were successfully excluded from hemicylindrical assembly sites.

All patients gave written informed consent. Two hundred seventy-nine patients (201 men, 78 women; mean age, 58 years) with iliac artery disease {{were randomly assigned to}} undergo primary stent placement (143 patients) or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with <b>selective</b> stent <b>placement</b> in cases in which the residual mean pressure gradient was greater than 10 nun Hg across the treated site (136 patients). Before and at 3, 12, and 24 months and 5 - 8 years after treatment, all patients underwent assessment, which included duplex ultrasonography (US), ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement, Fontaine classification of symptoms, and completion of the Rand 36 -Item Health survey for quality-of-life assessment. Treatment was considered successful for symptoms if symptoms increased at least one Fontaine grade, for ABI if ABI increased more than 0. 10, for patency if peak systolic velocity ratio at duplex US was less than 2. 5, and for quality of life if the RAND 36 -Item Health Survey score increased more than 15 points. Effects of both treatments on symptoms, quality of life, patency, and ABI were compared by using survival analyses. Results: Patients who underwent PTA and <b>selective</b> stent <b>placement</b> had better improvement of symptoms (hazard ratio [HR], 0. 8; 95 % confidence limits [CLs]: 0. 6, 1. 0) than did patients treated with primary stent placement, whereas ABI (HR, 0. 9; 95 % CLs: 0. 7, 1. 3), iliac patency (HR, 1. 3; 95 % CLs: 0. 8, 2. 1), and score for quality of life for nine survey dimensions did not support a difference between treatment groups.

40|$|Background Percutaneous transluminal {{angioplasty}} (PTA) is a safe, simple, {{and successful}} treatment for intermittent claudication caused by iliac-artery occlusive disease. Primary stent placement {{has been proposed}} as more effective than PTA. We compared the technical results and clinical outcomes of two treatment strategies-primary placement of a stent across the stenotic segment of the iliac artery, or primary PTA followed by <b>selective</b> stent <b>placement</b> when haemodynamic results were inadequate. Methods We randomly assigned 279 patients with intermittent claudication, recruited from departments of vascular surgery, either to direct stent placement (group I, n= 143) or primary angioplasty (group II, n= 136), with subsequent stent placement {{in case of a}} residual mean pressure gradient greater than 10 mm Hg across the treated site. The main inclusion criterion was intermittent claudication on the basis of iliac-artery stenosis of more than 50 %, proven by angiography. All patients had a clinical assessment before intervention and at 3, 12, and 24 months. Clinical success was defined as improvement of at least one clinical category. Secondary endpoints were initial technical results, procedural complications, cumulative patency as assessed by duplex ultrasonography, and quality of life. Findings In group II, <b>selective</b> stent <b>placement</b> was done in 59 (43 %) of the 136 patients. The mean follow-up was 9. 3 months (range 3 - 24). Initial haemodynamic success and complication rates were 119 (81 %) of 149 limbs and 6 (4 %) of 143 limbs (group I) versus 103 (82 %) of 126 limbs and 10 (7 %) of 136 limbs (group II), respectively. Clinical success rates at 2 years were 29 (78 %) of 37 patients and 26 (77 %) of 34 patients in groups I and II, respectively (p= 0. 6); however, 43 % and 35 % of the patients, respectively, still had symptoms. Quality of life improved significantly after intervention (p Interpretation There were no substantial differences in technical results and clinical outcomes of the two treatment strategies both at short-term and long-term follow-up.

40|$|BackgroundThe routine use of {{intraoperative}} electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring with <b>selective</b> shunt <b>placement</b> during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) {{has been}} shown to be safe and effective. We attempt to identify the anatomic and clinical factors associated with significant EEG changes requiring shunt placement during CEA. MethodsBetween January 2005 and June 2007, 242 CEAs were performed with <b>selective</b> shunt <b>placement</b> for significant EEG changes. Risk factors assessed include severity of both ipsilateral and contralateral disease, presence of ipsilateral preoperative symptoms, hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, age, gender, and preemptive intraoperative blood pressure manipulation to ≥ 20 % above baseline before cross-clamping. Data were analyzed with the χ 2 test (P <. 05 was significant). ResultsCEA was performed for asymptomatic disease in 177 of 242 patients (73. 1 %). The perioperative stroke rate was 0. 8 % (2 of 242), and the overall morbidity rate was 4. 5 %. No patients died. Significant EEG changes requiring shunt occurred in 35 patients (14. 46 %). Factors associated with carotid shunt placement were moderate ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis (50 % to 79 %) compared with severe (≥ 80 %) disease (30. 6 % vs 11. 7 %, P =. 003) and degree of contralateral carotid stenosis (0 % to 49 %, 10. 8 %; 50 % to 79 %, 10. 9 %; 80 % to 99 %, 23. 2 %; occlusion, 50 %; P =. 0003). Presence of symptoms, gender, age, hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease, and preemptive intraoperative manipulation of blood pressure were not significant predictors of shunt placement. ConclusionCEA performed with routine EEG monitoring and <b>selective</b> shunt <b>placement</b> is associated with a low risk of perioperative stroke. Identified predictors of significant EEG changes were anatomic factors including degree of contralateral carotid artery disease and moderate ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis (50 % to 79 %).

40|$|Background Studies {{from the}} UK {{have shown that}} {{children}} with Down syndrome acquire more academic skills in regular education. Does this likewise hold true for the Dutch situation, even after the effect of <b>selective</b> <b>placement</b> has been taken into account? Method In 2006, an extensive questionnaire was sent to 160 parents of (specially and regularly placed) children with Down syndrome (born 19932000) in primary education in the Netherlands with {{a response rate of}} 76 %. Questions were related to the child's school history, academic and non-academic skills, intelligence quotient, parental educational level, the extent to which parents worked on academics with their child at home, and the amount of academic instructional time at school. Academic skills were predicted with the other variables as independents. Results For the children in regular schools much more time proved to be spent on academics. Academic performance appeared to be predicted reasonably well on the basis of age, non-academic skills, parental educational level {{and the extent to which}} parents worked at home on academics. However, more variance could be predicted when the total amount of years that the child spent in regular education was added, especially regarding reading and to a lesser extent regarding writing and math. In addition, we could prove that this finding could not be accounted for by endogenity. Conclusion Regularly placed children with Down syndrome learn more academics. However, this is not a straight consequence of inclusive placement and age alone, but is also determined by factors such as cognitive functioning, non-academic skills, parental educational level and the extent to which parents worked at home on academics.

40|$|The central aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the morphological root responses of floodplain plant species to flooding and to soil nutrient heterogeneity, the relation between these responses and their consequences for plant growth and performance. Both flooding and soil heterogeneity {{play a role in}} floodplain habitats and plants growing here have to deal with both factors to a certain extent, depending on the elevation level. The morphological root responses of plant species to flooding {{on the one hand and}} nutrient heterogeneity in the soil on the other hand are investigated. We asked whether a trade-off in the responses to these factors exists in eight plant species, originating from different habitats in the floodplain. An extension of this study with three wetland species is also described, as well as an experiment in which soil flooding and nutrient heterogeneity are combined. Plants were successively subjected to both factors, in order to determine whether and how the root responses to flooding and nutrient heterogeneity are expressed in the same individual. Rumex palustris proved to be very plastic in its root responses. In natural soils, spatial and temporal variability in nutrient availability is high and patches are likely to appear and disappear frequently, and this seems particularly true in the habitat of R. palustris. We studied whether there are costs associated with the disappearance or switch in location of nutrient-rich patches in the soil for R. palustris, after the roots proliferated in the patch. We also present the results of a competition experiment with R. palustris and Agrostis stolonifera. In its natural habitat, R. palustris does not experience much competition, but its high <b>selective</b> root <b>placement</b> suggests a high competitive ability for nutrients belowground. We thus investigated whether the high <b>selective</b> root <b>placement</b> of R. palustris is beneficial when it has to compete for nutrients in the soil...|$|R
40|$|Hamming {{codes are}} widely used for the single bit error {{correction}} double bit error detection (SEC-DED) which occurred during data transmission process. This paper presents an enhanced detection of double adjacent bit errors and correcting all possible single bit errors in Hamming codes through <b>selective</b> bit <b>placement</b> technique for memory application. Soft errors occur due to the radiation particles which affects the memory elements. These soft errors cause flipping of single bit or more often adjacent bits in the memory. Proposed technique improves the probability of detecting double adjacent bit errors and also provides a simple method of detecting double adjacent bit errors as compared to convolution coding through interleaving which is complex and requires higher memory. Hamming (12, 8) is implemented on hardware using RL 78 (G 13) Microcontroller...|$|R
