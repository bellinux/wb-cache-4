5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent {{about a year}} at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E
5|$|Blank debuted for the ECW brand as Kelly Kelly. Originally, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> named just 'Kelly', but her ring {{name was}} {{expanded}} to 'Kelly Kelly' by WWE chairman Vince McMahon. She made her debut {{on the first}} episode of ECW on June 13, 2006, becoming the youngest Diva on the WWE roster {{at the age of}} 19. Her character, an exhibitionist, was introduced performing a striptease for the crowd. The next week, while performing another striptease, Kelly was interrupted by her on-screen boyfriend, Mike Knox, who came to the stage and covered her with a towel before dragging her backstage. Her stripping became a weekly segment known as Kelly's Exposé and usually followed the same routine; Kelly would dance and strip until she was interrupted by Knox, who was upset by her exhibitionism and showing off her body to others. Originally a solo segment, Kelly was joined by the villainous Candice Michelle on the July 11 edition of ECW.|$|E

25|$|Tiresias {{also appears}} in Sophocles' Antigone. Creon, now king of Thebes, refuses <b>to</b> allow Polynices <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried. His niece, Antigone, defies {{the order and}} is caught; Creon decrees that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> buried alive. The gods express their disapproval of Creon's {{decision}} through Tiresias, who tells Creon 'the city is sick through your fault.' However, Antigone has already hanged herself rather than be buried alive. When Creon arrives at the tomb where <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interred, his son, Haemon who <b>was</b> betrothed <b>to</b> Antigone, attacks Creon and then kills himself. When Creon's wife, Eurydice, is informed of her son and Antigone's deaths, she too takes her own life.|$|R
5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E
5|$|By 1914, Hydra {{had been}} {{withdrawn}} from active duty {{to serve as}} a gunnery training ship. At the outbreak of World War I in at the end of July 1914, Greece's pro-German monarch, Constantine I, decided to remain neutral. The Entente powers landed troops in Salonika in 1915, which was a source of tension between France and Greece. In October 1916, Hydra and a pair of torpedo boats defected to the Venizelist faction in the National Schism. Ultimately, the French seized the Greek Navy on 19 October; the heavy units of the Greek fleet were disarmed and placed in reserve {{for the remainder of the}} war. Hydra was decommissioned in 1918 and stricken from the naval register the next year. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold for scrapping in 1921, but instead returned to her role as a naval artillery school from 1922 until 1929 when she was broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the ship}} was {{extended}} due to ventilation problems discovered during sea trials, which necessitated lengthy modifications. She spent the first {{two and a half}} years in Germany before being deployed to the East Asia Squadron at the end of 1897. She was present during the Boxer Rebellion and took part in the Battle of Taku Forts in 1900. Gefion returned to Germany in late 1901, where she was modernized and then placed in reserve. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recommissioned after the start of World War I, but shortages of personnel prevented her return to active service. Instead, she was used as a barracks ship. After the war, she was converted into a freighter and renamed Adolf Sommerfeld, though the conversion was not particularly successful and she was scrapped in 1923.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> leased by the Royal Australian Navy to {{supplement}} its amphibious lift fleet from the 14 October 2011 to 31 January 2012, with an option {{until the end}} of February 2012.|$|R

5|$|Gefion {{initially}} {{served with}} the main German fleet and frequently escorted Kaiser Wilhelm II's yacht Hohenzollern on trips to other European countries, including a state visit to Russia in 1897. In late 1897, Gefion was reassigned to the East Asia Squadron; she arrived there in May 1898. The ship {{took part in the}} Battle of Taku Forts in June 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion in China. She returned to Germany in 1901 and was modernized, but she did not return to service after the work was finished in 1904. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but a crew could not be assembled due to shortages of personnel. Instead, she was used as a barracks ship in Danzig from 1916 {{to the end of the}} war. In 1920, she was sold, converted into a freighter, and renamed Adolf Sommerfeld. She served in this capacity for only three years, and was broken up for scrap in Danzig in 1923.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, should he die without a male heir, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Prussian Navy sent then-Korvettenkapitän Alexander von Monts to Austria {{to examine}} the new Whitehead torpedoes then being {{developed}} there. Albrecht von Stosch, {{the commander in chief}} of the new Imperial German Navy, approved a plan to develop a torpedo arm for the German fleet, and placed Monts in charge of the program in 1873. That year, Stosch's naval construction program called for a tender for the new torpedo boats. The tender was ordered from the British firm the Thames Iron Works, and named Zieten. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the last major warship purchased by the German navy from a foreign shipyard.|$|E

5|$|Isabeau was {{dismissed}} by historians as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now {{see her as}} taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility {{as a direct result}} of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with Orléans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> portrayed as good or evil.|$|E
5|$|New Jerseys {{modernization}} {{was unique}} in that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only reactivated Iowa-class battleship to lose a gun turret. At the time the Navy made the announcement plans were underway to remove New Jerseys No. 3 16in gun turret (located aft of the superstructure). In its place the Navy planned to install one of two systems: a vertical launching missile magazine which would have enabled New Jersey to carry an additional 48 Tomahawk or Harpoon missiles, or using the space generated by a removed gun turret for aircraft related updates centering on VTOL or V/STOL type aircraft; however these ideas were ultimately dropped, and New Jersey retained her No. 3 Gun Turret during her 1980s career.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1903, the {{expedition}} reached Port Stanley, where they received their first {{news from the}} outside world since leaving the Cape Verde Islands. After a week's rest, Scotia departed for Buenos Aires, where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> repaired and provisioned for another season's work. Bruce had further business in the city; he intended to persuade the Argentine government to assume responsibility for the Laurie Island meteorological station after {{the expedition}}'s departure. During the voyage to Buenos Aires, Scotia ran aground in the Río de la Plata estuary, and was stranded for several days before floating free and being assisted into port by a tug, on 24 December.|$|E

5|$|California was a liner {{that had}} spent {{the first years of}} the war as an armed {{merchant}} cruiser before being converted to a troopship. She had previously carried troops to Bombay in India as part of convoys WS22 and 26. She returned to the Clyde from Gibraltar on 4June as part of Convoy MFK15 and spent the next month docked in Glasgow undergoing repairs. Once this work was complete, California began to embark 470 personnel bound for West Africa on 4July. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> accompanied on this voyage by SS Duchess of York, which had been tasked with carrying 600 Royal Air Force personnel and civilians to West Africa, but had missed an earlier convoy owing to electrical problems. Like California, Duchess of York was a pre-war liner which had been converted to a troopship. Prior to the ships' departure it was decided to use Duchess of York to transport elements of the 5th(West Africa) Brigade to Bombay after the ships arrived at Freetown, while California would instead carry other West African personnel to the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of Anderson's childhood, the Queales lived at 56 Villa Street, in a house abutting Yeronga Memorial Park. On {{the opposite side of}} the park was Yeronga State School, the school at which Anderson began her formal education. In spite of its reputation as one of the best state schools in Queensland at the time, Yeronga State School rapidly became a site of dread and frustration for Anderson, who suffered from a speech impediment that caused strife for her in the classroom. Anderson's speech impediment (as well as her occasional flirtations with truancy) became such a hindrance to her education that her parents decided that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> home-schooled by her mother for a year, while attending weekly speech therapy sessions in the city. In spite of these efforts, Anderson's slight stammer was to stay with her for the rest of her life; several observers commented that the impediment lent her speech a careful and deliberate air. Following her primary school education, Anderson attended high school at Brisbane State High School. Upon graduation, she attended Brisbane Technical College Art School.|$|E
5|$|The German {{military}} {{then turned}} its attention westward, and in April 1940 invaded Denmark. Schleswig-Holstein {{was assigned to}} the naval component of the invasion force. During the invasion, the ship was briefly grounded off the Danish coast. Following the operation, she was transferred back to training duties, as the flagship of the Chief of Training Units. At the end of 1943, the reactivation of Schleswig-Holstein was once again contemplated. In her favor was the fact that she retained some coal-fired boilers, given the ever-worsening oil-supply situation. Thus, on 1 February 1944 she was once again recommissioned, at first taking up her old role as a cadet training ship, then later in the year docking at Gotenhafen (Gdynia) for a refit. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> converted into a convoy escort ship with a greatly enhanced anti-aircraft armament, but after being hit three times by Royal Air Force bombers on 18 December 1944, she eventually foundered in shallow water. As the ship was permanently disabled, her crew was sent ashore to assist in the defense of Marienburg.|$|E

But after the rapes <b>she</b> <b>is</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dead. The Church then dismembers the Baby's body and sells his remains as religious relics to the townspeople.
