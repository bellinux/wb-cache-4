We investigate what they learn and how their learning gains can be explained. For these purposes, we use a pre-experimental research design with a pretest and posttest. Data from 588 students who took both pretest and posttest from 36 certified undergraduate teacher preparation programs were analyzed for this study. Pre-test and post-test scores were put on the same metric using an IRT equating procedure with fixed item parameter equating. Gain scores were computed by subtracting pretest scores from posttest scores. The result of paired samples t-test showed that the gain scores are statistically significant and the effect size was moderate with the value of 0. 51. A final multiple regression model with 4 <b>student-level</b> <b>predictors</b> explained about 30 % {{of the variation in}} gain scores. In the next phase of analysis we will explore additional predictors using multilevel modeling to incorporate instructor and institution level variables...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{simultaneously}} investigate student-, classroom-, and school-level risk factors for victimization. Both peer nominations and students 2 ̆ 7 self-reports of victimization were utilized. The sample consisted of 6731 Finnish elementary school students (3386 girls and 3345 boys) nested in 358 classrooms in 74 schools. The participants were from Grades 3, 4, and 5 (mean age 11. years). The results of multilevel analyses indicated that there was considerable variability in, and distinctive risk factors associated with, both peer- and self-reported victimization at all the three levels investigated. Social anxiety and peer rejection synergistically predicted victimization at the student level. At the classroom level, negative social outcome expectations of defending the victim were associated with an increased risk of a student being bullied. Victimization was also common in classrooms and schools where students perceived their teachers to have less disapproving attitudes toward bullying. Furthermore, the effects of the <b>student-level</b> <b>predictors</b> were found to vary across classrooms, and classroom size moderated the effects of social anxiety and peer rejection on victimization. By identifying the risk factors at the multiple levels, and looking into cross-level interactions among these factors, research can help to target interventions at the key ecological factors contributing to victimization, making it possible to maximize the effectiveness of interventions...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explored the}} academic growth in mathematics of a longitudinal cohort of 21, 567 Oregon students during middle school {{on a state}} accountability test. The student test scores were used to calculate estimates of school performance based on four different accountability models (percent proficient [PP], change in PP, multilevel growth, and growth mixture). On average, 72 % of Oregon eighth graders were proficient in mathematics in 2012, 71 % in the average school, and 6 % more students in this cohort demonstrated mathematics proficiency compared to 2011. The two-level unconditional multilevel growth model estimated the average intercept (Grade 6) to be 228. 4 (SE = 0. 07) scale score points with an average middle school growth rate of 5. 40 scale points per year (SE = 0. 02) on the state mathematics test. Student demographic characteristics were a statistically significant improvement on the unconditional model. A major shortcoming of this research, however, was the inability to find successful model convergence for any three-level growth model or any growth mixture model. A latent class growth {{analysis was used to}} uncover groups of students who shared common growth trajectories. A five-latent class solution best represented the data with the lowest BIC and a significant LMR p. Two of the latent classes were students who had high achievement in Grade 6 and demonstrated high growth across middle school and a second group with low sixth grade achievement that had below average growth in middle school. <b>Student-level</b> demographic <b>predictors</b> had statistically significant relations with growth characteristics and latent class membership. In comparing school performance based on the four different models, it was found that, although statistically correlated, the models of school performance ranked schools differently. A school’s percentage of proficient students in Grade 8 correlated moderately (r = [. 60,. 70]) with growth over the middle school years as estimated by the growth and LCGA models. About 70 % to 80 % of schools ranked more than 10 percentiles differently for every pairwise comparison of models. These results, like previous research call into question whether currently used models of school performance produce consistent and valid descriptions of school performance using state test scores...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} literatures on mathematics {{education and}} {{gifted and talented}} education share many common conclusions about effective practices for strengthening students’ cognitive engagement and deep conceptual understandings. Enrichment learning and differentiated instruction comprise two broad approaches long advocated by proponents of gifted education. Enrichment learning shares many conceptual parallels with process standards advocated in mathematics education. Yet the effectiveness of applying curricular and pedagogical principles initially developed for gifted education/talent development programs to heterogeneous elementary school mathematics classrooms has received little research attention. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} determine if these principles should be disseminated and implemented more frequently in mixed-ability classrooms, and if so, what student and contextual factors predict positive learning outcomes when using enriched and pre-differentiated instructional units in mathematics. To investigate this line of inquiry, The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented (NRC/GT) created a series of three enriched and pre-differentiated grade 3 mathematics units. The NRC/GT subsequently conducted a multisite cluster-randomized control trial to study the overall causal impact of implementing these units on students’ mathematical achievement, with performance on the Problem Solving and Data Interpretation subtest of the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) as the outcome measure. In addition to completing the ITBS measure, treatment students completed researcher-developed pretests and posttests for each of the three units to measure learning gains on specific content within the curricular units. The present study used multilevel models to clarify to what extent student-level factors (quantitative ability, gender, prior mathematics achievement, and status as a “high learning potential” nominee) and contextual factors (class average quantitative ability, class average prior mathematics achievement, teacher responses to the curriculum, and school aggregate SES) predicted treatment students’ outcomes on the researcher-developed tests. Student scores on composite unit pretests, unit posttests, and on the difference scores from pretest to posttest were regressed on these predictors in a series of two-level models. Further, three-level models were tested with a measurement model at level- 1 that examined each unit test as a subscale component of the composite test. Results indicate that quantitative ability, prior achievement, and being nominated as having high learning potential were predictive of composite pretest and posttest scores, but gender was not. Student gains were predicted by quantitative ability and nomination status, but not by gender and prior achievement. Classroom mean gains from pretest to posttest varied across the classrooms in the study, but only one relationship between a student-level variable and an outcome varied significantly. Consequently, no significant cross-level interactions were apparent from the two-level models. The three-level hierarchical multivariate linear models confirmed the standard HLM covariance structure was appropriate for the posttest, but suggested the pretest was more adequately modeled with heterogeneous level- 1 variances. Several <b>student-level</b> and cluster-level <b>predictors</b> explained the variance in particular subscales even though these effects were not found when modeling the composite measures...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between student- and school-level factors and student health and wellbeing outcomes, and to estimate the variability present at each of the student and school levels for each of three selected health-related outcomes. The data are from the 2006 Canadian Health Behaviour in School-aged children (HBSC) study in which Grades 6 - 10 students (NÂ =Â  9670) and administrators (NÂ =Â  187) were surveyed. The three outcome measures are Self-Rated Health (SRH), Emotional Wellbeing (EWB), and Subjective Health Complaints (SHC). Individual and school-level effects on the three outcomes were estimated using multi-level modeling. Both individual and school-level factors were associated with students' health. Gender, family wealth, family structure, academic achievement and neighbourhood were significant <b>student-level</b> <b>predictors.</b> We identified random associations between the student-level variables and reported health outcomes. These random effects indicate that the relationships between these student variables and health are not consistent across schools. Student Problem Behaviours at the school were significant predictors of SRH and SHC, while Student Aggression and the school's average socioeconomic standing were significant school-level predictors of EWB. Findings suggest that the environment and disciplinary climate in schools can predict student health and wellbeing outcomes, and may have important implications for school initiatives aimed at students who are struggling both emotionally and academically.
