To descend such large drops on a bobbin-type descender would be difficult owing to the thickness and stiffness of the rope, and the resulting descent would be slow and jerky. The bobbin-descender could also overheat and melt the surface of the rope.

Based on the interference model and the activity of sensor nodes around the sink, we derive the failure probability of the transmission from a source node located one hop away from the sink using Gaussian approximation. Under the requirement of 1 % failure probability of transmission, we determine the <b>sink</b> <b>capacity,</b> which is defined as the maximum number of concurrent sensor nodes located one hop away from the sink.

Two kinds of interference namely multiple access interference (MAI) and node interference (NI) are considered and an infinite ARQ is assumed at link layer between a sending node and sink till successful transmission of packetized data. An appropriate analytical model of interference considering correlation amongst interferers, power control error and shadowing is developed for evaluating bit error rate (BER), packet error rate (PER), average number of retransmission for successful delivery of information, throughput, and delay in a single hop communication. A simple energy model is used for evaluating the consumption of energy for successful delivery of information between source and sink.

During winter, dark-coloured pupae drop off the host onto the snow, where they are exposed to environmental temperature variation and predation as long as the new snowfall provides shelter against these mortality factors. The other possible option is to passively sink into the snow, which is aided by morphology of pupae. Here, we experimentally studied passive snow <b>sinking</b> <b>capacity</b> of pupae of L. cervi.

Reliable estimates of global isoprene emission from different ecosystems demand a clear understanding of the processes of both production and consumption. Although the biochemistry of isoprene production has been studied extensively and environmental controls over its emission are relatively well known, the study of isoprene consumption in soil has been largely neglected. Here, we present results on the production and consumption of isoprene studied by measuring the following different components: (1) leaf and soil and (2) at the whole ecosystem level in two distinct enclosed ultraviolet light-depleted mesocosms at the Biosphere 2 facility: a cottonwood plantation with trees grown at ambient and elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and a tropical rainforest, under well watered and drought conditions. Consumption of isoprene by soil was observed in both systems. The isoprene <b>sink</b> <b>capacity</b> of litter-free soil of the agriforest stands showed no significant response to different CO 2 treatments, while isoprene production was strongly depressed by elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. In both mesocosms, drought suppressed the <b>sink</b> <b>capacity,</b> but the full <b>sink</b> <b>capacity</b> of dry soil was recovered within a few hours upon rewetting. We conclude that soil uptake of atmospheric isoprene is likely to be modest but significant and needs {{to be taken into account}} for a comprehensive estimate of the global isoprene budget.

This study investigated with soybean plants how transplantation into larger pots affects various characteristics related to photosynthetic matter production. The transplantation was analyzed to increase leaf photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance without affecting significantly leaf intercellular CO 2 concentration, implicating that the transplantation induced equal increases {{in the rate of}} CO 2 diffusion via leaf stomata and the rate of CO 2 fixation in leaf photosynthetic cells. Analyses of Rubisco activity and contents of a substrate (ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate (RuBP)) for Rubisco and total protein in leaf suggested that an increase in leaf Rubisco activity, which is likely to result from an increase in leaf Rubisco content, could contribute to the transplantation-induced increase in leaf photosynthetic rate. Analyses of leaf major photosynthetic carbohydrates and dry weights of source and sink organs revealed that transplantation increased plant <b>sink</b> <b>capacity</b> that uses leaf starch, inducing a decrease in leaf starch content and an increase in whole plant growth, particularly, growth of sink organs. Previously, in the same soybean species, it was demonstrated that negative correlation exists between leaf starch content and photosynthetic rate and that accumulation of starch in leaf decreases the rate of CO 2 diffusion within leaf. Thus, it was suggested that the transplantation-induced increase in plant <b>sink</b> <b>capacity</b> decreasing leaf starch content could cause the transplantation-induced increase in leaf photosynthetic rate by inducing an increase in the rate of CO 2 diffusion within leaf and thereby substantiating an increase in leaf Rubisco activity in vivo.

40|$|Zea mays grown {{with high}} levels of N {{fertilizer}} transports more sucrose into kernels than with low N. Sucrose translocation was greatest in genotypes with the highest capacity to deposit nitrogenous compounds as zein and glutelin in the kernel. These two proteins combined contain about 80 % of the total N in the kernel and about 60 % of the total N in the plant at maturity. They appear to serve as a functional N sink for the deposition of nitrogenous compounds. As the N <b>sink</b> <b>capacity</b> increases with additional available N fertilizer, more sucrose is transported into the kernel, resulting in increased kernel weight and grain yield. Zein functions as a more dynamic N sink than glutelin because the synthesis of zein is readily manipulated by N fertilization and genetic means. Increases in N deposition in the normal endosperm induced by N fertilizer are confined primarily to zein. Early termination of zein accumulation in the opaque- 2 mutant results in a reduction of sucrose movement into kernels.

Plant growth characteristics, carbohydrate accumulation, C and nitrogen (N) allocation, photosynthetic capacity, N use efficiency and the morphology of mesophyll cells were investigated in the developing leaves (DLs) and expanded leaves (ELs) of both males and females. Elevated CO 2 enhanced plant growth and photosynthetic capacity in DLs of both males and females, and induced the male ELs to have a greater leaf mass production, net photosynthesis rate (P-n), chlorophyll a/b ratio (Chl a/b), soluble protein level (SP), photosynthetic N use efficiency and soluble sugar level compared with females at the same leaf stage.

Dry matter production was more markedly increased with nitrogen fertilizer application than in control, and it was higher with deep fertilizer application in Takanari and standard fertilizer application in Nipponbare, respectively. The differences in dry matter production resulted from CGR and mean LAI in rice cultivars. Greater dry matter production was accompanied with the nitrogen accumulation at harvesting. Rice cultivars accumulated the largest amount of nitrogen at deep fertilizer application. Higher fertilizer application increased the number of panicle and total spikelets m– 2.

Initially, the basic physiological processes that determine bean yields are discussed, namely (1) metabolic events such as photosynthesis, respiration, and N metabolism, which have a direct effect on growth, and (2) morphogenic events, such as germination, vegetative and reproductive growth, senescence and abscission, which affect the change in form or development of the plant. The integration of these processes through carbohydrate and N partitioning is reviewed {{as well as the}} source-sink model, information that is then applied to yield potential and stress tolerance. Specific physiological strategies for increasing yields considering both source (photosynthesis, respiration, light utilization) and <b>sink</b> <b>capacities</b> (flower, seed, and pod abortion, pod growth rates, HI) are reviewed. An ideotype for max. yield is proposed. The problems of earliness and seed size, and several nonconventional strategies are discussed; abiotic stresses that affect yield potential, such as drought and excess water, and rusticity in beans are also analyzed. Unpublished results obtained in research work in Latin America are included to illustrate physiological phenomena not considered in previous studies. Indications are that bean crop productivity can be improved only through 2 basic approaches: (1) modifying plant genotypes to fit the environment better and (2) changing the environment to ameliorate the effects of environmental stresses.
