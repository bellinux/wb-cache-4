The heat {{generating}} mechanism {{inside the}} cavity of rolling bearing is analyzed and the convective {{heat transfer coefficient}} of bearing raceway surface in different rotational speed is calculated under the oil-air lubrication and the <b>spray</b> <b>lubrication</b> in this paper. The fluid domain geometry model of {{deep groove ball bearing}} SKF 6208 is established, employing the flow field module in Workbench. The comparing simulations of the temperatures of rolling bearing cavity under the oil-air lubrication to the <b>spray</b> <b>lubrication</b> are done in different rotational speed. The simulation results show that the highest temperature of bearing cavity with the oil-air lubrication is almost the same to the <b>spray</b> <b>lubrication</b> when the bearing rotational speed is lower, and the highest temperature of bearing cavity with the oil-air lubrication is far lower than the <b>spray</b> <b>lubrication</b> when the bearing rotational speed is higher. Those conclusions verify the advantages of the oil-air lubrication in high rotational speed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{reliability}} when testing gear efficiency and on how gear mesh efficiency {{can be increased}} without {{detrimental effects on the}} gears. Test equipment commonly used in gear research was analysed to identify important parameters for gear efficiency testing. The effect of the bearing model's load-dependent losses on gear mesh efficiency was also investigated. Two different surface finishes of gears, ground and superfinished, were investigated to determine how two different load levels during running-in affect gear mesh efficiency and changes in surface roughness. Efficiency and gear temperature were also measured for ground and superfinished gears with dip lubrication, as well as two different forms of <b>spray</b> <b>lubrication</b> (before and after gear mesh contact). Tests on a gear test rig, showed that different assemblies of the same test setup can yield different measurements of torque loss. The applied bearing model had a significant effect on the estimated gear mesh efficiency. The mesh efficiency of ground gears is affected by the running-in procedure, with a higher running-in load resulting in a higher mesh efficiency than a lower load. This effect was not seen for superfinished gears, which show the same gear mesh efficiency for both running-in loads. Gearbox efficiency increased with <b>spray</b> <b>lubrication</b> rather than dip lubrication. The gear mesh efficiency increased, and thus gear temperatures were reduced, when superfinished gears were used rather than ground gears. A lower gear temperature was measured when gears were spray lubricated at the mesh inlet rather than the mesh outlet. QC 20170314 </p...|$|E
40|$|This study {{tries to}} find out a better cooling and {{temperature}} homogenization as well as better die protection on high-pressure die-casting (HPDC) <b>spray</b> <b>lubrication.</b> Test procedures {{have been set up}} to study the Leidenfrost point (LFP), contact angle (CA), film thickness and protection from die soldering of lubricants typically applied into the die surfaces during HPDC process. Five different lubricants have been studied as well as the influence in different controllable process parameters (type of die material, oxidation of the surface, temperature, roughness, droplet diameter, water hardness and lubricant concentration). The increase of the LFP, avoiding film boiling regime, and a reduced CA, improve the cooling and film ability of die surface during spraying. The best chemistry exhibits high LFP, shows an increased thickness of the formed film and is more effective preventing the sticking of the aluminum part to the die surface. Thermogravimetric analysis shows better thermal properties for lubricants with anti-sticking performance. The study performed and the test protocols set up result in a better insight of the involved phenomena and allow selecting the most favorable operating window for HPDC lubrication...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In this study, a {{numerical}} simulation {{model of the}} oil spraying system is established. Design/methodology/approach: <b>Spraying</b> <b>lubrication</b> is a common form of the rolling bearing lubrication. Butwith the increase of the bearing speed, the roller cage is frequently shattered, which may lead to failure of thebearing. The shatter of roller cage {{may be related to}} the spraying mode of oil. For high-speed rolling bearing,the roller cage shatter can be cracked due to the shortage of oil, caused by lubricating oil not sprayed into theroller cage shatter. This condition can be ameliorated by changing the spraying mode of oil supply system. Themodel considered the spraying speed, spraying angle, oil pressure, oil viscosity, structure of roller cage shatter,rotating speed as the main parameters. By optimization, the best way of oil spraying was obtained which canmeet lubrication requirement of high-speed rolling bearing. At the same time, the numerical simulation resultsalso revealed that the optimal spraying mode is different for different rolling bearings. Findings: The simulating results indicate that due to the effect of the air pressure and airflow thickness, theoptimal spraying position is at a region closer to the inner ring of the bearings. Practical implications: This paper will provide useful information to applying numerical simulation of the oilspraying system. Originality/value: The computer simulation allows to better understand the interdependence betweenparameters of process and choosing optimal solution...|$|R
40|$|To provide {{industrial}} {{confirmation of}} laboratory results produced in Task 6 of this project, five industrial trials were organized with cooperative die casters in the USA. Components cast during these trials ranged from functional electronic heat sinks to decorative household plumbing components. Whereas laboratory work indicated that die temperature and draft angle {{were the most}} important process factors influencing solder accumulation, {{it was not possible to}} vary draft angle on the established production dies used for these trials. Substantial variations in die temperature were realized however and also die surface conditions were varied, confirming the influence of a secondary variable in the laboratory investigation. Substantial evidence from the trials indicated that die surface temperature is the most important factor for controlling solder build up. The surface roughness of the die casting die greatly influenced the number of castings that could be run before solder initially appeared. Development of careful thermal management techniques, now judged to be beyond the capabilities of most US die casters, will be necessary to control incidences of die soldering found in typical production. Thermal control will involve both control of the bulk die temperature through use of thermally controlled cooling lines, and also regulation of surface temperature by well controlled cooling lines, and also regulation of surface temperature by well controlled die <b>spraying</b> (<b>lubrication)</b> techniques. Further research, development and technology transfer to enhance thermal control capabilities of US die casters is recommended...|$|R

40|$|The {{applicability}} of a once-through oil mist {{system to the}} lubrication of helicopter spur gears was investigated and compared to conventional jet <b>spray</b> <b>lubrication.</b> In the mist lubrication mode, cooling air was supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the out of mesh location of the gear sets. The mist air was also supplied at 366 K (200 F) to the radial position mist nozzle at a constant rate of 0. 0632 mol/s (3 SCFM) per nozzle. The lubricant contained in the mist air varied between 32 - 44 cc/hour. In the recirculating jet spray mode, the flow rate was varied between 1893 - 2650 cc/hour. Visual inspection revealed the jet spray mode produced a superior surface finish on the gear teeth but a thermal energy survey showed a 15 - 20 % increase in heat generated. The gear tooth condition in the mist lubrication mode system could be improved if the cooling air and lubricant/air flow ratio were increased. The test gearbox and the procedure used are described...|$|E
50|$|Only {{the fixed}} {{parts of the}} engine, such as the block and head, are cooled {{directly}} by the main coolant system. Moving parts such as the pistons, {{and to a lesser}} extent the crank and rods, must rely on the lubrication oil as a coolant, or to a very limited amount of conduction into the block and thence the main coolant. High performance engines frequently have additional oil, beyond the amount needed for <b>lubrication,</b> <b>sprayed</b> upwards onto the bottom of the piston just for extra cooling. Air-cooled motorcycles often rely heavily on oil-cooling in addition to air-cooling of the cylinder barrels.|$|R
40|$|Two phase flows arise {{commonly}} in {{a variety}} of physical, engineering and industrial applications such as filtration, <b>lubrication,</b> <b>spray</b> process, natural gas networks and nuclear reactor cooling etc. The hydrodynamic behaviour of the two phase flows such as pressure drop, void fraction or velocity distribution varies in a systematic way with the observed flow patterns just as in case of a single phase flow, whose behaviour depends upon whether the flow is in the laminar or turbulent regime. Understanding the non linear complex dynamics underlying gas – liquid flows is a significant but challenging problem. The primary task is to characterize and quantify the various flow patterns that often appear complex. The identification of a flow regime automatically provides a picture of the phase boundaries. The location of phase boundaries in turn allows one to make various order of magnitude calculations using integrated forms of the momentum and continuity equations. Such calculations suggest what variables might be worth while investigating and what kind of behaviour is to be expected. Present study focuses on evaluation of mass fluxes and phase parameters to identify the respective flow regime in two phase flows...|$|R
