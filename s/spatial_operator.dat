40|$|This {{invention}} is a robot {{control system}} based on a high level language implementing a <b>spatial</b> <b>operator</b> algebra. There are two high level languages included within the system. At the highest level, applications programs can be written in a robot-oriented applications language including broad operators such as MOVE and GRASP. The robot-oriented applications language statements are translated into statements in the <b>spatial</b> <b>operator</b> algebra language. Programming can also take place using the <b>spatial</b> <b>operator</b> algebra language. The statements in the <b>spatial</b> <b>operator</b> algebra language from either source are then translated into machine language statements for execution by a digital control computer. The system also includes the capability of executing the control code sequences in a simulation mode before actual execution to assure proper action at execution time. The robot's environment is checked {{as part of the}} process and dynamic reconfiguration is also possible. The languages and system allow the programming and control of multiple arms and the use of inward/outward spatial recursions in which every computational step can be related to a transformation from one point in the mechanical robot to another point to name two major advantages...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a constraint embedding approach for handling of local closure constraints in multibody system dynamics. The approach uses <b>spatial</b> <b>operator</b> techniques to eliminate local-loop constraints from {{a system to}} effectively convert it into a tree-topology system. This conversion to a tree-topology allows the direct application of the host of available techniques including mass matrix factorization and inversion {{to be applied to}} the system dynamics. One application is the extension of the well-known recursive O(N) forward dynamics for solving the system dynamics of these systems. The algorithms are especially applicable to systems where the constraints are confined to small-subgraphs within the system topology.

40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} {{method for}} a reaction-diffusion equation arising in biolm modelling is presented. The equation shows two non-standard {{effects in the}} <b>spatial</b> <b>operator,</b> degeneracy like the porous medium equation and a singularity as an a priori known upper bound is approached. The equation is transformed and formulated {{in terms of a}} new dependent variable. This transformation is chosen such that the resulting <b>spatial</b> <b>operator</b> is the Laplace operator and that the non-linear effects appear now in the time-derivative. The numerical method for the new equation follows Rothe’s approach: while a standard discretization for the spatial domain is used, a fully-implicit time-discretization scheme is developed that takes the special properties of the equation into account. This paper presents the formulation of this time-discretization scheme as well as its analysis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spatial</b> <b>operators</b> {{have been}} used to analyze the {{dynamics}} of robotic multibody systems and to develop novel computational dynamics algorithms. Mass matrix factorization, inversion, diagonalization, and linearization are among several new insights obtained using such operators. While initially developed for serial rigid body manipulators, the <b>spatial</b> <b>operators</b> and the related mathematical analysis have been shown to extend very broadly including to tree and closed topology systems, to systems with flexible joints, links, etc. This work uses concepts from graph theory to explore the mathematical foundations of <b>spatial</b> <b>operators.</b> The goal is to study and characterize the properties of the <b>spatial</b> <b>operators</b> at an abstract level {{so that they can be}} applied to a broader range of dynamics problems. The rich mathematical properties of the kinematics and dynamics of robotic multibody systems has been an area of strong research interest for several decades. These properties are important to understand the inherent physical behavior of systems, for stability and control analysis, for the development of computational algorithms, and for model development of faithful models. Recurring patterns in <b>spatial</b> <b>operators</b> leads one to ask the more abstract question about the properties and characteristics of <b>spatial</b> <b>operators</b> that make them so broadly applicable. The idea is to step back from the specific application systems, and understand more deeply the generic requirements and properties of <b>spatial</b> <b>operators,</b> so that the insights and techniques are readily available across different kinematics and dynamics problems. In this work, techniques from graph theory were used to explore the abstract basis for the <b>spatial</b> <b>operators.</b> The close relationship between the mathematical properties of adjacency matrices for graphs and those of <b>spatial</b> <b>operators</b> and their kernels were established. The connections hold across very basic requirements on the system topology, the nature of the component bodies, the indexing schemes, etc. The relationship of the underlying structure is intimately connected with efficient, recursive computational algorithms. The results provide the foundational groundwork for a much broader look at the key problems in kinematics and dynamics. The properties of general graphs and trees of nodes and edge were examined, as well as the properties of adjacency matrices that are used to describe graph connectivity. The nilpotency property of such matrices for directed trees was reviewed, and the adjacency matrices were generalized to the notion of block weighted adjacency matrices that support block matrix elements. This leads us to the development of the notion of <b>Spatial</b> Kernel <b>Operator</b> SKO kernels. These kernels provide the basis for the development of SKO resolvent operators...|$|R

For implicit schemes, we focus on the performance of several Krylov solvers used in the solution of the linear systems that must be solved at each iteration. As in the explicit case, one of the principal kernels for Krylov methods is the application of a vector to a <b>spatial</b> <b>operator</b> (the matrix).

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{numerical}} scheme for the space-time fractional parabolic equation, i. e., an equation involving a fractional time derivative and a fractional <b>spatial</b> <b>operator.</b> Both the initial value {{problem and the}} non-homogeneous forcing problem (with zero initial data) are considered. The solution operator E(t) for the initial value problem can be written as a Dunford-Taylor integral involving the Mittag-Leffler function e_α, 1 and the resolvent of the underlying (non-fractional) <b>spatial</b> <b>operator</b> over an appropriate integration path in the complex plane. Here α denotes {{the order of the}} fractional time derivative. The solution for the non-homogeneous problem can be written as a convolution involving an operator W(t) and the forcing function F(t). We develop and analyze semi-discrete methods based on finite element approximation to the underlying (non-fractional) <b>spatial</b> <b>operator</b> in terms of analogous Dunford-Taylor integrals applied to the discrete operator. The space error is of optimal order up to a logarithm of 1 /h. The fully discrete method for the initial value problem is developed from the semi-discrete approximation by applying an exponentially convergent sinc quadrature technique to approximate the Dunford-Taylor integral of the discrete operator and is free of any time stepping. To approximate the convolution appearing in the semi-discrete approximation to the non-homogeneous problem, we apply a pseudo midpoint quadrature. This involves the average of W_h(s), (the semi-discrete approximation to W(s)) over the quadrature interval. This average can also be written as a Dunford-Taylor integral. We first analyze the error between this quadrature and the semi-discrete approximation. To develop a fully discrete method, we then introduce sinc quadrature approximations to the Dunford-Taylor integrals for computing the averages. Comment: 29 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
