5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm.</b> The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
25|$|The H2 and H2R have a tubular, {{thin-wall}} steel {{trellis frame}} and a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm,</b> with traditional sportbike wheelbase.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{the company}} {{introduced}} the Ducati 916 model designed by Massimo Tamburini, a water-cooled version that allowed for higher output levels and a striking new bodywork that had aggressive lines, an underseat exhaust, and a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm.</b> Ducati has since ceased {{production of the}} 916, supplanting it (and its progeny, the 748, 996 and 998) with the 749 and 999.|$|E
50|$|On many shaft-drive {{motorcycles}} {{the drive}} shaft {{is contained in}} one of the long sides of the swingarm. Notable examples include all post-1955 BMW models prior to BMW's use of the <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarms,</b> Urals, many Moto Guzzi twins, the Honda Goldwing, the Yamaha XS Eleven, and the Yamaha FJR1300.|$|R
50|$|A <b>single-sided</b> hollow <b>swingarm</b> {{enclosing}} {{the drive}} shaft provides right side {{drive through the}} gearbox and to the rear wheel. The 3-into-1 all stainless steel exhaust exits on the left hand side.|$|R
50|$|Front {{suspension}} of the Kabinenroller was by a transverse lower arm sprung by a torsional 3-element rubber spring at the inside end. Front suspension travel was limited by rubber buffers. Rear suspension was by a trailing arm similar to a <b>single-sided</b> motorcycle <b>swingarm</b> which also formed the enclosure for the chain drive to the rear wheel. The trailing arm was suspended by another torsional rubber spring. Hydraulic dampers {{were added to the}} design with the introduction of the KR200 in 1955; also the front track was increased at that time.|$|R
5000|$|The stylish <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> was {{designed}} to make wheel changes faster during races.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Notable on {{this example}} are an {{extended}} <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> and {{the appropriation of}} the Decepticonlogo.|$|E

50|$|The Honda VFR750F is {{motorcycle}} {{produced by}} Honda from 1986 to 1997. Originally {{intended as a}} sports bike {{to compete with the}} Suzuki GSX-R750 and Yamaha FZ750 it was reassigned to a sports tourer with its replacement in racing of the Honda VFR750R followed by the introduction of the more rounded 1990 VFR750FL. The fully faired motorcycle was introduced with a 104 horsepower (77 kW) liquid-cooled double overhead cam (DOHC) V4 four-stroke engine. All generations of VFR750F since 1990 had an ELF-designed pro-arm <b>single-sided</b> rear <b>swingarm</b> and since 1986 had durable, gear-driven cams.|$|R
50|$|The {{stronger}} {{tubular steel}} chassis was mounted on wide 17 in FPS front wheels, 18s in the back, with low profile radial tyres. The rear suspension was a Bilstein shock absorber {{acting on a}} <b>single-sided</b> Paralever <b>swingarm,</b> which pushed the wheelbase out to 1565 mm. On the front were twin 41.7 mm Marzocchi forks. The brakes were four-pot Brembo over two-pot on the K100, {{with a pair of}} 305 mm drilled discs. An Anti-lock braking system was optional in all markets except North America, where it was standard.|$|R
40|$|Carbon fibre has {{not been}} {{extensively}} used {{in the development of}} motorcycle swingarms. This study investigates the development of a carbon fibre swingarm with an emphasis on the structural integrity and on developing a finite element model (FEM). The motorcycle swingarm is a critical component in the rear part of the motorcycle. The literature shows that swingarms need to be strong enough to handle various loads experienced in the field, stiff enough to increase motorcycle response and stability, and light enough to improve motorcycle performance and reduce the rear unsprung mass. To this end carbon fibre was used in the design of a swingarm for a Ducati 1098 motorcycle due to its high stiffness and strength to weight ratios. The current research presents {{the first step in the}} design process of a <b>single-sided</b> carbon fibre <b>swingarm.</b> A test rig was developed for testing the stiffness and strength of swingarms. Vertical, lateral and torsional stiffness values of 500 kN/m, 445 kN/m and 550 Nm/deg respectively, were determined from deflection measurements. The lateral and torsional stiffness values are on the lower spectrum of stiffness values when compared with swingarms measured in the literature which suggests the swingarm will exhibit a sluggish response and reduced weave mode stability at medium to high speeds. To determine the strength, strains were measured on the swingarm. Maximum strain values of 1100 μ were measured which are considerably lower than the ultimate strain of 8000 μ for the material which indicates the swingarm is strong enough. Furthermore, a finite element (FE) model was developed so that later design iterations could be completed more quickly and cheaply. The FE model showed good correlation with the vertical displacement results (difference 4...|$|R
50|$|Major {{redesign}} {{with new}} frame and bodywork, cartridge forks, <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> and wider wheels to accept more modern tyres, gain of some weight.|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{consists}} of a tubular steel frame with load-bearing engine. A hydraulic 50 mm diameter upside-down fork by Marzocchi with 170 mm of travel guides the front. The rear wheel is held by a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> with progressive linkage, which is damped by a Sachs-Boge monoshock with a progressively-acting lever system and 155 mm of travel. Power is transferred to the rear wheel via a shaft integrated into the <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> with two joints and an anti-torque reaction support.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, {{the company}} {{introduced}} the Ducati 916 model designed by Massimo Tamburini, with striking new bodywork that featured aggressive lines, under-seat exhausts, and a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The VFR800's frame, {{which uses}} the engine as a {{stressed}} member, {{was derived from}} the VTR1000 Firestorm, but it retains the trademark VFR <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> pivoted from the aft of the crankcase.|$|E
50|$|The Ariel Ace {{comes with}} a choice of two {{alternative}} front suspensions; either a conventional upside-down telescopic fork, or Ariel's own girder fork. Rear suspension uses a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm.</b> Final drive is shaft drive.|$|E
5000|$|Honda {{developed}} the RC30 as a homologation racing version {{which was used}} from 1988 to 1993. It was the first large capacity motorcycle to use a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm..</b> The RC30 was succeeded in 1994 by the RC45.|$|E
50|$|The Triumph Sprint ST is a sport touring {{motorcycle}} {{manufactured in}} the United Kingdom since 1999 by Triumph. With its large 4-stroke three-cylinder engine, an alloy-beam frame and a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm,</b> it competed successfully in the market against the Honda VFR800.|$|E
50|$|Starting in 1985, {{the road}} {{versions}} were {{equipped with a}} <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> (Monolever). From 1988 Paralever rear suspension was introduced, first in the GS models R80 GS and R100 GS, {{and later in the}} road versions R80 R and R100 R.|$|E
5000|$|The BMW R- and K-series {{combine a}} shaft-drive {{contained}} in the swing arm with a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm,</b> and the combination is marketed as the Paralever. Newer Moto Guzzi motorcycles use a similar arrangement marketed as the CA.R.C. ("CArdano Reattivo Compatto" [...] - Compact Reactive Shaft Drive).|$|E
5000|$|Journalist Kevin Ash {{suggested}} {{that although the}} 916 was [...] "one {{of the most influential}} machines of the last twenty years", the design is actually derivative of the Honda NR750, with the shared elements of underseat exhaust, narrow waist, similar squared-off dual headlights, and <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> holding a large-section rear tire.|$|E
5000|$|Single-sided swingarms {{date from}} at least the late 1940s. In 1948 the Imme R100 {{produced}} by Norbert Riedel of Germany had both a single-sided front wheel suspension {{as well as a}} single-sided rear swingarm that doubled as the exhaust pipe. [...] Later in 1950, Moto Guzzi introduced the Galletto, a large-wheel step-through scooter. In 1980, BMW introduced its first <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> on the R80G/S, the [...] "Mono-lever", which was superseded by the [...] "Para-lever" [...] used currently. Honda currently features this style of swingarm on the Honda VFR. Ducati has created several models featuring single swingarms, most notably the Massimo Tamburini-designed 916 series. While Ducati abandoned this style for the 999, the company returned to it for the 1098 superbike in 2007, and it survives in the current Ducati 1199. The Triumph Sprint ST also features a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati 916 is a fully faired sport bike made by Ducati from 1994 to 1998. Featuring a [...] fuel injected, 4-valve, desmo, liquid-cooled, 90° V-twin {{engine in}} a trellis frame with a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> and USD forks, the 916 has {{consistently}} been declared {{to be one}} of the most beautiful motorcycles ever produced.|$|E
50|$|In early 1983, BMW {{introduced}} a 987 cc, in-line four-cylinder, water-cooled fuel injected engine to the European market, the K100. The K series {{comes with a}} simplified and distinctive rear suspension, a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm.</b> (In 1985 the traditionally powered boxer R80RT touring bike received this monolever rear suspension system and in 1987 the R100RT received it).|$|E
50|$|In 1994, {{the company}} {{introduced}} the Ducati 916 model designed by Massimo Tamburini, a water-cooled version that allowed for higher output levels and a striking new bodywork that had aggressive lines, an underseat exhaust, and a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm.</b> Ducati has since ceased {{production of the}} 916, supplanting it (and its progeny, the 748, 996 and 998) with the 749 and 999.|$|E
5000|$|The VFR was {{originally}} a 750 cc, but became an 800 cc in due course. New models featured technological innovation, {{such as a}} <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm,</b> linked braking, ABS, and VTEC. The VFR1200 became the first motorcycle to feature a dual-clutch transmission. Not all of these [...] "innovations" [...] proved popular with riders, who often preferred the simple robustness of the earlier models.|$|E
5000|$|The Ducati 899 Panigale was a [...] sport bike from Ducati, {{released}} in 2013 {{to replace the}} 848. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. It has a [...] version of the engine in the previously released 1199 Panigale. Claimed dry weight is 169 kg. The 899 has a conventional two-sided swingarm, unlike the 1199 which has a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Ducati 1198 is a sport bike made by Ducati from 2009 to 2011. For the 2011 {{model year}} there were two models: the 1198 and 1198SP (replacing the 1198S). The 1198 shared design {{elements}} with its predecessor 1098, but has more power and torque, redesigned wheels, lighter headlights, traction control, and lighter fairings (on the S model), and a few minor paint changes. One carryover from its 998 heritage is the distinctive <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm.</b>|$|E
50|$|The MV Agusta F4 was the {{motorcycle}} that launched {{the resurrection of}} MV Agusta in 1998. The F4 was created by motorcycle designer Massimo Tamburini at CRC (Cagiva Research Center), following {{his work on the}} Ducati 916. The F4 has a four pipe undertail exhaust, <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm,</b> large front forks (49 or 50 mm diameter) and traditional MV Agusta red and silver livery. The F4 {{is also one of the}} few production superbikes to have a hemispherical chamber 4 valves per cylinder engine.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the end of}} the T309 run of Speed Triples, Triumph {{released}} the first of its new generation of fuel injected sportbikes, the T509 Speed Triple. The new bike was a total redesign. While the all new engine still displaced 885 cc, it now produced a claimed [...] and was fitted with an engine management system by SAGEM, a French company that built systems for automobiles. The T509 had new aluminium perimeter chassis, a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm,</b> and upgraded suspension components.|$|E
50|$|The compact, {{weatherproof}} drivetrain of the Yamahopper {{resembles a}} minimalist {{version of the}} enclosed shaft drivetrains of most BMW motorcycles. Its simple, maintenance-free shaft-drive contained in the <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> eliminates chain maintenance, safety and wear concerns as well as weather wear factors and contributes to the durability {{and ease of use}} of these tiny motorbikes. The drive unit also incorporates a traditional centrifugal clutch but only a single speed gearing, unlike most mopeds which have two speeds. The simplified driveshaft setup makes wheel changes easy.|$|E
5000|$|A {{single-sided}} front swingarm suspension {{was used}} on the Yamaha GTS1000, introduced in 1993. The GTS used the RADD, Inc. front suspension designed by James Parker. A single sided girder fork was use on the German Imme R100 motorcycle between 1949 and 1951, and the Vespa scooter has a single-sided trailing-link fork. More recently, between 1998 and 2003, the ItalJet [...] "Dragster" [...] scooter also used a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm</b> suspension, though unlike the GTS1000 there was no upper control arm; {{the upper part of}} the suspension on the Dragster served only to transmit steering input.|$|E
5000|$|The 748 cc Mk.I VFR750 was {{introduced}} in 1985, and was over-engineered {{in a bid to}} re-establish a reputation for reliability. It had an alloy beam frame, gear driven cams. The Mk.IA changed wheel sizes from 16" [...] front & 18" [...] rear to 17" [...] front and rear, and the fairing was slightly modified. After this was a series of VFR750 models which featured various innovations, including a <b>single-sided</b> <b>swingarm,</b> linked braking, ABS, and VTEC. In due course the geared cam drive was dropped in favour of cheaper chain-drive.|$|E
50|$|A <b>single-sided</b> <b>{{swingarm}}</b> {{is a type}} of swingarm {{which lies}} along only one side of the rear wheel, allowing the rear wheel to be mounted like a car wheel (unlike the conventional motorcycle double-sided swingarm). Single-sided swingarms are traditionally found on small motorcycles or scooters, where a robust chain case doubles as the swingarm linking the engine and rear wheel. Single-sided swingarms need to be much stiffer than the double-sided versions, to accommodate the extra torsional forces, and as a result, they are usually heavier than double-sided arms. Having a single mounting point guarantees proper wheel alignment.|$|E
