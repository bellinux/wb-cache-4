The insecticide was applied in a hyper/holoendemic malarious area of 200 km 2 inhabited by about 50 000 people. All houses and animal shelters were sprayed at a target dosage rate of 2 g/m 2 at 3 -month intervals {{for a total}} of 8 consecutive <b>spray</b> <b>rounds</b> in 2 years. The malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae species A and B and A. funestus were reduced to negligible densities indoors and outdoors immediately after initiation of spraying and for 10 months after the last <b>spray</b> <b>round.</b> However, A. gambiae reappeared during the main wet season at densities high enough to reestablish low-level transmission for short periods. Spraying produced a marked and rapid decrease in both the incidence and prevalence of malaria. The daily probability of acquiring malaria infection was reduced from 0. 009 before spraying to 0. 0003 under spray protection, a reduction of 96 %. Data collected on a longitudinal basis indicated that sustained spray protection would reduce malaria prevalence to an asymptotic limit of 6. 9 % under the assumption that the inoculation and recovery rates remain stable. However, to attain malaria eradication in this type of epidemiological situation, complementary measures such as mass drug administration appear to be necessary...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background A {{comprehensive}} malaria control {{intervention was}} initiated in February 2004 on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea. This manuscript {{reports on the}} continuous entomological monitoring of the indoor residual spray (IRS) programme {{during the first two}} years of its implementation. Methods Mosquitoes were captured daily using window traps at 16 sentinel sites and analysed for species identification, sporozoite rates and knockdown resistance (kdr) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to assess the efficacy of the vector control initiative from December 2003 to December 2005. Results A total of 2, 807 and 10, 293 Anopheles funestus and Anopheles gambiae s. l. respectively were captured throughout the study period. Both M and S molecular forms of An. gambiae s. s. and Anopheles melas were identified. Prior to the first round of IRS, sporozoite rates were 6. 0, 8. 3 and 4. 0 for An. gambiae s. s., An. melas and An. funestus respectively showing An. melas to be an important vector in areas in which it occurred. After the third <b>spray</b> <b>round,</b> no infective mosquitoes were identified. After the first <b>spray</b> <b>round</b> using a pyrethroid spray the number of An. gambiae s. s. were not reduced due to the presence of the kdr gene but An funestus and An. melas populations declined from 23. 5 to 3. 1 and 5. 3 to 0. 8 per trap per 100 nights respectively. After the introduction of a carbamate insecticide in the second round, An. gambiae s. s. reduced from 25. 5 to 1. 9 per trap per 100 nights and An. funestus and An. melas remained at very low levels. Kdr was found only in the M-form of An. gambiae s. s. with the highest frequency at Punta Europa (85 %). Conclusion All three vectors that were responsible for malaria transmission before the start of the intervention were successfully controlled once an effective insecticide was used. Continuous entomological surveillance including resistance monitoring is of critical importance in any IRS based malaria vector control programme. This paper demonstrates that sufficient resources for such monitoring should be included in any proposal in order to avoid programme failures. </p...|$|R

The efficacy {{of this method}} depends, among other factors, on the timing and number of <b>spraying</b> <b>rounds,</b> which depend on the P. argentipes seasonality. To describe P. argentipes' seasonal patterns, six visceral leishmaniasis (VL) endemic villages, three in Muzaffarpur and three in Sunsari districts in India and Nepal, respectively, were selected based on accessibility and VL incidence. Ten houses per cluster with the highest P. argentipes density were monitored monthly for 15 - 16 mo using Center for Disease Control and Prevention light traps. Minimum and maximum temperature and rainfall data for the months January 2006 through December 2007 were collected from the nearest available weather stations. Backwards stepwise regression was used to generate the minimal adequate model for explaining the monthly variation in P. argentipes populations. The seasonality of P. argentipes is similar in India and Nepal, with two annual density peaks around May and October. Monthly P. argentipes density is positively associated with temperature and negatively associated with rainfall in both study sites. The multivariate climate model explained 57 % of the monthly vectorial abundance.

40|$|Indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) {{of households}} with insecticide {{is a principal}} malaria vector control intervention in Zanzibar. In 2006, IRS using the pyrethroid lambda-cyhalothrine was introduced in Zanzibar. Following detection of pyrethroid resistance in 2010, an insecticide resistance management plan was proposed, and IRS using bendiocarb was started in 2011. In 2014, bendiocarb was replaced by pirimiphos methyl. This study investigated the residual efficacy of pirimiphos methyl (Actellic® 300 CS) sprayed on common surfaces of human dwellings in Zanzibar. The residual activity of Actellic 300 CS was determined over 9  months through bioassay tests that measured the mortality of female Anopheles mosquitoes, exposed to sprayed surfaces under a WHO cone. The wall surfaces included; mud wall, oil or water painted walls, lime washed wall, un-plastered cement block wall and stone blocks. Insecticide susceptibility testing was done to investigate the resistance status of local malaria vectors against Actellic 300 CS using WHO protocols; Anopheline species were identified using PCR methods. Baseline tests conducted one-day post-IRS revealed 100  % mortality on all sprayed surfaces. The residual efficacy of Actellic 300 CS was maintained on all sprayed surfaces up to 8  months post-IRS. However, the bioassay test conducted 9  months post-IRS showed the 24  h mortality rate to be ≤ 80  % for lime wash, mud wall, water paint and stone block surfaces. Only oil paint surface retained the recommended residual efficacy beyond 9  months post-IRS, with mortality maintained at ≥ 97  %. Results of susceptibility tests showed that malaria vectors in Zanzibar were fully (100  %) susceptible to Actellic 300 CS. The predominant mosquito vector species was An. arabiensis (76. 0  %) in Pemba and An. gambiae (83. 5  %) in Unguja. The microencapsulated formulation of pirimiphos methyl (Actellic 300 CS) is a highly effective and appropriate insecticide for IRS use in Zanzibar as it showed a relatively prolonged residual activity compared to other products used for the same purpose.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Indoor {{residual}} spraying (IRS) {{is known}} to reduce malaria transmission. In northern Uganda, a high endemic area, IRS has been implemented since 2006. Limited data however, exists {{on the effect of}} IRS on the malaria burden. This study sought to assess the effect of IRS on malaria morbidity in the high intensity area of northern Uganda. Retrospective routine data from ten health facilities in three districts which had received at least five rounds of IRS in northern Uganda was analysed. The primary outcome of interest was malaria morbidity, measured by the slide positivity rate (SPR). Descriptive statistics were used to describe the malaria morbidity stratified by age and sex. The average change in the malaria morbidity, measured by the SPR was assessed according to time, measured as calendar months. A fixed-effects linear regression model was used which included a polynomial function of time and controlled for malaria seasonality and variations between districts/facilities. RESULTS : The total out-patient department attendance in the ten health facilities for the study period was 2, 779, 246, of which 736, 034 (26. 5 %) malaria cases were diagnosed with 374, 826 (50. 9 %) cases of under 5 years and an overall SPR of 37. 5 %. The percentage point (p. p.) changes in SPR according to time measured as calendar months following IRS, revealed a decreasing trend in malaria morbidity in the first 3 months following each round of IRS. The highest percentage point decrease in the SPR was observed in the second month following IRS (9. 5 p. p., CI − 17. 85 to − 1. 16, p = 0. 026), among patients above 5 years. The SPR decline however waned by the fourth month following IRS, with an increase in the SPR of 8. 4 p. p. at district level by the sixth month, p = 0. 510. CONCLUSION : The study results show that IRS was associated with a significant reduction in malaria morbidity in northern Uganda in the first 3 months following IRS. The malaria reduction however waned by the fourth month following IRS. Additional file 1.

40|$|AbstractThis work aims {{to explore}} the {{possibility}} of simulating the agglomeration process in a spray using CFD methods. The model system consists of a spray nozzle within a uniform airflow in a square-section chamber. The CFD simulations are performed using a mixed Eulerian–Lagrangian approach. The flow is modelled by solving the usual Eulerian equations, and then representative droplets are tracked using the Lagrangian approach, with conventional gas–particle coupling. A number of representative particles are introduced at each time step, with each particle representing a group of real particles with the same properties, and are tracked in a transient flow. Due to turbulence, particles are dispersed and may coalesce when they are close. The inter-particle distance {{is used to calculate}} the collision probability from kinetic theory, and agglomeration is assumed to occur when the proximity function exceeds a critical value. This method is applied to the simulation of a <b>round</b> <b>spray</b> jet flow, and the results show some interesting insights regarding the role of particle size redistribution and agglomeration.

UC Santa Barbara {{was able to make}} a steel/Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } composite in a hot isostatic press which will be used to evaluate the viability of this composite system. For thermal <b>spray</b> coatings, another <b>round</b> of coupons were sprayed for arc-lamp processing trials at Oak Ridge National Lab. Low stress scratching wear measurements at Albany Research Center on coupons from the previous arc-lamp trial demonstrated that the coatings had 3 - 10 X higher abrasive wear resistance than Brinell 500 abrasion resistant plate. An overview of the progress during the 4 th quarter of this project is given below. Research details are provided in the limited rights appendix to this report...|$|R
40|$|Diabrotica speciosa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) é uma importante praga polífaga na América Latina, atualmente controlada com inseticidas sintéticos. Este estudo tem como objetivo avaliar as respostas de D. speciosa a uma isca foliar com diferentes extratores de cucurbitacina, em condições laboratoriais e a utilização desta isca associada a um inseticida botânico ou sintético, para o controle da praga em estudo. Foram realizados teste de dupla escolha pareado com insetos adultos, cujos tratamentos utilizaram diferentes tipos de extratores de cucurbitacina: Água; Etanol; Etanol+Água e Etanol+Água+Butanol. Os tratamentos foram realizados com círculos de folhas de feijão, pulverizadas manualmente, com extratos. Também foi realizado outro teste com o melhor extrato testado no bioensaio anterior, em combinação com os seguintes inseticidas de origem vegetal: extrato de Tephrosia sp., extrato de Annona {{squamosa}} e o inseticida carbaril, de origem sintética. Os extratos e os inseticidas foram misturados e pulverizados em plantas de milho, cultivadas em vaso. Após a pulverização foram ofertados círculos de folhas tratadas e não tratadas aos adultos de D. speciosa em teste de dupla escolha. Em confinamento foram ofertadas apenas folhas tratadas aos insetos adultos, em diferentes dias, observando o consumo da folha pelo inseto, mesmo tratada com inseticida; bem como o efeito residual apresentado. No primeiro teste de dupla escolha foi analisado o consumo foliar (mm 2) para escolha do melhor extrator e no segundo teste, além da área foliar, também foi analisada, a mortalidade (%) dos insetos. No teste da escolha do melhor extrator se obteve o etanol e a melhor concentração foi a 40 %, em que o inseto fez o consumo de aproximadamente 74 mm 2 da folha, o que representou 23, 55 % da área da folha. No teste que utilizou isca+inseticida os resultados mostram que, mesmo as folhas possuindo inseticida, a isca de cucurbitacina mantém o estímulo ao inseto para o consumo de folhas tratadas. Os extratos de Tephrosia e A. squamosa foram eficazes na mortalidade dos insetos apenas na primeira avaliação, que foi no dia em que foi feita a aplicação, diferentemente do inseticida carbaril que foi eficaz em todas as avaliações. Diabrotica speciosa (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is {{an important}} polyphagous pest in Latin América, it control is carried out with synthetic insecticides. This way, {{the objective of this}} study was to evaluate the responses of D. speciosa a leaf bait with different extractors cucurbitacin in laboratory, and the use of this insecticide bait associated with a botanical insecticide, for control the pest in study. They were performed a double choice test paired with adult insects, whose treatments are used with different types of extractors cucurbitacin: Water, Ethanol, Ethanol+Water and Ethanol+Water+Butanol. The trataments were performed with cicles of bean leaves, manually sprayed with extracts. Another test was also performed with the best extracts tested in the previous bioassays in combination with the following insecticides of plant origin: extract of Tephrosia spp., extract of Annona squamosa and the insecticide carbaryl, synthetic origin. The extracts and insecticides were mixed and sprayed on corn plants, those grown in pots. After <b>spraying</b> <b>rounds</b> were offered leaves of treated and untreated adults of D. speciosa in double choice test. In confinement treated leaves were offered only to adults insects, on different days, observing the consumption of leaves by the insect, even treated with insecticide, as well as the residul effect presented. In the first test pair was analyzed leaf consumption (mm 2) to choose the best extractor, and was analyzed in the second test than the leaf area, also mortality (%) of insects. In choosing the best test we obtained the best extractor ethanol and best dose of the bait was 40 % in the insect did the consumption of about 74 mm 2 leaf represented 23, 55 % the leaf. The test of insecticide+ bait result show that, even the leaves possessing insecticidal, the bait cucurbitacina keeps the insect to stimulate the consumption of treated leaves. The extracts of Tephrosia sp. and A. squamamosa were effective in killing the insect only in the first evaluation, which was the day application was made, inlike of the insecticide carbaryl was effective in all evaluations...|$|R
40|$|From October, 1964, a {{large-scale}} Malathion trial {{was carried out}} in the Bandar Abbas area which covered 435 villages with a population of 138, 570. Until April, 1966, five rounds of Malathion 2 gm/m 2, were performed. From 1967, the lowland area was <b>sprayed</b> with two <b>rounds</b> of Malathion (March, August) and the highlands with two rounds of Malathion (April, August) and two rounds of DDT (Jume, October). The main Vectors of the area are An. stephensi mysorensis (resistant to DDT and DLD) followed by An. fluviatilis and An. dthali (predominantly in fie highlands). The results of entomological and parasitological evolution up to] 969 were as follows: in lowland areas, S <b>rounds</b> of Malathion <b>spraying</b> are able to control the predominant vector-An. Stephensi - and keep its density insignificant. In highland areas, due to the exophilic and exophagic tendency of the predominant vectors - An. fluviatilis and An. dthali - as well as outdoor sleeping habits of the local population, the complete interruption of transmission of malaria has not been achieved. The Annual Parasite Incidence (API) in lowland areas, which was 42. 9 per thousand in 1965, came down to 2. 2 per thousand in 1969. In highland areas, the API was reduced from 59. 8 per thousand inn 1965 to 11 per thousand in 1969...|$|R
