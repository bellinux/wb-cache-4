40|$|A {{test and}} {{analysis}} program performed on four complete propulsion systems for an {{urban electric vehicle}} (EV) is described and results given. A dc series motor and a permanent magnet (PM) motor were tested, each powered by an EV battery pack and controlled by (1) a series/parallel voltage-switching (V-switch) system; and (2) a system using a pulse width modulation, 400 Hz transistorized chopper. Dynamometer tests were first performed, followed by eV performance predictions and data correlating road tests. During dynamometer tests using chopper control; current, voltage, and power were measured on both the battery and motor sides of the chopper, using three types of instrumentation. Conventional dc instruments provided adequate accuracy for eV power and energy measurements, when used on the battery side of the controller. When using the chopper controller, {{the addition of a}} <b>small</b> <b>choke</b> inductor improved system efficiency in the lower duty cycle range (some 8 % increase at 50 % duty cycle) with both types of motors. Overall system efficiency rankings during road tests were: (1) series motor with V-switch; (2) PM motor with V-switch; (3) series motor with chopper; and (4) PM motor with chopper. Chopper control of the eV was smoother and required less driver skill than V-switch control...|$|E
40|$|Active ripple {{filtering}} is {{the replacement}} of large passive components in power filter circuits with smaller passive components and active control circuitry. This letter focuses on common-mode filters, where a large common-mode inductor (choke) is replaced by two <b>smaller</b> <b>chokes</b> and active op-amp control. The technique is appropriate when improved attenuation is required at relatively low frequencies and the high-frequency filtering requirements are easily met. Smaller chokes save significantly in material and winding costs. The technique is more advantageous if wire-wound chokes can be replaced by planar printed circuit board chokes. The use of the technique in an automotive electromagnetic interference (EMI) filter application is explored in detail...|$|R

But since the two chain segments are most likely not parallel to each other during operations of an iCVT, it is estimated that the load on a choking pulley is between 1 and 1.8 times of the tension of its chain.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Approximately 5, 500 {{years ago}} a {{discreet}} period of wetter and cooler environmental conditions prevailed across the southern Columbia Plateau.

40|$|Background Efficient {{effective}} child {{product safety}} (PS) responses require data on hazards, injury severity and injury probability. PS responses in Australia largely rely on reports from manufacturers/retailers, other jurisdictions/regulators, or consumers. The {{extent to which}} reactive responses reflect actual child injury priorities is unknown. Aims/Objectives/Purpose This research compared PS issues for children identified using data compiled from PS regulatory data and data compiled from health data sources in Queensland, Australia. Methods PS regulatory documents describing issues affecting children in Queensland in 2008 – 2009 were compiled and analysed to identify frequent products and hazards. Three health data sources (ED, injury surveillance and hospital data) were analysed to identify frequent products and hazards. Results/Outcomes Projectile toys/squeeze toys were the priority products for PS regulators with these toys having the potential to release <b>small</b> parts presenting <b>choking</b> hazards.

5000|$|US forces {{entered the}} war in Afghanistan in 2001. Although there was fierce {{fighting}} such as the Battle of Tora Bora and Operation Anaconda, the IED threat remained generally low until later in the war. Afghanistan is a rural country with rough terrain, most of the roads are unimproved and due to the abundance of rivers many culverts are present. Because of this IED threats are numerous. Typically tactics include placing high yield IEDs weighing several hundred pounds deep underground causing massive damage. However modern MRAP vehicles are capable of withholding most blasts. Another tactic is placing <b>small</b> IEDs at <b>choke</b> points, the vehicle becomes disabled and the passing troops are ambushed. Due to the decade long Soviet war in Afghanistan many Soviet mines are still used by Taliban fighters to make IEDs. [...] RCPs are not designated units and are normally brought together from existing Combat Engineer and EOD units. They are then deployed to areas of need. Not all parts of Afghanistan are equally covered by RCPs, for example the remote FOB Salerno near Khost housed RCP7 and RCP9, which were composed of National Guard sappers and active duty EOD personnel, {{on the other hand}} Gradez had no dedicated RCP units and relied on nearby units from FOB Salerno, FOB Shank, and Orgun-E.|$|R
40|$|HST finds galaxies whose Tolman dimming should exceed 10 mag. Could {{evolution}} alone {{explain these}} as our ancestor galaxies? Or {{could they be}} representatives of quite a different dynasty whose descendants are no longer prominent today? We explore this latter hypothesis and argue that Surface Brightness Selection Effects naturally bring into focus quite different dynasties from different redshifts. Thus the HST z= 7 galaxies could be examples of galaxies whose descendants are both too <b>small</b> and too <b>choked</b> with dust to be recognizable in our neighborhood easily today. Conversely the ancestors of the Milky Way and its obvious neighbors will have completely sunk below the sky at z> 1. 2 although their diffuse light {{could account for the}} missing Reionization flux. This Succeeding Prominent Dynasties Hypothesis (SPDH) fits the existing observations both naturally and well,including the bizarre distributions of galaxy surface brightnesses found in deep fields, the angular size ~ inverse (1 +z) law,'Downsizing' which turns out to be an 'illusion' {{in the sense that it}} does not imply evolution, 'Infant Mortality', i. e. the discrepancy between stars born and stars seen, and finally the recently discovered and unexpected excess of QSOAL DLAs at high redshift. If the SPDH is true then a large proportion of galaxies remain sunk from sight, probably at all redshifts. We show that fishing them out of the sky by their optical emissions alone will be practically impossible, even when they are nearby. More ingenious methods will be needed to detect them. It follows that disentangling galaxy evolution through studying ever higher redshift galaxies may be a forlorn hope because one will be comparing young apples with old oranges, not descendants with their own ancestors.

40|$|The {{original}} {{model of}} the Internet is simple and homogeneous: every interface is reachable via a long-lived address, routers do nothing but move packets {{as fast as possible}} over hopefully-stable routes, hosts are responsible for securing themselves, and any complicated function is implemented end-to-end by applications running on hosts. In recent years both network providers and end-site customers have deployed various forms of network intermediaries with accelerating frequency. Examples of intermediaries include NATs, transparent web caches, firewalls, and load balancers. The result of these deployments is a more complicated “Discrete Internet: ” an Internet composed of discrete subnetworks, attached at a <b>small</b> number of <b>choke</b> points, lacking universal addressability, and including stateful in-network intermediaries as vital components of (what were once endto-end) services. This development has anguished many who design networks and applications. These critics make sound technical arguments for why the emerging design of the Internet is undesirable, and some argue for a return to the earlier, simpler model. This paper explains why the original homogeneous Internet model is gone forever, replaced by the Discrete Internet. A novel technical mechanism – a new “session ” layer in the Internet protocol suite, inserted between the application and transport layers – is proposed as a way to manage the new complexity, retrieve some of the lost benefits of the original homogeneous model, and open a variety of new possibilities. I. THE DISCRETE INTERNET The Internet is increasingly being populated by intermediaries. For example, located between a browser and a web server there might be a NAT-ing firewall on the client side, one or more web caches at points in the network, and a workload balancer on the server side. Many lament the rise of intermediaries – especially NATs, but any stateful component – and argue that the Interne...|$|R
40|$|A Vapour Jet Refrigeration System (VJRS) is an {{alternative}} to the conventional mechanically driven vapour-compression refrigeration system. The VJRS utilises a supersonic ejector as a thermal compressor and has the potential significantly to reduce energy consumption in air conditioning systems. Experimental investigations and analysis of large supersonic jet ejectors such as those used for steam jet refrigeration, has been carried out in past literature. In the present study the performance characteristics of small VJRS ejectors using R 12 as the working fluid (ie ejectors with throat diameters of several millimetres only) have been investigated using experimental, analytical and C F D (computational fluid dynamics) techniques. In practice ejector performance may be affected by the choking phenomena in the secondary stream, superheating of vapour leaving the evaporator and generator, nozzle and diffuser efficiency. The present author developed a model for a small, single-fluid VJRS ejector using the theory of secondary vapour choking which was introduced by Munday and Bagster (1977). This theory was employed by the present researcher to design and test a small R 12 ejector. Results of a computer simulation that models secondary choking in the converging part of the ejector and the effects of superheat conditions on the ejector performance are presented. In the present work further developed has been carried out to examine the optimum nozzle position when the ejectors operated at fully developed choked conditions. It has been confirmed that for the <b>small</b> ejectors the <b>choking</b> phenomenon {{plays an important role in}} ejector performance. It was also recognised that the nozzle position is a very important factor of the ejector geometry for small VJRS ejectors. In the secondary choking theory, ejector performance may be taken to be a function of the 2 ̆ 2 effective area 2 ̆ 2 available to the secondary fluid within the mixing chamber of the ejector. The present study involved experimental investigation of how this effective area is influenced by operating conditions such as evaporator temperature and nozzle position. In the present investigation the geometry of the converging part of the ejector has also been studied and the shock pressure recovery process examined in the constant area mixing tube. The present author has developed a CFD simulation of the ejector using the PHOENICS-BFC code based on the finite volumetric technique. Comparisons have been made between the predictions of the entrainment ratio using the one-dimensional, constant area analysis, CFD results and experimental results. In the present study analysis of two-fluid VJRS ejectors carried out based on the one-dimensional analysis, constant area method. It was found that using an appropriate fluid-pair, the entrainment ratio is likely to be substantially better than for the single fluid VJRS...|$|R
