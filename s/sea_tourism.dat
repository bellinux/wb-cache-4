50|$|Another {{impact of}} tourism is marine {{pollution}} from cruise ships discharging waste into the sea. One single trip {{of a large}} cruise ship on average produces 210,000 gallons of sewage, 1,000,000 gallons of greywater, 125 gallons of toxic chemicals and hazardous waste, 8 tons of garbage and 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water. Although there have been attempts to regulate this kind of discharge, most of this waste is still dumped into the <b>sea</b> (<b>Tourism</b> in the Caribbean, Duval 2004). Some cruise ships are managing their waste by reducing the impact through advanced sewage systems, shipboard recycling programs, and increased use of biodegradable alternatives to plastic. However, their industry has increased about 60% from the 1980s to 2003. Therefore, they reduce the damage of their discharge but increase the quantity discharged.|$|E
