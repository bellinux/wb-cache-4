30|$|A {{wide range}} of {{value-added}} products can potentially be produced by bioprocessing hardwood spent <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquors</b> (HSSLs) that are by-products of {{pulp and paper industry}} with a high pentose sugar content.

Scheffersomyces stipitis is a yeast with high capacity to ferment the pentose sugar xylose under appropriate microaerophilic conditions but it has limited tolerance to HSSL inhibitors. In the present study, cultivations of suspended and immobilized S. stipitis were compared in terms of growth capacity and by-product formation using rich medium and HSSL to investigate whether the immobilization of cells in calcium alginate beads could be a protection against inhibitors while favoring the presence of microaerophilic conditions.|$|R

We screened 3 polysulfone (PS) membranes with cutoffs of 100, 50, and 25 kDa, respectively. Flux and retention for the 100 - and 50 -kDa membranes had the same order of magnitude, indicating that these properties were determined by fouling that formed on the membrane—not pore size. The PS membrane with the 50 -kDa cutoff performed best in terms of flux and retention of lignin-carbohydrate complexes and experienced the least membrane fouling. Two prefiltration methods were used to decrease the fouling of the 50 -kDa membrane: a 0. 2 -μm PS microfiltration membrane and dead-end filtration with 10 -um filter cloth and a 4 wt% mixture of kieselguhr (diatomite) and spent <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> prior to filtration. Prefiltration of the SSL with microfiltration increased the flux 3 -fold and decreased the fouling grade from 49 % to 7. 2 %.

The retention of LCC during microfiltration was high, {{which resulted in a}} loss of high-molecular-weight products, whereas the loss of LCC during dead-end filtration was negligible.

Hence, the biotechnological application of these microorganisms can cover many aspects, such as the treatment of hypersaline waste streams of different origin. Due to the fact that the high osmotic pressure of hypersaline environments reduces the risk of contamination, the capacity for cost-effective non-sterile cultivation can make extreme halophilic microorganisms potentially valuable organisms for biotechnological applications. In this contribution, the stepwise use of screening approaches, employing design of experiment (DoE) on model media and subsequently using industrial waste as substrate have been implemented to investigate the applicability of halophiles to generate PHB from the industrial waste stream spent <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL). The production of PHB on model media as well as dilutions of industrial substrate in a complex medium has been screened for by fluorescence microscopy using Nile Blue staining.

It could be shown that neither single inhibiting substances nor a mixture thereof inhibited growth in the investigated range, hence, leaving the question on the inhibiting mechanisms open.

However, fermentative yeasts used for the fermentation of the sugars in SSL are adversely affected by the inhibitory substances in this complex feedstock. To overcome this limitation, evolutionary engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was carried out using genome-shuffling technology based on large-scale population cross mating. Populations of UV-light-induced yeast mutants more tolerant than the wild type to hardwood spent <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (HWSSL) were first isolated and then recursively mated and enriched for more-tolerant populations.

The MMC was able to accumulate PHA from the different HSSL carbon components (acetic acid, xylose and lignosulfonates) with a PHA storage content during the reactor operation of 54. 2 +/- 10. 6 % PHB. In order to clarify the MMC composition, isolation was performed from the MMC, using HSSL or its main components.

To reduce the {{biological oxygen demand}} of SSL associated with dissolved sugars, we studied the capacity of Pichia stipitis FPL-YS 30 (xyl 3 Delta) to convert these sugars into useful products. FPL-YS 30 produces a negligible amount of ethanol while converting xylose into xylitol. This work describes the xylose fermentation kinetics of yeast strain P. stipitis FPL-YS 30. Yeast was grown in rich medium supplemented with different carbon sources: glucose, xylose, or ammonia-base SSL. The SSL and glucose-acclimatized cells showed similar maximum specific growth rates (0. 146 h(- 1)). The highest xylose consumption {{at the beginning of}} the fermentation process occurred using cells precultivated in xylose, which showed relatively high specific activity of glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 49). However, the maximum specific rates of xylose consumption (0. 19 g(xylose) /g(cel) h) and xylitol production (0. 059 g(xylitol) /g(cel) h) were obtained with cells acclimatized in glucose, in which the ratio between xylose reductase (EC 1. 1. 1. 21) and xylitol dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 9) was kept at higher level (0. 82). In this case, xylitol production (31. 6 g/l) was 19 and 8 % higher than in SSL and xylose-acclimatized cells, respectively.

Effects of H 2 O 2 dosage on the structure of ammonium lignosulfonate were also studied. The content of carboxyl, phenolic hydroxyl, and conjugated carbonyl groups in lignosulfonate that could be chelated with metal ions increased after ammonium lignosulfonate was oxidized. Average molecular weight and distribution were also determined with GPC.

One of the isolates of S. cerevisiae, no. 3, was heavily flocculating and produced a higher ethanol yield from spent <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> than did commercial baker's yeast. The greatest difference between isolate 3 and baker's yeast was that of galactose fermentation, even when galactose utilization was induced, i. e., when they were grown {{in the presence of}} galactose, prior to fermentation.

However, to date hardly any data on thermophiles growing directly on industrial substrates like spent <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor</b> (SSL) are available. This contribution investigates the ability of Thermoanaerobacter species to utilize the main sugars in the used SSL (mannose, glucose and xylose) and the effect of process parameters (pH, temperature and sugar concentration) on their growth. Based on these results the strain T. mathranii was chosen for further studies. The ability of T. mathranii to grow directly on SSL was investigated and the effect of several inhibiting substances on growth was elucidated. Furthermore it was tested whether pretreatment with activated charcoal can increase the fermentability of SSL. The fermentations were evaluated based on yields and specific rates. It could be shown that T. mathranii was able to ferment all sugars in the investigated softwood SSL and fermented diluted, untreated SSL (up to 2. 7 % (w/w) dry matter). Pretreatment with activated charcoal could slightly reduce the amount of phenols in the substrate and thus facilitate growth and ethanol production on higher SSL concentrations (up to 4. 7 % (w/v) dry matter). Ethanol yields of 0. 29 - 0. 44 Cmmol of ethanol per Cmmol sugar were obtained on untreated and pretreated spent <b>sulfite</b> <b>liquor,</b> respectively.

40|$|Investigations on Reaction Technology of Continuous Anaerobic Digestion, Shown by the Purification of an Acetic Acid Containig Waste Water with Methanogenic Bacteria This thesis {{deals with}} the {{reaction}} technology and application of anaerobic digestion in order to purify a waste water from pulp industries. A synthetic waste water, whose composition corresponded to the condenser water of <b>sulfite</b> waste <b>liquor,</b> was used for experiments. Acetic acid as the main waste load was the only carbon source. It was decomposed to biogas, a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, by methanogenic bacteria of the species Methanosarcina barkeri. Thebacterial culture was handled without sterile procedures and it did contain sulfate reducing bacteria that provided a favourable concentration of sulfide. In reaction engineering terms, the Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor {{was found to be}} the optimal reactor for this process. The pH-shift during decomposition of acetic acid was calcula ted by a Fortran program and resul ted in a concept for controlling a continuous biogas reactor. The process of anaerobic digestion was transferred from bench scale to pilot scale and the reaction volume was enlarged to 135 l. For this scale a fermentation plant was projected, constructed by an engineering firm, and started in operation. Strong emphasis was put on the measuring and control equipment and on the coupling of this equipment to a process control computer. The software for the registration of experimental values and the control of the plant was developed and mainly usedfor the optimal operation of the plant. The generation time of the cul ture was minimized by maximizing the selection pressure in order to get maximal biogas produc ti vi ty. The computer was used {{in such a way that}} the plant was brought to maximal biogas production automatically. A considerable decrease of the retention time - in connection with the increase of biomass concentration in the fermenter- was achieved by use of a rotating filter for biomass retention. The applicability of anaerobic digestion to the treatment of special industrial waste waters was shown by the operation of the plant. The fundamentals for the use of this process in a technical scale were worked out. Economic advantages can be expected as well as ecological ones...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{shortage}} of fossil fuels the use of lignin as a renewable resource is of great global importance. In this work two representative spent liquors from the two dominant processes in the paper and pulp industry were examined. First sum parameters (e. g. content of lignin and carbohydrates) and inorganic components of the liquors were analyzed. Because of large amounts of inorganic compounds in sulfate spent liquor and high sugar content in <b>sulfite</b> spent <b>liquor</b> lignin degradation products were isolated by well-known methods. The development of analytical methods was performed by lignin model compounds. In addition to commercially available monomeric substances several dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric compounds with lignin typical linkages were synthesized. Due to {{the large number of}} lignin degradation products in spent liquors a GCxGC-(TOF) MS method was developed. With this method monomeric and dimeric lignin model compounds can be analyzed. Even after derivatization trimeric and tetrameric substance cannot be recognized. The optimized method was applied to the examination of the isolated lignin degradation products. It was confirmed that spent liquors are complex mixtures of many compounds which even cannot be separated by comprehensive gas chromatography. So a fractionation of the degradation products via a successive soxhlet-extraction method using different solvents became necessary. After the fractionation some monomers were identified by GCxGC-(TOF) -MS. Afterwards a liquid chromatography method for the identification of high molecular compounds was developed. The developed and optimized HPLC-method shows signals in the DAD-chromatogram. With a mass spectrometric detection no signals were available. Therefore a mass spectrometric analysis method with direct injection using model substances was developed and transferred to the real samples. The mass spectrometric method enables a qualification of many substances. Using a high-resolution mass spectrometer it is possible to determine the molecular formula by detecting masses with a precision of ± 0. 02 Da. According to the molecular formula double-bound-equivalents were calculated. In particular MS/MS experiments could obtain information about the number of methoxygroups and the presence of ß-O- 4 ´-linkages and sulfonic acid groups. According to this method several proposals for the structures of 35 monomers in isolated lignosulphonates were evaluated. Eleven monomeric structures include sulfonic acid groups. Additionally eight C-C-linked dimers were identified. Furthermore masses of trimers, tetramers and pentamers were detected. In kraft lignin, isolated from the sulphate liquor, 27 monomers and 21 dimers were identified. In addition, high molecular weight substances with masses up to 680 Da were determined in this liquor. MS/MS experiments have shown that there are no ß-O- 4 '- linkages in the identified compounds. Up to now the masses of detected trimers, tetramers and pentamers were only postulated in literature. So these exact masses were discovered for the first time. Various determined substances, for example long-chain aromatic structures or condensation products, do not originate from wood and can only be formed during the pulping process. All identified substances have a uniform basic structure. Therefore the use of the uniform lignin degradation products seems reasonable. For example unification could be performed by hydrogenation. The received substances could serve as renewable raw materials for other chemical products...|$|R
