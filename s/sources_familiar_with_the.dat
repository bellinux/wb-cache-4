500|$|However, {{this move}} has drawn fire from <b>sources</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> subject; {{among them are}} dissenting members of the United States Marine Corps. These dissenters argue that battleships are still a viable {{solution}} to naval gunfire support, members of the United States Congress who remain [...] "deeply concerned" [...] {{over the loss of}} naval surface gunfire support that the battleships provided, and a number of independent groups such as the United States' Naval Fire Support Association (USNFSA) whose ranks frequently include former members of the armed service and fans of the battleships. Although the arguments presented from each group differ, they all agree that the United States Navy has not in good faith considered the potential of reactivated battleships for use in the field, a position that is supported by a 1999 Government Accountability Office report regarding the United States Navy's gunfire support program.|$|E

Moreover, the news source added that multiple <b>sources</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> [...] "baby mama" [...] {{and her family}} {{told them that they}} knew about the relationship between both parties. When the story broke out, close friends and associates of Wizkid didn't confirm the story due to DNA results that were pending at the time. Wizkid broke his silence on the story in several interviews. In an interview with a Nigerian Entertainment Today editor, Wizkid denied having a child. In another interview held at Ogudu-GRA in Lagos, Wizkid said he really doesn't want to find himself in that peculiar situation. A week before denying the aforementioned allegations, Wizkid tweeted from his official Twitter handle. In December 2012, he denied the baby scandal during an interview with Nonye Ben-Nwankwo of The Punch. In October 2013, Wizkid uploaded a picture of he and his 2-year-old son, Boluwatife Balogun, onto his Instagram account. The photo confirmed the alleged rumours and allegations that were harboured for 2 years. The photo also vindicated Nigerian Entertainment Today, the news source that first covered the story.|$|E

In 2011, he returned to Maryland, where he spent a year as lead technologist on Dell's CIA account.

2500|$|On 27 September 2011 {{at around}} 2 a.m. in McAllen, Texas, fatal gunshots were {{exchanged}} from one vehicle to another along an expressway. A man named Jorge Zavala and a 22-year-old man {{were victims of}} an attack perpetrated by unknown shooters traveling in a dark-colored SUV from a Chevrolet Tahoe, causing them to lose control of the vehicle and crash along the expressway. The local police did not find a motive for the attack, but sources told The Monitor that Zavala had ties with a faction of the Gulf Cartel in the Mexican border cities of Matamoros and Reynosa, showing signs that his assassination was due to an [...] "internal power struggle" [...] in the organization. Zavala died instantly at the scene, while the other man {{was taken to the}} hospital in critical condition. The McAllen Police Department refused to comment on how many gunshots were fired, but the preliminary autopsy revealed that Zavala died of multiple gunshots, not from the crash. Public records prove that Zavala's criminal history dates back to 1995, while <b>sources</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> victim stated that he was a close associate of the drug lord Gregorio Sauceda-Gamboa. A local law enforcement official {{who asked not to be}} identified stated that Samuel Flores Borrego's death and the power struggle in the organization may explain Zavala's death. Hours after Zavala's death, a series of grenade attacks prompted in Reynosa, Río Bravo, and Ciudad Victoria, while an intense gunfight took place in Matamoros, Tamaulipas.|$|E
50|$|According to two <b>sources</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blacked-out {{portions}} of the Senate report that discuss the CIA cable's contents, the document indicates that White House officials had proposed mentioning the supposed Atta-Prague meeting in a Bush speech scheduled for March 14, 2003... According {{to one of the}} <b>sources</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Senate report's censored portions, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, the tone of the CIA cable was 'strident' and expressed dismay that the White House was trying to shoehorn the Atta anecdote into the Bush speech to be delivered only days before the U.S. invasion of Iraq. The source said the cable also suggested that policymakers had tried to insert the same anecdote into other speeches by top administration officials. A second source familiar with the Senate report, however, maintained that it could be read as routine give-and-take between policymakers asking legitimate questions about intelligence reporting and field operatives giving respectful responses. Both <b>sources</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> report acknowledge that there is no proof the White House saw the cable, and thus it is unclear whether the CIA document had any bearing on the fact that Bush never mentioned the Atta anecdote in a speech.|$|E
