40|$|FLOW VISUALIZATION of the {{lubricant}} film in bearings {{has proved to}} be a powerful technique for revealing the com-plex nature of cavitation, a phenomenon not readily studied by other means. The method has been exploited by Cole and Hughes (r) t and others to obtain valuable information on the cavitation in journal bearings, viewing the lubricant through a glass bearing sleeve. This approach has the advantage that it is easy to apply, but it has limita-tions. In particular the effects of bearing deformation and of irregularities in bearing shape, e. g. mismatch of the two halves of a <b>split</b> <b>bearing,</b> are not readily simulated and the behaviour of heavily loaded bearings cannot easily be studied. T o overcome these limitations an apparatus has been developed in which the oil film is viewed through a glass shaft, the bearing being a normal metal sleeve.

40|$|Climate change, {{national}} and international targets and a possible impending fuel scarcity is driving {{the need for a}} clean, cheap and sustainable energy source. Although onshore wind is currently the most economically viable source of renewable energy, high failure rates often occurring many years prior to their design life, are increasing the cost through additional maintenance and downtime. The gearbox, and in particular the bearings within the gearbox are the components responsible for the largest proportion of downtime. Field studies have shown damage to the inner race of the planetary support bearings found in the epicyclic stage of the gearbox is restricted to an arc of approximately 40 ° centered on the point of maximum load. Engineers at Ricardo have designed an actuation system to overcome this problem which allows the raceway to be rotated periodically thus distributing damage and increasing bearing life. The monitoring of planetary support bearings typically found in the epicyclic stage of wind turbine gearboxes has been investigated in this thesis using acoustic emission technology due to its reported increase in sensitivity in detecting damage at low speeds compared to vibration analysis in addition to its ability to locate damage. Primarily, accelerated life tests were performed on a rolling element bearing seeded with a defect mounted in a bespoke full scale test rig designed to mimic loading conditions experienced by the planetary support bearings. In addition, data was recorded and analysed from a <b>split</b> <b>bearing</b> test rig and the high speed shaft bearing of a recommissioned 600 kW wind turbine gearbox. Initial experiments considered the influence of the lubrication regime on the measured acoustic emission signal. It was found that as the oil film reduces, asperity contact, typical of mixed or boundary lubrication, manifests itself as high amplitude transient events. Typical measures of bearing health in the time domain, such as peak values or kurtosis, become unreliable and demonstrates a need for a novel approach. Previous investigations into the use of acoustic emission for the purpose of bearing condition monitoring has focused on instances where full separation between bearing components occurred whereas this work considers a mixed lubrication regime. To overcome the drawbacks of the traditional measures, this work has investigated a process employing wavelet packet decomposition, autocorrelation and cepstrum to reduce the noise and boost the periodicity of a signal from a defected bearing. Outlier analysis was shown to be able to determine the presence of a seeded defect and indicate which bearing component is defected. Such approach was shown to provide a more robust measure than time domain methods. In contrast, this approach was compared to one employing time domain measures for a fully lubricated <b>split</b> <b>bearing.</b> In this case, a time domain approach was more successful at determining the presence of damage than the approach taken for the partially lubricated bearing. An attempt was made to improve the localisation of defects on a bearing which had, until now, relied on analytical time-of-flight methods. In this work artificial sources, rather than those resulting from a rolling element impinging on a defect, were generated by a standardised pencil lead break and used as training data for two methods namely Delta T mapping and neural networks. The neural networks in particular were shown to reduced the average error from 42 mm to 17 mm however given the time consuming nature of generating the training data a decision must be made regarding the relative importance of accuracy and ease of implementation...|$|E

40|$|The local {{splitting}} behaviour in Fibre Reinforced Concrete (FRC) elements under a high {{concentrated load}} is gaining a growing interest, especially {{with reference to}} precast tunnel segments. In fact, during the lining construction process, high concentrated thrust jack forces are introduced in the segments leading to both high compressive stresses under the thrust shoes that can provoke a concrete crushing and tensile transversal stresses that can cause cracks and, eventually, a splitting failure.

40|$|The {{design process}} of {{segmental}} concrete linings in ground conditions generally refers to standard load cases of de-molding, storage, embedded ground condition and grouting process. Nevertheless, {{the application of}} the Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) thrust jack forces is a crucial temporary loading condition during construction, which may govern the design procedure {{as well as the other}} stages. Tunnel segments were traditionally reinforced with conventional rebars in order to resist the tensile stresses at both Serviceability (SLS) and Ultimate Limit States (ULS). In the two last decades, Fiber Reinforced Concrete (FRC) has been also used in several precast tunnel segments with or without conventional rebars. For structural purposes, steel fibers are generally used, even though some types of structural macro-synthetic fibers, which are able to impart significant toughness and ductility to concrete, have been recently introduced in the market. For these reasons, an experimental program aimed to investigate the local splitting behavior in the segment regions under the TBM hydraulic jacks was carried out at the University of Brescia. Tests on concrete prisms (with or without fibrous reinforcement) under Line Load (LL) or Point Load (PL) configurations were carried out in order to evaluate the beneficial effects of polypropylene (PP) fibers in controlling typical splitting cracks occurring under the jack loads, which represent one of the most severe loading conditions for tunnel segments. Experimental results show the feasibility of using polypropylene fibers in tunnel segments, since they significantly enhance both the <b>splitting</b> <b>bearing</b> capacity and the ductility. Fibers lead to a stable development of the splitting crack, which allows a redistribution of stresses after cracking. However, the effectiveness of fibers is influenced by the casting direction, which leads to a different fiber orientation. When the latter is favorable (fibers expected to be mainly transversal to the <b>splitting</b> crack) the <b>bearing</b> capacity is higher than in case of an unfavorable casting direction (fibers expected to be mainly parallel to the splitting crack) ...|$|R

In order to widen biotechnological applications of protein trans-splicing, it is highly desirable to have split inteins with shorter C-terminal fragments, which can be chemically synthesized. Principal Findings: We report the identification of new functional split sites in DnaE inteins from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and from Nostoc punctiforme. One of the newly engineered <b>split</b> intein <b>bearing</b> C-terminal 15 residues showed more robust protein trans-splicing activity than {{naturally occurring}} split DnaE inteins in a foreign context. During {{the course of our}} experiments, we found that protein ligation by protein trans-splicing depended not only on the splicing junction sequences, but also on the foreign extein sequences. Furthermore, we could classify the protein trans-splicing reactions in foreign contexts with a simple kinetic model into three groups according to their kinetic parameters in the presence of various reducing agents. Conclusion: The shorter C-intein of the newly engineered split intein could be a useful tool for biotechnological applications including protein modification, incorporation of chemical probes, and segmental isotopic labelling.

These asymmetric properties often result in split {{first critical speed}}s. Since the horizontal stiffness is much softer than the vertical, a horizontal first critical speed may appear from several hundred to several thousand revolutions per minute lower than the vertical first critical. Tilting pad bearings produce more symmetric bearing properties. This symmetry usually results in a single unsplit first critical speed that is located approximately midway between the sleeve <b>bearing</b> <b>split</b> peaks. Two different case histories are examined. An induction motor and a steam turbine were both initially designed with tilting pad bearings. Both rotor bearing systems resulted in first critical speeds in the operating speed range. Numerous attempts to shift the critical out of the operating range were explored without success. As a last attempt short of a complete rotor redesign, switching to sleeve bearings was successful. Analytical results that support the decision to switch to sleeve bearings are shown along with actual test stand response plots. Additionally, for the steam turbine, results from a high speed balance are presented along with actual field speed-amplitude plots. While a tilting pad to sleeve bearing change is not recommended for all classes of turbomachinery to shift critical speeds, it is a powerful design tool as it may produce critical speed changes of up to 1000 rpm...|$|R
40|$|Opening {{and closing}} of a CFTR Cl− channel is {{controlled}} by PKA-mediated phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic regulatory (R) domain and by ATP binding, and likely hydrolysis, at its two nucleotide binding domains. Functional interactions between the R domain and the two nucleotide binding domains were probed by characterizing the gating of severed CFTR channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Expression levels were assessed using measurements of oocyte conductance, and detailed functional characteristics of the channels were extracted from kinetic analyses of macroscopic current relaxations and of single-channel gating events in membrane patches excised from the oocytes. The kinetic behavior of wild-type (WT) CFTR channels was {{compared with that of}} <b>split</b> CFTR channels <b>bearing</b> a single cut (between residues 633 and 634) just before the R domain, of split channels with a single cut (between residues 835 and 837) just after the R domain, and of split channels from which the entire R domain (residues 634 – 836) between those two cut sites was omitted. The channels cut before the R domain had characteristics almost identical to those of WT channels, except for less than twofold shorter open burst durations in the presence of PKA. Channels cut just after the R domain were characterized by a low level of activity even without phosphorylation, strong stimulation by PKA, enhanced apparent affinity for ATP as assayed by open probability, and a somewhat destabilized binding site for the locking action of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPPNP. Split channels with no R domain (from coexpression of CFTR segments 1 – 633 and 837 – 1480) were highly active without phosphorylation, but otherwise displayed the characteristics of channels cut after the R domain, including higher apparent ATP affinity, and less tight binding of AMPPNP at the locking site, than for WT. Intriguingly, severed channels with no R domain were still noticeably stimulated by PKA, implying that activation of WT CFTR by PKA likely also includes some component unrelated to the R domain. As the maximal opening rates were the same for WT channels and split channels with no R domain, it seems that the phosphorylated R domain does not stimulate opening of CFTR channels; rather, the dephosphorylated R domain inhibits them...|$|R
