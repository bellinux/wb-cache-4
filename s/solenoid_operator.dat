25|$|A variant {{application}} of the attraction principle is the plunger-type or <b>solenoid</b> <b>operator.</b> A reed relay {{is another example of}} the attraction principle.|$|E
40|$|A pulsed {{solenoid valve}} which can operate up to 550 [*]°C has been {{designed}} for supersonic jet introduction. This valve uses a novel design where the nozzle head, which serves as the hot oven, and the <b>solenoid</b> <b>operator</b> are separated and the latter is maintained at a relatively low temperature using water cooling. A long steel plunger forms a metal‐to‐metal seal at the orifice which is broken when the magnetic field generated by the solenoid pulls back the plunger. Thus, although the oven operates at the high temperatures required for nonvolatile materials, the <b>solenoid</b> <b>operator</b> and electrical parts remain relatively cool...|$|E
50|$|HF/DF used {{a set of}} antennas {{to receive}} the same signal in {{slightly}} different locations or angles, and then used the slight differences in the signal to display the bearing to the transmitter on an oscilloscope display. Earlier systems used a mechanically rotated antenna (or <b>solenoid)</b> and an <b>operator</b> listening for peaks or nulls in the signal, which took considerable time to determine, often {{on the order of}} a minute or more. HF/DF's display made the same measurement essentially instantaneously, which allowed it to catch fleeting signals, such as those from the U-boat fleet.|$|R
