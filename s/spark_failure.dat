40|$|In {{this work}} are {{presented}} {{the basis for}} improving the interpretation of transformer lightning impulse test {{and the development of}} a graphical user interface system, which allows comparisons of time domain data and frequency response. The frequency response is obtained from deconvolution of voltage and neutral current records. A quantitative comparison of frequency response is performed using the techniques applied to displacement detection through Frequency Response Analysis, such as correlation and spectral deviation. The system is implemented using 8 bit digitizers to acquire the voltage and neutral current records. The quantization error and reliability of the frequency response obtained is handled through the use of the coherence function and tolerance bands. The system is thoroughly tested applying a lightning impulse test to a dry type distribution transformer, simulating an interdisc fault with a <b>spark</b> gap. <b>Failure</b> detection is confirmed...|$|R
25|$|The Meech Lake Accord {{also met}} its doom in 1990. It was not {{ratified}} by the provincial governments of Manitoba and Newfoundland before the June ratification deadline. This <b>failure</b> <b>sparked</b> a revival of Quebec separatism, and led to another round of meetings in Charlottetown in 1991 and 1992. These negotiations culminated in the Charlottetown Accord, which outlined extensive changes to the constitution, including recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. However, the agreement was overwhelmingly defeated in a national referendum in October 1992. Many blamed the GST battle and Mulroney's unpopularity for {{the fall of the}} Accord.|$|R

40|$|This {{report was}} {{prepared}} at the Bureau of Standards for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Additional or subsidiary gaps have frequently {{been used in}} jump-spark ignition systems, in order to cause the resumption of sparking in fouled spark plugs. The series gap, to which {{the greater part of}} this report is devoted, is a subsidiary gap in the connection between the high tension terminal of the plug and that of the magneto or coil. A brief account is given of the use of this gap up to the present time and also of the statements concerning it which have gained some currency, most of which are shown to be erroneous. The simple theory of the action of the series gap is discussed and a detailed account given of the effect upon the sparking ability of the plug produced by changes in the values of the electrical resistance of the fouling and of the capacities in parallel with the plug and with the magneto or coil. This report presents the results of an investigation into the utility, action, and design of the auxiliary spark gap as a means for insuring freedom from <b>spark</b> plug <b>failure</b> due to fouling, and also to enable the restarting of fouled plugs...|$|R

40|$|In August 1763, {{northern}} Europe {{experienced a}} financial crisis with numerous parallels to the 2008 Lehman Brothers episode. The 1763 crisis was <b>sparked</b> by the <b>failure</b> of a major provider of acceptance loans, a form of securitized credit resembling modern asset-backed commercial paper. The central bank at {{the hub of the}} crisis, the Bank of Amsterdam, responded by broadening the range of acceptable collateral for its repo transactions. Analysis of archival data shows that this emergency source of liquidity helped to contain the effects of the crisis, by preventing the collapse of at least two other major securitizers. While the underlying themes seem to have changed little in 250 years, the modest scope of the 1763 liquidity intervention, together with the lightly regulated nature of the eighteenth century financial landscape, provide some informative contrasts with events of late 2008...|$|R
40|$|The power {{required}} to energize a copper magnet is minimized by operation {{at the lowest}} possible temperature. However, the resistance of copper drops very little at temperatures lower than 30 K, which defines a desirable temperature for economic operation of high-field/high-current magnets. Liquid hydrogen (at 1 bar) is therefore a natural candidate as the coolant for high-power copper magnets. Issues of safety make it prudent that the copper conductors (which could generate <b>sparks</b> during magnet <b>failures)</b> not be directly cooled by liquid hydrogen. Hence, a favorable scheme is that the magnet be cooled by flow of helium gas at ~ 30 K, with this gas cooled in an external heat exchanger with a liquid-helium bath. A design based on this scheme was developed (although not implemented) for the 15 -T pulsed solenoid used in the so-called MERIT experiment at the CERN Laboratory (Switzerland) ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT In this paper, we use {{scientific}} controversy {{emerging from}} a river otter restoration project in Missouri to explore the role of nonhuman actors in the dynamism of networks forming to establish the ideals and outcomes of ecological restoration. We demonstrate how an epistemic controversy, <b>sparked</b> by the <b>failure</b> of authoritative spokespersons (such as scientists) to enroll river otters, fish, and waterways, {{opened the door for}} a more diverse group of spokespersons who, in turn, enrolled more actors to settle the controversy. Thus, we emphasize the need to recognize the role of nonhumans as catalysts and actors because of their potential to challenge and change networks. Second, we explore the struggle between the networks that emerged to (re) define the restoration narrative as accomplished (necessitating the trapping of otters) or incomplete (with the otter population in possible jeopardy). Finally, our discussion highlights the importance of convergence and power when competing networks are involved. The otter restoration case study makes evident that a successful exercise of power has significant consequences for human and nonhuman actors alike, all of which have a stake in the landscape...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate change}} poses {{significant}} {{risks to the}} California economy. Recognizing and responding to these threats, Governor Schwarzenegger signed Executive Order #S- 3 - 05 (Schwarzenegger 2005) which called for a 30 percent reduction below business-as-usual of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. In September 2006, the California legislature passed and Governor Schwarzenegger signed into law the historic Global Warming Solutions Act (AB 32), which mandates a first-in-the-nation limit on emissions that cause global warming. In June 2006, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) released a “Draft Scoping Plan” – the policy roadmap to meet the emissions reduction target of 169 Million Metric Tons of Carbon (MMTCO 2) equivalent by 2020 to stabilize at 427 MMTCO 2 overall. The CARB board will take up final adoption of this plan in December 2008. During {{the months leading up}} to this decision, a financial crisis of global proportions is unfolding. The state, nation and world are caught in serial market <b>failures</b> <b>sparked</b> by the collapse of the housing credit market, and there is much speculation about the impact of declining capital gains revenue on the state budget. Against this backdrop, Energy Efficiency, Innovation, and Job Creation in California analyses the economic impact of CARB’s past and future policies to reduce fossil fuel generated energy demand. California’s achievements in energy efficiency over the last generation are well known, but evidence about their deeper economic implications remains weak. This study examines the economy-wide employment effects of the state’s landmark efficiency policies over the last thirty-five years, and forecasts the economic effects of significantly more aggressive policies proposed to reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} an experimental study to detecting the faults of engine using its noise. The noises {{produced by the}} engine and its accessory systems are numerous: whines, squeals, knock, rattles, and many other sounds. Faults diagnosis for Mitsubishis car engine model 2006 has been conducted and this diagnosis includes normal operating conditions for the engine (without malfunction) and for malfunctions situations at variable engine speed 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 rpm respectively The engine data is acquired from a four cylinder one- petrol engine test bed under consideration at different operating states, and then simulated. Most of the conventional fault diagnosis techniques using sound emission and vibration signals are based on analyzing the signal amplitude in the time or frequency domain. For engine under fired and misfires spark the all the domain parameters (RMS amplitude, peak amplitude and energy) was processed using MATLAB software. It was found that fault detection and diagnosis for internal combustion engines {{is complicated by the}} presence of engine noise during normal operation. The average of amplitude found to be 450 x 10 - 3 m for normal engine working without any malfunction and 458 x 10 - 3 m for misfire of one spark plug and for misfire of two spark plugs 457. 8 x 10 - 3 m. In this study, some of the engine malfunction such as <b>failure</b> <b>spark</b> plug has been recorded, but we can generalize it to include all engine breakdown. Generally, sound emission signal serves as a promising alternative to the condition monitoring and fault diagnosis in rotating machinery when the vibration signal is not available. This research paper explores that automobiles could be major sources of noise pollution. Condition monitoring and fault diagnosis of IC engine through acoustic signal analysis is an established technique for detecting early stages of component degradatio...|$|R
