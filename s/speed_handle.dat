5|$|The game {{features}} eleven Digimon as playable characters. Eight {{characters are}} available immediately; {{the rest are}} unlockable by completing cup races. However, the Digivolution mechanic increases {{the total number of}} playable Digimon to over 40. The cast predominantly includes popular Digimon from the Digimon anime. Characters' racing abilities differ through their ranking in three areas: <b>speed,</b> <b>handling</b> and acceleration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{restyling}} by designers John Mockett and Rod Scivyer saw {{the introduction}} of the twin [...] "bug eye" [...] headlamps which are a Triumph trademark to this day. When introduced in 1997 the T509 had a polished frame. It also had low mount clip-ons. To improve rider comfort and low <b>speed</b> <b>handling,</b> a regular handlebar was fitted from 1998.|$|R
50|$|The Audi Driving Experience {{includes}} emergency manoeuvres using Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) systems. It {{also includes}} the {{theory and practice of}} safe high <b>speed</b> <b>handling,</b> and helps demonstrate and educate the abilities of Audis 'trademark' quattro four-wheel drive system. These activities are all carried out in a safe (but realistic) environment, away from public roads/highways.|$|R
50|$|While a sidecar {{pilot is}} {{described}} as driving rather than riding, with all but the heaviest rigs, the comparison to a car is weak. Driver and passenger body position affect higher <b>speed</b> <b>handling,</b> especially on dirt or other uneven surfaces. If the sidecar and bike geometry are not coordinated the combination will be unstable, especially at speed, with shimmy upon acceleration or deceleration.|$|R
50|$|BMW's {{intention}} {{with the}} C1 was {{to appeal to}} car drivers in crowded city streets. The idea was to offer the convenience of a scooter or motorbike but without many of the associated dangers or hassles. The C1's most innovative design feature was its emphasis on safety. However, being secured by a seat belt could make slow <b>speed</b> <b>handling</b> and manoeuvring rather tricky until experience is acquired.|$|R
50|$|The {{wings are}} {{constructed}} of tubular {{front and rear}} spars. The wings and flying control surfaces are covered in Kevlar/Mylar/Polyester laminate. The wings can be removed or folded (if an optional folding kit is installed) for storage and transportation. The wing tips are of composite construction which reduces drag and improves low <b>speed</b> <b>handling.</b> Access to the cabin is provided by two gull-wing doors.|$|R
5000|$|Major facilities: High speed track, special surface/low <b>speed</b> track, <b>handling</b> course, grades, salt bath, {{environmental}} exposure area ...|$|R
50|$|Early {{disc brake}} {{calipers}} {{were located in}} front of the fork leg on top of the disc. This position placed the caliper in an area of high air flow for better heat removal. Calipers on most modern motorcycles are mounted {{to the rear of the}} fork leg. This has the advantage of reducing the angular momentum of the fork assembly and improving low <b>speed</b> <b>handling.</b> Radial mounted calipers.|$|R

50|$|Also {{note that}} the {{structure}} of the vehicle-buying hierarchy might be different for other families (ones who don't limit themselves to Hondas, or who care nothing about style, or who drive less than 5000 mi a year, etc.). It would definitely be different for a 25-year-old playboy who doesn't care how much his cars cost, knows he will never wreck one, and is intensely interested in <b>speed,</b> <b>handling,</b> and the numerous aspects of style.|$|R
5000|$|A {{test drive}} {{that was done}} on February 25, 2014 {{received}} positive reviews for its <b>speed,</b> <b>handling,</b> technology, and performance from The Fast Lane, and an overall 9 rating (out of 10) from Canada's Autonet.ca. Truck Trend quoted that they never really thought of the Suburban and Yukon XL as [...] "one-percent" [...] vehicles (referring to their previous generations and its upper-class and family-oriented customers), they're now solidly [...] "ten-percenters" [...] with the updated versions.|$|R
50|$|In September 2015, the hot {{and high}} {{altitude}} trials of LCH were conducted successfully. The third prototype (TD-3) was taken to Leh for testing. Hover performance, low <b>speed</b> <b>handling</b> capability at extreme heights and temperature along with landing at forward locations were tested. The helicopter became the first attack helicopter to land in Siachen. The helicopter landed at high altitude helipads at 13,600 feet to 15,800 feet. The weapon firing trials will be held {{during the middle of}} 2016.|$|R
30|$|The growing {{need for}} {{container}} terminals to handle containerships {{as fast as}} possible leads to more automation and more simultaneously operating STS cranes, leading to high peaks in electricity demand. As discussed in section 1.1, because an observed peak demand is charged for the next 12  months, the highest peak is responsible for nearly 25 – 30 % of the total electricity costs. This implies that higher <b>handling</b> <b>speeds</b> of containerships result in more peak-related energy costs, leading to higher handling costs. Because container carriers require both higher <b>handling</b> <b>speeds</b> and lower <b>handling</b> costs, terminals are confronted with a dilemma. The challenge is therefore to find opportunities to reduce the peak-related costs without reducing the <b>handling</b> <b>speed</b> too much.|$|R
25|$|A {{technical}} dispute arose {{between the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment and the English Electric Company (EEC) {{as to the}} optimum configuration for the company's proposed supersonic fighter. A single-seat, mid-winged research machine was built to investigate the low <b>speed</b> <b>handling</b> of the possible configurations. The same basic configuration of the P.1 was incorporated into a simpler testbed that had a fixed undercarriage. Since the SB5 was to test the low-speed flight characteristics, there was no requirement for the undercarriage to be retractable.|$|R
50|$|After {{returning}} to Chilbolton by road, the aircraft was flown to the A&AEE on 5 July 1955 for further trials. The aircraft was tested for low <b>speed</b> <b>handling</b> on 5 July. Whilst at 10000 ft, {{and unable to}} recover from a flat spin 20 minutes after take-off, the aircraft spun in from 3000 ft two miles south-southeast of Boscombe Down. It was destroyed by fire and the pilot Lieutenant Commander T.A. Rickell, who had ejected just before the crash, died of injuries sustained.|$|R
50|$|In the British Royal Navy, a third {{rate was}} a ship {{of the line}} which from the 1720s mounted between 64 and 80 guns, {{typically}} built with two gun decks (thus the related term two-decker). Years of experience proved that the third rate ships embodied the best compromise between sailing ability (<b>speed,</b> <b>handling),</b> firepower, and cost. So, while first rates and second rates were both larger and more powerful, the third-rate ships were {{in a real sense}} the optimal configuration.|$|R
50|$|The {{ships that}} became the Mississippi class were {{intended}} {{to serve as the}} modern equivalent of 19th century third-rate ship of the line, offering what was thought to be an efficient compromise between sailing ability (<b>speed,</b> <b>handling),</b> firepower, and cost. This concept had formed the backbone of the sailing battle fleets of the previous century, but trends in early twentieth century naval strategies were making the third-rate concept obsolete. Prevailing strategies called for a consistent battle line of first-rate units.|$|R
5000|$|Magne was a rugby {{back row}} forward, known {{especially}} for his <b>speed</b> and <b>handling</b> in open field play. He represented [...] 89 times, scoring 14 tries.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{designing}} conceptual supersonic cruise aircraft to meet low sonic boom requirements is outlined and described. The aircraft design is guided through a systematic evolution from initial three view {{drawing to a}} final numerical model description, while the designer using the method controls the integration of low sonic boom, high supersonic aerodynamic efficiency, adequate low <b>speed</b> <b>handling,</b> and reasonable structure and materials technologies. Some experience in preliminary aircraft design and {{in the use of}} various analytical and numerical codes is required for integrating the volume and lift requirements throughout the design process...|$|R
50|$|Flash {{memory devices}} use two {{different}} logical technologies—NOR and NAND—to map data. NOR flash provides high-speed random access, {{reading and writing}} data in specific memory locations; it can retrieve {{as little as a}} single byte. NAND flash reads and writes sequentially at high <b>speed,</b> <b>handling</b> data in small blocks called pages, however it is slower on read when compared to NOR. NAND flash reads faster than it writes, quickly transferring whole pages of data. Less expensive than NOR flash at high densities, NAND technology offers higher capacity for the same-size silicon.|$|R
50|$|Designed by John Britten and Desmond Norman, the Trislander is {{a further}} {{development}} of Britten-Norman's better-known Islander aircraft {{in order to give}} it a larger carrying capacity. In comparison with the Islander, the Trislander has a stretched fuselage, strengthened, fixed tricycle landing gear and a third engine on the fuselage centre line atop the fin. The Trislander has exceptional low <b>speed</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics, extended endurance, increased payload, low noise signature and economical operating costs. Capable of taking off from a 492 yard long landing strip, the Trislander can readily operate from unprepared surfaces.|$|R
50|$|In Ireland and the UK, the FJR1300 has {{replaced}} the Honda ST1300 Pan-European as the patrol motorcycle with several police forces, following that model's withdrawal due to concerns over high <b>speed</b> <b>handling.</b> The FJR is the patrol vehicle used by the police force of Trinidad and Tobago including the units in the convoy of the President and the Prime Minister. It is also used as the standard patrol motorcycle of the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee. The Danish, French and Australian Federal Police, and the Spanish Guardia Civil also use the FJR1300.|$|R
50|$|The race {{started from}} Porte Maillot {{and went through}} the Bois de Boulogne. Count Jules-Albert de Dion was first into Rouen after 6 hours and 48 minutes at an average speed of 19 km/h. He {{finished}} 3’30” ahead of Albert Lemaître (Peugeot), followed by Auguste Doriot (Peugeot) at 16’30”, René Panhard (Panhard) at 33’30’’ and Émile Levassor (Panhard) at 55’30”. The official winners were Peugeot and Panhard as cars were judged on their <b>speed,</b> <b>handling</b> and safety characteristics, and De Dion's steam car needed a stoker which was forbidden.|$|R
50|$|The models {{available}} are the HUMMER H1 (discontinued), H2 SUT, H2 SUV, H3 SUV and the H3T concept. Most {{models can}} be customized by transmission and upgrades (which {{depend on the}} model). The colors may also be changed. Six unlockable vehicles: The Security (Police, H3 SUV), Custom Racing (racing livery, H3T), Fire Truck (Firefighting, H1), Snow Patrol (A snow themed Police, H2 SUT), Bling (Golden, spinners, etc., H2 SUV), and the Patriot (Eagle and Flag-themed, H1) are non-customizable. Customization determines <b>Speed,</b> <b>Handling,</b> and Hp (how much damage it can take), {{as well as the}} look.|$|R
5000|$|The K 10 {{made its}} first flight in August 1963. [...] The Wortmann {{profiles}} did improve high speed performance but the K 10 lost the excellent low <b>speed</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics of the Ka 6, so only twelve K 10s were built and Kaiser's attention turned to producing an improved Ka 6, the Ka 6E which adopted the all-moving tailplane of the K 10 but used the earlier NACA airfoils. [...] Three K 10s remained on the German civil aircraft register in 2010. [...] A Swiss registered K 10 crashed fatally in 1999.|$|R
5000|$|The race {{started from}} Porte Maillot {{and went through}} the Bois de Boulogne. Count Jules-Albert de Dion was first into Rouen after 6 hours and 48 minutes at an average speed of 19 km/h.

The official winners were Peugeot and Panhard as cars were judged on their <b>speed,</b> <b>handling</b> and safety characteristics. De Dion's steam car needed a stoker, which was forbidden.|$|R
50|$|During World War II, Dr. Alexander Lippisch {{proposed}} a ramjet propelled point defence fighter Lippisch P.13a. To investigate the low <b>speed</b> <b>handling</b> and aerodynamics of this delta-winged fighter, Lippisch arranged for Akaflieg Darmstadt {{to build a}} full-scale flying glider model, which emerged as the Darmstadt D-33. After the Akaflieg Darmstadt workshop was bombed in September 1944, the D-33 project {{was moved to the}} Akaflieg München workshops at Prien am Chiemsee. At Prien, Wolfgang Heinemann and Hans Zacher from Darmstadt, with Klaus Metzner and Hermann Nenninger from Munich, completed the D-33 as the Akaflieg Darmstadt/Akaflieg München DM1.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{article focuses}} on methods for {{designing}} modular cable-driven orientation mechanisms that can be attached to robot systems that lack on rotational degrees of freedom. The approach yields assembly systems for high <b>speed</b> <b>handling</b> applications by reducing moving masses. For this purpose, a classification of feasible kinematic structures are given and resulting characteristics, like the orientation workspace, dexterity or its homogeneity, are analyzed. The mechanical design of a first prototype is subsequently presented along with a universal simulation tool for determining task-adapted powertrains using cables. Finally, results of first tests and possibilities for future developments are presented...|$|R
50|$|The Pegasus vectored-thrust {{turbofan}} is a two-shaft design featuring three {{low pressure}} (LP) and eight high pressure (HP) compressor stages driven by two LP and two HP turbine stages respectively. Unusually the LP and HP spools rotate {{in opposite directions}} to greatly reduce the gyroscopic effects which would otherwise hamper low <b>speed</b> <b>handling.</b> LP and HP fan blading is titanium, the LP fan blades operating in the partly supersonic region, and airflow is 432 lb/s. The engine employs a simple thrust vectoring system that uses four swiveling nozzles, giving the Harrier thrust both for lift and forward propulsion, allowing for STOVL flight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sequel to}} the PlayStation's first {{snowmobile}} racing game, Sled Storm combines the ability to perform aerial tricks with arcade-style racing down a series of seven snow- and ice-covered courses. As in previous games in the EA Sports Big lineup, performing tricks earns players points used to unlock characters and acquire speed boosts. The eight male and female characters have varying trick abilities and they each have distinct snowmobiles, or [...] "sleds," [...] individually rated in acceleration, top <b>speed,</b> <b>handling,</b> and stability. New sleds for each character can be earned by placing first on the majority of courses.|$|R
50|$|Criticisms {{directed}} at Java include {{the implementation of}} generics, <b>speed,</b> the <b>handling</b> of unsigned numbers, the implementation of floating-point arithmetic, {{and a history of}} security vulnerabilities in the primary Java VM implementation HotSpot.|$|R
25|$|Tom Prescott {{worked for}} Sikorsky Aircraft, Piper Aircraft, and Learjet. He left Learjet in 1983 {{to produce the}} Prescott Pusher. The pusher was tested using a 1/5 scale model in the Wichita State University wind tunnel in 1983. Flying scale models were tested in 1984, {{which led to the}} {{development}} of the drooped wing tips for better low <b>speed</b> <b>handling</b> and reduced drag. The aircraft was modeled using CAD/CAM software for creating drawings and defining machine cuts on the fuselage steel, becoming the first CAD/CAM designed homebuilt aircraft. The AVIA Products Co was purchased to develop an electrically controlled variable pitch fiberglass pusher propeller.|$|R
