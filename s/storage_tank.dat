5|$|News reports {{described}} the incident {{as the biggest}} {{of its kind in}} peacetime Europe and certainly the biggest such explosion in the United Kingdom since the 1974 Flixborough disaster. The flames had been extinguished by the afternoon of 13 December 2005. However, one <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> re-ignited that evening, which the fire-fighters left to burn rather than attempting to extinguish it again.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April 1970, a B-52D {{assigned}} to the 28th Bomb Wing caught fire and crashed while landing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota; sliding {{to a halt and}} burning atop a 25,000 gallon fuel <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> Efforts by fire department personnel saved the 9 man crew and prevented a catastrophic explosion of the fuel tank.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ <b>storage</b> <b>tank,</b> enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
50|$|In the USA, <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> {{operate under}} no (or very little) pressure, {{distinguishing}} them from pressure vessels. <b>Storage</b> <b>tanks</b> are often cylindrical in shape, {{perpendicular to the}} ground with flat bottoms, and a fixed flangible or floating roof. There are usually many environmental regulations applied to the design and operation of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> often depending {{on the nature of the}} fluid contained within. Above ground <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> (AST) differ from underground (UST) <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> in the kinds of regulations that are applied.|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} on piped-water supply before entering the <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and after leaving the water <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> which are found in Jimma. Nineteen water <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> were analyzed but the finding from six of water <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> presented in this study {{as most of the}} tanks were interconnected and the water is delivered with single pipe line. The tanks are made up of plastic material and commonly called ‘Rotto’. The water storing capacity of the tanks ranged from 2500 to 25, 000  L and were filled with tap water.|$|R

5|$|In response, the United Nations {{began to}} pass a series of resolutions {{demanding}} the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Afraid that Saudi Arabia would be invaded next, the Saudi government requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began marshalling forces {{from a variety of}} nations, styled the Coalition, on the Arabian peninsula. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented with the use of explosives to destroy wellheads {{in the area of the}} Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of 200,000 barrels a day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.|$|E
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
5|$|When the {{railways}} were nationalised in 1948, services at Shirehampton {{came under the}} aegis of the Western Region of British Railways. Staff levels decreased by 1958 to two clerks, two leading porters, one porter, and a stationmaster who was also responsible for Sea Mills railway station. Service levels had decreased slightly by 1955 to 28 towards Avonmouth and 29 towards Bristol, but the services were at regular intervals. Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase, and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted, which lost more passengers. A year later in 1963, the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line, but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn. Goods services from the station ended on 29 November 1965, and from 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line, including Shirehampton, with tickets issued by the train guard. An 800-ton oil <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> was built in the station yard in 1967, with deliveries continuing until the mid-eighties. By 2005 the yard had been redeveloped and was occupied by a commercial vehicle hire company. The general reduction in passenger traffic, as well as the transfer of Avonmouth goods traffic to the Henbury Loop Line, allowed the removal of the second track from 19 October 1970, with all services using the original, northern platform. The signal box was taken out of service at the same time, and the buildings on the remaining platform sold off before being destroyed by a fire in the 1990s. The station master's house is now a private dwelling, with the garden containing a small brick building with a chimney surviving from the station buildings. By 1974, service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction, with no Sunday services beyond Avonmouth.|$|E

30|$|In Ethiopia, the {{discontinuity}} {{of drinking}} water supply, hinders the distribution of water to people in need. This discontinuity creates a need to use <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> Likewise, in Jimma, irregular provision of piped water is frequently observed and presence of water <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> is vital. Small to large sized plastic water <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> commonly called ‘Rotto’ are found and used as water storage containers. Water stored in unhygienic manner may be re-contaminated, and can cause water borne diseases. Contamination most often occurs with deteriorated infrastructure; allowing entry of particulate or other non-potable material. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was}} to assess physicochemical and bacteriological qualities of tap water stored in water <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R

40|$|One hundred {{water samples}} were {{collected}} from the residential galvanized steel water <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> from three different regions of Al-Karak Province {{in the southern part}} of the country Jordan. Samples were analyzed for major anions (HCO 3, F -, Cl -, NO 3 - and SO 4 - 2), major cations (Na +, K +, Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) and heavy metals (Pb, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn and Ni), in order to evaluate the impact of the residential <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> on the drinking water quality in comparison to its water source. The water quality of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> showed higher ionic concentrations in comparison to its source. This was attributed to dust entering the <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> during the dusty summer season and the elevated water temperature leading to further evaporation from the tanks. Despite the fact that the contact period between the water and the residential <b>storage</b> water <b>tanks</b> is short (less than one week), elevated levels of heavy metals were found in the drinking water indicating dissolution of these metals from <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> to the water. This is enhanced due to the fact that many <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> were in wear and tear conditions and some not cleaned for a long period of time. Elevated levels of heavy metals in the drinking water from the residential <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> were noticeable in comparison to its source water; these levels were still below the Jordanian drinking water standards and didn`t exceed the World Health Organization standards for drinking water...|$|R

25|$|The {{capacity}} of the DM plant is dictated by the type and quantity of salts in the raw water input. However, some storage is essential as the DM plant may be down for maintenance. For this purpose, a <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> is installed from which DM water is continuously withdrawn for boiler make-up. The <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> for DM water is made from materials not affected by corrosive water, such as PVC. The piping and valves are generally of stainless steel. Sometimes, a steam blanketing arrangement or stainless steel doughnut float is provided {{on top of the}} water in the tank to avoid contact with air. DM water make-up is generally added at the steam space of the surface condenser (i.e., the vacuum side). This arrangement not only sprays the water but also DM water gets deaerated, with the dissolved gases being removed by a de-aerator through an ejector attached to the condenser.|$|E
