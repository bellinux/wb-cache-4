50|$|Silicate paints require <b>siliceous</b> <b>substrate</b> for setting. For {{this reason}} {{they are highly}} {{suitable}} for mineral substrates such as mineral plasters and concrete. They are only of limited use for application on wood and metal, though. The permeability for water vapor of silicate paints is equivalent {{to that of the}} substrate. This effectively means that silicate paints do not inhibit the diffusion of water vapor. Moisture contained in parts of a structure or in the plaster may diffuse outward without resistance. This keeps walls dry and prevents structural damage. This addition helps avoid condensation water on the surface of building materials. This reduces the risk of infestation by algae and fungi. The high alkalinity of the binding agent water glass adds to the inhibitive effect against infestation by microorganisms and completely eliminates the need for additional preservatives.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe alpine sedge Carex curvula ssp. curvula is a clonal, {{dominant}} graminoid {{found in}} the European Alps, the Carpathians, the Pyrenees and {{in some of the}} Balkan Mountains. It is a late-successional species of acidophilous alpine meadows that occurs on sites that were covered by ice during the last glacial maximum (LGM). By applying the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequencing, we attempted to identify the recolonization routes followed by the species after the last ice retreat. We relied on the genetic diversity of 37 populations covering the entire distributional range of the species. As a wind-pollinated species, C. curvula is characterized by a low level of population genetic differentiation. Nuclear and chloroplast data both support the hypothesis of a long-term separation of Eastern (Balkans and Carpathians) and Western (Alps and Pyrenees) lineages. In the Alps, a continuum of genetic depauperation from the east to the west may be related to a recolonization wave originating in the eastern-most parts of the chain, where the main glacial refugium was likely located. The Pyrenean populations are nested within the western Alps group and show a low level of genetic diversity, probably due to recent long-distance colonization. In contrast to the Alps, we found no phylogeographical structure in the Carpathians. The combination of reduced ice extension during the Würm period and the presence of large areas of <b>siliceous</b> <b>substrate</b> at suitable elevation suggest that in contrast to populations in the Alps, the species in the Carpathians underwent a local vertical migration rather than extinction and recolonization over long distance...|$|E
40|$|The {{large amount}} of {{volatile}} organic compound (VOC) emitted by vegetation modifies air quality contributing to both tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol production. A {{better understanding of the}} factors controlling VOC emissions by vegetation is mandatory in order to improve emission estimates derived from tropospheric chemistry models. Although the Mediterranean shrublands are particularly abundant and rich in emitting species, their emission potential is poorly known. Focusing on a VOC-emitting shrub species widespread in the Mediterranean area (Cistus monspeliensis L.), we measured and analysed its emissions of terpenes taking into account the age of individuals, the season of sampling and the soil type. Sampling was done under natural environmental conditions. Species of the genus Cistus are frequently reported to be storing species, although we found only one stored monoterpene and three sesquiterpenes in very low amount. Major emitted compounds were a-pinene and b-myrcene. Total terpene emissions were not influenced by plant age but emission of some individual terpenes was positively correlated with age. A strong seasonal effect was evidenced. A larger amount of terpenes was emitted during spring and summer than during fall and winter. Summer emission rates were nearly 70 times higher than winter emission rates. Total and individual terpene emissions were influenced by soil type; emissions on <b>siliceous</b> <b>substrate</b> were ca. seven times higher than those on calcareous substrate. In conclusion, it appears clearly that environmental factors such as soil nature and season should be taken into account in order to achieve improved modelling of terpene emissions by shrub species...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of our work was to {{elucidate}} factors responsible for the geographical differences in leaf-litter decomposition rates in Spanish oligotrophic headwater streams. Decomposition experiments with alder (Alnus glutinosa) leaf litter were carried out in 22 headwater streams in 4 different climatic regions across the Iberian Peninsula (Cornisa Cantbrica, Cordillera Litoral Catalana, Sierra de Guadarrama, and Sierra Nevada). Streams that were similar in size, flowed mainly over <b>siliceous</b> <b>substrate</b> in catchments with scarce human settlements and activities, and fell within a range of low nutrient concentrations were chosen in each region. Breakdown rates were regionally variable and were low (0. 1090. 198 % ash-free dry mass [AFDM]/degree day [dd]) in the Cornisa Cantbrica, the most mesic and Atlantic region, and high (0. 3020. 639 % AFDM/dd) in Sierra de Guadarrama, one of the coldest and most inland areas. Temperature was not the determining factor affecting differences in breakdown rates among regions, and breakdown rates were not related to concentrations of dissolved nutrients. However, microbial reproductive activity (sporulation rates) was significantly correlated with dissolved P concentration. Breakdown rates were explained better by presence and feeding activities of detritivores than by decomposer activity. Incorporation of breakdown rates in assessment schemes of stream ecological status will be difficult because leaf processing does not respond unequivocally to environmental factors when climatic regions are considered. Thus, regional adjustments of baseline standards in reference conditions will be required. © 2011 by The North American Benthological Society.

40|$|The high species {{diversity}} and endemism of the Maritime Alps {{suggest that this}} region may have held several refugia during the Pleistocene glaciations. Nevertheless, this assumption has rarely been examined. Here we investigate the genetic diversity of Saxifraga florulenta, a rare endemic restricted to <b>siliceous</b> <b>substrates</b> in the Maritime Alps. Overlaying the maximum extension of the ice sheet during the Pleistocene, the current distributions of S. florulenta and <b>siliceous</b> <b>substrates</b> suggest the existence of two putative refugial areas in the Maritime Alps. By using evidence from amplified fragment length polymorphisms we aim at elucidating whether genetic structure of the species corresponds to this two-refugia hypothesis and how this genetic information {{can be used to}} ensure its long-term conservation. Low levels of species-wide and within-population genetic diversity were detected, suggesting strong historical bottlenecks. Bayesian and principal coordinate analyses identified two population groups in agreement with the two refugia hypothesis. However, weak genetic divergence between these groups suggests that their separation happened more recently, and that S. florulenta survived the Pleistocene glaciations in one main refugium. The lack of a significant correlation among genetic and geographic distances implies that populations are not at migration-drift equilibrium and current levels of gene flow among them {{do not appear to be}} sufficient to balance the effect of genetic drift. Hence, in future conservation strategies, special care should be taken to preserve both gene pools and prevent further fragmentation of populations...|$|R

40|$|Packaging {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} technological steps of food preservation. Microbial growth and oxidation reactions occurring on food surface are two of the main causes of deterioration of fresh and processed food products. Traditional food packaging generally protect foodstuff from external influences. Whereas active packaging systems interact with the food permitting the extension of their shelf-life and the maintenance, or even the improvement of their quality and sensorial features. The main objective of this thesis is the attainment of knowledge related to the development of new material formulations for food packaging by using suitably modified inorganic nanoparticles in order to obtain a controlled release system of active substances and to improve active film physical and gas barrier performances. As far as antioxidant active films is concerned, the aim of the work is the development of innovative films containing natural -tocopherol adsorbed onto functionalised and not functionalised mesoporous silica particles (SBA- 15; SBA- 15 +APTES) in order to protect it during LDPE film manufacture and to be able to control its release rate. The synthesized mesoporous powders were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction and N 2 adsorption/desorption at 77 K. Powders loaded with tocopherol were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Results show that the maximum of the pore size distribution reduces from 90 Å for purely siliceous SBA- 15 to 73 Å for amino-functionalized SBA- 15. Infrared analysis shows that tocopherol interacts with the amino groups of functionalized SBA- 15. It has been also proven that circa 40 % and 30 % of tocopherol is loaded into SBA- 15 and SBA- 15 +APTES respectively. Release tests performed using 96 % v/v ethanol as fatty food stimulant show that the tocopherol diffusivity of films containing functionalized mesoporous silica decreased of about 50 % with respect to films containing free tocopherol, as. This is due to the decrease in the pore size and to the increase in diffusion resistance caused by the functionalization of the internal pore walls with the amino groups. Moreover, the oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) assay of the produced active polymer films proved the antioxidant effectiveness of tocopherol released from samples after manufacturing process. As far as antimicrobial activity is concerned, silver montmorillonite clays have been increasingly investigated as germicidal, bactericidal, antifungal, and antiseptic components in different food packaging formulation. The aim of this thesis is the development of a new class of antimicrobial systems in which the inorganic phyllosilicate clays (MMT) have been used as support for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The Ag-MMT filler consists of nanometric metallic silver and oxides particles (size in the range 2 - 40 nm) preferentially located on the surface of MMT single lamellae as the UV adsorption and FT-IR spectra showed. Antimicrobial bionanocomposites have been obtained by solution casting of AgMMT particles into chitosan, one of the most interesting biopolymers obtained from natural sources. The combined effect of glycerol and AgMMT particles on the thermal, structural and barrier properties of the obtained bionanocomposites was investigated. In fact, the plasticizer and the silver ions as well as the surface of metallic particles exert a combined effect which allows a reduction of the liquid water uptake and water permeability with respect to neat chitosan. Indeed, X. Ray results revealed that Ag-MMT particles result partially intercalated by chitosan macromolecules although it cannot be excluded in such an extent the exfoliation due to the collapse of MMT structure during the preparation of the active filler. Moreover, considering that the antibacterial mechanism of silver is mainly related to the action of silver ions and metallic AgNPs, the silver release kinetics from bionanocomposites in water at 25 °C were also investigated. In conclusion, samples of purely siliceous and amino-functionalized SBA- 15 mesoporous silica were successfully used as α-tocopherol carriers for the production of active LDPE polymer films. In fact, active polymer films containing the functionalized carrier showed a slower tocopherol release when compared to samples containing free tocopherol and tocopherol loaded onto purely <b>siliceous</b> <b>substrate.</b> Whereas, for antimicrobial active film,. the silver supporting nanoparticles, Ag-MMT, contribute to modulate the release kinetics of silver ions from bionanocomposite films over a longer time interval (up to 20 days). This is of paramount importance for the production of active films to be used as food packaging materials or potentially as biomaterials...|$|E

40|$|Sand dune {{vegetation}} {{along the}} coast of the Mexican states of Tabasco and Campeche was sampled by means of 1501 releves and the data were analyzed with classification and ordination programs. 36 community types were distinguished, which were grouped into 10 higher-order groups. The communities are described in a sequence reflecting the main vegetation zonation. Beach, embryo dune and foredune community groups include 12 community types, the sheltered zone includes 16 types and the fixed dunes 8 types. The ordination results reveal one main vegetation gradient corresponding to the increase in mean distance from the shoreline and elevation, and being covariant with species richness, mean vegetation cover and mean vegetation height. Additional differences are related to the geographical transition between the Gulf and Caribbean coastal vegetation and environmental conditions, mainly type of sand, occurring in the study area. Siliceous sand and a Gulf climate are characteristic for most of Tabasco, and calcareous sand and a Caribbean-type climate are characteristic for Campeche. Disturbance caused by coconut plantations, cattle grazing and tourism favours the invasion of ruderal species from waste places behind the dunes, which attain local dominance in the dunes described here. Consequently some separate community types had to be distinguished.

40|$|The protein binding {{properties}} of a cationic polyelectrolyte, poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC), {{were used for}} protein separation. The polyelectrolyte was used in two confined states: as a separate dense, viscous, aqueous phase (coacervate), or adsorbed on <b>siliceous</b> <b>substrates.</b> Polyelectrolyte-protein coacervation may be suitable for large-scale separations. Coacervation selectivity and efficiency was studied {{as a function of}} polyelectrolyte MW, ionic strength (I), protein-polymer mixing ratio (r), and pH, using bovine serum albumin (BSA), ribonuclease (RNAse), β-lactoglobulin, and γ-globulin. Coacervate structure was studied via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and rheology. FRAP showed the diffusivity of BSA in coacervates is the same as for a non-interacting probe of equal size. The coacervate microviscosity was found to be two orders of magnitude lower than its (Newtonian) macroviscosity. Protein-polyelectrolyte “bonds” in coacervates are therefore loose and non-specific. ^ PDADMAC was also electrostatically bound to a chromatographic packing material, controlled porous glass (CPG), or to silica capillaries. The selectivity of PDADMAC for BSA vs. β-lactoglobulin, seen in coacervation was preserved after its immobilization on both surfaces. The pH, ionic strength, and mixing time for polyelectrolyte adsorption on CPG all affect subsequent protein binding, presumably via the molecular {{properties of}} the adsorbed polyelectrolyte layer. Size-exclusion chromatography and quasi-elastic light scattering studies were used to establish a correlation between the configuration of adsorbed polyelectrolytes and subsequent protein binding. Measurements of electroosmotic flow as a function of polymer MW and ionic strength were interpreted in terms of the structure of adsorbed PDADMAC. Enhancement of protein separations with treated capillaries was demonstrated. ...|$|R

These data {{and a series of}} environmental variables were used to build up a logistic regression model capable of probabilistically designating a specimen of Discoglossus found in any Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid cell of 10 km × 10 km to one of the two species.

Samples of dried coral skeleton of Favia sp. invaded by the Indo-Pacific excavating sponge Cliona orientalis Thiele, 1900 were used. The sponge tissue penetrated the 12 -mm-thick samples to approximately 10 mm. The average proportional weight of organic matter, <b>siliceous</b> spicules, calcareous <b>substrate</b> and salts {{in the entire}} samples {{was found to be}} respectively 2. 5 %, 4. 4 %, 90. 5 % and 2. 5 % of dry weight applying the LAC method, and 2. 9 %, 5. 9 %, 89. 0 % and 2. 3 % of dry weight applying the ADC method. Respective volumetric proportions of the organic matter, spicules, substrate and salts were then calculated to be 6. 4 %, 5. 5 %, 85. 2 % and 3. 0 % of volume with the LAC method, and 7. 4 %, 7. 2 %, 82. 7 % and 2. 7 % of volume with the ADC method. The LAC method showed low variability of data and is simple and fast and therefore is recommended. The ADC method generated very similar results to the LAC method. However, due to the handling involved in the ADC method, {{more than half of the}} spicules may be lost and the method is therefore not recommended unless careful data corrections are considered. In addition, the buoyant weight method was used to quantify actual substrate weight in the fresh sponge-substrate samples. This method was found to be at least 97 % effective, revealing that buoyant weights can potentially be used to quantify bioerosion rates of excavating sponges.
