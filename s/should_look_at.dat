25|$|In his speech, Pericles {{states that}} he had been emphasising the greatness of Athens in order to convey that the {{citizens}} of Athens must continue to support the war, to show them that what they were fighting for was of the utmost importance. To help make his point he stated that the soldiers who he was speaking of gave their lives to a cause to protect the city of Athens, its citizens, and its freedom. He praised Athens for its attributes that stood out amongst their neighbours such as its democracy when he elaborates that trust is justly placed on the citizens rather than relying only on the system and the policy of the city. Where citizens boast a freedom that differs from their enemies’ the Lacedaemonians. He regards the soldiers who gave their lives as truly worth of merit. That if anyone should ask, they <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> their final moments when they gave their lives to their country and that should leave no doubt {{in the mind of the}} doubtful. He explained that fighting for one’s country was a great honour, and that it was like wearing a cloak that concealed any negative implications because his imperfections would be outweighed by his merits as a citizen. He praises the soldiers for not faltering in their execution during the war. That the soldiers put aside their desires and wishes for the greater cause. Because as they are described by Pericles, Athenian citizens were distinct from the citizens of other nations – they were open minded, tolerant, and ready to understand and follow orders. Where their system of democracy allowed them to have a voice amongst those who made important decisions that would affect them. Therefore, he proceeds to point out that the greatest honour and act of valour in Athens is to live and die for freedom of the state Pericles believed was different and more special than any other neighbouring city.|$|E

500|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissent, {{with which}} Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer joined. Justice David Souter joined all {{sections}} of Stevens' dissent besides {{a critique of}} previous decision of the Supreme Court in arbitration case law. Stevens examined the history of arbitration {{and the purpose of}} it throughout the century. The Federal Arbitration Act was designed, he explained, to maintain the enforceability of contractual agreements. But private arbitration is a whole other situation. Stevens wrote, [...] "As the history of the legislation indicates, the potential disparity in bargaining power between individual employees and large employers was the source of organized labor’s opposition to the Act, which it feared would require courts to enforce unfair employment contracts". He went on to quote the former Chief Justice of the Israeli Supreme Court, Aharon Barak in supporting the idea that the Court <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the purpose of the act rather than its pure statutory language.|$|E

500|$|On 20 February 2011, {{following}} {{the publication of}} Saldanha's and Somasekhara's contradictory reports on the attacks on churches, more than 100,000 Christians representing some 45 Christian denominations and secular organisations gathered in Mangalore to protest. Present was Bishop Aloysius Paul D'Souza of Mangalore Diocese, Bishop Emeritus C. L. Furtado and Bishop John S. Sadananda of the CSI Karnataka Southern Diocese, AICC general secretary Oscar Fernandes, Bishop Lawrence Mukkuzhy of the Catholic Syro-Malabar Diocese of Belthangady, Geevarghese Mar Divannasious of the Syro-Malankara Diocese of Puttur, Diocesan Vicar-General Msgr Denis M. Prabhu; and some 24 new-generation churches united under the Karnataka Missions Network (KMN) including the Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC), Operation Mobilization Bookstall (OMB), Good News Book Centre (GNBC), All India Catholic Union (AICU), Catholic Association of South Kanara (CASK), and International Federation of Karnataka Christian Associations (IFKCA). Secular organisations participating in the protest included Udupi Jilla Alpasankhyatara Vedike (UJAV), the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), the DK District Committee, the local unit of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), and the Muslim Vartakara Sangha (VS) and Muslim Okkoota groups. The protest rally was [...] "organised {{against a backdrop of}} an apparent whitewash by the B. K. Somasekhara Commission concerning Hindu radicals and government agencies." [...] The protesters tied black cloths over their mouths and carried black flags as they walked silently for about a kilometre in one of the strongest Christian areas of the city. George Castelino, a Catholic lay leader who guided the march, stated that the black [...] "symbolised that the action of the government and its commission have silenced Christians." [...] Rev. Alwyn Culaso of the Full Gospel Church said that [...] "This is a sea of Christianity that is wounded by the attacks on the churches by the fundamental groups. The government <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the faith and patience of these people and give justice." [...] On 17 February 2011, Ronald Colaco, Chairman of IFKCA and Higher Education Minister V. S. Acharya submitted a memorandum to Yeddyurappa, demanding that the cases filed against Christian youths be dropped. Following the publications of the reports and subsequent protests, the government of Karnataka announced that it would drop 338 cases against Christians who had protested in the attacks. In December 2011, 23 cases against Christians were dropped upon request by the Karnataka Christians International and the Mangalore Diocese.|$|E

2500|$|In the UK case R. v. Gough (1993), the House of Lords {{articulated}} a [...] "real {{danger of}} bias" [...] test. According to Lord Goff of Chieveley, when formulating the appropriate test for apparent bias, it was [...] "unnecessary ... {{to require that}} the court <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the matter {{through the eyes of}} the reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man". He took the view that the test should be stated in terms of [...] "real danger rather than real likelihood to ensure that the court is thinking in terms of possibility rather than probability of bias".|$|E
2500|$|Compared {{to other}} Western and even non-Western countries, Germany {{has a low}} {{proportion}} of women in business leadership roles, lower even than Turkey, Malaysia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Botswana, India. One {{of the reasons for}} the low presence of women in key positions is the social norm that considers full-time work inappropriate for women. Especially Southern Germany is conservative regarding gender roles. In 2011, Jose Manuel Barroso, then president of the European Commission, stated [...] "Germany, but also Austria and the Netherlands, <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the example of the northern countries [...] that means removing obstacles for women, older workers, foreigners and low-skilled job-seekers to get into the workforce".|$|E
2500|$|We {{are better}} advised, writes Penelope Curtis, [...] "to {{look at what}} is sculptural within Cubism. Cubist {{painting}} is an almost sculptural translation of the external world; its associated sculpture translates Cubist painting back into a semi-reality". Attempts to separate painting and sculpture, even by 1910, are very difficult. [...] "If painters used sculpture for their own ends, so sculptors exploited the new freedom too", writes Curtis, [...] "and we <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what sculptors took from the discourse of painting and why. In the longer term we could read such developments as the beginning of a process in which sculpture expands, poaching painting's territory and then others, to become steadily more prominent in this century".|$|E

2500|$|Osborne {{suggested}} the line {{should be considered}} as part of a review of the second phase of High Speed 2. [...] Initial estimates suggested a rail line with a [...] line speed, and Leeds-Manchester journey times reduced to 30minutes, [...] Osborne estimated the cost to be less per mile than that of HS2, giving a cost of under £6 billion. Initial responses to the proposal were mixed: Jeremy Acklam of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) suggested that plans <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> connecting other northern cities; such as Liverpool, and potentially north-east England via York; commentators noted that the proposal could be viewed as an attempt to gain political support in the north of England {{in the run-up to the}} 2015 general election: The Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) characterised the proposal as a [...] "headline grabbing vanity project designed to attract votes". [...] However the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), Confederation of British Industry (CBI), and others were cautiously positive about the proposal, but emphasised the need to deliver on existing smaller-scale schemes.|$|E
2500|$|The real {{likelihood}} test centres {{on whether}} the facts, as assessed by the court, {{give rise to a}} real likelihood of bias. In R. v. Gough (1993), the House of Lords chose to state the test in terms of a [...] "real danger of bias", and emphasized that the test was concerned with the possibility, not probability, of bias. Lord Goff of Chievely also stated that [...] "the court <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the matter {{through the eyes of a}} reasonable man, because the court in cases such as these personifies the reasonable man". However, the test in Gough has been disapproved of in some Commonwealth jurisdictions. One criticism is that the emphasis on the court's view of the facts gives insufficient emphasis to the perception of the public. These criticisms were addressed by the House of Lords in Porter v. Magill (2001). The Court adjusted the Gough test by stating it to be [...] "whether the fair-minded and informed observer, having considered the facts, would conclude that there was a real possibility that the tribunal was biased". This case therefore established the current test in the UK to be one of a [...] "real possibility of bias".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2004, Putin said: [...] "It is my deep {{conviction}} that {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union was a national tragedy on a massive scale.

On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today we <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the situation in which we live. One cannot keep looking back and fretting about it: we should look forward." [...] In December 2007, he said in the interview to the Time magazine: [...] "Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best sense of that word. Incidentally, I think that to a certain extent, to a significant extent, this is also attributable to the American people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Passing: Passing, or the exchanging {{of cards}} between players, is {{optional}} and rare in Spades. However, one more common exception relates to Nil bids, which are generally considered difficult to make, {{especially when the}} bid was blindly made. To offset this difficulty slightly, a partnership in which one player has bid Nil or Blind Nil can choose to pass 2 cards between players; the most common arrangement is one card for regular nil and two cards for blind nil. When passing, the partners agree {{on a number of}} cards to pass, then select that number of cards and place them face down in front of their partner. Neither partner <b>should</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the cards passed to them before they have passed their own cards. In passing this way, the idea is for the partner who bid Nil to offload their highest trumps or other face cards in return for low cards from their partner, which both decreases the likelihood that the nil bidder can be forced to take a trick, and increases the likelihood that his partner will be able to [...] "cover", or overplay high cards the nil bidder still holds that would otherwise take a trick. The number of cards passed should be determined before the game begins so that each team can use this as they bid.|$|E
