40|$|The time {{evolution}} of the out-of-equilibrium Mott insulator is investigated numerically through calculations of space-time resolved density and entropy profiles resulting from {{the release of a}} gas of ultracold fermionic atoms from an optical trap. For adiabatic, moderate and sudden <b>switching-off</b> <b>of</b> the trapping potential, the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the Mott insulator is found to differ profoundly from that of the band insulator and the metallic phase, displaying a self-induced stability that is robust within a wide range of densities, system sizes and interaction strengths. The connection between the entanglement entropy and changes of phase, known for equilibrium situations, is found to extend to the out-of-equilibrium regime. Finally, the relation between the system's long time behavior and the thermalization limit is analyzed. Comment: 5 color figure...|$|R
