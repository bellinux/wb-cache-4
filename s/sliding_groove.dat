50|$|Unlike the Sporting Model {{from which}} it was derived, and the 1902 Military Model, who had milled <b>slide</b> <b>grooves</b> and {{checkered}} <b>slides</b> respectively, the 1903 Pocket Hammer featured <b>slide</b> <b>grooves</b> {{at the rear of}} the slide. The first pistols featured the milled pattern similar to the 1902 Sporting Models, but Colt transitioned to rear cut slides around the spring of 1905, apparently for all their automatics. This would indicate that only about 1,700 or so 1903 Pocket Hammers had the rear milled slides, making them the earliest and hardest to find of the type.|$|R
50|$|The RAMI can {{be fired}} either double or single action. The 2075 RAMI also {{features}} full length <b>slide</b> <b>grooves</b> which minimize {{play in the}} action and increases overall accuracy. The 2075 is designed with a slide lock that holds the chamber open after the last round in the magazine has been fired.|$|R
5000|$|A {{portcullis}} (from the French , [...] "sliding door") {{is a heavy}} vertically-closing gate {{typically found}} in medieval fortifications, consisting of a latticed grille made of wood, metal, {{or a combination of}} the two, which <b>slides</b> down <b>grooves</b> inset within each jamb of the gateway.|$|R
50|$|A {{sluice gate}} is {{traditionally}} a wood or metal barrier <b>sliding</b> in <b>grooves</b> that {{are set in}} {{the sides of the}} waterway. Sluice gates commonly control water levels and flow rates in rivers and canals. They are also used in wastewater treatment plants and to recover minerals in mining operations, and in watermills.|$|R
5|$|An {{observer}} was {{vulnerable to}} an enemy sniper firing a bullet through his loophole, but Hesketh-Prichard devised a metal-armoured double loophole {{that would protect}} him. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter <b>sliding</b> in <b>grooves.</b> Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them.|$|R
50|$|The 9mm model {{features}} a safety catch, which was absent on Russian-produced TT-33 handguns. Furthermore, the Model 213 features the thin <b>slide</b> grip <b>grooves,</b> {{as opposed to}} the original Russian wide-types. The 9mm model is featured with a magazine well block mounted {{in the rear of the}} magazine well to accept 9mm type magazines without frame modification.|$|R
5000|$|French: Pièce sur pièce poteaux et pièce coulissante (piece on piece <b>sliding</b> in a <b>groove),</b> pièce sur pièce en coulisse, poteaux et piece coulissante, pieces sur pieces, poiteau cannale, poteaux sur soles ...|$|R
30|$|As {{seen in the}} {{dependence}} of mica processing on load, the surface was machined by tip <b>sliding,</b> forming <b>grooves</b> at loads at or above 130 nN. The mean depth of the processed groove was 0.7 to 1.0  nm, which corresponds to the cleavage plane spacing of muscovite. To realize the processing of 1 -nm units, the processing experiment was performed with as small a load as possible.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prominent}} {{feature of the}} Model 1900 was the sight safety, which while a good idea in theory, did not work out well in execution, and proved to be unpopular. When pushed down the safety blocked the firing pin, when pushed up it performed as the rear sight. This gave an immediate visual indicator of whether the safety was on or off when one went to aim the pistol, without resorting to feeling for the safety lever. The first 1900s were equipped with rear milled <b>slide</b> <b>grooves</b> {{but when it was}} found that this could interfere with the sight safety (one could inadvertently flip the safety on or off while manipulating the slide) the milled <b>slide</b> <b>grooves</b> were moved to the front. This safety was used in about the first 3,000 production pistols. Colt then installed a conventional rear sight and eliminated the sight safety although the cut in the slide remained but was plugged. The grooves, remained {{in the front of the}} slide. There are earlier sight safety M1900s that were factory retrofitted with the new fixed sight. Although Colt considered a new firing pin safety mounted on the left side of the slide with one prototype, it did not produce such a model. This was possibly a mistake as the lack of safety features probably affected sales - the recommended way to carry a safety-less Colt automatic was with an empty chamber, requiring the user the rack the slide to chamber a round before firing - which made it slower to get in action and required two hands, as well as making it impossible to render the weapon safe after firing a partial magazine, without dropping the magazine and extracting the chambered round, itself a dangerous operation in a gun without a safety. This was a major complaint of the military when they tested it, something Colt was for some reason loath to fix in the 1900-1902-1903 series of pistols. The only exception was the new small-sized Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless, a completely new design with a grip and frame thumb safety at the start of production in 1904. It is possible that Colt found it cheaper to introduce the features into a new model, and the sales of the 1903 Pocket Hammerless were spectacular in comparison to the 1900/1902/1903 large frame automatics. By contrast, Mauser C96's and Lugers had manual thumb safeties from the outset.|$|R
50|$|A falling-block action (also {{known as}} a sliding-block or dropping-block action) is a single-shot firearm action in which a solid metal {{breechblock}} <b>slides</b> vertically in <b>grooves</b> cut into the breech of the weapon and is actuated by a lever.|$|R
50|$|Norinco, the People's Liberation Army's state weapons {{manufacturer}} in China, still manufactures a commercial {{variant of the}} Tokarev pistol chambered in the more common 9×19mm Parabellum round, known as the Tokarev Model 213, {{as well as in}} the original 7.62×25mm caliber. It features a safety catch, which was absent on Soviet-produced TT-33 handguns. Furthermore, the Model 213 features the thin <b>slide</b> grip <b>grooves,</b> as opposed to the original Russian wide-types. The 9×19mm model is featured with a magazine well block mounted in the rear of the magazine well to accept 9×19mm-type magazines without frame modification.|$|R
50|$|The microtonal tuning {{mechanism}} {{consists of a}} <b>sliding</b> bridge, a <b>groove</b> and buffers fitted to each note of the instrument. The bridge is in constant contact with the strings. If the musician slides the bridge along the groove to any point between the buffers, a precise microtonal interval change results.|$|R
50|$|A falling-block action (also {{known as}} a sliding-block action) is a single-shot firearm action in which a solid metal {{breechblock}} <b>slides</b> vertically in <b>grooves</b> cut into the breech of the weapon and actuated by a lever. Examples of firearms using the falling block action are the Sharps rifle and Ruger No. 1.|$|R
50|$|Burnishing is {{normally}} undesirable in mechanical components {{for a variety}} of reasons, sometimes simply because its effects are unpredictable. Even light burnishing will significantly alter the surface finish of a part. Initially the finish will be smoother, but with repetitive <b>sliding</b> action, <b>grooves</b> will develop on the surface along the sliding direction. The plastic deformation associated with burnishing will harden the surface and generate compressive residual stresses. Although these properties are usually advantageous, excessive burnishing leads to sub-surface cracks which cause spalling, a phenomenon where the upper layer of a surface flakes off of the bulk material.|$|R
50|$|The clausilium is a {{calcareous}} structure, tongue-shaped or spoon-shaped, {{which can}} close the aperture of the snail shell {{to protect the}} soft parts against predation by animals such as carnivorous beetle larvae. The narrow end of the clausilium <b>slides</b> in the <b>grooves</b> that are formed by the folds {{on the inside of}} the shell.|$|R
50|$|The third {{model was}} also {{produced}} as a takedown rifle, and featured a modified receiver {{that allowed the}} breech bolt to lock externally. The third model was also available in a deluxe version, which, similar to the second model, featured a fancy checkered walnut stock available in either straight or pistol grip and a <b>grooved</b> <b>slide</b> handle.|$|R
50|$|The PYa is a high-capacity, double-action, short-recoil {{semi-automatic}} pistol. Barrel/slide locking is {{a simplified}} Colt-Browning design, {{similar to that}} found in many modern pistols (for example the SIG Sauer and Glock families of pistols); the breech end of the barrel is rectangular in shape, rather than rounded, and fits into matching locking <b>grooves</b> within the <b>slide,</b> near the ejection port. The slide stop lever can be mounted {{on either side of}} the weapon to accommodate both left- and right-handed users. Likewise, the manual safety is ambidextrous, with safety catches on both sides of the weapon, where it is manipulated by the thumb. It is mounted on the frame, below the rear <b>slide</b> <b>grooves,</b> and directly behind the slide stop lever. The hammer is partially concealed at the sides to prevent catching on clothes and equipment. The magazine release catch is located in the base of the trigger guard on the left side, where it can be manipulated with the thumb (right-handed users) or index or middle finger (left-handed users). The front sight is formed as a fixed part of the slide and is non-adjustable. The back sight is drift adjustable for windage (dovetail type), but this requires a tool. Both feature white contrast elements to ease aiming in low-light conditions. The standard magazine capacity is 17 rounds, fed from a double-column, single feed magazine. Magazines with an 18 round capacity were produced after 2004.|$|R
50|$|The gun has {{an upper}} {{and a lower}} gun-carriage. The upper gun-carriage <b>slides,</b> resting on <b>grooves</b> along the rail of the lower gun-carriage. In the trail is an oil buffer, acting as a recoil brake, which {{includes}} 40 india-rubber doughnuts which were compressed when the gun was fired. After the recoil stroke the doughnuts expanded again and the barrel returned into firing position.|$|R
50|$|The second {{model was}} {{designed}} as a takedown rifle. It also had a case hardened receiver, but had an adjustable rear sight. In August 1901, the case hardened receiver was changed to a blued version. Approximately 100,000 second model rifles were produced with case hardened receivers, and 200,000 were produced with blued receivers. A deluxe version was offered, which featured a fancy checkered walnut stock available in either straight or pistol grip and a <b>grooved</b> <b>slide</b> handle.|$|R
5000|$|The Smith & Wesson Model 1913 is {{a center}} fire {{semi-automatic}} pistol introduced by Smith & Wesson in 1913. This pistol was {{also known as}} the model 35 which was produced from 1913 to 1921. Approximately 8,350 were built and this gun was chambered in the [...]35 S&W Auto cartridge. It featured smooth wooden grip panels, a fully <b>grooved</b> <b>slide</b> with crossbolt lock stud, and an ambidextrous safety that was operated with the middle finger of the shooting hand.|$|R
5000|$|As {{shown in}} the {{disassembly}} photo, the switch actuator pivots in two holes in {{the sides of the}} plastic switch body. An actuator bar <b>slides</b> in two <b>grooves</b> inside the actuator, pressed down by a compression spring into a notch in the common contact bar. The common contact bar is free to rock on a small diameter rod, welded to the common terminal. However, because of the pressure applied by the compression spring, the common contact bar will always be held against one of the two contacts.|$|R
50|$|The Coggeshall rule {{consisted}} of two rulers, each a foot (30 cm) long, which were put together in various ways. The most common and convenient arrangement was {{to have one of}} the rulers <b>slide</b> within a <b>groove</b> made along the middle of the other, like an ordinary linear slide rule, as shown in the figure below. Another form had one ruler sliding alongside the other, and a third form had a common two-foot folding ruler with a groove along one side in which a thin sliding piece was inserted that carried Coggeshall's lines.|$|R
5000|$|He also {{devised a}} metal-armoured double {{loophole}} {{that would protect}} the sniper observer from enemy fire. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter <b>sliding</b> in <b>grooves.</b> Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them. Another innovation {{was the use of}} a dummy head to find the location of an enemy sniper. The papier-mâché figures were painted to resemble soldiers to draw sniper fire. Some were equipped with rubber surgical tubing so the dummy could [...] "smoke" [...] a cigarette and thus appear realistic. Holes punched in the dummy by enemy sniper bullets then could be used for triangulation purposes to determine the position of the enemy sniper, who could then be attacked with artillery fire. He developed many of the modern techniques in sniping, including the use of spotting scopes and working in pairs, and using Kim's Game to train observational skills.|$|R
40|$|Tribological {{test was}} carried out using a pin-on-disc {{geometry}} with fabricated SKD 11 pin on bearing steel disc, under sliding in paraffin oil. Fabrication has been made with various angles and widths of crosshatch pattern. The effects of geometrical parameters on friction were mainly examined in mixed and elastohydrodynamic lubrication. The result shows that friction control could achieve by fabricating micro-grooved crosshatch pattern on contact surface. It is observed that each geometrical parameter of texture influence on friction, especially decrease of groove aspect ratio and increases of <b>groove</b> <b>sliding</b> length show friction reduction performance. Crucial parameter Gl was proposed for micro-grooved crosshatch texture...|$|R
50|$|Patellar {{luxation}} is the dislocation (slipping) of the patella (kneecap). In dogs, the patella {{is a small}} bone that shields {{the front}} of the stifle joint in its hind legs. This bone is held in place by ligaments. As the knee joint is moved, the patella <b>slides</b> in a <b>groove</b> in the femur. The kneecap may dislocate toward the inside (medial) or outside (lateral) of the leg. This condition {{may be the result of}} injury or congenital deformities (present at birth). Patellar luxation can affect either or both legs. Testing is available to predict the presence of patellar luxation in a dog.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to quantitatively {{characterize}} the appearance, stability, density, and shape of surface nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces under varying conditions such as temperature and temperature variation, gas type and concentration, surfactants, and surface treatment. The method we adopt is atomic force microscopy (AFM) operated in the tapping mode. In particular, we show (i) that nanobubbles can <b>slide</b> along <b>grooves</b> under the influence of the AFM tip, (ii) that nanobubbles can spontaneously form by substrate heating, allowing for a comparison of the surface topology with and without the nanobubble, (iii) that a water temperature increase leads to a drastic increase in the nanobubble density, (iv) that pressurizing the water with CO 2 also leads to a larger nanobubble density, but typically to smaller nanobubbles, (v) that alcohol-cleaning of the surface is crucial for the formation of surface nanobubbles, (vi) that adding 2 -butanol as surfactant leads to considerably smaller surface nanobubbles, and (vii) that flushing water over alcohol-covered surfaces strongly enhances the formation of surface nanobubbles...|$|R
2500|$|Catfish {{also have}} a sound-generating {{mechanism}} in their pectoral fins. Many species in the catfish family possess an enhanced first pectoral fin ray, called the spine, which can be moved by large abductor and adductor muscles. The base of the catfishes’ spines has a sequence of ridges, and the spine normally <b>slides</b> within a <b>groove</b> on the fish’s pelvic girdle during routine movement; but, pressing the ridges on the spine against the pelvic girdle groove creates a series of short pulses. [...] The movement is analogous to a finger moving down the teeth of a comb, and consequently a series of sharp taps is produced.|$|R
5000|$|Gun makers {{developed}} ways to {{keep the}} actions from opening too soon by [...] "locking" [...] the breech closed. Using this technique a firearm, such as the Colt [...]45 ACP Government model handgun was made which featured a grooved barrel and a <b>grooved</b> <b>slide</b> which were cammed together to prevent the breech from opening. The camming mechanism [...] "locked" [...] the breech closed until the entire barrel and slide assembly had moved far enough that the pressure in the chamber was low enough to safely unlock the breech {{during the process of}} ejecting the spent casing which was followed by loading a new loaded cartridge. [...] (This is called locked breech.) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} mechanism {{designed by}} Sebestény uses a grooved ball {{to hold the}} centre pieces in place. The edge pieces are {{held in place by}} the centres and the corners are held in place by the edges, much like the original cube. There are three mutually perpendicular grooves for the centre pieces to <b>slide</b> through. Each <b>groove</b> is only wide enough to allow one row of centre pieces to slide through it. The ball is shaped to prevent the centre pieces of the other row from sliding, ensuring that the ball remains aligned with the outside of the cube. Turning one of the centre layers moves either just that layer or the ball as well.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{shape of}} the clausilium varies from genus to genus: it can be tongue-shaped, spoon-shaped or spatula-shaped. The wide flat end of the clausilium can close the {{aperture}} of the snail shell, and thus protect the soft parts against predation by animals such as carnivorous beetle larvae. The narrow end of the clausilium <b>slides</b> in a <b>groove,</b> which is formed by spiral folds {{on the inside of}} the shell around the columella. Because the groove is long, and the muscles that control the clausilium are also long, the whole structure can be retracted into the shell. The mechanism is totally different, but the clausilium is vaguely reminiscent of an automated garage door opener.|$|R
40|$|Molecular {{recognition}} of the DNA minor groove is a multi-route process which can involve many steps before {{the formation of the}} most stable adduct. In particular, many studies have pointed out the importance of events like <b>sliding</b> along the <b>groove</b> and dissociation (which is a relevant step in the translocation among different sequences) for the affinity and the specificity of minor groove binders. In this contribution we present our recent work on the subject. Umbrella sampling and metadynamics were used to characterize mechanisms and free energy profiles of molecular recognition routes by the antitumoral agents anthramycin, duocarmycin and distamycin. Our results are in very good agreement with the available experimental data, and provide insights on the influence of factors like size, charge and flexibility on the molecular recognition process...|$|R
50|$|Petter {{designed}} a pistol which {{had some of}} the same design elements as the John Browning M1911 such as the <b>grooved</b> <b>slide</b> and barrel which interlocked and recoiled together until a pivoting link lowered the barrel, thus unlocking the assembly and further rearward movement of the barrel and slide together, which after reaching the point of greatest movement would be returned back to battery. Along the way the slide would strip a cartridge from the magazine and push it into the chamber just prior to the under barrel link forcing the barrel up into engagement with the slide, locking the action. Petter eliminated the barrel bushing and used a full length spring guide which had the effect of removing one of the elements of inaccuracy from the M1911 design and increased functional reliability.|$|R
50|$|The {{teeth of}} the {{variator}} pulley of an iCVT are formed by pins that extend from one pulley half to the other pulley half and <b>slide</b> in the <b>grooves</b> of the pulley halves of the variator pulley. Here torque from the chain is transferred to the pins and then from the pins to the pulley halves. Since the pins are round and the grooves are curved, line contact between the pins and the grooves are used to transfer force from the pins to the grooves. The amount of force that can be transmitted between two parts depend on the contact area of the two parts. Since the contact areas between the pins and their grooves are very small, the amount of force that can be transmitted between them, and hence also the torque capacity of an iCVT, is limited.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{boundary}} layer flows {{along the walls}} of wind tunnels were studied to validate the transfer of two dimensional calculations to three dimensional transonic flowfield calculations. Results from trials in various wind tunnels were examind {{to determine the effects}} of the wall boundary flow on the control surfaces of an airfoil. Models <b>sliding</b> along a <b>groove</b> in the wall of a channel at sub- and transonic speeds were examined, with the finding that with either nonuniformities in the groove, or even if the channel walls are uniform, the lateral boundary layer can cause variations in the central flow region or alter the onset of shock at the transition point. Models for the effects in both turbulence and in the absence of turbulence are formulated, and it is noted that the characteristics of individual wind tunnels must be studied to quantify any existing three dimensional effects...|$|R
60|$|The future fort {{was begun}} on {{the centre of}} the level patch of green-sward {{at the foot of the}} flat rock by the spring, where the party had {{originally}} encamped. A square was traced on the ground to indicate the stockade; and within this, Stanley marked off an oblong patch, close to the back stockade, for the principal dwelling-house, facing the river. Two other spaces were on either side of this--one for a store, the other for a dwelling for the men. When finished, the fort would thus have the form of three sides of a square surrounded by a stockade. In the centre of this, and the first thing that was erected, was a flag-staff, on which the H.B.C.--Hudson's Bay Company--flag was hoisted, and saluted with three cheers as its crimson folds fluttered out in the breeze for the first time. The plan on which the houses were constructed was that on which all the dwellings of the fur-traders are built--namely, a framework of timber, the interstices of which are filled up with logs <b>sliding</b> into <b>grooves</b> cut in the main posts and beams. This manner of building is so simple that a house can be erected without any other instruments than an axe, an auger, and a large chisel; and the speed with which it is put up would surprise those whose notions of house-building are limited to stone edifices.|$|R
5000|$|The S.E. Palace at Nimroud {{has just}} yielded a large {{collection}} of beautiful ivories, relics of a throne or furniture, &c. They {{have been fitted}} together by means of rivets, <b>slides,</b> and <b>grooves</b> - a complete Assyrian puzzle, and somewhat dangerous to sit on! Many exhibit traces of gilding and enamel, and were probably broken up for the inlaid gold and jewels {{with which they were}} once adorned. There is a decided Egypto-Assyrian character about the whole collection, perfect Egyptian heads being mixed with Assyrian Bulls and Lions. The heads were very fine indeed. Some of the articles were maces, dagger-handles, or portions of chairs and tables (for we have undoubted evidence of the Assyrians using such.) Figures back to back form a shaft, and support a flower-headed capital. There are also boxes, and a vase - all elaborately carved. The Assyrians were adepts in veneering, the layers being highly ornamented with sacred emblems and lion-hunts. Phoenician inscriptions are found on two of three articles. They were found strewed {{at the bottom of a}} chamber among wood ashes. They had escaped the flames, but are blackened from lying among smouldering wood. I have got up a horse-load of objects, and am fitting them together as fast as possible, preparatory to boiling them in gelatine. The whole room is not yet explored, as the earth must first be removed from above. I propose going down to-morrow.|$|R
