The animals were killed three at a time, every 4 h during the 24 -h span and fixed by intracardiac perfusion. In these reticulated nucleoli, the stereological analysis over a 24 -h period showed a variation dependent on the time of killing for the two parameters investigated, the mean nucleolar volume, Vnu, and the mean volume of the fibrillar centres, Vfc(nu). The minimal value occurred at 0300 h (dark span) and the maximal one at 0700 h (at the onset of the light <b>span).</b> <b>Between</b> these two <b>extreme</b> <b>values,</b> Vnu increased 1 - 8 -fold and Vfc(nu) 5 - 3 -fold. These data are compared with a previous description from our laboratory of circadian rhythm in nucleoli of sympathetic neurons of superior cervical ganglion in the same animals.

The measures and estimators capture extremal dependence decay over time and can be re-scaled to provide robust estimators of canonical conditional tail probability and tail copula notions of tail dependence. Unlike extant o¤erings, the tests obtain asymptotic power of one against infinitessimal deviations from tail independence. Further, the estimators apply to dependent, heterogeneous processes with or without extremal dependence and irrespective of non-extremal properties and joint distribution specifications.

40|$|Offshore {{structures}} {{are exposed to}} random wave loading in the ocean environment and hence the probability distribution of the <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> of their response to wave loading is required for their safe and economical design. To this end, the conventional (Monte Carlo) time simulation technique (CTS) is frequently used for predicting the probability distribution of the <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> of response. However, this technique suffers from excessive sampling variability and hence {{a large number of}} simulated extreme responses (hundreds of simulated response records) are required to reduce the sampling variability to acceptable levels. A more efficient version of the time simulation technique (ETS) was recently introduced which takes advantage of the correlation <b>between</b> the <b>extreme</b> surface elevations and their corresponding extreme responses by dividing the simulated extreme responses into a number of groups based on the magnitude of their associated extreme surface elevations. The probability distribution of response <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> for each group is then calculated individually based on {{a relatively small number of}} simulations, and then the total probability theorem is used to derive the probability distribution of response <b>extreme</b> <b>values.</b> The ETS procedure is found to be many times more efficient than the CTS method.

In this paper, a more efficient version of the ETS technique is introduced which takes advantage of the correlation <b>between</b> <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> of the nonlinear response and their corresponding linear response <b>extreme</b> <b>values</b> (both quasi-static and dynamic linear responses are considered)).
