40|$|We {{presented}} a finite-element-based algorithm to simulate plane-strain, <b>straight</b> <b>hydraulic</b> fractures in an impermeable elastic medium. The algorithm acCOllllts for the nonlinear coupling between the fluid {{pressure and the}} crack opening and separately tracks {{the evolution of the}} crack tip and the fluid front. It therefore allows the existence of a fluid lag. The fluid front is advanced explicitly in time, but an implicit strategy is needed for the crack tip to guarantee the satisfaction of Griffith's criterion at each time step. We enforced the coupling between the fluid and the rock by simultaneously solving for the pressure field in the fluid and the crack opening at each time step. We provided verification of our algorithm by performing sample simulations and comparing them with two known similarity solutions. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} method for computing unsteady flow conditions in liquid-filled flow systems is developed. The method {{which is called}} the wave plan incorporates distributed parameter and nonlinear effects including the effects of viscous resistance. The wave plan is essentially a solution synthesized {{from the effects of}} incremental step pressure pulses. The pressure pulses are generated because of incremental flow-rate changes that originate in a hydraulic system from a variety of sources, including the mechanical motion of the system structure. The pressure pulses propagate throughout the system at sonic velocity and are partially transmitted and reflected at each discontinuity. The velocity change caused by each pressure pulse is obtained from the Joukowski relation. Pressure and velocity time histories at any point in the system are obtained by a timewise summation of the contributions of the incremental pressure pulses passing that point. The analysis is presented in a form general enough to be applied to a variety of hydraulic systems. To illustrate the application of the method to a specific system, the response of a <b>straight</b> <b>hydraulic</b> line to a sinusoidal orifice-area variation of an upstream valve is computed. Both a constant-cross- section line and a tapered line are analyzed in the examples, and various nonlinear effects evaluated. Comparisons are carried out with experimental data obtained for the constant-diameter line and good agreement is shown to exist...|$|E
40|$|Groynes are {{man-made}} hydraulic structures {{constructed for}} a variety of purposes. They extend outside the bank in the depth of streams. Local scour usually occurs around groynes resulting in problems of interest to hydraulic engineers. In this study laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the local scour around different number of groynes distributed on different spacing with different shapes. Physical models have been developed for groynes installed in a <b>straight</b> <b>hydraulic</b> channel grounded with uniform cohesionless soil as bed material with medium grain size d 50 0. 69 mm. The experiments were conducted under subcritical flow and Clear- water conditions. Three different numbers of groynes single double and triple were used to indicate the impact of the numbers on the local scour such impact have been observed to be as reverse relationship specially for the intermediate groynes. Different spacing between groynes as 1 1. 5 and 2 times the length of groynes were used in this study. For the range tested it has been observed that for each spacing decrease by 0. 5 Lg there was a decrease in scour depth about 20. Also several lengths of groynes 13 10 and 7 cm were used and it has been observed that scour depth is decreased about 20 - 53 by decreasing the ratio of groyne length to main flow width LgB by 7. 5. Two different shapes of curved groynes namely as quadrant quarter of a cylinder and semi-parabolic shaped groynes were used to indicate the effect of groyne shape on the local scour. Generally scour is decreased about 75 in quadrant shape groynes as compared with that of semi-parabolic shape groynes...|$|E
40|$|The {{attenuation}} constant for sinusoidal pressure and flow perturbations superimposed on the laminar flow of a viscous liquid {{was measured in}} a system consisting of a long, <b>straight,</b> cylindrical <b>hydraulic</b> line. The upstream and downstream ends of the line were securely fastened t o the ground. A sinusoidal perturbation was imposed on the mean flow at the upstream end {{by means of a}} s m a l l oscillation of a throttle valve abmt a partly open mean position. The downstream end was terminated in a restricting orifice. Pressure perturbations were measured at three locations along the line for frequencies from 15 t o 100 cps. These pressure measurements were reduced by use of a pair of complex damped acoustic one-dimensional wave equations to obtain the {{attenuation constant}} along with the phase constant and the dimensionless downstream admittance. For the range of frequencies investigated, the experimental values of the attenuation constant are in good agreement with classical theory...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{branches}} of the Paraná delta is the Paraná de las Palmas River. This branch doesn’t have the biggest discharge but has the most navigation. The situation in the Paraná de las Palmas isn’t without problems though; the river banks show erosion over the whole length of the branch. This erosion has been investigated by the following research questions: - What are the contributions of the different erosion agents to the total erosion rate of the river banks along the Paraná de las Palmas River? - What kind of measures can be taken to decrease the erosion rate, and what are the effects of the different measures? Although the bank erosion occurs in the whole river branch, in answering the research questions, a smaller study area is defined between km 81 and km 90 of the river branch (measured from Buenos Aires), close to the city of Campana. This study area contains one bend and one <b>straight</b> river section. <b>Hydraulic</b> EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{may have a}} {{noticeable}} impact on the northern environment, leading to changes in permafrost, vegetation and fluvial morphology. In this paper we compare the results from three geomorphological models and study the potential effects of changing climatic factors on the river channel types in North-European Russia. Two of the selected models by Romashin [Romashin, V. V., 1968. Variations of the river channel types under governing factors, Annals of the Hydrological Institute, vol. 155. Hydrometeoizdat, Leningrad, pp. 56 - 63. ] and Leopold and Wolman [Leopold, L. B., Wolman, M. G., 1957. River channel pattern: braided, meandering and <b>straight,</b> Physiographic and <b>hydraulic</b> studies of rivers. USA Geological Survey Professional Paper 252, pp. 85 - 98. ] are conventional QS-type models, which predict the existence of either multi-thread or single-tread channel types using data on discharge and channel slope. The more advanced model by Van den Berg [Van den Berg, J. H., 1995. Prediction of alluvial channel pattern of perennial rivers. Geomorphology 12, 259 - 270. ] {{takes into account the}} size of the sediment material. We used data from 16 runoff gauges to validate the models and predict the channel types at selected locations under modern and predicted for the future climatic conditions. Two of the three models successfully replicated the currently existing channel types in {{all but one of the}} studied sites. Predictive calculations under the hypothetical scenarios of 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 35 % runoff increase gave different results. Van den Berg's model predicted potential transformation of the channel types, from single- to multi-thread, at 4 of 16 selected locations in the next few decades, and at 5 locations by the middle of the 21 st century. Each of the QS-type models predicted such transformation at one site only. Results of the study indicate that climatic warming in combination with other environmental changes may lead to transformation of the river channel types at selected locations in north-western Russia. Further efforts are needed to improve the performance of the fluvial geomorphological models and their ability to predict such changes. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
