40|$|West Nile is an {{important}} novel virus in the United States, having spread rapidly since it was first detected in New York in 1999. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{as well as many}} State Health Departments, have mandated programs for surveillance of West Nile Virus activity. These programs incorporate many different aspects including existing arboserology programs with additional testing for West Nile Virus and new plans that incorporate active and passive surveillance methods. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine all aspects of the Florida West Nile surveillance program to determine if there was transmission in the animal systems prior to human cases. The predictive analyses were done using regional data graphs, spatial information, correlations and regression models. Data for sentinel chickens, bird necropsy and mosquito pool surveillance from participating counties in Florida were obtained from the State of Florida surveillance database. The human data was obtained from the State of Florida reportable disease database for each county whether participating in the state surveillance programs or not. Clinical cases were examined by demographics (gender and age) and an incidence rate was calculated to demonstrate the effects of disease. Specific statistical methods used included Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s coefficient correlation, Poisson distribution regression modeling to show if any of the surveillance systems were predictors for human disease. The incidence rate analysis for clinical cases showed clustering of cases in adjacent counties within a region where Florida 2 ̆ 7 s panhandle and adjacent counties northeast had the highest incidence. Florida 2 ̆ 7 s central and southern regions had moderate human incidence. This provides useful information in transmission geography for prevention and control measures. Demographic analysis showed that there were twice as many males than females diagnosed with West Nile in Florida, this was true across the groups as well. The highest number of cases was seen within the age group over 55 years of age for West Nile Neuroinvasive Disease and for West Nile Fever the highest number of cases was within the 36 - 54 age range. The temporal distribution was determined using graphical representations of all of the <b>surveillance</b> <b>types</b> and clinical cases. In order to include all relevant data, the temporality was set from week 20 to week 52. This study found that all of the <b>surveillance</b> <b>types</b> (dead birds, mosquitoes and sentinels) offered a specialized strength for predicting clinical cases. However, mosquitoes proved to be the least efficient out of the three surveillance systems. The regional and spatial analysis showed that positive dead birds and sentinels provided the coverage for the surveillance systems in the state. However, Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient was low for sentinel surveillance; this may be due to higher participation showing West Nile Virus activity in areas (especially rural) that have no reported human cases. This analysis did show that West Nile is detected in mosquito pool samples before it is detected in the dead bird or sentinel surveillance systems which provides an earlier warning for human cases. The Poisson distribution regression model was only useful for the pooled years and 2003. These showed that mosquitoes, positive dead birds and sentinels were good predictors for clinical cases for the combined years and dead birds and sentinels were significant for 2003 as well. The recommendations based on the results from this study would be to continue all the current surveillance efforts but with the following enhancements: 1. Increase the coverage and consistency of submissions for all <b>surveillance</b> <b>types.</b> 2. Set standard levels of participation for all counties based on the regional analyses and populations at risk. 3. Create standardized approaches for sampling, shipping and submitting samples (especially for mosquito pool submissions) and require that participating counties adhere to these standards. 4.

Data collection spanned {{the period of}} relocation of Brisbane Women’s from Annerley to Wacol, from a traditional lock-and-key establishment to a keyless unit. This study investigated inmate women’s accounts of education using interview data and analysis of policy. While the study drew upon feminist criminology theory and conversation analysis to provide a theoretical dialogue for investigating prison education, this paper investigates more broadly five key themes. They are categorised as a culture of containment and <b>surveillance,</b> <b>types</b> of education, access to education, pedagogical issues {{and the role of}} support groups in education. Women’s prisons and their rituals have been constructed by men for men, sometimes with concessions made for women and criminal laws have been drawn with reference to the way that men define women and perpetuate the dependence of women on more powerful male others. The structural and interactional features of oral texts such as interviews were examined to understand the educational experiences of women inmates. The research found that women’s involvement in prison education is framed by a culture of containment and surveillance. In the keyless prison, heightened electronic security reported increases in internal body searches and routinized head counts were found to exacerbate the difficulties women inmates experience in prison education.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a method for}} evaluation of surveillance for avian influenza (AI) in wild birds and compares surveillance activities before and after changes in surveillance strategy in Great Britain (GB). In October 2008 the AI Wild Bird Surveillance (AIWBS) system in GB was modified to focus on passive surveillance (birds found dead), including those found during warden patrols of wetlands and wildlife reserves, with less emphasis on public reporting of birds found dead. The number of birds sampled by active surveillance (birds live-trapped or shot) was also reduced. In the present study {{the impact of these}} changes was investigated by comparing the 12 mo prior to October 2008 with the subsequent 12 mo. Four factors were considered for each surveillance system component: 1) the number of wild birds tested; 2) whether the tested wild birds were considered "higher risk species" (HRS) for being infected with AI; 3) the location of the birds tested with respect to counties designated as a priority for surveillance; and 4) the probability that the birds tested might yield a positive AI virus result based on surveillance results in wild birds across Europe. The number of birds tested by both <b>surveillance</b> <b>types</b> was greatly reduced after the strategy change. The proportion of birds sampled in priority counties also significantly decreased in the second year for both active and passive surveillance. However, the proportion of HRS sampled by active surveillance significantly increased, while a significant decrease in these species was seen for passive surveillance in the second year. The derived probability scores for detecting AI based on European surveillance results indicated a reduction in sensitivity for H 5 N 1 highly pathogenic AI detection by passive surveillance. The methods developed to evaluate AIWBS in GB may be applicable to other European Union countries. The results also reflect the complex issues associated with evaluation of disease surveillance in wildlife populations in which the disease ecology is only partially understood...|$|E

40|$|To date, {{investigation}} and policy development relating to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) have focused largely on describing patterns {{of resistance to}} individual antimicrobials, often from restricted data sources. What this approach fails to accommodate is the complexity of AMR, such as genetic linkage of resistance determinants, which could potentially lead to inaccurate inference. Novel approaches are therefore required to bring new perspectives on the epidemiology of AMR. These studies take an ecological perspective of AMR, examining several key issues: The relative contribution to AMR from animal and human populations; the potential differences between passive and active surveillance of AMR; the associations of age, antimicrobial treatment and a shared environment with AMR diversity; the relationships between AMR phenotype and genotype; and exploring the additional information provided by DNA sequencing data. Novel ecological and epidemiological approaches were developed to examine long-term passive surveillance data of AMR in Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 (DT 104) isolates from concurrently sampled and sympatric human and animal populations in Scotland. By examining the diversity and the phenotypic and temporal relatedness of the resistance profiles, the most likely source of resistance was assessed. The conclusions were that whilst ecologically connected, animals and humans have distinguishable DT 104 communities, differing in prevalence, linkage, and diversity. Furthermore, the sympatric animal population {{is unlikely to be}} the major source of resistance for human DT 104. As robust data are critical to any analysis, the potential differences between data collected by different <b>surveillance</b> <b>types</b> were examined. These systems are not generally designed to detect emerging resistances. The diversity of phenotypic AMR from passive and active surveillance data of poultry Salmonella Heidelberg and swine Salmonella Typhimurium var. 5 - isolates derived from animals and foods-of-animal origin were contrasted to assess their suitability for detecting emerging resistance patterns. Results indicated that active and passive surveillance approaches were potentially sampling from distinguishable microbiological communities and are therefore complementary, and that passive surveillance is better at detecting rare profiles. The ecological and epidemiological approach was also applied to a different organism, in a different ecosystem. In order to assess the association of age and antimicrobial exposure with AMR diversity, E. coli from cows and calves on seven dairy farms were examined. There were distinguishable populations of resistance phenotypes on the farms, associated with both age and treatment. Multivariable models were developed to examine simultaneously the association of age, treatment, time, and farm with AMR diversity. These results indicated that there may be particular animal husbandry or farm management practices which influence AMR diversity, and which appear to be different for co-habiting young and adult dairy cattle. The majority of AMR data collected by surveillance systems are phenotypic in nature. However, it is often the underlying genotype that is of interest, which until now could only be achieved with the application of molecular methods. A novel latent class Bayesian model was developed to infer the prevalence of various AMR determinants in a population given a sample of phenotypes, which was applied to animal and human DT 104 data. Differences were demonstrated in the estimated prevalences of a number of AMR determinants between the two populations, further supporting the previous observations that the epidemiologies of the organism, the resistance determinants, or both, are distinguishable. To obtain a greater resolution with which to compare AMR in different populations, a second-generation sequencing platform was used to obtain DNA sequencing data from select animal and human DT 104 isolates. The objectives were to determine the diversity of the bacteria and of the resistance determinants. Whilst analysis of the resistance determinants is ongoing, preliminary results have suggested that the subtypes of DT 104 infecting animals and humans are indeed similar. Overall, these studies comprise application of novel methods and frameworks for the analysis of AMR. The implication of these studies is that greater and more explicit thought is needed regarding the design, collection, analysis, and interpretation of AMR data properly to inform policy...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUpper {{urinary tract}} urothelial {{carcinoma}} (UTUC) {{is a rare}} disease, which means there are little evidence-based data available to guide clinical decision-making. Although {{diagnosis and treatment of}} UTUC have improved significantly over the last 5 years, accurate risk stratification remains a challenge owing to the difficulty of clinical staging. A number of potential prognostic factors have been identified, encompassing clinical characteristics, pathological factors and molecular markers. Tumor stage and lymph node status are the most important predictors of survival in patients with UTUC. Preoperative evaluation for hydronephrosis can identify patients at risk of non-organ-confined disease. In the subgroup of patients with stage ≥pT 2 disease, a longer interval between diagnosis and radical nephroureterectomy is associated with a higher risk of disease recurrence and cancer-specific mortality. Extensive tumor necrosis, sessile tumor architecture and lymphovascular invasion are independent predictors of clinical outcomes for patients with UTUC treated with radical nephroureterectomy.

We divided the prognostic factors for UTUC in four different categories: clinical factors, preoperative characteristics, intraoperative/surgical factors, and postoperative/pathologic factors. Prognostic factors described in order of importance are tumor stage and grade, lymph node involvement, a concomitantcis, age at the diagnostic, lymphovascular invasion, tumor architecture and necrosis, tumor location and multifocality, gender.

A statistical {{model of the}} multipath channel {{in the form of}} the signal return and noise characterization is derived, and utilized to distinguish signal components from noise. The algorithm then uses multiple signal receptions at each base station, to differentiate between line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS components, and accurately estimate the LOS position in the received multipath signal. The location is estimated through a mathematical programming problem formulation. Using a synthesized bandwidth (BW) of 2 GHz, a 4 -bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and with 5 - 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), range estimation with sub-meter accuracy is achieved.

It included 106 surveillance stations of the animal disease epidemiological surveillance network in Chad distributed randomly into 52 stations of active surveillance and 54 stations of passive surveillance. Nine diseases of various vaccination and expected prevalence status were monitored. The active surveillance stations carried out four herd visits monthly to look for the diseases under surveillance and organised four farmers awareness-raising meetings to stimulate them to make disease notifications. The passive surveillance stations held each month four farmer awareness-raising meetings. The suspicions recorded by the stations were consigned to a suspicion form specific to each disease, indicating whether a call from the farmer, a visit to the herd or a awareness-raising meeting was the source. The results showed that, irrespective of <b>surveillance</b> <b>type,</b> all diseases under surveillance, except the rare diseases (Rinderpest and Rift Valley fever) were reported by the surveillance agents. However, suspicions recorded following farmer calls are significantly more important than suspicions carried out during herd visits or meetings.

Finally approximately 83 % of the herd visits realised by the active surveillance stations showed negative results (no suspicion identified).

The incidence of GRAB in the ICU increased from 1. 26 cases per 1000 occupied bed days (OBDs) for January to June 1993, to 6. 62 per 1000 OBDs for July to December 1993 (Chi square = 4. 8, P < 0. 05), confirming {{the existence of an}} outbreak. For the two year period, 1993 and 1994, a total of 45 cases of GRAB infection or colonisation was identified. Males and females were equally represented, with an age range of 16 - 79 years and a mean age of 51 years. Admitting diagnoses varied, with multiple trauma and head injury predominating (ten cases). For 35 of the 45 cases the initial site of GRAB isolation was sputum or other respiratory tract specimen. Specific treatment for GRAB was initiated in 23 patients, however no deaths were directly attributable to GRAB infection. The period of time between admission to the ICU and first isolation of GRAB ranged from three to 70 days with a median of nine days. Overall, ten (11 %) of 91 staff hand samples and one of 37 (3 %) environmental samples yielded GRAB. All GRAB isolates produced similar biochemical profiles and antibiotic resistance patterns, except for a group of five which were ciprofloxacin resistant. Thirty patient isolates, all ten staff hand isolates and the environmental isolate produced identical REA patterns. The remaining five patient isolates (all ciprofloxacin resistant) which were available for typing produced a different REA pattern. Our study has documented a moderate-sized outbreak of GRAB in an ICU setting. Typing of isolates using REA was useful in delineating outbreak strains. Carriage of GRAB on staff hands was demonstrated as the most-likely source of infection. Despite institution of infection control measures GRAB now appears endemic in the ICU...|$|R
25|$|In September 2002, Roark {{and three}} former NSA officials, William Binney, J. Kirk Wiebe, and Ed Loomis, filed a DoD Inspector General report {{regarding}} problems at NSA, including Trailblazer. Drake {{was a major}} source for the report, and gave information to DoD during its investigation of the matter. Roark tried to notify her superior, then-Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Porter Goss. She also attempted to contact William Rehnquist, the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court at the time. In addition, Roark {{made an effort to}} inform Vice President Dick Cheney's legal counsel David Addington, who had been a Republican staff colleague of hers on the committee in the 1980s. Addington was later revealed by a Washington Post report to be the author of the controlling legal and technical documents for the Bush administration's warrantless <b>surveillance</b> program, <b>typing</b> the documents on a Tempest-shielded computer across from his desk in room 268 of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and storing them in a vault in his office. Roark got no response from all three men.|$|R
40|$|Epithelial cells {{line body}} surface tissues {{and provide a}} {{physicochemical}} barrier to the external environment. Frequent microbial and non-microbial challenges such as those imposed by mechanical disruption, injury or exposure to noxious environmental substances including chemicals, carcinogens, ultraviolet-irradiation or toxins cause activation of epithelial cells with release of cytokines and chemokines as well as alterations in the expression of cell surface ligands. Such display of epithelial stress is rapidly sensed by tissue resident immunocytes, which can directly interact with self-moieties on epithelial cells and initiate both local and systemic immune responses. Epithelial cells are thus key drivers of immune surveillance at body surface tissues. However, epithelial cells have a propensity to drive type 2 immunity (rather than type 1) upon non-invasive challenge or stress – a type of immunity whose regulation and function still remain enigmatic. Here we review the induction and possible role of type 2 immunity in epithelial tissues and propose that rapid immune <b>surveillance</b> and <b>type</b> 2 immunity are key regulators of tissue homeostasis and carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The {{epidemiologic}} typing {{of bacterial}} pathogens {{can be applied}} to answer a number of different questions: in case of outbreak, what is the extent and mode of transmission of epidemic clone(s) ? In case of long-term surveillance, what is the prevalence over time and the geographic spread of epidemic and endemic clones in the population? A number of molecular typing methods can be used to classify bacteria based on genomic diversity into groups of closely-related isolates (presumed to arise from a common ancestor in the same chain of transmission) and divergent, epidemiologically-unrelated isolates (arising from independent sources of infection). Ribotyping, IS-RFLP fingerprinting, macrorestriction analysis of chromosomal DNA and PCR-fingerprinting using arbitrary sequence or repeat element primers are useful methods for outbreak investigations and regional <b>surveillance.</b> Library <b>typing</b> systems based on multilocus sequence-based analysis and strain-specific probe hybridization schemes are in development for the international surveillance of major pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Accurate epidemiological interpretation of data obtained with molecular typing systems still requires additional research on the evolution rate of polymorphic loci in bacterial pathogens...|$|R
