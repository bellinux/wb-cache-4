50|$|Gyratory {{equipment}} is divided to a {{top and a}} bottom unit. The unit on top consists of screening frames supported with rugged <b>springs</b> <b>attached</b> to the circular base, which allows free vibration of the top unit. Secondary support <b>springs</b> are <b>attached</b> to for heavy duty operation, preventing the vibration of the top unit from reaching the floor. The base of the machine (bottom unit) consists of top and bottom eccentric weights attached to a heavy duty motor. Minimum energy is consumed with the installation of double extended shafts on the motors, which are attached to both {{the top and bottom}} eccentric weights. Screen decks can be mounted on top of another within the machine assembly with spacing frames connected together via stainless steel quick release clamps.|$|R

50|$|The {{shaft of}} the anchor, called the crutch {{ends in a}} fork which embraces the shaft of the pendulum, giving it {{transverse}} impulses. The pendulum rod is hung from a short straight suspension <b>spring</b> <b>attached</b> to a sturdy support directly behind the anchor. The pivot of the anchor is aligned with the bending point of the spring. This arrangement results in a more stable pendulum support than simply suspending the pendulum directly from the anchor.|$|E
50|$|A balance spring, or hairspring, is a <b>spring</b> <b>attached</b> to {{the balance}} wheel in {{mechanical}} timepieces. It causes the balance wheel to oscillate with a resonant frequency when the timepiece is running, which controls {{the speed at}} which the wheels of the timepiece turn, and thus the rate of movement of the hands. A regulator lever is often fitted, which can be used to alter the free length of the spring and thereby adjust the rate of the timepiece.|$|E

This method is widely employed by hobbyists to produce foam cores for model airplane wings.|$|R
50|$|As an {{original}} invention for the clarinette à anneaux mobiles, Buffet utilized needle springs {{in order to}} control the opening and closing of keys mounted on axles. Needle springs are mounted on posts screwed directly into the wooden body of the clarinet and are used for all keys other than those with extremely short pivoting axles, which continue to make use of simple leaf <b>springs</b> <b>attached</b> longitudinally to the underside of each separate key. This is the method of operation of the keys on pre-Boehm woodwind instruments.|$|R

50|$|Since it is {{the slave}} {{pendulum}} that releases the gravity lever, this synchronization {{is vital to the}} functioning of the clock. The synchronizing mechanism used a small <b>spring</b> <b>attached</b> to the shaft of the slave pendulum and an electromagnetic armature that would catch the spring if the slave pendulum was running slightly late, thus shortening the period of the slave pendulum for one swing. The slave pendulum was adjusted to run slightly slow, such that on approximately every other synchronization pulse the spring would be caught by the armature.|$|E

50|$|A pair of {{independent}} treadle mechanisms collected {{power from the}} rider's legs instead of a crank. Power from each treadle {{was transferred to the}} rear wheel by a leather strap over a ratchet mechanism. (See image in gallery below.) The attachment point of the leather strap could be moved to provide multiple gear ratios, and both treadles could be pressed simultaneously for a brief increase in torque. A <b>spring</b> <b>attached</b> to the ratchet rewound the strap when the foot was raised. This treadle arrangement also allowed riders of different sizes to ride the same bike comfortably without modification, as the pedals were not constrained to trace a circle about an axle.|$|E
40|$|This {{study shows}} the optimum {{attachment}} of Two-Way Shape Memory Alloy (TWSMA) springs onto thermal liner and its sewing method {{for the mass}} production of fire fighter's intelligent turnout gear. SMA <b>springs</b> were <b>attached</b> to the fabric by four different methods and stitched by two different shapes (square and wave). The durability of the <b>attached</b> <b>springs</b> was tested by laundering up to 50 cycles. Examined were whether the <b>springs</b> would remain <b>attached</b> to the fabric after repeated laundering, the shape memory effect and reaction of the springs, and the anti-corrosiveness of the springs. A Human-Clothing-Environ-ment simulator evaluated thermal insulation according to attachment methods, air layer volume, and stitch types. The findings showed that silicon <b>attached</b> <b>springs</b> remained intact after repeated laundering; in addition, repeated laundering did not influence the responsiveness and anti-corrosiveness of SMAs. Air volume had positive relations with the insulation. Attachment methods or stitch methods had limited impact on the thermal insulation.

50|$|The Hotchkiss drive, {{invented by}} Albert Hotchkiss, {{was the most}} popular rear {{suspension}} system used in American cars from the 1930s to the 1970s. The system uses longitudinal leaf <b>springs</b> <b>attached</b> both forward and behind the differential of the live axle. These springs transmit the torque to the frame. Although scorned by many European car makers of the time, it was accepted by American car makers because it was inexpensive to manufacture. Also, the dynamic defects of this design were suppressed by the enormous weight of US passenger vehicles before implementation the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard.|$|R
50|$|The {{golden age}} of the stagecoach was during the Regency period, from 1800 to 1830. The era saw great {{improvements}} {{in the design of}} the coaches, notably by John Besant in 1792 and 1795. His coach had a greatly improved turning capacity and braking system, and a novel feature that prevented the wheels from falling off while the coach was in motion. Obadiah Elliott registered the first patent for a spring-suspension vehicle. Each wheel had two durable steel leaf springs on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the <b>springs</b> <b>attached</b> to the axles.|$|R
