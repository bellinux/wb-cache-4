5|$|The nickel-based <b>superalloys</b> have {{improved}} creep strength {{with the addition}} of rhenium. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium. Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the F-15 and F-16, whereas the newer single-crystal third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. Rhenium is also used in the <b>superalloys,</b> such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause <b>superalloys</b> to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP (topologically close packed) phases. In 4th- and 5th-generation <b>superalloys,</b> ruthenium is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new <b>superalloys</b> are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174.|$|E
5|$|Most {{high-strength}} steel alloys (for example, 41xx steels) contain 0.25% to 8% molybdenum. Even in these small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used {{each year in}} stainless steels, tool steels, cast irons, and high-temperature <b>superalloys.</b>|$|E
5|$|Out of 44,500 tonnes of niobium mined in 2006, an {{estimated}} 90% {{was used in}} high-grade structural steel. The second largest application is <b>superalloys.</b> Niobium alloy superconductors and electronic components account for a very small share of the world production.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the inner quality of <b>superalloy</b> master alloy ingots, the new {{technology}} of <b>superalloy</b> vacuum-electromagnetic casting, i. e. applying electromagnetic stirring (EMS) to the solidification process of <b>superalloy</b> vacuum casting was developed. The effect of EMS on the inner quality of IN 100 <b>superalloy</b> ingots was studied with EPMA and optical microscope. The results show that while an EMS with 50 Hz frequency and 60 A current is imposed, the equiax crystals of IN 100 <b>superalloy</b> ingots can be effectively refined and increased, and the central shrinkage porosity and the dendritic segregation of IN 100 <b>superalloy</b> ingots are greatly reduced, so the inner quality of IN 100 <b>superalloy</b> ingots is obviously improved...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the transmission and the {{scanning electron microscope}} investigations of thin foils of Ni-Al-Сr-based <b>superalloy,</b> which is obtained by the directional crystallization technique. This <b>superalloy</b> contains γ′- and γ-phases. Additionally, lanthanum is introduced in the <b>superalloy</b> in 0. 015, 0. 10 and 0. 30 wt % concentrations. The <b>superalloy</b> specimens are then subjected to 1273 K annealing during 10 and 25 h. It is shown that γ′-phase is major. In the <b>superalloy,</b> lanthanides La 2 Ni 3 and Al 2 La are detected along with carbide La 2 C 3 particles located on dislocations of the major phase. The amount of phases in the <b>superalloy</b> depends on its thermal treatment and lanthanum concentration. The investigations include the effect of annealing on scalar density of dislocations in γ′-phase. It is demonstrated that lanthanum alloying modifies the preferred orientation of γ′-phase. Annealing of lanthanum-alloyed <b>superalloy</b> causes the orientation dispersion. In γ′-phase, the correlation is observed between the degree of heterogeneity of solid solution and scalar dislocation density. It is shown that this heterogeneity results {{in the formation of}} high-density dislocations in γ′-phase...|$|R

The availability of mathematical model {{was approved by the}} experiments of the IN 100 <b>superalloy.</b> The experimental results indicate that the feeding capacity of melt in vacuum casting can be greatly increased by imposing the 50 Hz, 60 A rotating electromagnetic stirring, which can decrease the central shrinkage cavity in <b>superalloy</b> ingots, so the quality of the <b>superalloy</b> ingots can be wide-range improved...|$|R
5|$|Rhenium {{is added}} to {{high-temperature}} <b>superalloys</b> {{that are used to}} make jet engine parts, using 70% of the worldwide rhenium production. Another major application is in platinum–rhenium catalysts, which are primarily used in making lead-free, high-octane gasoline.|$|E
5|$|About 86% of {{molybdenum}} produced {{is used in}} metallurgy, {{with the}} rest used in chemical applications.

5|$|Quantities of niobium {{are used}} in nickel-, cobalt-, and iron-based <b>superalloys</b> in {{proportions}} as great as 6.5% for such applications as jet engine components, gas turbines, rocket subassemblies, turbo charger systems, heat resisting, and combustion equipment. Niobium precipitates a hardening γ-phase within the grain structure of the superalloy.|$|E
40|$|The temperature-dependent {{engineering}} elastic constants of a {{directionally solidified}} nickel-base <b>superalloy</b> were estimated from the single-crystal elastic constants of nickel and MAR-MOO 2 <b>superalloy</b> by using Wells' method. In this method, the directionally solidified (columnar-grained) nickel-base <b>superalloy</b> was modeled as a transversely isotropic material, {{and the five}} independent elastic constants of the transversely isotropic material were determined from the three independent elastic constants of a cubic single crystal. Solidification for both the single crystals and the directionally solidified <b>superalloy</b> {{was assumed to be}} along the (001) direction. Temperature-dependent Young's moduli in longitudinal and transverse directions, shear moduli, and Poisson's ratios were tabulated for the directionally solidified nickel-base <b>superalloy.</b> These engineering elastic constants could be used as input for performing finite element structural analysis of directionally solidified turbine engine components...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Fracture {{morphology}} {{analysis is}} an important way to understand material fracture process, find the reason of fracture and improve its performance. Nickel based powder metallurgy(P/M) <b>superalloy</b> {{is an important}} material which is widely used in the modern aeronautic and astronautic industry. In {{order to determine the}} fracture characteristic morpholgies and mechanisms of the P/M <b>superalloy</b> fractured at different conditions, the fracture surfaces of the high temperature low cycle fatigue，high cycle fatigue, high-low cycle complex fatigue, tension and creep specimens from the P/M <b>superalloy</b> were studied by scanning electron microscopy and stereo-microscopy. The mechanisms and influencing factors of high temperature fatigue crack initiation and propagation were emphatically analyzed, and creep and tension fracture mechanisms of the P/M <b>superalloy</b> were also discussed. The application of the fracture surface analysis for the fracture failure analysis of the P/M <b>superalloy</b> turbine disk were introduced finally...|$|R
40|$|The impact {{properties}} of copper, copper- 10 nickel, and a <b>superalloy</b> matrix reinforced with tungsten fibers were studied. In {{most cases the}} following increased composite impact strength: increased fiber or matrix toughness, decreased fiber-matrix reaction, increased test temperature, hot working and heat treatment. Notch sensitivity was reduced by increasing fiber or matrix toughness. The effect of fiber content depended on the relative toughness of the fibers and matrix. Above 530 K a 60 volume per cent <b>superalloy</b> matrix composite had a greater impact strength than a turbine blade <b>superalloy,</b> whereas below 530 K a hot worked 56 volume per cent composite had a greater impact strength than the <b>superalloy...</b>|$|R
5|$|Tungsten's many alloys have {{numerous}} applications, including {{incandescent light}} bulb filaments, X-ray tubes (as both the filament and target), electrodes in TIG welding, <b>superalloys,</b> and radiation shielding. Tungsten's hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial catalysts.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading {{producer}} of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron which has a niobium content of 60-70%. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines. Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing <b>superalloys</b> is important for its use in jet and rocket engines.|$|E
5|$|One example {{superalloy}} is Inconel 718, {{consisting of}} roughly 50% nickel, 18.6% chromium, 18.5% iron, 5% niobium, 3.1% molybdenum, 0.9% titanium, and 0.4% aluminium. These <b>superalloys</b> are used, for example, in advanced air frame {{systems for the}} Gemini program. Another niobium alloy {{was used for the}} nozzle of the Apollo Service Module. Because niobium is oxidized at temperatures above 400°C, a protective coating is necessary for these applications to prevent the alloy from becoming brittle.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Superalloy</b> GH 4169 {{as one of}} high {{temperature}} structural material is widely used in aviation industry. Isothermal compression of <b>superalloy</b> GH 4169 has been conducted on Gleebe- 1500 D hot simulation at the deformation temperatures ranging from 950 ℃ to 1100 ℃，the strain rates ranging from 0. 01 s- 1 to 10 s- 1, and the height reduction of 50 %. Effect of processing parameters,i. e. deformation temperature, strain rate and strain, on the hot deformation behaviors of <b>superalloy</b> GH 4169 was studied.

40|$|International audienceA grade 25 cobalt-based <b>superalloy</b> in {{the form}} of a sheet 5 mm in {{thickness}} and a steel substrate of type X 38 CrMoV 5 are joined by explosion cladding. The macrostructure and microstructure of the interface and of the co-based <b>superalloy</b> layers are studied. The interface presents the form of wavelets with a period of 1000 µm and an amplitude of 250 µm. The <b>superalloy</b> grains are deformed during the cladding process with several slip systems appearing. Near to the interface, the <b>superalloy</b> grains elongate and tend to follow the geometry of the interface. Observation with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) reveals zones of localised fusion at the interface. The EDS analysis shows that these fusion zones are the result of mixing between the base and cladding plates. Radiocrystallographic analysis by X-ray diffraction reveals the presence of the f. c. c cobalt in the cobalt-based <b>superalloy</b> layer. Thus cobalt retains its crystallographic structure (f. c. c) after cladding process. Hardness is evaluated with reference to microstructure. Near the interface, the hardness of the <b>superalloy</b> is of the order of 600 HV 1 kg. In the remainder of the thickness, hardness is of the order of 500 HV 1 kg, being greater than that of the unplated <b>superalloy</b> (270 HV 1 kg). The track obtained by an indentation test at the interface under a load of 100 kg exhibits no cracking. This tends to prove the good metallurgical bond at the interface...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe thermal {{protection}} performance of <b>superalloy</b> honeycomb structure in high-temperature environments {{are important for}} {{thermal protection}} design of high-speed aircrafts. By using a self-developed transient aerodynamic thermal simulation system, the thermal protection performance of <b>superalloy</b> honeycomb panel was tested in this paper at different transient heating rates ranging from 5 °C/s to 30 °C/s, with the maximum instantaneous temperature reaching 950 °C. Furthermore, the thermal protection performance of <b>superalloy</b> honeycomb structure under simulated thermal environments was computed for different high heating rates by using 3 D finite element method, and a comparison between calculational and experimental results was carried out.

5|$|Tantalum is {{also used}} to produce a variety of alloys that have high melting points, strength, and ductility. Alloyed with other metals, it {{is also used}} in making carbide tools for {{metalworking}} equipment and in the production of <b>superalloys</b> for jet engine components, chemical process equipment, nuclear reactors, and missile parts. Because of its ductility, tantalum can be drawn into fine wires or filaments, which are used for evaporating metals such as aluminium. Since it resists attack by body fluids and is nonirritating, tantalum is widely used in making surgical instruments and implants. For example, porous tantalum coatings are used in the construction of orthopedic implants due to tantalum's ability to form a direct bond to hard tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{strengthening}} {{effect of}} forming stable metal carbides at the grain boundaries {{and the strong}} increase in corrosion resistance made chromium an important alloying material for steel. The high-speed tool steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. Stainless steel, the main corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium is added to iron in sufficient concentrations, usually above 11%. For its formation, ferrochromium {{is added to the}} molten iron. Also nickel-based alloys increase in strength due to the formation of discrete, stable metal carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For example, Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel <b>superalloys,</b> they are used in jet engines and gas turbines in lieu of common structural materials.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based <b>superalloys</b> consume {{most of the}} {{produced}} cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensionless}} Niyama criterion {{was used}} to predict the formation of microporosity in nickel-based <b>superalloy</b> casting, which extended the model application from a simple plate casting to complex thin-wall <b>superalloy</b> casting. The physical characteristics of the <b>superalloy</b> were calculated by JMatPro software. The relation between the volume percentage of microporosity and the dimensionless Niyama values were constructed.

25|$|Silicones {{are often}} used in {{waterproofing}} treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and caulking compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil. Other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide. Silicon is a component of some <b>superalloys.</b>|$|E
25|$|The stress {{at which}} yield occurs is {{dependent}} on both the rate of deformation (strain rate) and, more significantly, the temperature at which the deformation occurs. In general, the yield strength increases with strain rate and decreases with temperature. When the latter is not the case, the material is said to exhibit yield strength anomaly, which is typical for <b>superalloys</b> and leads to their use in applications requiring high strength at high temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from <b>superalloys</b> like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

In 2006, 77% of the rhenium consumption in the United States was in alloys. The rising demand for military jet engines and the constant supply made it necessary to develop <b>superalloys</b> with a lower rhenium content.

During high temperature long term aging, the stability of the microstructure and mechanical properties of a single crystal Ni-base <b>superalloy</b> is considered to be very important for the safe operation of a turbine engine. Because the single crystal <b>superalloy</b> is free of grain boundary, there have no problem on the weakening effect of grain boundary as well as the microcrack formation on the transverse grain boundary.
