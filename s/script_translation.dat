This had to be cut from the game due to concerns over the volume of content, but as the team still wanted to show this event, they incorporated it into the plot of Kingsglaive. To ensure a connection between the movie and the game, both projects used the same shared script as their core. That script was written by Saori Itamuro based on a draft by Kazushige Nojima. The team also wanted a proper cinematic experience that would appeal to a large audience, so they brought in a professional screenwriter, Takashi Hasegawa, to create a full-length cinematic script. Los Angeles-based company Hydra Entertainment assisted with creating the script alongside Hasegawa, in addition to writing assistance from Hollywood staff.

50|$|While {{the voice}} actors {{involved}} usually {{bear the brunt}} of criticisms towards poor dubbing, other factors may include inaccurate <b>script</b> <b>translation</b> and poor audio mixing. Dialogue typically contains speech patterns and sentence structure that are natural to the language but would appear awkward if translated literally. English dubs of Japanese animation, for example, must rewrite the dialogue so that it flows smoothly and follows the natural pattern of English speech. Voice actors in a dubbing capacity typically do not have the luxury of viewing the original film with the original voice actor and thus have little idea regarding how to perform the role. On some occasions, voice actors record their dialogue separately, which can lack the dynamics gained from performing as a group.|$|E

40|$|Every night, on stages {{all over}} the world, {{curtains}} go up.

For many deaf people the experience of theatre is delivered {{through the use of a}} theatrical interpreter, who is charged with the task of rendering an equivalent interpretation for a dynamic theatrical performance in a different language. What are the demands theatrical interpreters encounter in this work and what are the subsequent strategies they employ to counter these demands? In this study, I explored how interpreters who work between English and American Sign Language (ASL) navigate <b>script</b> <b>translation,</b> musical aesthetics, and stage action during a single theatrical performance. To examine the demands and strategies in this setting, I analyzed twenty minutes of an interpreted Broadway musical and conducted two interviews with the theatrical interpreting team. Findings reveal that the team of interpreters primarily used meaning-based free translation and included the use of manipulated prosody, sign space, and facial expressions to parallel auditory information contained in the music. Further, they used various techniques both to throw focus to visual information taking place on stage and to share focus during the concurrent presentation of auditory and visual information. The results provide an in-depth examination of an under-researched domain of interpreting and offers insights into the linguistic and artistic devices employed by highly experienced theatrical interpreters. The techniques uncovered in this examination may serve as a guide for other interpreters who seek to work in this unique interpreting environment...|$|E
40|$|Throughout this dissertation, {{which is}} based on the movie “Quijotes Negros”, the {{importance}} of the application of linguistic knowledge in the process of <b>script</b> <b>translation</b> will be analyzed. The problems one encounters when translating the script of a film that includes an interesting use of language, that is, a mixture of dialectal characteristics and standard Spanish, go beyond the literal conveyance of the message and comprise a deeper knowledge of cultural features of both languages, in order to truly give tribute to the original script, a part of the translation process which amateur translators tend to overlook. The dissertation will include theoretical and practical work. The study will comprise two chapters. The first one will be divided as follows: First, we will talk about linguistic theory including fields such as morphosyntax, semantics and pragmatics. Then, we will present the different points of view of various authors and translators regarding translation and its importance in the film industry. In order to be more specific and accurate, we will subdivide this section of the chapter in two parts. The first part will include the theory of translation on its own, discussing the different types of translation; translation in the film industry (including its evolution and the appearance of amateur translators along with the development of this industry), and translation techniques whereas the second part will include transference of culture through translation. The second chapter will focus on the analysis of the script of the film. First, we will talk about the contents discussed in the movie and give a short explanation, provided by the film director, of some events in Ecuadorian history as they are discussed in the film. Then, we will describe the specific linguistic and technical topics related to the problems found in the script; and finally, we will use all the theory previously discussed and apply it to present a new translation. ...|$|E

Keywords: culturally-bound words, {{translation}} strategies, Frozen <b>script</b> <b>Translation</b> {{has always}} been a central part of communication. It becomes a bridge to cope the gap of the culture and language background diversity among people. Culturally-bound words seemingly a communicating gateway in conceiving cultural message which want to be put on by the movie. In this study, the translation of culturally-bound words in Frozen movie is analyzed by using three translation strategies in comparison, that are the theories proposed by Newmark, Pinchuk, and Gotlieb. The research question in this study are: 1) What are the culturally-bound words found in the Frozen movie? and 2) How are the culturally-bound words in the Frozen movie translated into Indonesian? Hence, from the research question, the researcher formulates the objective of the study are to investigate: 1) The culturally-bound words in the Frozen movie and 2) How the culturally-bound words in the Frozen movie translated into Indonesian. The design of this study is descriptive study with qualitative approach since it focuses on understanding language phenomena {{from the perspective of the}} human participants in natural settings. The data of this research are the culturally-bound words in Frozen movie. The source of data are both script by Jennifer Lee and official subtitle that rewritten. To establish and enhance the credibility and dependability in this study, theoretical triangulation is used. Data analysis reveals some findings covering the formulated research questions. Throughout the movie, the researcher finds 101 culturally-bound words which are separated in five categories, material culture; custom, activities, and organization; ecology; gestures and habits; and social culture. The strategies used are literal translation, cultural equivalent, transference, reduction, naturalization, modulation, couplet procedures, descriptive equivalent, through translation and shift/transposition. A movie translator should accurately choose the best strategy in translating culturally-bound words since a word, sometimes, need a deeper explanation in order to cope gaps between SL and TL culture. Thus, choosing strategies appropriately may help the cultural message of the movie can be received well by the viewers...|$|E

Box 600 Doctoral thesis, 2008405 30 Göteborg, Sweden 289 pagesOrganizing InnovationHow Policies are Translated into PracticeInnovation is commonly {{seen as a}} driver of economic growth, {{which in turn is}} regarded asnecessary for societal prosperity. Government agencies therefore prepare innovation policiesand programmes in efforts to stimulate economic development. Following an organizingperspective and ethnographically inspired research techniques, this thesis explores how such{{policies are}} translated into practice in organizing a microwave innovation initiative. The views on innovation have shifted over time and the latest fashion is to focusinnovation systems, clusters and triple helix constellations, which all highlight interorganizationalrelations as the locus of innovation. These theories are central to internationaland Swedish policymaking. This thesis begins with studying how such theories ofinnovation-producing arrangements are translated into a Swedish agency for innovationsystems and inscribed into policy aimed at developing regional innovation systems andclusters. Theories are thus combined and edited as hybridized innovation scripts, orprogrammes-for-action, for how innovation initiatives should be organized. Theseinnovation scripts are then prescribed in programme competitions where governmentagencies evaluate and fund winning innovation initiatives. One such competition triggered the establishment of a cluster and innovation systeminitiative called Microwave Road (MWR), which aimed to further collaborative microwavetechnology development. In organizing MWR, microwave related companies, researchinstitutes and public organizations were grouped together in an inter-organizationalarrangement, as the innovation scripts were seen as prescribing. Once established,representatives for MWR organized meetings and seminars, and engaged in efforts ofcontinuous recruiting of members, and government support and funding. However,organizing a microwave network resulted in a structural precedence were form wasprioritized over content, and MWR struggled to initiate its desired technology developmentactivities. Two technology initiatives were consequently launched. One aimed at groupingmicrowave and automotive companies to stimulate joint technology development, but theautomotive representatives showed little interest and the group dissolved. The second builton local experiences and practices and was more successful as it focused work in a specificfield of microwave technology, as opposed to organizational structuring. The two initiativesthus followed different organizing scripts: one focusing structure and one action. This study shows how the innovation scripts became organizing scripts as they wereenacted in MWR, resulting in inertia as organizational structure was focused rather thaninnovation activities. However, when the scripts edited and adjusted to the local setting, theyafforded collaborative innovation work. This suggests that innovation policy shouldfacilitate innovation initiatives, not impose structural prescriptions on how to organize.
