40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the use of Tono-Pen XL in measuring IOP during the application of a suction ring in rabbit eyes with manometrically controlled IOP. Methods Tono-Pen XL was calibrated against direct manometry in 10 rabbit eyes. A suction ring was then applied in 4 rabbit eyes and the IOP was determined manometrically during suction ring application at 350 mmHg vacuum pressure. Finally, in 6 catheterized rabbit eyes the IOP was measured with Tono-Pen XL during suction ring application at <b>suction</b> <b>vacuum</b> from 350 to 650 mmHg, while keeping actual IOP stable at 30 mmHg and 60 mmHg. Results Linear regression analysis revealed that the Tono-pen XL was reliable for IOPs between 10 and 70 mmHg (R 2 = 0. 9855). Direct manometry during suction ring application showed no statistically significant variation of Tono-Pen XL readings when the incanulation manometry intraocular pressure changed from 30 mmHg to 60 mmHg and no statistically significant correlation between <b>suction</b> <b>vacuum</b> and IOP measurements. Conclusion Tono-Pen XL measurements are unreliable during the application of a suction ring on living rabbit eyes even when the actual IOP is forced to be within the validated range of Tono-Pen XL measurements. This inaccuracy is probably related to altered corneal and scleral geometry and stress. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{message in the}} report of A. T. M. Tang and associates [1] concerns the essential role of continuous vacuum in sternotomy wound infections healing process. Dressings by polyurethane foam sealed by transparent adhe-sive drape in fact are changed only once every 48 h, since wound toilette and purulent material removal actually relies on a sophisticate intermittent high <b>suction</b> <b>vacuum</b> system. We have adopted a conceptually similar, closed technique for super®cial wound infections. After a favourable experi-ence with a two stage approach [2], consisting in prelimin-ary debridement, followed, a few days later, by a surgical closure {{by means of a}}dvancement ¯aps and multiple high suctions drains, we now carry out primary closure of the infected super®cial tissues. When a super®cial sternal wound infection is diagnosed, surgical debridement is carried out; a suf®cient number of small high suction drains (Riplast; Neukirchen-Saar, Germany) are positioned and the skin is immediately closed by means of a continuous mono-®lament suture. High suction is continued until no more material is drained, usually after 7 ± 8 days. We have treated 15 patients by this method with good results; only in one case a further debridement was necessary with second inten-tion healing. Cosmetic results were very satisfactorily in the remaining 14 patients. Mean hospital stay after infection diagnosis was 9 ^ 2 days. We believe that, when possible, immediate skin closure after debridement over an ef®cient and continuous vacuum system, may be in most cases as effective as the polyurethane foam and adhesive sealant drape medication, offering better cosmetic results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Suction drains are {{routinely}} used after {{modified radical mastectomy}} and are an important factor contributing to increased hospital stay as the patients are often discharged only after their removal. Amongst various factors that influence the amount of postoperative drainage, the negative suction pressure applied to the drain {{has been reported to}} be of great significance. While a high negative suction pressure is expected to drain the collection and reduce the dead space promptly, it may also prevent the leaking lymphatics from closing and lead to increased drainage from the wound. Against this background a prospective randomized clinical study was conducted to compare the amount and duration of drainage between a half negative suction and full vacuum suction drainage in patients following modified radical mastectomy. The associated postoperative morbidity was also compared between the two groups. Methods 85 FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) proven cases of locally advanced breast cancer were randomized. (Using randomly ordered sealed envelops, which were opened immediately before the closure of the wound) in to 50 patients with full vacuum suction (pressure = 700 g/m 2) and 35 cases in to half vacuum suction drainage (pressure = 350 g/m 2) groups. The two groups were comparable in respect of age, weight, and technique of operation and extent of axillary dissection. Surgery was performed by the same surgical team comprising of five surgeons (two senior and three resident surgeons) using a standardized technique with electrocautery. External compression dressing was provided over the axilla for first 48 hrs and following that patients were encouraged to do active and passive shoulder exercises. The outcomes measured were postoperative morbidity and the length of hospital stay. Statistical methods used: Descriptive studies were performed with SPSS version 10 and group characteristics were compared using student t-test. Results Half vacuum suction drains were removed earlier than the full <b>suction</b> <b>vacuum</b> suction drains. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of seroma formation in the two groups and there was a significant reduction in the total hospital stay in patients with half vacuum suction drainage systems as compared to the full suction drainage group (p Conclusions Half negative suction drains provide an effective compromise between no suction and full or high suction drainage after modified radical mastectomy by reducing the hospital stay and the post operative morbidity including post operative seromas. </p...|$|E

40|$|Bioengineering {{including}} native vegetation is {{an ancient}} method of improving the stability of slopes. In modern railway engineering, this technique is re-captured for increasing the soil stiffness and shear strength of sub-grade beneath rail tracks. Currently this practice has become increasingly popular in Australia for stabilising railway corridors built over expansive clays and compressive soft soils. The tree roots provide three stabilising functions: (a) reinforcement of the soil, (b) dissipation of excess pore pressures and (c) establishing sufficient matric suction to increase the shear strength. The main focus {{of this research is}} to investigate the effects of vegetation on soil matric suction, ground settlement and lateral movement (radial consolidation). A mathematical model for the rate of root water uptake has been developed based on the root growth rate and considering ground conditions, type of vegetation and climatic parameters. The three independent features in the root water uptake model considered in detail are soil suction, root distribution, and potential transpiration. In order to establish a rigorous analysis for estimating the actual transpiration or root water uptake, the above mentioned factors have been quantified through relevant equations to develop the proposed root water uptake model. A two dimensional finite element approach based on ABAQUS has been employed to solve the transient coupled flow and deformation equations. The proposed root water uptake model has been implemented in the coupled analysis by introducing a sink term as a subroutine in the finite element analysis. The finite element mesh can be constructed using partially/fully saturated soil elements, representing the salient aspects of unsaturated permeability and the soil water characteristic curve. The model formulation is based on the general effective stress theory of unsaturated soils. Based on this proposed model, the distribution of the matric suction profile adjacent to the tree has been numerically analysed. To validate the model, an array of field measurements conducted at Miram site in Victoria, Australia and the data have been compared with the numerical predictions. The predicted results calculated using the soil, plant, and atmospheric parameters contained in the numerical model, compared favourably with the field and the associated laboratory measurements, justifying the assumptions upon which the model has been developed. The numerical analysis encompassing the developed root water uptake model can reasonably predict the region of maximum matric suction (away from the tree trunk axis), which has been consistent with the field measurements. Moreover, field measurements taken from the previously published literature have been compared with the numerical predictions. It is found that given the approximation of the assumed model parameters, the agreement between the predicted results and field data is still promising. The influence of different parameters on the maximum rate of root water uptake is investigated through parametric and sensitivity analyses. In addition, the rate of selected parameters such as potential transpiration and its distribution, suction at wilting point, the coefficient of permeability and the distribution of root length density have been studied in detail. The findings of this study confirm that four key parameters, including permeability, wilting point suction, density and distribution of the root length, and the rate of potential transpiration should be estimated or measured accurately in order to predict the behaviour of clayey soils near tree roots. The action of a single tree on improving the soil behaviour has been compared to a vertical drain with applied <b>suction</b> (<b>vacuum</b> pressure). It is seen that root water uptake and associated matric suction is analogous to a prefabricated vertical drain with vacuum preloading, and the lateral inward displacements simulate the radial consolidation process of prefabricated vertical drains. If a pattern of trees can be grown systematically along rail corridors, this may offer a cheaper and more environmentally attractive solution to vertical drains in the long-term. The results of this study provide a valuable and a relatively accurate mean to estimate the influences of vegetation on ground. The numerical model developed herein offers practicing geotechnical engineers an effective tool for designing structures on vadose zones containing vegetation. It is desirable to consider the influence zone of tree roots and the improved soil properties in modern geotechnical designs, benefiting from native vegetation...|$|E
