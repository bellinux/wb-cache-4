5|$|After these slights, {{speculation}} {{was raised}} that Mathias {{would leave the}} Republican Party, especially as the 1980 elections were approaching. Several prominent conservatives in the state, such as U.S. Representatives Marjorie Holt and Robert Bauman, were considering challenging Mathias for his seat. In contrast, the Democratic <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> had fewer challengers, suggesting Mathias would win renomination more easily {{if he were to}} switch parties. However, Mathias chose to remain as a Republican, and teamed up with eight other Republican senators to express their dissatisfaction with the hard-line wing of the party. Mathias later stated that he had never seriously considered switching parties.|$|E
25|$|Two days later, a {{replacement}} train consisting of three recently refurbished {{cars and the}} Mitsubishi FM power and baggage van with 37.5kW generator from the Auckland excursion fleet {{was brought in to}} supplement the remaining four Southerner cars. The first and second of these temporary replacement cars seated 50, alcove-style, like the Southerner cars, but with a more modern seat, seen on upgraded Masterton cars and the NIMT cars. The third car seated 54 in the same type of seat, but with all seats facing into two centre tables, one on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> The NIMT car turned buffet car in 1973 returned to the train as part of the replacement consist.|$|E
25|$|Although the Boeing design {{had been}} the first to enter series production, the 247 proved to have some serious design deficiencies. Air {{carriers}} considered its limited capacity a drawback since it carried only ten passengers, in five rows with a seat on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> as well as a flight attendant. Compared to the more spacious DC-2 and later DC-3, the passenger count was too few to make it a commercially viable airliner. Another feature influencing passenger comfort was that the 247's main wing spar ran through the cabin, so persons moving through the cabin had to step over it. The Lockheed Model 10 Electra had a similar configuration and while it was a more compact design, the Electra managed to carry the same number of passengers at a slightly better overall performance, and more importantly, at a lower cost-per-mile.|$|E

500|$|However, in a {{subsequent}} interview with the Los Angeles Times that appeared a month later, Eastwood suggested {{that he would not}} necessarily vote for Trump and instead appeared agnostic regarding the 2016 presidential election. The Times Rebecca Keegan asked, [...] "So when you say you’re not on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> does that mean you’re not voting for Trump?" [...] Eastwood replied, [...] "I’m totally an enigma. I’m just astounded. I hate to pick up the paper.

By the time the Boeing company committed to production, the decision {{had been made to}} design the production model 707 as a six-abreast design, with a larger [...] diameter fuselage, after C.R. Smith, CEO of American Airlines, told Boeing he wouldn't buy the 707 unless it was an inch wider than the then-proposed Douglas DC-8 passenger jet. This decision did not unduly delay introduction of the production model since the -80 had been largely hand-built, using little production tooling.|$|E

Ron Kampeas of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency wrote that [...] "someone needs to carpet Cohen, pronto, for his rhetoric." [...] His remarks were also condemned by the National Jewish Democratic Council, which issued a statement saying that [...] "invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never acceptable—on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> Cohen’s comments and similar comments made by others are not helpful as our leaders and citizens conduct a joint effort to advance civility in our political discourse.

The cave consists of an apsidal hall with side aisles for circumambulation (pradikshana). This path is full of carved Buddhist legends, three depictions of the Miracle of Sravasti in the right ambulatory <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> and seated Buddhas in various mudra. Many of these were added later by devotees, and therefore are intrusive to {{the aims of the}} original planners. The artwork begins {{on the wall of the}} aisle, immediately the left side of entrance. The major artworks include the Mahaparinirvana of Buddha (reclining Buddha) on the wall, followed by the legend called the [...] "Temptations by Mara". The temptations include the seduction by Mara's daughters who are depicted below the meditating Buddha. They are shown scantly dressed and in seductive postures, while on both the left and right side of the Buddha are armies of Mara attempting to distract him with noise and threaten him with violence. In top right corner is the image of a dejected Mara frustrated by his failure to disturb the resolve or focus of the ascetic Buddha.|$|E
2500|$|Iglesia ni Cristo church {{buildings}} primarily {{serve as}} {{places of worship}} and are used for other religious functions. These are described by Culture and customs of the Philippines, a book published by Greenwood Publishing Group, as structures [...] "which employ exterior neo-Gothic vertical support columns with tall narrow windows between, interlocking trapezoids, and rosette motifs, as well as tower and spires." [...] There are multiple entrances leading to the main sanctuary, where males and females sit on either <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> facing a dais where sermons are made. The choir loft is located behind the dais, and in larger churches, a baptistry with pools for immersion baptism {{is located at the}} back of the church. Meanwhile, Fernando Nakpil-Zialcita, an anthropologist from Ateneo de Manila University, said that INC churches can be uniquely identified for [...] "its exuberant use of fanciful forms and ornaments [...] brilliant white facade whose silhouette is a cusped Gothic arch or a flattened Saracenic arch." [...] The distinctive spires represent [...] "the reaching out of the faithful to God." [...] Prominent architects, such as Juan Nakpil (a National Artist of the Philippines for architecture) and Carlos A. Santos-Viola, had been involved in designing INC churches while the Engineering and Construction Department of INC, established in 1971, oversees the uniformity in design of church buildings.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, Hanson has {{appeared}} {{to reject the}} term neoconservative, writing in a 2016 column [...] "Hillary's Neoliberals" [...] that the term neoconservative was coined in the 1970s to describe liberals who moved right on social issues and on maintaining deterrence during the Cold War. Hanson has critiqued the decision of several neoconservatives to declare their support for Hillary Clinton as preferable to Donald Trump on grounds that Clinton {{has a long history}} of abuse of office, and is mired in scandal over violations of national security statutes as well as influence peddling between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Hanson has attacked these neoconservatives as [...] "neoliberals" [...] who were never entirely proper conservative, arguing that these people had joined the Republican Party out of distaste for the Democratic Party, which had nominated as the presidential candidates George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 as opposed to converting to conservatism. [...] Hanson ended his column that there were now two emerging factions in America — the proverbial ordinary Americans supporting Trump vs. the elites of both the Democratic and Republican parties supporting Clinton. Hanson wrote: [...] "A mostly urban, highly educated, and high-income globalized elite often shares more cultural and political affinities with their counterparts on the other <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> than they do with the lower-middle and working classes of their own parties. Just as Hillary Clinton may feel more comfortable with the old neoconservatives, Trump supporters have little in common with either Clintonites or neocons. Clinton versus Trump is a war of NPR, CBS, and the New York Times against the National Enquirer, conservative talk radio, and the Drudge Report. Clinton supporters such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, onetime Bush officials Hank Paulson and Brent Scowcroft, and billionaire Meg Whitman certainly have nothing in common with Republican Trump supporters such as Mike Huckabee and Rush Limbaugh. Culture, not just politics, is rapidly destroying—but also rebuilding—traditional political parties." ...|$|E
