50|$|According to the PMI (2008), lead is a {{dependency}} {{between two}} activities (p. 140). An {{example would be}} scheduling {{the start of a}} 2-week activity dependent with the finish of the <b>successor</b> <b>activity</b> with a lead of 2 weeks so they will finish at the same time.|$|E
50|$|ADM is {{used for}} {{scheduling}} activities in a project plan. Precedence relationships between activities are represented by circles connected {{by one or more}} arrows. The length of the arrow represents the duration of the relevant activity. ADM only shows finish-to-start relationships, meaning that each activity is completed before the <b>successor</b> <b>activity</b> starts.|$|E
50|$|CPM calculates {{available}} slippage in Free Float and Total Float. CPM measures Free Float by {{how much}} a predecessor activity may be delayed without causing a delay to its nearest <b>successor</b> <b>activity.</b> In GPM this is called buffer and it is calculated as the minimum of the link gaps for all logic ties to successor objects.|$|E
50|$|The LF {{for start}} is the minimum LS of its <b>successor</b> <b>activities.</b> Since a has an LS of 0 work days and b has an LS of 3.84 work days, the LS is 0 work days.|$|R
50|$|The LF for a is {{the minimum}} LS of its <b>successor</b> <b>activities.</b> Since c has an LS of 4 work days and d has an LS of 8.68 work days, the LF for a is 4 work days. The {{duration}} (4 work days) is subtracted from the LF {{to get an}} LS of 0 work days.|$|R
50|$|Barring any {{unforeseen}} events, {{the project}} should take 19.51 work days to complete. The {{next step is}} to determine the late start (LS) and late finish (LF) of each activity. This will eventually show if there are activities that have slack. The LF is defined as the minimum LS of all <b>successor</b> <b>activities,</b> unless the activity is the last activity, for which the LF equals the EF. The LS is the LF minus the task duration (LS = LF − duration).|$|R
5000|$|In {{accordance}} to PMBOK a lead is [...] "the {{amount of}} time whereby a <b>successor</b> <b>activity</b> can be advanced {{with respect to a}} predecessor activity For example, on a project to construct a new office building, the landscaping could be scheduled to start prior to the scheduled punch list completion. This would be shown as a finish-to-start with two-week lead".|$|E
5000|$|PMBOK defines lag as [...] "the {{amount of}} time whereby a <b>successor</b> <b>activity</b> will be delayed {{with respect to a}} {{predecessor}} activity". For example:When building two walls from a novel design, one might start the second wall 2 days after the first so that the second team can learn from the first. This {{is an example of a}} lag in a Start-Start relationship.|$|E
50|$|SF {{is rarely}} used, and should {{generally}} be avoided. Microsoft recommends to use SF dependency for just-in-time scheduling. It {{can be easily}} shown however, that this would only work if resource levelling is not used, because resource levelling can delay a <b>successor</b> <b>activity</b> (an activity, which shall be finished just-in-time) in such a way, that it will finish later than the start of its logical predecessor activity, thus not fulfilling the just-in-time requirement.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to {{identify}} the minimum time of a construction project using the critical path method and linear programming model. A systematic analysis is attempted by developing a work breakdown structure for entire project to establish work elements for quantifying various resources against time and cost. A network is established taking into consideration all the predecessor and <b>successor</b> <b>activities.</b> The network is then optimized through crashing of activities so as to obtain optimal solution and serves as a base for optimizing total project cost. Finally, linear programming model is used to formulate the system of crashing network for minimum time by LINGO model and Microsoft Excel. These models consider many considerations of project thus reducing the duration of project. Ultimately, comparison of both the software outputs and the manual calculations is done and the best verifier is determined...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNon-Conformance {{is defined}} as {{deviation}} in terms of quality during the construction execution. Whenever there is a deviation in quality, a non-conformance report (NCR) is issued. This non-conformance leads to rectification, repair or rework of an activity that ultimately result in time and/or cost overrun. Also, deviation in quality can have a direct or indirect impact on the <b>successor</b> <b>activities</b> and subsequently on the project performance. Every NCR has its origin with an activity and there exist dependencies among the activities and NCRs. The objective {{of the present study}} is to capture the dependencies among activities and NCRs using a structured approach that can be utilized to estimate the total project duration, which is inclusive of the delays due to nonconformances. To achieve this objective, a case study-based MDM (Multiple Domain Matrix) solution methodology has been proposed and the same has been demonstrated with the case study of a metro project. This NCR-activity mapping using MDM is effective in planning repetitive projects...|$|R

5000|$|Finish-to-start is {{considered}} a [...] "natural dependency". The Practice Standard for Scheduling recommends, that [...] "Typically , each predecessor activity would finish {{prior to the start}} of its <b>successor</b> <b>activity</b> (or activities)(known as finish-to-start (FS) relationship). Sometimes it is necessarily to overlap activities; an option may be selected to use start-to-start (SS), finish-to-finish (FF) or start-to-finish (SF) relationships....Whenever possible, the FS logical relationship should be used. If other types of relationships are used, they shall be used sparingly and with full understanding of how the relationships have been implemented in the scheduling software being used. Ideally, the sequence of all activities will be defined in such a way that the start of every activity has a logical relationship from a predecessor and the finish of every activity has a logical relationship to a successor".|$|E

40|$|Intelligent {{optimisation}} {{refers to}} the promising technique of integrating learning mechanisms into (meta-) heuristic search. In this paper we use multi-agent reinforcement learning for building high quality solutions for the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem. We use a network of distributed reinforcement learning agents that cooperate to jointly learn a well performing constructive heuristic. Each agent, being responsible for one activity, uses two simple learning devices, called learning automata, that learn to select a <b>successor</b> <b>activity</b> order and a mode, respectively. By coupling the reward signals for both learning tasks, we can clearly show the advantage of using reinforcement learning in search. We present some comparative results, to show that our method can compete with the best performing algorithms for the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem, yet using only simple learning schemes without the burden of complex finetuning. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTheoretically proper {{modeling}} of overlapping activities with traditional precedence relationships is impossible. This {{is due to}} the fact that traditional precedence relations create logic between the endpoints of activities. In contradiction, overlapping can be defined as a ‘continuous’ relation using time or location/production units between all the points of the predecessor and all the points of the <b>successor</b> <b>activities.</b> (E. g. at least 50 m safety distance is necessary between activity B and A during execution.) Recently developed point-to-point relations give a practically better solution, as they let planners form connections among as many internal points of the related activities as seemingly necessary, and all these points can be controlled during the execution phase. However, a theoretically proper solution is only available if an infinite number of point-to-point relations are used between two overlapping activities, but this is obviously impossible. The novelty of this paper is the definition of a new type of precedence relation for the Precedence Diagram Method (PDM), the so-called continuous relation. One continuous relation can be used instead of infinite point-to-point relations in order to perfectly model activity overlapping. Relation lags can be defined using either time or volume units. Another main advantage of this development is that continuous relations enable the definition of non-linear activities, while original PDM assumes continuous linear activities only...|$|R

In this period, the Great Royal Palace was built, and the temple of Ashur was expanded and enlarged with a ziggurat. This empire came to end when Hammurabi, the Amorite king of Babylon incorporated the city into his short lived empire {{following the death of}} Ishme-Dagan I c. 1681 BC, and the next three Assyrian kings were regarded as vassals. A king named Adasi drove the Babylonians and Amorites from Assur and Assyria as a whole c. 1720 BC, however little is known of his <b>successors.</b> Renewed building <b>activity</b> is known a few centuries later, during the reign of a king Puzur-Ashur III, when the city was refortified and the southern quarters incorporated into the main city defenses.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn global {{scientific}} experiments with collaborative scenarios involving multinational teams {{there are big}} challenges related to data access, namely data movements are precluded to other regions or Clouds due to the constraints on latency costs, data privacy and data ownership. Furthermore, each site is processing local data sets using specialized algorithms and producing intermediate results that are helpful as inputs to applications running on remote sites. This paper shows how to model such collaborative scenarios as a scientific workflow implemented with AWARD (Autonomic Workflow Activities Reconfigurable and Dynamic), a decentralized framework offering a feasible solution to run the workflow activities on distributed data centers in different regions without the need of large data movements. The AWARD workflow activities are independently monitored and dynamically reconfigured and steering by different users, namely by hot-swapping the algorithms to enhance the computation results or by changing the workflow structure to support feedback dependencies where an activity receives feedback output from a <b>successor</b> <b>activity.</b> A real implementation of one practical scenario and its execution on multiple data centers of the Amazon Cloud is presented including experimental results with steering by multiple users...|$|E
40|$|Quaternary mapping has {{progress}}ed on two fronts. Firstly, {{progress was made}} on a digital seamless compilation of 1 : 250 000 -scale surficial geology for all of Manitoba from published paper and digital maps, and secondly, three-dimensional mapping of the southern Phanerozoic terrane of Manitoba, which uses the surficial geology as a key input. The digital seamless surficial geology compilation is set to be the long overdue replacement for the original Surficial Geological Map of Manitoba (Nielsen et al., 1981). To achieve this goal all the most current and most detailed paper maps required for the 1 : 250 000 -scale compilation have been digitized. Edge matching and polygon conflicts are being resolved {{with the aid of}} a digital elevation model (DEM) derived from the recently released shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) data (United States Geological Survey, 2002). Original mapping of several previously unmapped areas was also carried out with the aid of the SRTM DEM and limited ground truthing. Progress has also been made in 3 -D mapping. Three-dimensional geological mapping of the Phanerozoic succession in southern Manitoba, south of 55 °N and west of 95 °W, is being completed as a <b>successor</b> <b>activity</b> to the Prairie compo-nent of the National Geoscience Mapping Program (NATMAP). Modelling is being done in manageably sized tiles; the Lake Winnipeg basin has been completed, and in combination with the already completed southern Prairie NATMAP area of southeastern Manitoba, has enhanced our understanding of the eastern edge of Phanerozoic rocks...|$|E
40|$|Most {{existing}} human mobility literature {{focuses on}} exterior characteristics of movements but neglects activities, {{the driving force}} that underlies human movements. In this research, we combine activity-based analysis with a movement-based approach to model the intra-urban human mobility observed from about 15 million check-in records during a yearlong period in Shanghai, China. The proposed model is activity-based and includes two parts: the transition of travel demands during a specific time period and the movement between locations. For the first part, we find the transition probability between activities varies over time, and then we construct a temporal transition probability matrix to represent the transition probability of travel demands during a time interval. For the second part, we suggest that the travel demands {{can be divided into}} two classes, locationally mandatory activity (LMA) and locationally stochastic activity (LSA), according to whether the demand is associated with fixed location or not. By judging the combination of predecessor activity type and <b>successor</b> <b>activity</b> type we determine three trip patterns, each associated with a different decay parameter. To validate the model, we adopt the mechanism of an agent-based model and compare the simulated results with the observed pattern from the displacement distance distribution, the spatio-temporal distribution of activities, and the temporal distribution of travel demand transitions. The results show that the simulated patterns fit the observed data well, indicating that these findings open new directions for combining activity-based analysis with a movement-based approach using social medi...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we deal with}} nondeterministic {{stochastic}} activity networks (NDSANs). Their stochastic character results from activity durations, which are given by nonnegative continuous random variables. The nondeterministic behavior of an NDSAN {{is a consequence of}} its variable topology, based on two additional features. First, by associating choice probabilities with the immediate <b>successors</b> of an <b>activity,</b> some branches of execution are not always taken. Second, by allowing iterated executions of a group of activities according to predetermined probabilities, the number of times an activity is to be executed is not determined a priori. These properties lead {{to a wide variety of}} activity networks, capable of modelling many real situations in process engineering and project management. We describe a simple, recursively structured construction of NDSANs, which both provides a coherent syntactic mechanism to incorporate the two abovementioned nondeterminism features and allows the analytic formulation of completion time. This construction also directly gives rise to a recursive simulation algorithm for NDSANs, whose repeated execution produces an estimate of the probability distribution of the completion time of the network. We also report on real-world case studies, using the Komolgorov-Smirnov statistic for validation. Activity networks Project management Project scheduling Simulation...|$|R
40|$|Basic {{ideas and}} {{characteristics}} of fundamental falconry are disseminated also in the Kingdom of Serbia, ideas of fellowship, releasing of Germanization influence and strengthening of national and cultural conscience. Gymnastics associations accepted the idea of overall Slavic falconry exercising, and added to their names title 'Falcon', as in Czech Falcons, and introduced Czech 'Falcon' exercising system, instead of German one. Also Smederevo Gymnastics and Combat Association {{in the course of}} time chose the falcon exercising system. The aim of this research was to find, systemize and critically analyze data about the falconry in Smederevo, about the falcon association 'Dusan Silni' (Dusan the Mighty), which as a <b>successor</b> continued the <b>activities</b> of the previous association - Smederevo Gymnastics and Combat Association. The basic assumption was founded on the expectation that data from the archive, periodical sources and ex falcon legacy would provide a satisfying base for reconstruction of Falcon Association history, i. e. appearance and development of the Falconry in Smederevo. During the research historic, causal and descriptive methods were used. Research results for the reference period, show that despite complex political, social, economic and cultural situation in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Falcon Association of Smederevo {{played a significant role in}} spreading and development of the falcon movement and promotion of Yugoslav national thought. Large number of data showed that activities of this falcon organization were extremely versatile. Well organized training programs, numerous participation in falcon rallies and competitions, as well as health, educational, cultural and other forms of acting of the Association, had great influence on social and cultural transformation of the town of Smederevo as well as of the nearby villages and rural population, for which falcon foremen took most credit...|$|R
