[...] On September 24, 1884, the Governing Committee of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) sent notices to Stock Exchange members who were also New-York Petroleum Exchange and <b>Stock</b> <b>Board</b> members, stating that according to Stock Exchange rules, membership could not be retained in both. At a meeting held on December 10, 1884, the New-York Petroleum Exchange and <b>Stock</b> <b>Board</b> amended its constitution.

40|$|The {{information}} value of <b>stock</b> message <b>boards</b> {{has often been}} debated. A main difficulty in assessing the value {{is the presence of}} a large number of posts with varying quality. This paper presents an intuitive approach to identify and aggregate information in <b>stock</b> message <b>boards.</b> We weigh each post’s recommendation by its author’s credibility based on accuracy of his past posts. We find that the weighted average recommendation of a <b>stock</b> message <b>board</b> has prediction power over future excessive returns of the stock. The effect is both statistically and economically significant. Interestingly, a simple average recommendation of a <b>stock</b> message <b>board</b> has no prediction power for future stock movements. These results indicate that there exist informed investors in <b>stock</b> message <b>boards,</b> but their information is neither fully incorporated into the market price, nor fully acknowledged by peers in <b>stock</b> message <b>boards.</b> An implementable trading strategy is developed to explore the {{information value}} of <b>stock</b> message <b>boards.</b> We find that significant economic gain can be achieved even after taking into consideration of trading costs. We also discuss various approaches to improve the information aggregation process and thus the performance of the trading strategy. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Financial {{pressures}} brought Perlman on October 25, 1961 to Symes {{and they}} agreed to take up where they had left off twenty-one months before. Agreement on key issues was quickly reached. The Central would sell its twenty percent interest in the Baltimore and Ohio. The Pennsy would divest itself, over time, of its one-third interest in the Norfolk and Western. (Penn Central's financial officer, David C. Bevan, would use the $300 million realized from this sale on non-rail diversification.) The Central would thus {{go out of business}} as a corporate entity, while the corporate existence of the Pennsylvania would continue under a new name. By 1962 the Pennsy and Central boards approved a Penn Central merger where one share of Pennsy stock would be exchanged for one share of the new company's stock, and 1.3 shares of Central stock would be exchanged for one share of the new Penn Central <b>stock.</b> <b>Board</b> representation would be based on shares outstanding in 1961—about 6.5 million for the Central, about 13.2 for the Pennsy—the outstanding shares, resulted in a sixty-forty split on the new board in favor of the Pennsy shareholders.

For example, among Chinese <b>stock</b> message <b>boards,</b> only Eastmoney.com provides data on the IP addresses of users who have posted a message. This unique feature facilitates the study on home bias in investors communication. Dong and Xiao (2011) employed this feature; through users’ respective IP addresses, the authors identified the geographical regions of participants involved in discussions on <b>stock</b> message <b>boards.</b> Looking at the message board of a particular stock, the authors compared the number of investors from a particular province engaged in discussions against {{the total number of}} investors having discussions on that board. This enabled the authors to measure the local level of exchange for that stock in the province. Extending the same approach to other provinces, the authors established the differences in levels of exchange between two provinces for a particular stock. Similarly, Huang et al. (2016) utilized the IP data of Eastmoney.com and constructed a quantitative indicator of local bias in investor attention. The indicator directly measures the magnitude of home bias in information exchange.|$|R
5000|$|The New-York Mining and National Petroleum Exchange {{merged with}} the New-York Petroleum Exchange and <b>Stock</b> <b>Board</b> on February 28, 1885.

The institution would later be renamed the Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York. By its official formation in 1885, its memberships of 2403 was considered the largest membership of any exchange in the United States, excluding the New York Produce Exchange. 400 of those members were also members of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). From its inception, Consolidated employed then cutting edge clearing house techniques which were efficient at preventing frauds and the reneging on bargains. Consolidated's initial business included mining stocks and petroleum pipe-line certificates, and in 1885 the sales of mining stocks amounted to 2,057,319 shares. In 1885, there was also a demand by the exchange's members {{for the creation of a}} department to deal in railroad stocks. After attempts to negotiate trade areas with the NYSE, Consolidated made the decision to [...] "accept any trade that could be obtained." [...] By March 20, 1886, the membership of the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange of New York was 2,403, where it remained limited.

40|$|Determining {{effective}} {{cleaning and}} disinfection regimes of livestock housing is vital to improving the health of resident animals and reducing zoonotic disease. A cleaning regime consisting of scraping, soaking with or without detergent (treatment and control), pressure washing, disinfection and natural drying was applied to multiple pig pens. After each cleaning stage, samples were taken from different materials and enumerated for total aerobic count (TAC) and Enterobacteriaceae (ENT). Soaking with detergent (Blast-Off, Biolink) caused significantly greater reductions of TAC and ENT on metal, and TAC on concrete, compared with control. Disinfection effect (Virkon S, DuPont) was not significantly associated with prior detergent treatment. Disinfection significantly reduced TAC and ENT on concrete and <b>stock</b> <b>board</b> but not on metal. Twenty-four hours after disinfection TAC and ENT on metal and <b>stock</b> <b>board</b> were significantly reduced, but no significant reductions occurred in the subsequent 96  hours. Counts on concrete did not significantly reduce during the entire drying period (120  hours). Detergent and disinfectant have varying bactericidal effects according {{to the surface and}} bacterial target; however, both can significantly reduce microbial numbers so should be used during cleaning, with a minimum drying period of 24  hours, to lower bacterial counts effectively...|$|E

Several probable reasons exist for this situation, as follows. (i) Eastmoney.com has always been ranked the most popular 9 among Chinese <b>stock</b> message <b>boards,</b> its users are active, and the volume of its cumulative data is huge. (ii) The time period over which its public data has been saved is longer. For example, its earliest saved data on Gree Electric Appliances Inc. dates back to August 29, 2007, whereas data from Homeway.com are available only for the 3  months. (iii) Information on Eastmoney.com is richer and more detailed. For example, studies by Dong and Xiao (2011) and Huang et al.
