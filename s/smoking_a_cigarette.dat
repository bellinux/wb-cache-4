5|$|Some {{time after}} 7:00pm, a Woodsville, New Hampshire {{resident}} {{heard a loud}} thump outside of her house. Through her window she could see a car up against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. The car pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. She telephoned the Grafton County Sheriff's Department at 7:27pm to report the accident. According to the 911 log, the woman claimed to have seen a man <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> inside the car. However, the woman later stated {{that she had not}} seen a man nor a person <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> but rather had seen {{what appeared to be a}} red light glowing from inside the car, potentially from a cell phone. At about the same time another neighbor saw the car as well as someone walking around the vehicle. She witnessed a third neighbor pull up alongside the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{fails to}} {{complete}} the revised Patient Zero exhibit before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero. The night after the exhibit opens, Mary and other ACT UP members break into the Hall of Contagion and trash the exhibit. Zero returns and Burton explains {{that he tried to}} stop the exhibit. Zero forgives Burton but says he wants to disappear again completely. Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{newspapers}} published {{images of}} Tomlinson's {{first encounter with}} police that evening. According to Barry Smith, Tomlinson left the newspaper stand outside Monument Tube Station at around 7pm. The Daily Mail published an image showing Tomlinson <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette</b> {{in front of a}} police van in Lombard Street. An eyewitness, IT worker Ross Hardy, said Tomlinson was drunk and refusing to move; a police van tried to nudge him out of the way, and when that didn't work he was moved by four riot officers. The newspaper published a second image of him apparently being pushed by the police. On 16 April The Guardian published three images of Tomlinson taken at the same time.|$|E
40|$|Background—Cigarette <b>smoking</b> is <b>a</b> {{well-known}} {{risk factor}} {{for the development of}} cardiovascular disease, yet the mechanism of action involved is not completely understood. Because cigarette smoke contains superoxide and other reactive oxygen species, it has been hypothesized that some of the adverse effects of smoking may result from oxidative damage to endothelial cells, which results in nitric oxide (NO) shortage. However, little information is available regarding the acute effects of smoking on plasma concentrations of NO and antioxidants. We measured the changes in the combined plasma concentrations of nitrate and nitrite as an index of NO concentration, as well as changes in concentrations of major serum antioxidants (ascorbic acid, cysteine, methionine, and uric acid) in smokers after <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette.</b> Methods and Results—A randomized crossover study of the effects of <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette</b> was performed in 20 smokers. <b>Smoking</b> <b>a</b> sham <b>cigarette</b> induced no significant changes in all assayed parameters. However, <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette</b> significantly decreased nitrate and nitrite plasma concentrations by 3. 51. 2 and 3. 41. 1 mol/L, compared with plasma concentrations at presmoking and sham smoking, respectively. The concentrations of ascorbic acid and other antioxidants were also significantly lower after <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette.</b> These parameters returned to preexperimental levels 60 minutes after smoking cessation. Conclusion—The present findings indicate that <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette</b> temporarily decreases nitrate, nitrite, and seru...|$|R

5|$|In North America, several {{volumes of}} the manga have ranked within the weekly Nielsen BookScan graphic novels list, {{including}} volume five at both sixth and ninth in October 2004, volume six at sixth in February 2005, and volume seven at seventh in June 2005. In 2004, the Yu Yu Hakusho manga serialization sparked a controversy when a Florida grade school teacher issued a complaint about material found in an issue of the American Shonen Jump magazine purchased by a fifth-grade student at a Scholastic Book Fair. The complaint centered around portions of the manga containing violence, mild profanity, a character wearing a swastika, and another character <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette.</b> About 18,000 copies of the publication (out of 120,000) were returned from the fairs {{as a result of}} the matter. A Viz spokesperson defended the manga, clarifying that it is intended for older teens and that the alleged swastika is actually a Buddhist manji.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo in a dark room, with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following preparatory school Ross boarded at Haileybury where, {{being both}} small {{for his age}} and a latecomer to his year, he {{initially}} suffered greatly from bullying — to his intense relief the bully {{was killed in a}} vacation cycling accident — but his stock quickly rose when he revealed a talent which matched his passion for cricket. With a hint of the debonair style that was to characterise his life, he avoided participation in the OTC and all study of mathematics and science, instead enjoying art, French poetry and racquet sports. As a senior boy he was caned for making an unlicensed visit to Wimbledon; it was his misfortune that he figured, <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> in a photograph of spectators carried in his headmaster's newspaper the following morning.|$|E

25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette,</b> Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E
25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} two weeks later. It is midday, {{and the sun}} is scorching. Too hot to work, the mechanics, wearing {{sleeveless}} tank tops or stripped to their waists, laze around the garage and flirt with their girlfriends. Luca has taken Angelo under his wing and is teaching him how to fight. Unfortunately, Angelo shows little skill and continues to be the subject of the other mechanics' ridicule. Dino arrives, looking rather silly in a straw hat, Hawaiian shirt, Bermudas, and socks and sandals. Taking his briefcase, he leaves for a trip. Luca begins flirting with Lana, who is kneading dough for bread, and mutual seduction ensues. The mechanics and their partners also begin behaving lustily with increasing intensity. Lana leads Luca into her apartment with Dino above Dino's office. They make love, and Luca subsequently emerges dressed only in his underwear and an unbuttoned shirt, <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> <b>cigarette.</b> He then re-enters the apartment and returns to Lana. Other couples lounge around the garage floor, apparently in post-coital bliss. Dino returns from his trip, and chases his workers and their friends away. He sees Lana through the apartment window and thinks she is waving at him, not realizing she is again making love to Luca with her hand pressed to the window. Dino ascends the metal staircase leading to the apartment, but trips and makes a clattering noise. Lana and Luca realize that Dino has returned. Just as Dino enters the apartment, Luca leaves by throwing his clothes out of another window and climbing down a fire escape. He dresses, but discovers that one of his boots is missing. Fortunately, Lana tosses the boot out of the window. Luca puts it on and walks away quickly. Angelo observes and follows him. Next, we see a car in the garage shaking as two people engage in sexual intercourse within. Luca emerges, buttoning his trousers, followed – unexpectedly – by Angelo. The expression on Angelo's face indicates he has fallen in love with Luca, and in parallel solos, both Lana and Angelo express joyous ecstasy at having encountered Luca that night.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Smoking {{is known}} to be a primary cause of chronic harmful effects on the {{vascular}} system. It also induces some acute effects on the coronary circulation and on the ophthalmic artery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to assess the effect of <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette</b> on cutaneous blood flow in habitual smokers as well as in nonsmokers. METHODS: A laser Doppler flowmeter was used to perform measurements of cutaneous microcirculation. Flowmetric data were recorded (i) before smoking, (ii) inhaling from <b>an</b> unlighted <b>cigarette,</b> (iii) during cigarette smoking, (iv) 2 and (v) 5 min after smoking. RESULTS: We could show that <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette</b> acts on the cutaneous microcirculation reducing blood flow in both groups of subjects (38. 1 % reduction in smokers and 28. 1 % reduction in nonsmokers; p < 0. 01). Interestingly, the recovery phase is faster in nonsmoker subjects than in smoker ones; in fact, the recovery is complete 2 and 5 min after cigarette smoking in nonsmokers and in smokers, respectively. CONCLUSION: <b>Smoking</b> <b>a</b> single <b>cigarette</b> decreases the cutaneous blood flow in habitual smoker as well as in nonsmoker subjects. Moreover, the slower recovery phase of smokers suggests that their microcirculation become inured to smoke...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the authors tested the {{hypothesis}} that nicotine would provide greater relief from negative affect for more impulsive smokers than for less impulsive smokers. Euthymic adult smokers (N = 70) participated in 2 laboratory sessions, during which they underwent a negative mood induction (music x autobiographical memory), then smoked either a nicotinized or de-nicotinized cigarette. Mixed-effects regression yielded a significant Impulsivity x Condition (nicotinized vs. de-nicotinized) x Time interaction. Simple effects analyses showed that heightened impulsivity predicted greater negative affect relief after <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> nicotinized <b>cigarette</b> but not after <b>smoking</b> <b>a</b> de-nicotinized <b>cigarette.</b> These data suggest that nicotine may be a disproportionately powerful negative reinforcer for highly impulsive smokers, promoting higher levels of nicotine dependence and inhibiting smoking cessation...|$|R
