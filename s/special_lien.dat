[...] A <b>special</b> <b>lien,</b> the more common kind, {{requires}} a close connection between the property and the service rendered. [...] A <b>special</b> <b>lien</b> can only be exercised in respect of fees relating to the instant transaction; the lienor cannot use the property held as security for past debts as well. [...] A general lien affects all of {{the property of the}} lienee in the possession of the lienor, and stands as security for all of the debts of the lienee to the lienor. [...] A <b>special</b> <b>lien</b> can be extended to a general lien by contract, and this is commonly done in the case of carriers. [...] A common-law lien only gives a passive right to retain; there is no power of sale which arises at common law, although some statutes have also conferred an additional power of sale, and it is possible to confer a separate power of sale by contract.|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{barrier to}} investing in renewable energy and comprehensive energy efficiency improvements to homes {{across the country}} is the initial capital cost. Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing {{is one of several}} new financial models broadening access to clean energy by addressing this upfront cost issue. Recently, the White House cited PACE programs as an important element of its 'Recovery through Retrofit' plan. The residential PACE model involves the creation of a special clean energy financing district that homeowners elect to opt into. Once opted in, the local government (usually at the city or county level) finances the upfront investment of the renewable energy installation and/or energy efficiency improvements. A <b>special</b> <b>lien</b> is attached to the property and the assessment is paid back as a line item on the property tax bill. As of April 2010, 17 states have passed legislation to allow their local governments to create PACE programs, two already have the authority to set up PACE programs, and over 10 additional states are actively developing enabling legislation. This policy brief analyzes {{one of the advantages of}} PACE, which is the transferability of the special assessment from one homeowner to the next when the home is sold. This analysis focuses on the potential for the outstanding lien to impact the sales negotiation process, rather than the legal nature of the lien transfer itself. The goal of this paper is to consider what implications a PACE lien may have on the home sales negotiation process so that it can be addressed upfront rather than risk a future backlash to PACE programs. If PACE programs do expand at a rapid rate, the chances are high that there will be other cases where prospective buyers uses PACE liens to negotiate lower home prices or require repayment of the lien as a condition of sale. As a result, PACE programs should highlight this issue as a potential risk factor for the sake of full disclosure. A good example of this is in Boulder County where the following statement is included in the ClimateSmart PACE program materials: 'Please Note: There is no legal requirement that the loan be paid off when you refinance or sell your home. However, this may be an item subject to negotiation with a future buyer and may also be a matter of negotiation with the mortgage lender. ' Such candid disclosure for what might be a low risk event can be debated. However, a selling point of PACE programs is the transferability of the lien to the new homeowner. To the degree this benefit is questioned, PACE programs may end up looking more like home equity loan financing, with the associated debt repaid at closing, rather than property-based financing that remains with the improved home. While it is possible that upfront disclosure might negatively impact participation rates in PACE programs, it also will protect the integrity of a PACE program in later years if such situations come to pass. Ideally, this will become less of an issue over time as more homebuyers understand the positive economic and societal benefits of owning a home with clean energy features...|$|E

[...] The City of Houston imposed {{special tax levies}} for road and sewerage projects on owners of property abutting the sections of street being improved. The ruling effectively removed the only tool the city had for enforcing payment of the special assessments by homeowners. Road construction contractors stopped all work because they feared the city would not pay them. Many homeowners stopped paying their assessment bills.|$|R
40|$|The I. R. S. has an {{imposing}} armamentarium of {{means by which}} to collect unpaid taxes. They include the general tax <b>lien,</b> various <b>special</b> tax <b>liens,</b> administrative levy and sale, and judicial sale. There are many administrative and judicial protections for taxpayers and third parties against the overly zealous application {{of these and other}} devices. Nonetheless, the I. R. S. ’s collection options are of imposing breadth and power, considerably exceeding collection options available to private creditors. Confronted by these collection devices, those who owe taxes and are determined not to pay them sometimes resort to transferring their assets to others, typically family members, close associates, or controlled corporations or other entities. Part I of this article describes the three principal means by which the I. R. S. protects itself against or defeats such transfers. It also notes examples of the devices in Nevada and the interaction of state law and federal law as to them.

Some former LLDB personnel were formed into a new clandestine unit, the Vietnamese Special Mission Service (SMS). Approximately 5,000 personnel served in the Special Forces during the Vietnam War. After the Fall of Saigon, those who did not escape were sent to reeducation camps.|$|R
