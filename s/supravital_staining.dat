5000|$|A {{vital stain}} in a casual usage may mean a stain {{that can be}} applied on living cells without killing them. Vital stains have been useful for {{diagnostic}} and surgical techniques in a variety of medical specialties. In <b>supravital</b> <b>staining</b> living cells that have been removed from an organism, whereas intravital staining is done by injecting or otherwise introducing the stain into the body. The term vital stain is used by some authors to refer to an intravital stain, and by others interchangeably with a supravital stain, the core concept being that the cell being examined is still alive. But in a more strict sense the term vital staining has a meaning contrasting with <b>supravital</b> <b>staining.</b> While in <b>supravital</b> <b>staining</b> the live cells take up the stain, in [...] "vital staining" [...] - the most accepted but apparently paradoxical meaning of this term, the live cells exclude the stain i.e. stain negatively and only the dead cells stain positively and thus viability can be assessed by counting the percentage of total cells that stain negatively. Very bulky or highly charged stains that don't cross live plasma membrane are used as vital stains and supravital stains are those that are either small or are pumped actively into live cells. Since supravital and intravital nature of the staining depends on the dye, a combination of supravital and vital dyes can also be used in a sophisticated way to better classify cells into distinct subsets (e.g. viable, dead, dying etc.).|$|E
50|$|Neutral red (toluylene red, Basic Red 5, or C.I. 50040) is a eurhodin dye {{used for}} {{staining}} in histology. It stains lysosomes red. It {{is used as}} a general stain in histology, as a counterstain in combination with other dyes, and for many staining methods. Together with Janus Green B, it is used to stain embryonal tissues and <b>supravital</b> <b>staining</b> of blood. Can be used for staining Golgi apparatus in cells and Nissl granules in neurons.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Supravital</b> <b>staining</b> can be {{combined}} with cell surface antibody staining (immunofluorescence) for applications such as FACS analysis. [...] Immunofluorescence can also be done within the interior of live cells by reversible cell permeabilization using the detergent Triton X-100. Adjusted carefully to the appropriate concentration {{for the number of}} cells, the pretreatment can permit access of molecules between 1 and 150 kilodaltons to the interior of the cell.

5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>supravital</b> <b>stain</b> is {{performed}} on reticulocytes using new methylene blue or brilliant cresyl blue, {{which makes it}} possible to see the reticulofilamentous pattern of ribosomes characteristically precipitated in these live immature red blood cells by the <b>supravital</b> <b>stains.</b> By counting the number of such cells the rate of red blood cell formation can be determined, providing an insight into bone marrow activity and anemia. [...] This is in contrast to vital staining, when the dye employed is one that is excluded from the living cells so that only dead cells are stained positively. (Vital stains include dyes like trypan blue and propidium iodide, which are either too bulky or too charged to cross the cell membrane, or which are actively rapidly pumped out by live cells.) ...|$|R

5000|$|While ex vivo, many cells {{continue}} to live and metabolize until they are [...] "fixed". Some staining methods are based on this property. Those stains excluded by the living cells but {{taken up by the}} already dead cells are called vital stains (e.g. trypan blue or propidium iodide for eukaryotic cells). Those that enter and stain living cells are called <b>supravital</b> <b>stains</b> (e.g. New Methylene Blue and Brilliant Cresyl Blue for reticulocyte staining). However, these stains are eventually toxic to the organism, some more so than others. Partly due to their toxic interaction inside a living cell, when <b>supravital</b> <b>stains</b> enter a living cell, they might produce a characteristic pattern of staining different from the staining of an already fixed cell (e.g. [...] "reticulocyte" [...] look versus diffuse [...] "polychromasia"). To achieve desired effects, the stains are used in very dilute solutions ranging from [...] to [...] (Howey, 2000). Note that many stains may be used in both living and fixed cells.|$|R

It differs from intravital staining, which is done by injecting or otherwise introducing the stain into the body. Thus a supravital stain may have a greater toxicity, as only a few cells need to survive it a short while. The term [...] "vital stain" [...] is used by some authors to refer specifically to an intravital stain, and by others interchangeably with a supravital stain, the core concept being that the cell being examined is still alive. As the cells are alive and unfixed, outside the body, supravital stains are temporary in nature.|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} paper the author {{reported}} that the dyes used generally for <b>supravital</b> <b>staining</b> form insoluble precipitates with the Nessler's reagent suggesting that this reagent {{may be used for}} the fixation of the dyes used in <b>supravital</b> <b>staining</b> of cells. However, some authors report that several fixatives those containing mercuric ion or picric acid can be used for the fixation of dyes used in <b>supravital</b> <b>staining</b> of cells. In this paper the author presents the results observed on the reactions of various dyes with several fixatives. Experiment proved that some fixatives containing Hg or picric acid form insoluble colored precipitates with dyes. The formation of the precipitates is most marked in Janus green B and less marked in Nile blue. By treating picric acid the dyes change their color to that with yellow tone. No precipitates can remain undissolubled when they are exposed to the organic solvents, like alcohol, aceton etc. Janus green B precipitates show some resistance to the action of organic solvents but less resistance to Nile blue. It follows then for the observation of the supravitally stained granules on fixed cells, organic solvents should be avoided in any process of fixation and dehydration...|$|E

Methods: Oocytes and granulosa cells were isolated from ovaries of mice which were immunized with allogenic ovarian extract. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the expression of TNF-α and its receptors at mRNA level. To distinguish living, apoptotic and necrotic granulosa cells <b>supravital</b> double <b>staining</b> was applied with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide dyes. Results: We have revealed that expression of TNF-α and both receptors (TNFR-I and TNFR-II) mRNAs was changed in mice with immune ovarian failure. The levels of TNF-α and TNFR-I mRNAs were detected to be higher in oocytes and granulosa cells upon immunization. However, the expression of mRNA encoding TNFR-II was decreased in granulosa and it was not found out in oocytes. We also detected the intensification of apoptosis and especially necrosis in follicular cells after their treatment with TNF-α.

Hydrostatic pressure (HP) {{plays an important role}} in follicular development. Objective: This study was designed to examine the effects of HP on in-vitro maturation of oocytes and cell death in cumulus cells derived from vitrified-warmed mouse ovaries. Materials and Methods: Preovulatory follicles were harvested from non-vitrified and vitrified-warmed 6 - 8 week-old female NMRI mouse ovaries and randomly assigned to following groups: non-vitrified (control), non-vitrified with HP exposure (treatment I), vitrified-warmed (treatment II) and vitrified-warmed with HP exposure (treatment III). The follicles of treatments I and III were subjected to HP (20 mmHg) for 30 min and after that all groups were cultured for 24 h and assessed for in-vitro maturation of oocytes. The viability and apoptosis of cumulus cells and oocytes were assessed using <b>supravital</b> nuclear <b>staining</b> and TUNEL assay, respectively. Results: Oocytes harvested follicles in both control and treatment II had a significantly lower percentage of metaphase II oocytes (MII) than the treatment I and III (23. 5 ± 3. 1, 15. 03 ± 4. 6 and 32. 7 ± 3. 2, 25. 5 ± 4. 6; respectively) (p< 0. 05). Viability of the cumulus cells reduced in treatment I, II and III (83. 4, 83. 3 and 77. 7 %) compared to control (86. 9 %), (p< 0. 05). The apoptotic index in cumulus and oocyte complexes in treatments I and III (10. 7 ± 0. 8 and 15. 3 ± 0. 8) was higher than in control and treatment II (6. 7 ± 0. 5 and 9. 7 ± 0. 5) (p< 0. 05).
