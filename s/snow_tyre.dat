40|$|The use of <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> in New Zealand is {{becoming}} more common due to lower priced late model second hand passenger cars being imported fitted with older half worn <b>snow</b> <b>tyres.</b> Inappropriate use of <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> has been anecdotally linked {{to a number of}} serious and fatal crashes nationally. A primary consideration for crash investigators is to establish whether or not the use of the <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> contributed to the cause of those crashes. This paper describes comparative testing of <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> and conventional tyres for both wet and dry road surfaces. Testing was undertaken for both cornering and straight line emergency braking. The tests were performed by NZ Police Serious Crash Unit staff. Preliminary test results indicated a significant reduction in traction for <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> when compared to conventional car tyres during cornering manoeuvres, and a considerable increase in stopping distances on wet surfaces under emergency braking situations. An analysis of the results from initial testing showed a reduction in cornering (lateral) traction of around 6. 0 % on a dry road and 9. 2 % in the wet. Regarding stopping distances under emergency braking, in the dry there was a reduction in stopping distance of around 13. 1 %, but an increase in stopping distance in the wet of 16. 0 %. This equates to an increase in stopping distance on a wet road surface of about 2. 6 metres at 50 km/h and about 10. 6 metres at a speed of 100 km/h. The research, although limited in extent, show that <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> do not offer as much grip as can be achieved with conventional tyres, particularly in wet conditions and also during cornering in wet or dry road conditions. Further testing is required to determine if the age of the <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> and/or the road surface type will {{have an effect on the}} results (asphalt, bitumen chip etc). This testing should clarify the relationship between tyre type, tread depth and friction...|$|R

40|$|Automobile {{drivers are}} {{regularly}} exposed to vibrational and acoustic stimuli. These stimuli cause discomfort, and methods for analysing the noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) properties of automobiles are in regular use. Most manufacturers currently dedicate significant {{attention to the}} NVH characteristics of their products. NVH criteria are regularly applied {{to the design of}} the steering system, whose vibration spectra can reach frequencies as high as 300 Hz. The design of steering components {{has been the subject of}} several studies (Pak et al., 1991) and the human subjective response to steering vibration has also been investigated, in terms of perceived intensity (Giacomin et. al., 2004) and induced fatigue (Giacomin and Abrahams, 2000). While further research is required, much is known about the discomfort produced by steering vibration. A less well understood topic is the information transmitted to the driver. With electronically assisted and by-wire steering technologies (Jurgen, 1999) the question of what stimuli should reach the driver has become important. All current methods for estimating vibrational discomfort, whether hand-arm or whole-body, and whether based on frequency weightings (ISO 5349 - 1, 2001) or customer correlations (Schoeggl, 2001), are defined in such a way as to suggest that a uniform reduction in vibration level brings a uniform reduction in discomfort. Less vibration is considered better. This may not be appropriate in the case of information, however, since situations can be imagined in which an increase in vibration might prove useful towards understanding the nature of the road surface or of the vehicle dynamic state. The question of what information the steering should transmit to the driver is not a simple one. Vibrational stimuli help the driver to interpret many things including the type of road surface, the presence of water or <b>snow,</b> <b>tyre</b> slip (both longitudinal and lateral) and the dynamic state of subsystems such as the engine, the steering and the brakes. The stimuli are perceived, compared to models from long term memory and interpreted. A possible approach is the measurement of statistical information. Since the work of Shannon (1949), numerous researchers have applied the concept of information entropy to problems in human behaviour and control (Corning, 2001; Bea and Marijuan, 2003). In Shannon’s terminology information refers to the capacity to reduce statistical uncertainty, while entropy is the degree of uncertainty. The basic premise is that a communication channel can be analysed in terms of the symbols used, and that the probability of occurrence of the symbols can be used as a metric of information flow. In recent years information measures have occasionally been applied to automotive problems, one example being the measure of steering wheel entropy defined by Nakayama et. al. (1999). The availability of a metric for quantifying the information transmitted to the driver provides an important new type of evaluation. As shown in figure 1, stimuli can then be judged in terms of the two, often opposing, criteria of discomfort and information. Further, optimisation of the information transmitting elements of the steering system by the automobile designer leads to a perception enhancing interface, or, more specifically, a Perception Enhancement System (PES). A possible PES for a by-wire steering system is shown in figure 2, where movements at the tyre or wheel hub are returned to the driver through a perception enhancing electronic controller unit, which identifies significant features which are then amplified and transmitted. Research to define information metrics and perception enhancement systems for automobile steering systems is being performed as part of a collaboration between the Perception Enhancement Systems research group of Sheffield University and the Hyundai Motor Company central research laboratory. This article describes the results of two experiments which have measured the effect of the amplitude and the frequency bandwidth of steering vibration on the human ability to identify road surface type...|$|E

50|$|The Rally Sweden {{was marked}} {{by the lack of}} snow, which forced the {{organization}} to change the rally route and cancel some of the stages that had started to thaw out, making the studded <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> unsafe to use.

By 1979 he had designed {{and created a}} lightweight bicycle for the wet mud of south-east England that used 650Bx54 Nokia Hakkapeliitta <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> from Finland. Apps set up Cleland Cycles Ltd to manufacture copies of his design in 1982 and these were sold under Apps' Cleland Cycles brand until 1984. They were designed for touring, in which reliability and comfort were more important than speed and racing. Companies in Britain produced their own versions, notably English Cycles and Highpath Engineering.|$|R

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} road safety; Inventory and {{selection}} for research purposes. This report contains {{an inventory of}} factors increasing the risk of sustaining serious or fatal injury in a traffic crash. For readability the term ‘risk factors’ is used; this should always be read as risk increasing factors. Risk factors can influence {{the risk of being}} involved in a traffic crash. An example of such a risk factor is driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Furthermore, risk factors can also influence the risk of sustaining injury in a crash, for example not wearing a seatbelt. A central assumption in this report is that there must always be a situation that {{can be used as a}} reference: quantitative assessments can only be made if a comparison can be made between the risk of a crash in a situation in which that specific risk factor is present, and the risk of a crash in a situation without that factor. This approach has been taken from epidemiology, where, for example, a comparison is made between the risk of a serious illness if a certain risk factor is present and the risk of the same illness if that factor is not present. Although they are related, risk factors are not the same as measures. This report considers a risk factor to be the underlying cause of a risk increase in a certain situation. Measures can help to limit the consequences of a risk factor. Sometimes the two are each other’s mirror image. For example: in this report a driver not using <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> is considered a risk factor. At the same time, however, the use of <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> can also be indicated as a measure...|$|R
50|$|With {{the switch}} to Pirelli tyres, tyre mousse (along with all anti-deflation devices) has been banned, and fewer {{compounds}} are available. Also the teams aren't allowed to modify tyres by themselves (e.g. by making additional cuts) anymore. At the first event of the season, the available tires were the soft slick DS tire (Pirelli PZero), the WX snow tire without studs, and the WX snow tire with studs (both variants of Pirelli Sottozero). The same <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> were used in Sweden as well. Later on loose surface tyres were introduced: Pirelli Scorpion, available in two variants - hard compound for abrasive surfaces, such as roads in Mexico or Greece, and soft one, for more muddy stages as seen on Welsh event. Tire walls have been strengthened in order to endure long, rough gravel stages often full of sharp rocks. The tread on Scorpions is asymmetric and directional, as it has proven more efficient during the tests.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{having made}} only minor {{changes to the}} car during the winter off-season, and faced with the {{imminent}} departure of team principal Jost Capito to Formula One team McLaren, Volkswagen Motorsport continued to dominate the 2016 season. Ogier won the opening two rounds in Monte Carlo and Sweden despite difficult conditions that saw several stages of the Rally Sweden route cancelled as rising temperatures saw the roads thaw out, making the studded <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> unusable. Latvala, however, endured a string of mechanical failures and driver errors that saw him fail to score a single point in the opening rounds. He took advantage of his road position to win Rally Mexico while Ogier finished second despite having been first on the road and sweeping loose gravel off the surface. Andreas Mikkelsen remained in the third Polo R, but changed his co-driver for the season, enlisting Anders Jæger as Ola Fløene joined Mads Østberg at M-Sport. Mikkelsen and Jæger started their season with a podium in Monte Carlo and a points finish in Sweden before retiring in Mexico.|$|R
500|$|The {{final stage}} of the rally took place on Sunday morning. After {{conducting}} the entire race in France the organisers only paid {{lip service to the}} principality by holding a Super Special Stage there. It involved two laps of part of the Circuit de Monaco for a total distance of , with two cars on the road at the same time but starting at two different points along the track so that they did not interfere with each other. Because the Service Park was in Valence, repairs, adjustments, refuelling and tyre changes were carried out on Saturday night ahead of the drive down to the coast. The decision about which tyres to fit on the cars was taken out of the teams' hands. ACM ordered that all the cars would drive on the <b>snow</b> <b>tyres</b> that the teams had been allocated, but had not been used because of the dry weather, a decision that was described as [...] "absurd" [...] because the cars ended up drifting through the corners. Loeb's, Sordo's and Grönholm's lead times so far ahead of anyone else's, so the interest in Stage 15 was on Hirvonen and Atkinson. Only eight-tenths of a second made the difference between a fourth-place position and five points, and fifth-placed position and four points. Hirvonen, who was in fourth place, completed the stage in , and admitted, [...] " [...] a few small mistakes, and that can be it. Nothing more I can do. We'll see how Chris drives and hope for the best.". Atkinson drove opposite Grönholm on the stage, with Hirvonen watching from the sidelines. To beat Hirvonen, he had to complete the stage in [...] He was one-tenth of a second quicker than that, which won him the stage and fourth place in the rally.|$|R

50|$|Where {{snowfall}} is an issue, {{this system}} {{may not be}} practical: since the guide rail forms the return leg of the electrical circuit, accumulation of ice and snow on the rail could cause intermittent power interruptions to the vehicle. Also, as the vehicle does not place {{a significant portion of}} its weight on the guide wheel (most of it being supported by the rubber <b>tyres),</b> <b>snow</b> packed into the flangeways or atop the rail by road traffic could lift the guide wheel off the rail, leading the vehicle to go off course.|$|R
40|$|The {{friction}} {{of rubber}} on {{ice and snow}} surfaces is complex. Deeper scientific understanding is important for optimising performance of tyres in winter. Rubber, ice and snow systems exhibit frictional behaviour which depends on their material properties. The viscoelastic nature of rubber results in a higher real contact area compared to most other solids. At temperatures close or below the glass transition temperature, the frictional behaviour of rubber changes and its hardness increases. Thus, the real area of contact decreases, while the dissipation in {{the bulk of the}} rubber increases. Sliding of rubber on ice or snow leads to a temperature increase at the interface because of frictional heating, this can cause the surface to melt which decreases friction significantly. In this study we measured the friction of rubber on ice and snow and related the behaviour to mechanisms that occur. Key parameters affecting friction were examined and quantified. For this work a cold room and a new linear tribometer were specially designed and constructed. The rubber samples were made from various compounds and had different geometries. Typically they were the size of a “tread block element”. The geometries were chosen systematically to investigate the effects of surface area, sharp/rounded edges and sipes (small slits in the tread block that are used on <b>snow</b> <b>tyres).</b> A significant part of the work was developing consistent and reproducible ice and snow surfaces. New protocols were devised for these. The ice surfaces were made of de-ionised water, tap water and de-ionised water with salt. For the snow surface production: artificial snow was made and then compacted in a specially manufactured press, resulting in hard packed snow tracks for testing. Static and dynamic friction were investigated. Both were affected by speed, load, temperature and ice composition. The dynamic friction behaviour on ice was explained in terms of melt-water formation and the real area of contact of the rubber. The static friction was significantly affected by the losses inside the rubber bulk, the adhesive forces at the interface, and the time of stationary contact before the test. The investigation of rubber sliding on snow showed some similarities with sliding on ice; the surface of the rubber block slides over snow particles resulting in similar mechanisms as are seen on ice. However with snow there can also be a “ploughing” effect, where snow is cut by the leading edge of a sharp tread block. This effect contributes to friction. Experiments were made with simple rounded edged samples to avoid ploughing; the results showed the same trends as seen on ice, i. e. lower friction with increased speed, load and temperature. Investigations of siped tread blocks showed the same friction at low speeds as tread blocks without sipes. At higher speeds siped blocks exhibited less, or no, decrease in friction; more sipes gave less friction decrease. Our industrial collaborator, Michelin, made vehicle tests on <b>snow</b> using whole <b>tyres</b> with similar tread blocks. The trends they found were identical to our tests despite the dynamics of the system being more complex. This indicates how powerful the approach of using simple systematic experiments is for generating deeper understanding of the processes involved in sliding on ice and snow...|$|R
50|$|The opening {{stages of}} the rally {{presented}} {{a challenge to the}} drivers. Where the first pass through Le Moulinon—Antraigues was mostly dry, the Burzet—St. Martial stage was covered in <b>snow,</b> making <b>tyre</b> choice critical. With the cars running in the order that they finished the 2012 season, Sébastien Loeb was the first driver through the stages, and on his arrival at the end of Le Moulinon—Antraigues it was observed that the dry conditions had torn the studs free of his front tyres. This would become a problem that all of the leading teams would be faced with. Nevertheless, Loeb set the early pace, finishing the stage seventeen seconds ahead of team-mate Mikko Hirvonen and looked unchallenged until Sébastien Ogier set a stage time that was three and a half second faster, giving the Volkswagen Polo R WRC a stage win on the very first stage it contested. Meanwhile, Jari-Matti Latvala in the second Polo R, arrived late at a time control checkpoint before the second stage, and received a thirty-second penalty. Ogier and Loeb maintained their momentum through the snowy Burzet—St. Martial stage, but Loeb took the rally lead from Ogier by seven seconds. Dani Sordo, in the third works-supported Citroën DS3 WRC, retained third place despite a fast time from Juho Hänninen in the Qatar World Rally Team Fiesta RS that saw him pick up two places overall.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we have {{investigated}} how tyres with different road grip affect the stability of passenger cars equipped with Electronic Stability Control (ESC) systems during winter road conditions. The introduction of ESC in passenger cars has been very positive for traffic safety. An ESC system's function is however dependent on forces between road and tyres. Thus, {{it is not clear}} how important the tyre road grip performance is for the ESC system to function properly. Field tests on ice with six different drivers were used for assessing how well an ESC system can help the driver in a specific critical situation during slippery road conditions, namely a sudden double lane change. Four different studless winter tyres were used in the study: one studless winter tyre for Nordic conditions, and three studless winter tyres for central European conditions. The specific tyres were chosen to represent a large difference of road grip on ice and <b>snow,</b> and winter <b>tyre</b> tests in the media served as a guide for picking out the tyres...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} draw the {{attention}} of drivers to slippery conditions, ice warning sensors for application on carriageways have been developed. These are expected {{to react to the}} temperature of the road surface, which would be an advance compared with existing warning sensors in the vehicle that measure the air temperature. The aim of this project is to investigate the function of these types of ice warning sensors. This will be done both in a laboratory environment and in the field in the winter before and after the warning sensor has been exposed to the effect of studded <b>tyres,</b> <b>snow</b> ploughs and salting. The type of ice warning sensor that was available consisted of a yellow background plate with a symbol {{in the form of a}} snow star punched out from the middle. According to the manufacturer, this symbol was to change colour, from yellow to dark orange, at a temperature of + 2 °C.

40|$|Tyres {{are used}} in {{everyday}} life {{for a variety of}} practical and recreational tasks. Frictional behaviour of tyres on any surface is important for vehicle safety and control; this behaviour becomes more important when that surface is snow. The interaction of rubber and a snow surface is complex and a deeper understanding of both is needed in order to help develop better tyres. Outdoor full scale tyre test results were compared to results from indoor laboratory tests using a linear tribometer and a surface of compacted artificial snow; these were in excellent correlation allowing a systematic and comprehensive study of rubber friction on snow to be conducted in the laboratory. Rubber samples of varied rubber compositions and geometries were used to gain an understanding of friction on snow. Samples with varying glass transition temperature (Tg), dynamic rigidity (G*) and Payne effect (dependence of the dynamic moduli on the amplitude of the applied strain) were investigated along with samples with and without sipes. The rubber friction coefficient (μ) was measured as a function of velocity and temperature. The siped samples exhibited a higher μ than those without sipes. FE simulations, rubber friction tests for varying contact pressures and steel blade force tests were performed to evaluate contributions from ‘surface’ friction and ploughing separately. The increased μ was attributed to the ploughing force from the front edges of the ‘subblocks’ created by the sipes. Although it is well known in the industry that siped tyres grip well, {{this is the first time}} it has been explained how sipes grip effectively through a combination of ploughing and rubber snow interaction. A comprehensive study of varying rubber properties (Tg, G* and Payne effect) was conducted to better understand their impact on snow friction. The findings were evaluated using the WLF shift factor to account for the running frequency of the rubber from the snow surface roughness. G* was found to be the dominant parameter for rubber μ when considering running frequency. Increased μ values were exhibited by rubbers with a lower G*. The decreased G* makes the rubber more compliant, thus increasing the contact area between the rubber and the snow, in turn increasing μ. A better knowledge of the surface roughness of snow will aid the understanding of the interaction between rubber and <b>snow</b> for <b>tyres.</b> A method was developed to characterise the artificial snow surface utilising sectioning and imaging of chemically stabilised snow samples. From images of the snow surface before friction testing the average indentor size can be found, this is used to analyse the running frequency of the rubber. Qualitatively comparing the surfaces before and after rubber friction testing shows a decrease in surface profile aggressivity after a test; this is attributed to melting of the snow from frictional heating and snow grain fracture. Friction tests were conducted to directly compare rubber friction on snow and ice using round edged samples. Again it was found that the rubber with the decreased G* exhibited higher friction; this was seen on both snow and ice confirming G* as the dominant rubber property for both surfaces, regardless of the surface roughness change. It was found that at low temperatures ice had a higher μ than snow, while at high temperatures snow exhibited a higher μ than ice. It is hypothesised that this intriguing switch is due to the surface roughness change leading to differing contact areas both with and without melt water. This switch is not seen when a simple heat transfer model is used, confirming the effect as a surface roughness change. The use of a modified Hertz model shows that indentation is the dominant mechanism at low velocities on snow. It is hypothesised that at high velocities melt water dominates on both snow and ice while adhesion may have a more significant role on ice at low velocities. These findings provide knowledge that can be used in the design of <b>tyres</b> for <b>snow</b> and ice in the future...|$|R
