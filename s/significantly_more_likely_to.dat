5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children were <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> exhibit poor peer relationships.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two studies}} on the {{incidence}} of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample were <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in maltreated rather than neglected toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|Personal traits such as age, gender, location, and {{education}} correlate, either positively or negatively, with HIV/AIDS awareness levels. For example, older women have demonstrated {{higher levels of}} knowledge regarding HIV/AIDS than younger women in Malawi. Because men typically have greater access to education and other social resources, they are often more knowledgeable about HIV prevention and transmission than women. While men are, on average, able to list 2.2 ways to prevent HIV transmission, women are only able to list 1.5 ways. Only 38% of women surveyed in 2003-2004 understood that their husbands {{would be less likely}} to contract HIV if they used condoms during intercourse with prostitutes and other women from high-risk groups. In addition, men who are raised in urban environments are, on average, more informed about HIV/AIDS than men who are raised in rural environments, presumably because urban children typically have greater access to educational resources than rural children. Among both men and women, higher levels of education correspond to increased knowledge about HIV/AIDS: men and women who have received secondary school educations are <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> understand complex aspects of the disease, such as the fact that people who appear healthy can still be HIV-positive, than those who have not. Finally, people who have lost friends or family members to the disease are likely to have greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS due to their personal, firsthand exposure to the problem.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD. Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD {{have been found to be}} <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss of caregivers in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{persistence}} of hardship from middle age to old age. Proposed status maintenance models suggest that stratification of economic status occurs over the life course (e. g., little mobility is seen within the income distribution). Some studies have found evidence to support this, but none have looked at broader measures of well-being. Using 29 years (1968 - 96) of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the author employs hypothesis tests (t-tests) and logistic regression techniques {{to examine the relationship}} between middle-age chronic hardships and adverse old-age outcomes. In almost every case, individuals who experience middle-age chronic hardships are <b>significantly</b> (statistically) <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> experience adverse old-age outcomes. ...|$|R

Indians earn higher incomes than Malays, the other major minority group. Indians are also <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> hold university degrees than these groups.

50|$|For most sperm recipients, {{anonymity}} of the donor {{is not of}} major importance at the obtainment or tryer-stage. Anonymous sperm is often less expensive. Another reason that recipients choose anonymous donors is concern about {{the role that the}} donor or the child may want the donor to play in the child's life. Sperm recipients may prefer a non-anonymous donor if they anticipate disclosing donor conception to their child and anticipate the child's desire to seek more information about their donor in the future. A Dutch study found that lesbian couples are <b>significantly</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> (98%) <b>to</b> choose non-anonymous donors than heterosexual couples (63%). Of the heterosexual couples that opted for anonymous donation, 83% intended never to inform their child of their conception via sperm donation.|$|R
40|$|Objective: Many {{forms of}} {{contraception}} {{are available on}} prescription only for example, the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) and long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). In this analysis we aim to identify key determinants of prescription contraceptive use. Design: Cross-sectional population survey. Data on sociodemographic indices, concerns about the OCP and perceived barriers to access were collected. Setting: Data set constructed from a representative population-based telephone survey of community dwelling adults in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) Participants: 1515 women aged between 18 and 45 ?years Main outcome measure: Self-reported user of the OCP or LARCs (intrauterine contraception, contraceptive injections or subdermal contraceptive implants) in the previous 12 ?months. Results: For {{at least some of}} the previous year, 35 % had used the OCP and 14 % had used LARCs, while 3 % had used two or more of these methods. OCP users were <b>significantly</b> younger, <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be unmarried and had higher income than non-users. Overall, 68 % agreed with the statement ‘that taking a break from long-term use of the contraceptive pill is a good idea’ and 37 % agreed with the statement that ‘the OCP has dangerous side effects’ and this was the strongest predictor variable of non-use of the OCP. Intrauterine contraception users were <b>significantly</b> older, <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be married and had lower income than non-users. Injections or subdermal contraceptive implant users were significantly younger, less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be married, had lower income and were less <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> agree that taking a break from long-term use of the pill is a good idea than non-users. Conclusions: Prescription contraceptive use is sociodemographically patterned, with LARCs in particular being associated with lower incomes in the RoI. Concerns about the safety of the OCP remain prevalent and are important and modifiable determinants of contraceptive-related behaviour...|$|R

The paper finds that financial optimism {{has a significant}} positive effect on risk taking behaviour. Optimistic investors choose risky portfolios over risk-free portfolios for their investments and have higher debt borrowing. We use more than 660, 000 observations from the British Household Panel Survey covering the period 1991 to 2007 in our analysis. Optimistic, pessimistic and neural respondents have significantly different demographic characteristics. Optimists are <b>significantly</b> younger, <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be male, have higher educational qualifications, <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have business ownership, borrow more personal debt and take on a larger mortgage than non-optimists.

The finding that only wage subsidies are effective for immigrants is in contrast with recent meta-analyses’ conclusion for the unemployed in general that job search assistance programmes are also effective (Kluve, [2010], Card et al.
