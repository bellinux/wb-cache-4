A high pass filter (HPF) was designed to detect arc signal only. The HPF consists of 2 -stage coupling capacitors and detection impedance, and its low cut-off frequency of- 3 dB was estimated to 3 kHz.

40|$|Arc {{fault is}} one of the most {{critical}} reasons for electrical fires. Due to the diversity, randomness and concealment of arc faults in low-voltage circuits, it is difficult for general methods to protect all loads from <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults. From the analysis of many <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults, a large number of high frequency signals generated in circuits are found. These signals are easily affected by Gaussian noise which is difficult to be eliminated as a result of frequency aliasing. Thus, a novel detection algorithm is developed to accurately detect <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults in this paper. Initially, an autoregressive model of the mixed high frequency signals is modelled. Then, autoregressive bispectrum analysis is introduced to analyze common <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> fault features. The phase information of arc fault signal is preserved using this method. The influence of Gaussian noise is restrained effectively. Afterwards, several features including characteristic frequency, fluctuation of phase angles, diffused distribution and incremental numbers of bispectrum peaks are extracted for recognizing arc faults. Finally, least squares support vector machine is used to accurately identify <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults from the load states based on these frequency features of bispectrum. The validity of the algorithm is experimentally verified obtaining arc fault detection rate above 97 %...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Arc {{fault is}} one of the most {{important}} reasons of electrical fires. The common characteristics of <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults are always submerged in load currents which are acquired as mixed signals. It is difficult to extract useful arc fault characteristics through conventional approaches. Hence, novel approaches based on blind source separation and harmonic analysis are developed for characteristic research of <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults. At first, a low-voltage arc fault experimental platform was set up to generate arc faults of different loads, and a large number of load currents were acquired to analyze fault characteristics. When <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults occurred in circuits, currents would distort a little. Then, in order to obtain current minor changes, blind source separation (BSS) was used to separate distortions from observed mixed signals. Finally, common characteristics of <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults were found. The amplitudes of odd harmonic components in arc fault currents change rapidly. The total odd harmonic ratio fluctuates tempestuously with inconstancy but increases a lot. These harmonic characteristics provide very important bases for arc fault detection...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{prevalence}} of DC sources and loads {{has resulted in}} DC distribution being re-considered at a micro-grid level. However, in comparison to AC systems, {{the lack of a}} natural zero crossing has traditionally meant that protecting DC systems is inherently more difficult – this protection issue is compounded when attempting to diagnose and isolate fault conditions. One such condition is the <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> fault, which poses significant protection issues as their presence negates the logic of overcurrent protection philosophies. This paper proposes the IntelArc system to accurately diagnose <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults in DC systems. IntelArc combines time-frequency and time domain extracted features with hidden Markov models to discriminate between nominal transient behavior and arc fault behavior across a variety of operating conditions. Preliminary testing of the system is outlined with results showing that the system has the potential for accurate, generalized, diagnosis of <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults in DC systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – It is {{well known}} that <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults in Low Voltage DC (LVDC) {{distribution}} system occur at unintended points of discontinuity within an electrical circuit. These faults can make circuit breakers not respond timely due to low fault current. It, therefore, is needed to detect the series fault for protecting circuits from electrical fires. This paper proposes a novel scheme to detect the <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> fault using Wavelet Singular Value Decomposition (WSVD) and state diagram. In this paper, the fault detector developed is designed by using three criterion factors based on the RMS value of Singular value of Approximation (SA), Sum of the absolute value of Detail (SD), and state diagram. LVDC distribution system including AC/DC and DC/DC converter is modeled to verify the proposed scheme using ElectroMagnetic Transient Program (EMTP) software. EMTP/MODELS is also utilized to implement the <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> model and WSVD. Simulation results according to various conditions clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{power demand}} in {{aircraft}} has grown significantly {{over the last}} century, and this trend continues with the More Electric Aircraft (MEA) and All Electric Aircraft (AEA) concepts. Higher voltages such as 270 VDC are required to deliver additional power to loads and to optimise aircraft mass. Increased voltages inflict more stress on the Electrical Wiring Interconnect System (EWIS) and increase the impact of <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults caused by wiring defects. Solid State Power Controllers (SSPCs) are used to provide fast protection in high voltage distribution systems. The aim of this work is the characterisation, modelling, simulation and detection of <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults in 28 VDC and 270 VDC electrical power distribution systems featuring SSPCs. The majority of passive detection schemes in the literature were designed based on empirical data rather than well characterised electric arc parameters, and thus nuisance trips are unavoidable. To address this <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults in 28 VDC and 270 VDC solid state power distribution systems were characterised using the SAE 5692 "Loose terminal" method [8], and {{it was found that}} 270 VDC arc faults cause a minimal 5. 6...|$|R
40|$|A {{mismatch}} in a photovoltaic array implies {{differences in}} the I-V characteristics of the modules forming the array {{which can lead to}} significant energy losses known as mismatch losses. The sources of mismatch losses could be easy- or difficult-to-predict sources. This thesis proposes novel designs for photovoltaic arrays to reduce mismatch losses. The mismatch from easy-to-predict sources and its resulting losses can be reduced by altering the interconnection of the array. Therefore, this thesis proposes an optimal total-cross-tied interconnection, based on a thorough mathematical formulation, which can significantly reduce mismatch losses from easy-to-predict sources. Application examples of the operation of the optimal total-cross-tied interconnection under partial shading are presented. The effect of partial shading caused by easy- or difficult-to-predict sources can be considerably reduced by photovoltaic array reconfiguration. This thesis proposes a novel mathematical formulation for the optimal reconfiguration of photovoltaic arrays to minimize partial shading losses. The thesis formulates the reconfiguration problem as a mixed integer quadratic programming problem and finds the optimal solution using branch-and-bound algorithm. The proposed formulation can be used for equal or non-equal number of modules per row. Moreover, it can be used for fully reconfigurable or partially-reconfigurable arrays. Application examples of the operation of the reconfigurable photovoltaic array under partial shading are presented. Finally, the recently updated American National Electric Code requires the presence of a <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> fault detector in any Photovoltaic installation operating at a voltage {{greater than or equal to}} 80 V. However, the Photovoltaic market nowadays lacks the presence of an accurate <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> fault detector that can detect <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults and discriminate between them and partial shading. The work in this thesis proposes an algorithm that can detect <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> faults and discriminate between them and partial shading in total-cross-tied arrays. This algorithm is based on the measurement of instantaneous row voltages. 1 yea...|$|R

40|$|Most of the arc {{fault that}} occur in the low voltage {{switchboard}} starts at the joint. This paper presents a fundamental concept of using an alternative and simple approach to detect the <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> that occurs in the low voltage switchboard. The voltage detector is designed based on the voltage drop at the joint when the <b>series</b> <b>arc</b> occurs. Since non-linear loads produce harmonics and the harmonic content at the point of coupling varies from time to time, thus it is difficult to detect the arc in frequency domain. Therefore, the current detector is designed based on the shoulder and asymmetry properties of the arc fault current in time domain. Various arc models are investigated and the suitable models are implemented. The simulation result reveals that the circuit breaker is able to isolate the main supply from the load when all the relays from the detectors are energized {{in order to avoid the}} possibility of arc flash...|$|R
