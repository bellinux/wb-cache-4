50|$|Matton Shipyard is a {{historic}} shipyard and canal boat service yard located on Van Schaick Island at Cohoes in Albany County, New York. It consists of eight extant buildings, various surviving features, and archaeological remains dating to the period 1916 to 1983 when the site functioned as a <b>shipyard,</b> <b>repair</b> facility, and towboat operation on the New York State Barge Canal and Champlain Canal. Extant buildings include the office / stores (c. 1916-1917), watchman's building (c. 1936-1943), sheet metal shop (c. 1937-1938), carpenter shop (c. 1916 and 1936-1943), stores building (c. 1941-1943), pipeshop (c. 1936-1943), pitch building (pre-1936), garage (c. 1916), and electric building. Also on the property are a flagpole (c. 1916), dock, steel launching ramps, fence, and camels. Numerous ruins also occupy the property. The motor ship Day Peckinpaugh is berthed here.|$|E

50|$|Born into a U.S. Air Force {{family in}} 1949, O'Neill's growing up years were spent on many Air Force bases {{throughout}} the United States, {{at a time}} when piston-engined aircraft a generation or two behind the B-17 were still in wide use. His Air Force upbringing fostered a lifelong interest in World War II aviation history. After graduating from the University of Maryland in 1971, O'Neill served with the U.S. Navy for three years, first as a destroyer gunnery officer and then as a <b>shipyard</b> <b>repair</b> officer at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. Upon leaving military service he became an attorney and the General Counsel of Curtiss-Wright Corporation, the aviation company that had manufactured the P-40 Warhawk fighter and the Cyclone B-17 engines during World War II. In 2001 O'Neill left corporate life to enter the private practice of law. As of 2013 he manages a very active immigration and employment law firm based in Morristown, New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|On 7 February 1980, Barb {{deployed}} to the mid-Pacific region to conduct equipment tests and procedure evaluations {{and to take}} part in the multinational exercise, RIMPAC 80. Based at Pearl Harbor, she carried out those missions until early April when she returned to San Diego. Another seven-week upkeep period followed, after which she resumed local operations out of San Diego. The submarine continued to pursue training assignments locally until July. On 21 July, Barb entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for an unusually extensive overhaul, which lasted until late 1982. The propulsion plant underwent steam generator cleaning. The fire control and sonar systems were replaced with the latest AN/BQQ-5 sonar and digital fire control technology. Barb received the complete SUBSAFE package of modifications the Navy first began installing on submarines in the 1960s. What was to have been an 18-month overhaul stretched into 27 months due to <b>shipyard</b> <b>repair</b> quality problems and scheduling delays. Barb underwent not one but four sea trials as each trial identified additional re-work to be done at the shipyard. Barb eventually returned to the Point Loma submarine base in San Diego, California in December 1982. Additional re-work was done in floating dry-dock in San Diego in early 1983.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{reported}} on an experimental program {{to research the}} effect of using blasted copper slag from <b>shipyard</b> <b>repair</b> and maintenance as replacement of fine aggregates in the sand-cement brick. 20 cubes of cement sand brick mixtures were produced with different blasted copper slag ratio ranging from 0 % (for the control mixture) to 60 %. All the sand-cement brick mixtures were tested for their compressive strength, density and water absorption at day 28 of air curing. There was a 16. 28 % improvement in the compressive strength of brick with 20 % replacement of copper slag as fine aggregates in comparison with control mixture. However, the addition of higher percentage of blasted copper slag as fine aggregates resulted in reduction of compressive strength but the density was increased. Also, the results of water absorption decreased as copper slag ratios in brick increases. The water absorption for 60 % of copper slag ratio in brick was the lowest absorption compared to 20 % of copper slag to sand ratio in brick. Hence, {{it is recommended that}} 0 % to 20 % of blasted copper slag may be used as a replacement of fine aggregates in order to obtain a good strength and low density of sand-cement brick. Index Terms—Blasted copper slag, compressive strength, leaching, stabilization and solidification. I...|$|E
