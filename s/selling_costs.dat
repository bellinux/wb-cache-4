Chicago {{was the center of}} the wholesale dry-goods trade, and in the 1860s Ward joined the leading dry-goods house, Field Palmer & Leiter, forerunner of Marshall Field & Co. He worked for Field for two years and then joined the wholesale dry-goods business of Wills, Greg & Co. In tedious rounds of train trips to southern communities, hiring rigs at the local stables, driving out to the crossroads stores and listening to the complaints of the back-country proprietors and their rural customers, he conceived a new merchandising technique: direct mail sales to country people. It was a time when rural consumers longed for the comforts of the city, yet all too often were victimized by monopolists and overcharged by the costs of many middlemen required to bring manufactured products to the countryside. The quality of merchandise also was suspect and the hapless farmer had no recourse in a caveat emptor economy. Ward shaped a plan to buy goods at low cost for cash. By eliminating intermediaries, with their markups and commissions, and drastically cutting <b>selling</b> <b>costs,</b> he could sell goods to people, however remote, at appealing prices.

50|$|To {{predict how}} <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> change with sales, a firm must {{distinguish}} between fixed <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> and variable <b>selling</b> <b>costs.</b> Recognizing {{the difference between}} fixed and variable <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> can help firms account for the relative risks associated with alternative sales strategies. In general, strategies that incur variable <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> are less risky because variable <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> will remain lower {{in the event that}} sales fail to meet expectations.|$|E

They might include promises to reimburse retailers for spending on cooperative advertising. Sales commissions represent one example of <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> that vary in proportion to revenue. Consequently, any sales commissions should be included in variable <b>selling</b> <b>costs.</b>|$|E

Compared to the brick-and-mortar type of stores, the online shopping retailers can save <b>selling</b> <b>cost,</b> such as rent and labor cost, and consumers who purchase items via online shopping site also can save time for shopping trips.

Furthermore, we examine how delivery manners affects retailer's and consumer's cost, concluding that the online shopping retailers should clearly introduce the delivery charge independent from {{the price of the}} items...|$|R

50|$|Rather than {{varying with}} unit sales, total {{variable}} <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> {{are more likely}} to vary directly with the monetary value of the units sold - that is, with revenue. Thus, {{it is more likely that}} variable <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> will be expressed as a percentage of revenue, rather than a certain monetary amount per unit. The classification of <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> as fixed or variable will depend on an organization’s structure and on the specific decisions of management. A number of items, however, typically fall into one category or the other - with the proviso that their status as fixed or variable can be time specific.

50|$|Net {{realizable value}} (NRV) {{is a method}} of {{evaluating}} a fixed or current asset's worth when held in inventory, {{in the field of}} accounting. NRV is part of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that apply to valuing inventory, so as to not overstate or understate the value of inventory goods. Net realizable value is generally equal to the selling price of the inventory goods less the <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> (completion and disposal). Therefore, it is expected sales price less <b>selling</b> <b>costs</b> (e.g. repair and disposal costs). NRV prevents overstating or understating of an assets value. NRV is the price cap when using the Lower of Cost or Market Rule.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} two-period dual-channel {{model for a}} durable goods {{manufacturer}} that can sell directly by its own e-channel and indirectly via an independent reseller to investigate how product durability and the channel structure create strategic issues that are significantly different from those in managing a dual channel for nondurables. Our game-theoretic model nests Arya et al. (2007) as a special case when product durability reduces to zero and thus generalizes it to the durable goods setting. The equilibrium solutions indicate that, when the product is durable, both parties' profitability strongly depends on product durability and direct <b>selling</b> <b>cost.</b> In particular, we find that, compared to encroaching the reseller's market by direct selling online, it is optimal for the manufacturer to open an inactive e-channel that serves only as an information medium. Moreover, we find that, contrary to Arya et al. 's (2007) results, if product durability is moderate, for any direct <b>selling</b> <b>cost,</b> manufacturer's encroachment is always detrimental to the reseller, and thus its bright side disappears. We test our model's theoretical predictions {{on the effects of}} product durability on manufacturer's and reseller's profitability with data from the U. S. x 86 computer server market, and find strong empirical support-profitability of both parties is higher when product durability is sufficiently low or sufficiently high, and lower when durability is intermediate...|$|R

[...] While on the other hand they assumed that [...] "the 'establishment expenses' (by which they meant administrative and <b>selling</b> <b>costs)</b> were, in the aggregate more or less constant, and should not be so allocated because that would 'have the effect of disproportionately reducing the cost of each, with every increase, and the reverse with every diminution of business'."
