60|$|And it {{was then}} that his {{strength}} suddenly flagged. His senses began to reel. His breath, which had kept pace with the quick beating of his heart, intermitted, hesitated, was lost! Above the advancing thunder of hoofs behind him, he thought he heard a woman's voice. He knew now he was going crazy; he shouted and fell; he rose again and staggered forward a few steps and fell again. It was over now! A sudden sense of some strange, subtle perfume, beating up through the acrid, <b>smarting</b> <b>dust</b> of the plain, that choked his mouth and blinded his eyes, came swooning over him. And then the blessed interposition of unconsciousness and peace.|$|R

40|$|Inspired by the {{robustness}} and flexibility of biological systems, we are developing linguistic and programming tools {{to allow us}} to program spatial systems populated by vast numbers of unreliable components interconnected in unknown, irregular, and time-varying ways. We organize our computations around geometry, making the fact that our system is made up of discrete individuals implicit. Geometry allows us to specify requirements in terms of the behavior of the space occupied by the aggregate rather than the behavior of individuals, thereby decreasing complexity. So we describe the behavior of space explicitly, abstracting away the discrete nature of the components. As an example, we present the Amorphous Medium Language, which describes behavior in terms of homeostatic maintenance of constraints on nested regions of space. Increasingly, we are {{faced with the prospect of}} programming spatially embedded mesh networks composed of huge numbers of unreliable parts. Projects in such diverse fields as sensor networks (e. g. NEST [12]), peer-to-peer wireless (e. g. RoofNet [2]), smart materials (e. g. <b>smart</b> <b>dusts</b> [16, 26]), and biological computation [18, 30, 31] all envision using networks of large size (ranging fro...|$|R

50|$|In 1997, Kristofer S. J. Pister, a {{professor}} of electrical engineering and computer sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, conceived of and started the <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> project with DARPA funding.|$|E
5000|$|Still {{more of an}} UGS {{research}} program, under DARPA, is <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust,</b> {{which is}} a program for developing massively parallel networks of hundreds or thousand [...] "motes," [...] {{on the order of}} 1 mm3.|$|E
60|$|After a few moments, {{he noticed}} that the sun shone down between the houses and it was getting hot. He felt thirsty, and the glare hurt his eyes, which <b>smarted</b> with the <b>dust</b> and acrid vapor that hung about the spot. All the soldiers, however, had not gone back; several lay in strange, slack attitudes near the front of the barricade, and a rebel who sprang down, perhaps with the object of {{securing}} fresh cartridges, suddenly dropped. The rest lay close and left the fallen alone. Then a tall priest in threadbare cassock and clumsy raw-hide shoes came out of a house {{and with the help of}} two or three others carried the victims inside. Cliffe heard somebody say that it was Father Agustin.|$|R
50|$|A {{phased array}} antenna 100 Âµm in {{diameter}} could produce 300 GHz beams only a few degrees in diameter, instead of the 180 degree radiation from tsa conventional metal antenna of that size. Potential uses include <b>smart</b> <b>dust,</b> low-power terabit wireless networks and photonics.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> project {{attempted}} {{to demonstrate that}} a complete sensor/communication system could be made of sensors one cubic millimeter in size. This involved advances in miniaturization, integration, and energy management.

50|$|Neural dust is a {{term used}} to refer to millimeter-sized devices {{operated}} as wirelessly powered nerve sensors. The sensors may be used to study, monitor, or control the nerves and muscles and to remotely monitor neural activity. In practice, a medical treatment could introduce thousands of neural dust devices into human brains. The term is derived from <b>smart</b> <b>dust,</b> as the sensors used as neural dust may also be defined by this concept.|$|E
50|$|Kristofer Pister is a {{professor}} at the University of California, Berkeley, where he has taught since 1997. Prior to that he was {{a professor}} at the University of California Los Angeles. He is generally attributed as the inventor and key implementer of smartdust, and is the founder and current CTO of Dust Networks, a company commercializing the <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> concept. Dust Networks was then bought by Linear but still kept its original name (Dust Networks).|$|E
5000|$|A <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> {{research}} proposal {{was presented to}} DARPA written by Kristofer S. J. Pister, Joe Kahn, and Bernhard Boser, all from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1997. The proposal, to build wireless sensor nodes with a volume of one cubic millimeter, was selected for funding in 1998. The project led to a working mote smaller than a grain of rice, and larger [...] "COTS Dust" [...] devices kicked off the TinyOS effort at Berkeley.|$|E
50|$|The {{concepts}} for <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> {{emerged from}} a workshop at RAND in 1992 {{and a series of}} DARPA ISAT studies in the mid-1990s due to the potential military applications of the technology. The work was strongly influenced by work at UCLA and the University of Michigan during that period, as well as science fiction authors Stanislaw Lem, Neal Stephenson and Vernor Vinge. The first public presentation of the concept by that name was at the American Vacuum Society meeting in Anaheim in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Smartdust is {{a system}} of many tiny {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) such as sensors, robots, or other devices, that can detect, for example, light, temperature, vibration, magnetism, or chemicals. They are usually operated on a computer network wirelessly and are distributed over some area to perform tasks, usually sensing through radio-frequency identification. Without an antenna of much greater size the range of tiny <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> communication devices is measured in a few millimeters {{and they may be}} vulnerable to electromagnetic disablement and destruction by microwave exposure.|$|E
5000|$|Sensors {{are useful}} devices that collect {{information}} related to a specific parameter, such as noise, temperature, humidity, pressure, etc. Sensors are increasingly connected via wireless to allow large scale collection of sensor data. With a large sample of sensor data, analytics processing {{can be used to}} make sense out of these data. The connectivity of wireless sensor networks rely on the principles behind wireless ad hoc networks, since sensors can now be deploy without any fixed radio towers, and they can now form networks on-the-fly. [...] "Smart Dust" [...] was one of the early projects done at U C Berkeley, where tiny radios were used to interconnect <b>smart</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E
50|$|Nanotechnology miniaturizes normal objects, in {{this case}} a guitar. It can be used to create tiny cameras, scales and {{listening}} devices. An example of this is <b>smart</b> <b>dust,</b> which can be either a camera or a listening device smaller than a grain of sand. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. For comparison, a human hair is about 200,000 nanometers thick. The nano guitar is about as long as one-twentieth of the diameter of a human hair, 10 micrometers or 10,000 nanometers long. The six strings are 50 nanometers wide each. The entire guitar is the size of an average red blood cell. The guitar is carved from a grain of crystalline silicon by scanning a laser over a film called a 'resist'.|$|E
50|$|As stated earlier, {{the most}} common size of mobile {{computing}} device is pocket-sized that can be hand-held, but other sizes for mobile devices exist too. Mark Weiser, known {{as the father of}} ubiquitous computing, computing everywhere, referred to device sizes that are tab-sized, pad and board sized, where tabs are defined as accompanied or wearable centimetre-sized devices, e.g. smartphones and smart cards, and pads are defined as hand-held decimetre-sized devices, e.g., laptops and tablet computers. If one changes the form of the mobile devices in terms of being non-planar, one can also have skin devices and tiny dust-sized devices. Dust refers to miniaturised devices without direct HCI interfaces, e.g., micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), ranging from nanometres through micrometers to millimetres. See also <b>Smart</b> <b>dust.</b> Skin: fabrics based upon light emitting and conductive polymers and organic computer devices. These can be formed into more flexible non-planar display surfaces and products such as clothes and curtains, see OLED display. See also smart device.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> {{concept has}} been around for almost a decade now, but its {{application}} in transport domain has only been recently investigated. This is a very valuable area of research, as <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> â being generally perceived as the low-cost, ubiquitous sensor of the future â can {{play an important role in}} Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Our involvement in several transport-related UK and EU funded projects (such as ASTRA [1], EMMA [5], and TRACKSS [7]) gave us the opportunity to carry out feasibility experiments and to develop demonstrations of <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> applications in transport domain. We have also investigated how <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> can be used in collaboration with other (more traditional) transport sensors for developing better Co-operative Transport Systems (CTS). This position paper outlines what we have learnt from using <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> in transport domain, and provides an illustration on the important role that the <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> technology can play in future ITS. WHAT IS <b>SMART</b> <b>DUST?</b> <b>Smart</b> <b>dust</b> is a network of micro-electro-mechanical devices (also known as motes), which are typically composed of a processing unit, some memory, and a radio chip, which allows them to communicate wirelessly with other <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> devices within range. This wireless capability makes it possible for <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> devices to form a Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) â a collection of mobile computing devices which cooperate to form a dynamic network without using fixed infrastructure. These devices can also be equipped with additiona...|$|E
40|$|<b>Smart</b> <b>dust</b> {{is a set}} of a {{vast number}} of ultra-small fully {{autonomous}} computing and communication devices, with very restricted energy and computing capabilities, that co-operate to quickly and efficiently accomplish a large sensing task. <b>Smart</b> <b>dust</b> can be very useful in practice i. e. in the local detection of a remote crucial event and the propagation of data reporting its realization. In this work we continue our effort towards the research on <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> from a basic algorithmic point of view. Under a simple but realistic model for <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> we present an interesting problem, which is how to propagate efficiently information on an event detected locally. Then we present anew <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> protocol, which we call the "Sleep-Awake" protocol, for information propagation that explicitly uses the energy saving features (i. e. the alteration of sleeping and awake time periods) of the <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> particles. By using both some simple probabilistic analysis and extensive experiments, we provide some first concrete results for the success probability and the time and energy efficiency of the protocol, in terms of parameters of the <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> network. We note that the study of the interplay of these parameters allows us to program the <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> network characteristics accordingly. Â© 2003 IEEE...|$|E

40|$|Abstract-It is matter {{happiness}} for us, while presenting this paper. It {{gives an}} immense pleasure & satisfaction {{in bringing out}} this paper on <b>SMART</b> <b>DUST.</b> <b>SMART</b> <b>DUST</b> is an emerging technology made up from tiny, wireless sensors or motes.

It is light in weight that they can remain suspended in the environment like an ordinary dust particle.

40|$|<b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> {{has been}} {{conceived}} as a system of millimeter scale autonomous devices that {{form the basis for}} massively distributed wireless sensor networks [1] and [2]. In the present paper we review our proposed development of <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> as self-organised swarms of miniature communication/sensor devices useful for remote monitoring in space exploration [3]. The underpinning miniaturised wireless/ computing network technology required is very similar to nanotechnology systems, known as Smart Specks (part of a large consortium in Scotland [4]) that are already being fabricated at the University of Glasgow Nanoelectronics Research Centre for applications in collective computer intelligence, wireless distributed systems and smart RF-ID tagging. In our space application we address the key requirement of how <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> motes can be enabled to move in synchronisation and to navigate over large distances autonomously. We first observe that with diameters and densities comparable to sand particles the behaviour of passive dust is comparable to the movement of airborne sand which has a considerable range on earth and on planets such as Mars [5, 6]. A possible application for <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> would be to launch several tens of thousands of <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> elements into a wind borne environment on a remote sensing mission involve navigation and data gathering/sensing over a period of time. Casualties would be inevitable. Finally, the surviving <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> swarm would re-group into a phased array for transmission of data back to a remote spacecraft. The wireless networking of such a system is critical and complicated by the short range of available transmitter technologies and appropriate power supplies. Harvesting of local power has been investigated for: solar power, microwave absorption and collisional self-charging. However, the central problem is how to arrange for the collective self-organised motion of the <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> ensemble in the presence of hostile terrain and weather. We have investigated the possibility of dynamically changing the shape of the <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> elements so as to permit controlled navigation. Algorithms have been devised for the adaptive shape change of <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> modes that permits a change in drag coefficient depending on location and heading. Monte Carlo simulations were performed for passive and <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> [3] for swarms of <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> devices transporting in the wind-dominated environment of the Martian landscape. It is concluded that relatively simple shape changing algorithms with nearest neighbour wireless communications augmented by longer range Small Worlds links are sufficient for long-range synchronised navigation. Practically all the energy requirements are met by entrainment of the <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> in the wind flow provided reasonable fluctuations exist. The implementation of the shape-changing has been investigated experimentally and theoretically through the use of an electro-active polymer sheath encasing each mote. As a bonus this methodology also is a basis for energy storage through impacts with passive sand. We are also studying scaled-down versions of self-organising <b>smart</b> <b>dust</b> for applications in liquid environments. A scaled-up version for application to probes to distant solar systems is also under study...|$|E

40|$|<b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> sensor {{networks}} â {{consisting of}} cubic millimeter scale sensor nodes capable of limited computation, sensing, and passive optical communication with a base station â are envisioned to fulfill complex large scale monitoring tasks {{in a wide}} variety of application areas. In many potential <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> applications such as object detection and tracking, finegrained node localization plays a key role. However, due to the unique characteristics of <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust,</b> traditional localization systems cannot be used. In this paper we present and analyse the Lighthouse location systems, a novel laser-based location system for <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust,</b> which allows tiny dust nodes to autonomously estimate their location with high accuracy without additional infrastructure components besides a modified base station device. Using an early 2 D prototype of the system, node locations could be estimated with an average accuracy of about 2 % and an average standard deviation of about 0. 7 % of the nodeâs distance to the base station. ...|$|E
40|$|The new {{technology}} is the INTERNET OF THINGS, the general concept of the Internet of Things {{is that we can}} put a sensor on anything and have it send data back to a database through the Internet. In this way we can monitor everything, everywhere and build smarter systems that are more interactive than ever before. Now what if the sensors were in the air, everywhere? They could monitor everything temperature, humidity, chemical signatures, movement everything. The technology is called Brainy mote or <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust.</b> <b>Smart</b> <b>dust</b> is tiny electronic devices designed to capture mountains of information about their surroundings while literally floating on air like dust. <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> is a self-contained network of tiny motes each having the capability of sensing and monitoring the environment conditions. <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> is made of âmotesâ which are tiny sensors that can perform a variety of functions.

40|$|A deep bibliographic {{research}} on current femtosatellites layouts {{has led to}} a spacecraft design suitable for solar sailing purposes. A <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> equipped with an ElectroChromic System (ECS) concept has been proposed as candidate satellite for heliocentric mission scenarios. In this context, the aim of the current work consists of demonstrating that an ECS-based femtosatellite, after having moved away from the deployer, is able to approach again the chief for sending the collected data. A <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> has a characteristic side length and a small weight that allows the generation of a propulsive thrust by exploiting the solar radiation pressure. The electrochromic coating applied on the <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> surface exposed to the sunlight is used to vary the sail attitude following a proper control law. No relevant works on the <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> attitude control proposed in this work are currently available in specific literature, so the collected results could constitute the basis for an innovative way to exploit the opportunities offered by an ECS-based femtosatellite. A mathematical model has been developed and implemented on MATLAB software, {{in order to determine the}} relative motion of a <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> with respect to a chief satellite covering a heliocentric circular orbit both in a linearised and a non-linearised form. The preliminary analysis of the mission scenario treated in this work has highlighted that the analytical results of the linearised model are often not precise. However, if the non-linear model is used, an accurate determination of the relative motion in which the <b>Smart</b> <b>Dust</b> reapproaches the chief spacecraft can be obtained...|$|E
