25|$|Speech {{intelligibility}} enhancement, James M. Kates of Signatron (1984). This {{system uses}} Dugan's automatic mixing algorithm to reconstitute several spectral regions of {{a signal that}} has been divided into frequency bands for <b>short-time</b> spectral analysis {{in order to achieve}} greater intelligibility of spoken consonants.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} {{in general is}} that wavelets are localized in both time and frequency whereas the standard Fourier transform is only localized in frequency. The <b>Short-time</b> Fourier transform (STFT) {{is similar to the}} wavelet transform, in that it is also time and frequency localized, but there are issues with the frequency/time resolution trade-off.|$|E
25|$|When {{applied to}} filters, the result implies that one cannot achieve high {{temporal}} resolution and frequency resolution {{at the same}} time; a concrete example are the resolution issues of the <b>short-time</b> Fourier transform—if one uses a wide window, one achieves good frequency resolution {{at the cost of}} temporal resolution, while a narrow window has the opposite trade-off.|$|E
25|$|Pasteurization is {{the reason}} for milk's {{extended}} shelf life. High-temperature, <b>short-time</b> (HTST) pasteurized milk typically has a refrigerated shelf life of two to three weeks, whereas ultra-pasteurized milk can last much longer, sometimes two to three months. When ultra-heat treatment (UHT) is combined with sterile handling and container technology (such as aseptic packaging), it can even be stored unrefrigerated for up to 9 months.|$|E
25|$|When {{assessing}} rated amplifier power output, it {{is useful}} to consider the applied load, the signal type (e.g., speech or music), required power output duration (i.e., <b>short-time</b> or continuous), and required dynamic range (e.g., recorded or live audio). In high-powered audio applications that require long cables to the load (e.g., cinemas and shopping centres) it may be more efficient to connect to the load at line output voltage, with matching transformers at source and loads. This avoids long runs of heavy speaker cables.|$|E
25|$|The eight-hour day {{movement}} or 40-hour week movement, {{also known as}} the <b>short-time</b> movement, was a social movement to regulate the length of a working day, preventing excesses and abuses. It was started by James Deb and had its origins in the Industrial Revolution in Britain, where industrial production in large factories transformed working life. The use of child labour was common. The working day could range from 10 to 16 hours, and the work week was typically six days a week.|$|E
25|$|As {{alternatives}} to the Fourier transform, in time-frequency analysis, one uses time-frequency transforms or time-frequency distributions to represent signals {{in a form that}} has some time information and some frequency information – by the uncertainty principle, there is a trade-off between these. These can be generalizations of the Fourier transform, such as the <b>short-time</b> Fourier transform or fractional Fourier transform, or other functions to represent signals, as in wavelet transforms and chirplet transforms, with the wavelet analog of the (continuous) Fourier transform being the continuous wavelet transform.|$|E
25|$|Finally, infant {{formulas}} are {{heat treated}} {{to maintain the}} bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either retort sterilization or high-temperature <b>short-time</b> (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then spray drying would be required in addition. Retort sterilization is a traditional retort sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118°C. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2–3 seconds) treatment at 142°C. Because of the short time used, there is little protein denaturation, but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.|$|E
25|$|Braathens SAFE started flying {{scheduled}} services to Hamar from 16 May 1956, using de Havilland Herons. Hamar was an intermediate {{stop on the}} route between Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Trondheim Airport, Værnes, which also called at Røros Airport. Braathens remained until 1958, when they replace the Herons with the larger Fokker F27 Friendships on the route. These could not land on the short runway at Stafsberg, so Hamar was dropped from the service. Braathens stated that they never made any money from operating at Hamar. As a <b>short-time</b> replacement, Solbergfly started a route which connected Notodden Airport, Tuven with Oslo and Hamar, using a Cessna 310. However, the route was abandoned after a single season.|$|E
25|$|The Works Constitution Act of 1972 {{required}} {{in cases of}} collective dismissal at an establishment normally employing more than twenty employees that management and the works council must negotiate a social plan that stipulates compensation for workers who lose their jobs. In cases where the two parties could not agree on a social plan, the law provided for binding arbitration. In 1972, the rights of works councils to information from management were not only strengthened, but works councils were also provided with full codetermination rights {{on issues such as}} working time arrangements in the plant, the setting of piece rates, plant wage systems, the establishment of vacation times, work breaks, overtime, and <b>short-time</b> work. Legislation was passed which acknowledged {{for the first time the}} presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils.|$|E

Sheila explains that {{she is also a}} sex addict, like Sam, and that Sam and she {{met for the first time}} at one of group meetings of sexual addicts. Frasier begs her not to tell Sam about their <b>short-time</b> affair. Suddenly, Sam arrives into the room and then, in order to be honest to her, confesses to Sheila that, at the day of their engagement, Sam slept with another woman twice. Then Sheila confesses that she slept with other two regular patrons: Paul ("short, bald, fat") and then Cliff Clavin. Though he forgives her dalliance with Paul, Sam is disgusted to learn about Cliff and breaks off his relationship with Sheila. (When she turns to Frasier for help, he is equally disgusted about Cliff.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Often, signals can be {{represented}} well as a sum of sinusoids. However, consider a non-continuous signal with an abrupt discontinuity; this signal can still {{be represented}} as a sum of sinusoids, but requires an infinite number, which is an observation known as Gibbs phenomenon. This, then, requires {{an infinite number of}} Fourier coefficients, which is not practical for many applications, such as compression. Wavelets are more useful for describing these signals with discontinuities because of their time-localized behavior (both Fourier and wavelet transforms are frequency-localized, but wavelets have an additional time-localization property). Because of this, many types of signals in practice may be non-sparse in the Fourier domain, but very sparse in the wavelet domain. This is particularly useful in signal reconstruction, especially in the recently popular field of compressed sensing. (Note that the <b>short-time</b> Fourier transform (STFT) is also localized in time and frequency, but there are often problems with the frequency-time resolution trade-off. Wavelets are better signal representations because of multiresolution analysis.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Commission's powers {{allowed it}} to specify {{policies}} for each Poor Law Union, and policy {{did not have to}} be uniform. [...] Implementation of the New Poor Law administrative arrangements was phased in, starting with the Southern counties whose problems the Act had been designed to address. There was a gratifying reduction in poor-rates, but also horror tales of paupers ill-treated or relief refused. Some paupers were induced to migrate from the Southern to Northern towns, leading to a suspicion in the North that the New Poor Law was intended to drive wages down. By 1837, when roll-out of the new arrangements reached the textile districts of Lancashire and Yorkshire, trade was in recession. The usual response to this was for hours of work to be reduced, with pay reducing correspondingly and out-door relief being given to those who could not make ends meet on <b>short-time</b> earnings. This was clearly incompatible with a policy of [...] "no out-door relief", and, despite assurances from the Poor Law Commission that there was no intention to apply that policy in the textile districts, they were not believed and a number of textile towns resisted (or rioted in response to) efforts to introduce the new arrangements. This resistance was eventually overcome, but outdoor relief was never abolished in many Northern districts, although the possibility existed. Policy officially changed after the passing of the Outdoor Labour Test Order, which [...] "allowed" [...] outdoor relief.|$|E

The good influences of music on the whole body of children have likewise been surprisingly proved. Obviously another of the immense advantages of the <b>Short-Time</b> system to the cause of good education is the great diminution of its cost, and of the period of time over which it extends.
