25|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Kelpie were simply (black) dogs, called Colleys or Collies. The word collie has the same root as coal and collier (a ship). Some of these collies were imported to Australia for <b>stock</b> <b>work</b> in the early 19th century, and were bred to other types of dogs (possibly including the occasional Dingo), but always {{with an eye to}} working sheep without direct supervision. Today's Collie breeds were not formed until about ten or 15 years after the Kelpie was established as a breed, with the first official Border Collie not brought to Australia until after Federation in 1901.|$|E
25|$|In 1937 the Southern Railway {{carried out}} a {{thorough}} review of {{the technical aspects of}} the line, now 40years old. This led to an immediate proposal to order new rolling stock in five-car formations, in association with the provision of escalators at the City station. The scheme was delayed and the declaration of war on 3 September 1939 led to cancellation of the escalator scheme. However the rolling <b>stock</b> <b>work</b> was considered to be well advanced, and 12 motor coaches and 16 trailers were ordered from English Electric, and built at the Dick, Kerr works at Preston.|$|E
25|$|Not all Africanized hives {{display the}} typical hyper-defensive behavior, which may provide bee breeders {{a point to}} begin {{breeding}} a gentler <b>stock.</b> <b>Work</b> {{has been done in}} Brazil towards this end, but in order to maintain these traits, it is necessary to develop a queen breeding and mating facility in order to requeen colonies and to prevent reintroduction of unwanted genes or characteristics through unintended cross-breeding with feral colonies. In Puerto Rico, some bee colonies are already beginning to show more gentle behavior. This is believed to be because the more gentle bees contain genetic material that is more similar to the European honey bee although they also contain African honey bee material. Also while bee incidents are much less common than they were during the first wave of Africanized bee colonization, this can be largely attributed to modified and improved bee management techniques. Prominent among these are locating bee-yards much further from human habitation, creating barriers to keep livestock at enough of a distance to prevent interaction, and education of the general public to teach them how to properly react when feral colonies are encountered and what resources to contact. The Africanized bee is considered the bee of choice for beekeeping in Brazil.|$|E
