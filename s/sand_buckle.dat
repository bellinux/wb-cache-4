40|$|Abstract. For plate steel castings, the foundry {{technology}} was designed {{according to the}} dynamic directional solidification of proportional solidification theory. Adopting chilling process for the thick and large plane, it may cause the casting basically even cooling. Using self-feeding shrinkage in solidification achieved the dynamic directional feeding of molten steel, and the casting was poured and congealing at the same time. The shrinkage of finally congealing part was fed by small riser. Adopting this foundry technology, the large plane downwards avoided appearing the defects such as <b>sand</b> <b>buckle,</b> slag, pinhole porosity, and pore, etc.; the process yield was greatly increased with this foundry technology, too...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} metallographic examination of faults {{occurring in the}} course of founding thin-walled cast-iron castings in furan resin sand molds. A non-conformance of the scab type was Observed on surface of the casting as well as <b>sand</b> <b>buckles</b> and cold shots. Studied the chemical composition by means of a scanning electron microscope in a region of casting defects: microanalysis point and microanalysis surface. Around the observed defects discloses high concentration of oxides of iron, manganese and silicon. A computer simulation of the casting process has been carried out with the objective to establish the cause of occurrence of cold shots on casting surface. The simulation was carried out with the use of NovaFlow & Solid program. We analyzed the flowing metal in the mold cavity. The main reason for the occurrence of casting defects {{on the surface of the}} casting was gating system, which caused turbulent flow of metal with a distinctive splash stream of liquid alloy...|$|R
50|$|On June 4, 2008, Sand was {{piloting}} {{his personal}} airplane, a Cessna 172, {{on a flight}} from Bismarck, North Dakota to Fargo, North Dakota. At approximately 11:00 a.m. CDT, the plane experienced engine problems, and Sand was forced to land in a corn field near {{the small town of}} Nortonville, North Dakota, which is located about twenty-six miles south of Jamestown, North Dakota. According to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, the plane came down in the corn field's soft soil, bounced, flipped forward and landed upside down. <b>Sand</b> was <b>buckled</b> into the pilot's seat, but was out of the aircraft before emergency responders arrived. He was evaluated by medical personnel {{at the site of the}} crash and in Edgeley, North Dakota. Reports the following day indicated that Sand received a small cut on his forehead along with several bruises, but was otherwise uninjured in the accident.|$|R
