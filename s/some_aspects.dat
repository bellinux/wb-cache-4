5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements had a real life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was aware of. These included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. <b>Some</b> <b>aspects</b> of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
5|$|Conceived by series creators Michael Schur and Greg Daniels, Ron {{has been}} a central {{character}} since the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. Offerman had some input into the character's creation, and <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> of Ron's personality were inspired by the actor, like his affinity for woodworking and 16-year-old Lagavulin Single Malt Scotch. The traits of the character were also partially inspired by a real-life Libertarian elected official in Burbank, California.|$|E
5|$|Douglas Seale as The Sultan, the pompous, but kind {{ruler of}} Agrabah, who desperately {{tries to find}} a suitor for his {{daughter}} Jasmine. <b>Some</b> <b>aspects</b> of the character were inspired by the Wizard of Oz, to create a bumbling authority figure.

5|$|Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's sarcastic, foul-mouthed parrot assistant. Much like Robin Williams, Gottfried {{was given}} freedom to improvise his lines.

5|$|He {{seemingly}} rejected <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> of van Eyckian realism, {{notably in}} his depictions of shadows, and his unwillingness to apply transparent glazes. As a colourist, Lochner was more inclined towards the International Gothic style, {{even if this}} inhibited realism. He did not utilise the newly developed Netherlandish techniques of representing perspective, but rather indicated distance through the diminution of parallel objects.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, {{another son}} of Merthyr Tydfil, Jack Jones, based his novel, Off to Philadelphia in the Morning , {{on the events}} in the life of Joseph Parry. The book became a BBC three-part {{presentation}} of the same name in 1978.

5|$|Lastly, {{he played}} {{at least some}} part in the {{establishment}} of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, passing the cipher manuscripts from which it was founded to his friend William Wynn Westcott shortly before his death.

5|$|More {{recently}} still, Trollope {{scholars have}} looked upon it with increasing favour, describing it {{as a powerful}} work that has suffered undeserved neglect. Present-day critics have focussed increasingly on the Carry Brattle subplot; it has been suggested, {{supported in part by}} the similarity of passages from The Vicar, from the Autobiography, and from The Small House at Allington referring to Johnny Eames, that <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> of her portrayal are based on the novelist's own early adulthood in London.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} {{on the effects of}} partial epileptic seizures on consciousness found that patients who suffer from partial epileptic seizures experience altered states of consciousness. In partial epileptic seizures, consciousness is impaired or lost while <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> of consciousness, often automated behaviors, remain intact. Studies found that when measuring the qualitative features during partial epileptic seizures, patients exhibited an increase in arousal and became absorbed in the experience of the seizure, followed by difficulty in focusing and shifting attention.|$|E
5|$|The English sailor Robert Knox {{described}} {{walking into}} the island’s Tamil country in the publication An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon, referencing <b>some</b> <b>aspects</b> of their royal, rural and economic life and annotating some kingdoms within it on a map in 1681CE.

Using the cursed plasm that {{shapes the}} Underworld, a sin-eater can remove <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> of the target, or force <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> {{of the world}} to ignore him.
