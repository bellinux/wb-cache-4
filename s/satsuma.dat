5|$|<b>Satsuma,</b> {{named for}} <b>Satsuma</b> Province, was laid down at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 15 May 1905. She was {{launched}} on 15 November 1906 with Emperor Meiji, the Navy Minister, and other high officials {{on hand for}} the ceremony, and completed on 25 March 1910. At the time of her launching, <b>Satsuma</b> had the largest displacement of any battleship in the world.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{initially}} agreed to these demands, on January 17, 1868, Yoshinobu {{declared that he}} would not be bound by the Restoration proclamation and called for its rescission. On January 24, he decided to prepare an attack on Kyoto, occupied by <b>Satsuma</b> and Chōshū forces. This decision was prompted by his learning of a series of arsons in Edo, starting with the burning of the outerworks of Edo Castle, the main Tokugawa residence. This was blamed on <b>Satsuma</b> rōnin, who on that day attacked a government office. The next day shogunate forces responded by attacking the Edo residence of the daimyō of <b>Satsuma,</b> where many opponents of the shogunate, under Takamori's direction, had been hiding and creating trouble. The palace was burned down, and many opponents killed or later executed.|$|E
5|$|Yoshitaka's son Yoshinao {{served in}} the Imperial Japanese Army, and fought in the <b>Satsuma</b> Rebellion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Satsumas</b> {{grown in}} humid areas may be ripe while {{the skin is}} still green.|$|R
50|$|Dan Moroboshi {{is portrayed}} by , {{who is also}} Ultra Seven's voice actor and Jiro <b>Satsuma's</b> actor.|$|R
50|$|Kian wrote a Gunki monogatari called Kian Nikki ("Kian Diary") during King Shō Hōs reign. It {{is a very}} {{important}} account of <b>Satsumas</b> invasion.|$|R
5|$|Aki was {{refitting}} at Kure and <b>Satsuma</b> {{was assigned}} to the 1st Battleship Squadron when World War I began in August 1914. The latter served as Rear Admiral Tatsuo Matsumura's flagship in the Second South Seas Squadron as it seized the German possessions of the Caroline and the Palau Islands in October 1914. <b>Satsuma</b> rejoined the 1st Battleship Squadron in 1915, was refitted at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in 1916 and served with the 1st Squadron {{for the rest of the}} war. Aki was also assigned to the 1st Squadron upon the completion of her refit and remained with it until she was transferred to the 2nd Battleship Squadron in 1918.|$|E
5|$|For artillery, wooden cannons, {{only able}} to fire 3 or 4 shots before bursting, coexisted with {{state-of-the-art}} Armstrong guns using explosive shells. Armstrong guns were efficiently used by the troops of <b>Satsuma</b> and Saga throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|Western interpretations {{include the}} 2003 American film The Last Samurai {{directed}} by Edward Zwick, which combines {{into a single}} narrative historical situations belonging both to the Boshin War, the 1877 <b>Satsuma</b> Rebellion, and other similar uprisings of ex-samurai during the early Meiji period. The elements of the movie pertaining to the early modernization of Japan's military forces {{as well as the}} direct involvement of foreign (mostly French) forces relate to the Boshin War and the few years leading to it. However, the suicidal stand of traditionalist samurai forces led by Saigō Takamori against the modernized Imperial army relate to the much later <b>Satsuma</b> Rebellion.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{the area}} has become home to a large peach {{business}} and <b>satsumas,</b> once destroyed by freezing temperatures, have now returned to commercial production in a more weather-hardy variety.|$|R
50|$|Other than tourism, one of {{the most}} {{important}} means of living for the villagers is the production of <b>satsumas</b> and tangerines. Almost 60% of the town land is covered with tangerine gardens.|$|R
50|$|Primarily an {{agricultural}} community, early crops consisted of mainly pears, <b>satsumas,</b> strawberries, and figs that were then sold in nearby Galveston. Later, {{in the early}} 1900s, many farmers switched over to rice and dairy farming, as they were more profitable and stable commodities.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, on 28 January 1868, the naval Battle of Awa between the Shogunate and {{elements}} of the <b>Satsuma</b> Navy took place. This was Japan's second engagement between two modern navies. The battle, although small in scale, ended in favour of the Shogunate.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{bombardment}} of Kagoshima, the <b>Satsuma</b> domain had become {{closer to the}} British and was pursuing the modernization of its army and navy with their support. The Scottish dealer Thomas Blake Glover sold quantities of warships and guns to the southern domains. American and British military experts, usually former officers, may have been directly involved in this military effort. The British ambassador Harry Smith Parkes supported the anti-Shogunate forces in a drive to establish a legitimate, unified Imperial rule in Japan, and to counter French influence with the Shogunate. During that period, southern Japanese leaders such as Saigō Takamori of <b>Satsuma,</b> or Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru of Chōshū cultivated personal connections with British diplomats, notably Ernest Mason Satow.|$|E
5|$|<b>Satsuma</b> {{rejoined the}} 1st Battleship Squadron in 1915, was {{refitted}} at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in 1916 {{and served with}} the 1st Squadron {{for the rest of}} the war. Sometime during the war, she was fitted with two 12-pounders on high-angle mounts to serve as anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
50|$|Mandarin oranges (tangerines, <b>satsumas)</b> {{are one of}} {{the basic}} species. Even {{pure-bred}} ones are genetically diverse. Many varieties commercially called mandarins are actually hybrids. Most are hybrids with sweet oranges, but some are hybrids with lemons. Some are hybrids with pomelos (and thus like sweet oranges).|$|R
50|$|Menderes district, {{which is}} notable for its <b>satsumas,</b> {{beautiful}} bays and historical riches, is 20 km from İzmir. The antique city of Lebedos {{is situated in}} the western corner of the district in Ürkmez locality. Ruins of Kolophon, Klaros, Notion and Lebedos, which are along the Menderes-Selçuk road are {{next to each other}} and make up the important archeological sites of the province. Gümüldür municipality is the region that produces the world-famous tangerine breed of <b>satsumas.</b> Özdere is one of the important tourism resorts of the Aegean coast. Beads of various colors and shapes which are produced by the locals in Görece village are particularly of note. The area was called Cumaovası and was a township in the Konak (Centre) district before it became a district in 1988.|$|R
50|$|Three years later, Shō Hō {{was named}} Prince of Nakagusuku and given Nakagusuku magiri as his domain. King Shō Nei died without an heir in 1621, and Shō Hō was {{selected}} to succeed him. As the first king to be enthroned since <b>Satsuma's</b> invasion in 1609, formal permission and acknowledgment of the king's authority and legitimacy was required before performing the coronation ceremony, sending heralds to China, and assuming {{the responsibilities of the}} throne. In addition, while Shō Hō retained powers related to organization of offices and administration of punishments, along with all the ritual prestige of the throne, Shō Nei was the last king of Ryukyu to rule personally, directly, and absolutely as monarch. Much of the decisions and behavior of Shō Hō's government were subject to <b>Satsuma's</b> approval.|$|R
5|$|She was lightly {{damaged by}} a typhoon on 22 September 1912. <b>Satsuma</b> was {{assigned}} to the 1st Battleship Squadron when World War I began in August 1914. She served as Rear Admiral Tatsuo Matsumura's flagship in the Second South Seas Squadron as it seized the German possessions of the Caroline and the Palau Islands in October 1914.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, {{apparently}} {{distressed by}} the imperial approval {{given to the}} actions of <b>Satsuma</b> and Chōshū, fled Osaka aboard the Kaiyō Maru, withdrawing to Edo. Demoralized by his flight and by the betrayal by Yodo and Tsu, Shogunate forces retreated, making the Toba-Fushimi encounter an Imperial victory, although it is often considered the Shogunate forces should have won the encounter. Osaka Castle was soon invested on February 8 (on March 1, Western calendar), {{putting an end to}} the battle of Toba-Fushimi.|$|E
5|$|The {{forces of}} Chōshū and <b>Satsuma</b> were fully modernized with Armstrong guns, Minié rifles and one Gatling gun. The Shogunate forces had been {{slightly}} lagging {{in term of}} equipment, although the French military mission to Japan (1867–1868) had recently trained a core elite force. The Shogun also relied on troops supplied by allied domains, which were not necessarily as advanced in terms of military equipment and methods, composing an army that had both modern and outdated elements.|$|E
50|$|Under the Tanaka {{classification}} system, mikans, <b>satsumas,</b> tangerines etc. {{are considered}} to be divided into different species, including Citrus unshiu and Citrus tangerina. Under the Swingle system, all these {{are considered to}} be groups of mandarin varieties. Unshius and tangerines genetically resemble mandarins, but the genetics are still not thoroughly studied.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was said}} that Komatsu Tatewaki, who {{attacked}} Tenryū-ji, where the Chōshū forces’ headquarters was located, distributed to commoners who suffered from fires from the war the rice that {{was left in the}} temple by the enemy forces. In the wake of this battle, <b>Satsuma’s</b> influence in Kyoto became further strengthened.|$|R
50|$|He was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} the principles of <b>Satsuma's</b> swordsmanship school, Jigen-ryū, into Ryūkyū kobujutsu (Ryūkyūan traditional martial arts) and he is credited with creating the foundation for the bōjutsu of Tsuken. He passed on Jigen-ryū to some of his students, including Ankō Asato and Itarashiki Chochu. The Tsuken Bō tradition was perfected by Tsuken Seisoku Ueekata of Shuri.|$|R
5|$|However, {{military}} movements by imperial forces, partisan {{violence in}} Edo, and an imperial decree promoted by <b>Satsuma</b> and Chōshū abolishing {{the house of}} Tokugawa led Yoshinobu to launch a military campaign to seize the emperor's court in Kyoto. The military tide rapidly turned {{in favor of the}} smaller but relatively modernized imperial faction, and after a series of battles culminating in the surrender of Edo, Yoshinobu personally surrendered. Those loyal to the Tokugawa retreated to northern Honshū and later to Hokkaidō, where they founded the Ezo republic. Defeat at the Battle of Hakodate broke this last holdout and left the imperial rule supreme throughout the whole of Japan, completing the military phase of the Meiji Restoration.|$|E
5|$|Imperial troops mainly used Minié rifles, {{which were}} much more accurate, lethal, and had a much longer range than the smoothbore Gewehr guns, although, being also muzzle-loading, they were {{similarly}} limited to two shots per minute. Improved breech-loading mechanisms, such as the Snider, developing {{a rate of about}} ten shots a minute, are known to have been used by troops of the Chōshū Domain against the Shogunate's Shōgitai, at the Battle of Ueno in July 1868. In {{the second half of the}} conflict, in the northeast theater, Tosa Province troops are known to have used American-made Spencer repeating rifles. American-made handguns were also popular, such as the 1863 Smith & Wesson Army No 2, which was imported to Japan by the Scottish trader Thomas Blake Glover and used by the <b>Satsuma</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|Through rich {{cultural}} exchange with China and Korea {{facilitated by the}} proximity to the continent, iron manufacture had been practiced on Kyūshū (Saikaidō) since earliest times. Swordsmiths were active from the Heian period onwards. Initially the Yamato school's influence is evident all over the island. However, distance from other swordmaking centers such as Yamato or Yamashiro caused the workmanship to remain static as smiths maintained old traditions and shunned innovations. Kyūshū blades, therefore, demonstrate a classic workmanship. The old Kyūshū smiths are represented by Bungo Yukihira from Bungo Province, the Miike school active in Chikugo Province and the Naminohira school of <b>Satsuma</b> Province. Two old blades, one by Miike Mitsuyo and the other by Bungo Yukihira, and five later blades from the 14th century, have been designated as national treasures from Kyūshū. They originate from three provinces: Chikugo, Chikuzen, and Bungo. Generally Kyūshū blades are characterized by a sugata that looks old having a wide shinogi. The jihada is mokume-hada that tends to masame-hada or becomes ayasugi-hada. The jigana is soft and there are ji-nie and chikei present. The hamon is small midare made up of nie and based on suguha. The edge of the hamon starts just above the hamachi.|$|E
5000|$|As of 2005 the {{interior}} of the complex includes various microfarms located on yards. The microfarms have a variety of plants growing herbs and vegetables native to Vietnam, including calamondins, choy greens, limes, night jasmine, melons, mints, papaya trees, peppers, and <b>satsumas.</b> Josh Harkinson of the Houston Press said that when one enters the complex, it [...] "unfurls like a lotus flower." ...|$|R
50|$|Upon his death, Shō Nei {{was buried}} {{not in the}} royal {{mausoleum}} at Shuri, but rather at Urasoe Castle. Popular belief says this is because he felt that by succumbing to <b>Satsuma's</b> invasion, he had deeply dishonored himself before his ancestors, and was unfit to be buried with them. However, Shō Nei was originally from Urasoe, so a more mundane explanation may be the truer one.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{thereafter}} in January 1868, the Boshin War (War of the Year of the Dragon) {{started with}} the Battle of Toba-Fushimi in which Chōshū and <b>Satsuma's</b> forces defeated the ex-shogun's army. This forced (or allowed) the Emperor to strip Yoshinobu of all power, {{setting the stage for}} official restoration. On January 3, 1868, the Emperor made a formal declaration of the restoration of his power: ...|$|R
25|$|Shimazu Nariakira {{was born}} at the <b>Satsuma</b> domain's estate in Edo, on April 28, 1809. He rose to power as daimyō of the domain of <b>Satsuma</b> only after {{surviving}} a gruesome and arduous war within his own family and domain, known as the Oyura Sōdō or the Takasaki Kuzure. He faced much opposition in <b>Satsuma</b> since {{he spent most of}} his life in Edo; as such he was considered a stranger in his own domain. In his quest to prepare <b>Satsuma</b> for potential Western aggression, he also faced many opposing military schools of thought in <b>Satsuma</b> who disagreed with the Shimazu family’s plan for strengthening coastal defense.|$|E
25|$|In April 1609, <b>Satsuma</b> Domain {{launched}} a second {{invasion of the}} Ryukyu Kingdom. Within a month, they conquered the Amami Islands {{in the face of}} fierce resistance on all but Okinoerabu Island. After <b>Satsuma</b> landed on Kouri Island, across from Unten Harbor, Ryukyu sent a thousand soldiers, commanded by Nago Ryōhō, to reinforce Nakijin Castle. On 30 April, Nago Ryōhō's force met the <b>Satsuma</b> army near Nakijin, but retreated after sustaining a 50% casualty rate; Nakijin was captured and razed and Shō Kokushi, the garrison commander and the heir to the Ryukyuan throne, died from wounds sustained in the battle. <b>Satsuma</b> landed in Yomitanzan unopposed on 3 May, advancing overland towards Shuri and by sea towards Naha. Ryukyu was able to stop and drive <b>Satsuma</b> away from Naha, but <b>Satsuma</b> was able to capture Urasoe Castle and cross the Taihei Bridge, surrounding Shuri Castle. After fierce resistance, Shuri fell on 6 May and King Shō Nei surrendered.|$|E
25|$|During the Edo period, the Sakoku Edict of 1635 led to {{the strict}} {{seclusion}} of Japan from the outside world. However, the <b>Satsuma</b> Domain, which spanned the provinces of <b>Satsuma,</b> Ōsumi, and the southwestern part of Hyūga, maintained trade relations with neighbouring countries by using the Ryukyu Islands as a conduit, and by advocating that the islands distinctively formed an independent kingdom, even though in reality, the <b>Satsuma</b> Domain had conquered the Ryūkyū Kingdom in 1609. The invasion of Ryukyu had assured Satsuma's place {{as one of the}} most powerful feudal domains in Tokugawa Japan, and would also set a precedent for <b>Satsuma</b> as a vital role in later overthrowing the Tokugawa shogunate and initiating the Meiji Restoration.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Satsumas</b> {{were also}} {{grown in the}} United States from the early 1900s, but Japan {{remained}} a major supplier. U.S. imports of these Japanese oranges was suspended due to hostilities with Japan during World War II. While they {{were one of the}} first Japanese goods allowed for export {{after the end of the}} war, residual hostility led to the rebranding of these oranges as [...] "mandarin" [...] oranges.|$|R
50|$|During these times, the Amami {{people found}} their joys in local liquors made from sugarcanes, awamori bought from Ryukyu, and folk songs sung with sanshin. Their folk songs {{evolved into a}} style {{different}} from that of Ryukyu, and still remain as a part of their culture today. Under <b>Satsuma's</b> rule, names of Amami people underwent a great change, and they are today known for many unique one-character surnames.|$|R
5000|$|Nariakira died {{suddenly}} in 1858. He was succeeded by his half-brother Shimazu Hisamitsu, to whom Shō Tai {{was obliged to}} formally swear anew the oath of loyalty to the Shimazu clan {{that he and his}} ancestors had sworn since 1611. Hisamitsu reversed his half-brother's policies regarding Ryukyu's interactions with the West; <b>Satsuma's</b> radical opposition to foreign influence was a driving force in the events of the following decade in Japan.|$|R
