50|$|ACE-1 {{perennial}} cereal (PC) rye {{has been}} developed in Canada as a new crop for silage and green-feed production. The rye was developed by first crossing <b>Secale</b> <b>cereale</b> <b>L.</b> (rye) and Secale montanum (perennial wild rye), then backcrossing the produced F1 generation with <b>Secale</b> <b>cereale</b> <b>L.,</b> and selecting for the perennial types. Beneficial characteristics of the crop include early growth in spring, competing well with weeds, and producing significant regrowth for silage or pasture. PC rye also has an extensive root system {{that can be used}} to improve soil tilth and prevent soil erosion during the fall and winter months. The newly developed crop has not shown significant susceptibility to disease. The new cultivar is currently being further evaluated to test for adaptation and yield potential. These characteristics could make this species an attractive crop to be used in the future.|$|E

40|$|Wheat-rye 1 BL. 1 RS translocations {{have been}} widely used in wheat {{breeding}} programs. A 1 BL. 1 RS translocation wheat line, 91 S- 23, was developed from a 1 R monosomic addition of the rye (<b>Secale</b> <b>cereale)</b> inbred line <b>L</b> 155 into wheat (Triticum aestivum) MY 11. A new commercial wheat cultivar, CN 18, which also contained the 1 BL. 1 RS translocation, was derived from the cross MY 11 × 91 S- 23. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) indicated that the rye centromere was eliminated from the 1 BL. 1 RS chromosomes of CN 18 but not from 91 S- 23. Based on the 1 RS source and the centromeric structure of the translocation chromosome, CN 18 qualifies as a new wheat cultivar possessing a 1 BL. 1 RS translocation. CN 18 displayed high yield performance and resistance to powdery mildew and stripe rust, whereas 91 S- 23 was susceptible to these diseases. The present study provides a new 1 RS resource for wheat improvement...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract The primary {{aim of this}} study was to estimate ge-netic diversity among <b>Secale</b> <b>cereale</b> <b>L.</b> accessions using 22 previously published simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The plant material included 367 rye accessions comprising historical and contemporary cultivars, cultivated materials, landraces, and breeding strains from the Polish breeding com-pany Danko. The studied accessions represented a wide geo-graphical diversity. Several methods were employed to ana-lyze genetic diversity among the <b>Secale</b> <b>cereale</b> <b>L.</b> accessions and to determine population structure: principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), neighbor-joining (NJ), and Bayesian cluster-ing. We also defined a core collection of 25 rye accessions representing over 93 % of SSR alleles. The results of these analyses showed that accessions from the rye gene bank are clearly divergent in comparisonwith materials received direct-ly from European breeding companies. Our findings suggest also that the genetic pool of current rye cultivars is becoming narrower during breeding processes. The selected panel of SSR markers performed well in detection of genetic diversity patterns and can be recommended for future germplasm characterization studies in rye...|$|E
