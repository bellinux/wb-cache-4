Captain De Rosa descended quickly through several decks moving towards the ship's stern. An agitated voice came over the ship's loudspeakers requesting he come immediately to the bridge. Arriving there, De Rosa was faced by machine guns. The terrorists fired some shots into the deck and then <b>shouted</b> <b>in</b> Arabic. They demanded he sail the ship 300 miles to the northeast to the Syrian port of Tartus.|$|E
500|$|At {{the sight}} of hail and {{thunderstorm}} clouds, i.e. the ala that leads them, people did not just sit and wait– they resorted to magic. In the Pomoravlje region, this magic was assisted by ala’s herbs, picked in levees and the places on a field where a plow turns around during plowing. These locations were considered unclean because ale visited them. In folk spells of eastern Serbia, a particular ala could be addressed by a female personal name: Smiljana, Kalina, Magdalena, Dobrica, Dragija, Zagorka, etc. An expression for addressing an ala– Maate paletinke– is of uncertain meaning. One of the spells that was used upon sighting hail clouds, and which explicitly mentioned an ala, was <b>shouted</b> <b>in</b> {{the direction of the}} clouds: ...|$|E

500|$|Brown {{frequently}} {{finds himself}} in confrontations with opponents, often mocking them. Most memorable was during a Scottish Cup tie against Rangers at Ibrox in 2011 when he clashed several times with El-Hadji Diouf. [...] Matters {{came to a head}} when Brown scored Celtic's equaliser, then turned round in front of Diouf with his arms outstretched and stared directly at the Rangers player. Brown was yellow carded by the referee, but afterwards said [...] "It was the best booking I've had in my life." [...] In a physical encounter against Ross County in 2013, he was booked for goading and laughing at Mihael Kovačević after the Ross County defender rushed up to him and <b>shouted</b> <b>in</b> his face. [...] In August 2015, The Daily Record reported complaints from Qarabağ's Gara Garayev that several Celtic players mocked them during a Champions League qualifying, with Brown described as being [...] "the worst".|$|E
500|$|Although Parliamentary leaders, Vane among them, {{had promised}} Cromwell on 19 April 1653 to delay {{action on the}} {{election}} bill, Vane was likely one of the ringleaders that sought to have the bill enacted the next day before Cromwell could react. [...] Cromwell was however alerted by a supporter, and interrupted the proceedings that would otherwise have passed the bill. [...] Bringing troops into the chamber, he {{put an end to}} the debate, saying [...] "You are no Parliament. [...] I say you are no Parliament. [...] I will put an end to your sitting." [...] Vane protested, [...] "This is not honest; yea, it is against morality and common honesty", to which Cromwell <b>shouted</b> <b>in</b> response, [...] "O Sir Henry Vane, Sir Henry Vane; the Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane!" [...] This ended the commonwealth, and Cromwell began to rule as Lord Protector. [...] Vane, [...] "daily missed and courted for his assistance", was invited to sit on Cromwell's council, but refused.|$|E
500|$|Helen Faucit was critiqued by Henry Morley, a {{professor}} of English literature in University College, London, who thought the actress [...] "too demonstrative and noisy" [...] in the scenes before Duncan's murder with the [...] "Come, you spirits" [...] speech [...] "simply spouted" [...] and its closing [...] "Hold! Hold!" [...] <b>shouted</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "most unheavenly manner." [...] In the [...] "I have given suck" [...] speech, he thought Faucit [...] "poured out" [...] the speech {{in a way that}} recalled the [...] "scold at the door of a gin-shop." [...] Faucit, he believed, was [...] "too essentially feminine, too exclusively gifted with the art of expressing all that is most beautiful and graceful in womanhood, to succeed in inspiring anything like awe and terror." [...] He thought her talents more congenial to {{the second phase of the}} character, and found her [...] "admirably good" [...] in the banquet scene. Her sleepwalking scene, however, was described as having [...] "the air of a too well-studied dramatic recitation." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was the subject of {{controversy}} with the Asian community, as well as comedian Margaret Cho. In the film Full Metal Jacket, an Asian prostitute approaches US troops and offers to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. She uses terms such as [...] "Me so horny" [...] and [...] "me love you long time", which were heavily parodied and popularized. Accordingly, those terms have been used as humor at the expense of Asian people, and have been described as [...] "racial slurs" [...] by Cho. Other female acts have been known to use the phrase, such as Fergie on her track [...] "London Bridge" [...] (2006), and Nelly Furtado in [...] "Maneater" [...] (2006). In an interview with MTV News, Cho retracted her earlier comments, and expressed how if used in song, and by a female then it wouldn't be offensive: [...] "I don't mind it when it's used in songs, like when women use it," [...] Cho continued. [...] "Fergie uses it, that doesn't bother me. But when it's <b>shouted</b> <b>in</b> the street and they don't wait to hear the response? What if I was actually going to go, 'Oh, OK'? They never stick around to hear the answer." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{episode of}} MTV Unplugged {{starring}} Cyrus premiered through MTV on January 29, 2014; she performed an acoustic version of [...] "Wrecking Ball", among several additional tracks from Bangerz. On May 27, 2014 Cyrus performed the song during the World Music Awards held in Monte Carlo, Monaco; where she also won four World Music Awards. She wore a gown with a scenic theme based on flowers during the performance. It received positive reviews for its understated simplicity and strong vocal delivery. Cyrus returned {{to perform the}} song during the musical festival on June 21, 2014, Summertime Ball at Wembley Stadium of London, in front of 80,000 people. Cyrus has performed the song during her ongoing Bangerz Tour. A critic from the Nashville Scene praised the performance, writing, [...] "Wrecking Ball was sung by Miley and earnestly <b>shouted</b> <b>in</b> unison by the arena, some of the audience tearing up." [...] Blake Hannon praised Cyrus' vocal delivery, writing, [...] "The crowd kept going when things slowed down for Wrecking Ball. It was {{the highlight of the}} night, and not because of anything visual. The costumed characters vanished and the screen was black, with Cyrus belting out one of the best pop power ballads in recent memory with only a smattering of lights. It's a reminder that beneath it all, Cyrus has a voice — and a pretty big one, at that." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{his horse}} faltered and collapsed, Le Gris was thrown off {{and lost his}} axe. Undaunted, he rose and drew his longsword, turning to meet Carrouges who was already {{advancing}} on him, sword also drawn. Again the combatants traded blows, their weapons the only sounds heard in the silent battleground. Again, Le Gris' superior strength gave him an advantage, pushing Carrouges back before thrusting his blade through his opponent's thigh. As the crowd murmured, Le Gris made a fatal mistake; withdrawing his weapon, he stepped back to watch his wounded enemy and was thus off balance when the desperate Carrouges threw himself forwards, wrestling Le Gris {{to the ground and}} hacking at him with his own longsword. Although Le Gris' plate armour was too thick to allow Carrouges' weapon to penetrate, it was also so heavy that he could not regain his feet with Carrouges on top of him. Stranded on the ground, Le Gris struggled as Carrouges straddled him and used his sword to smash open the lock on Le Gris' faceplate. As the crowd watched in silence, Carrouges <b>shouted</b> <b>in</b> Le Gris' exposed face for him to confess his crime before death or face hell. Le Gris replied so all could hear, [...] "In the name of God, and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent of the crime". Enraged, Carrouges drew his misericordia and thrust it through Le Gris' throat, killing him instantly.|$|E
