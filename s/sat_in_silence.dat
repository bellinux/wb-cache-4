25|$|The {{success of}} a play, {{especially}} one's first success, is somewhat like pushing against a door which suddenly opens from the other side. One may fall on one's face or not, but certainly a new room is opened that was always securely shut until then. For myself, the experience was invigorating. It {{made it possible to}} dream of daring more and risking more. The audience <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> before the unwinding of All My Sons and gasped when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, I imagine, for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invented a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.|$|E
500|$|He noted how the {{procedure}} for imparting the knowledge had to be changed such that, certainly by the 1850s and possibly as early as 1830, the president's role was to select specimens from those brought to the meeting and identify them to the attendees, who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>silence.</b> Horsefield describes this change as being necessary because previously the president ...|$|E
500|$|Both the King and Queen were fond {{of their}} niece, Princess Victoria of Kent. Their {{attempts}} {{to forge a}} close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and the Duchess of Kent, the young princess' widowed mother. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Princess Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess of Kent would never be regent. He said, [...] "I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not {{in the hands of a}} person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed." [...] The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears, while her mother <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> and was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner (the two left the next day). William's outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria's tempered view of him as [...] "a good old man, though eccentric and singular". William survived, though mortally ill, to the month after Victoria's coming of age. [...] "Poor old man!", Victoria wrote as he was dying, [...] "I feel sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|The King then {{approached}} the Buddha {{and gave his}} salutation. Then, while standing, he saw how the Monks <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>silence,</b> calm like a still, waveless lake. He exclaimed: [...] "Can my beloved son, Udayi Bhadda, possess such calmness and composure as the Monks show me now?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Byatt's {{upbringing}} {{was fairly}} unhappy {{as she struggled}} against her domineering mother. She was educated at two independent boarding schools, Sheffield High School and the Quaker Mount School in York. She noted {{in an interview in}} 2009, [...] "I am not a Quaker, of course, because I'm anti-Christian and the Quakers are a form of Christianity but their religion is wonderful – you simply <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> and listened to the nature of things." ...|$|E
2500|$|After George Balanchine {{was hired}} by the Ballet Russe, he was {{attracted}} to Tallchief professionally and personally. She, however, was unaware of his attraction: [...] "It {{never occurred to me that}} there was anything more than dancing on his mind... It would have been preposterous to think there was anything personal." [...] Although their relationship became more personal, it was a shock to Tallchief when Balanchine asked her to marry him. During the summer of 1945, he asked her to meet him after a Los Angeles performance. Balanchine opened the car door for her; when she got in he <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> for a moment before saying, [...] "Maria, I would like you to become my wife". [...] "I almost fell out of my seat and was unable to respond", she recalled. [...] She eventually replied, [...] "But, George, I'm not sure I love you. I feel that I hardly know you." [...] He answered that it did not matter, and if the marriage only lasted a few years that was all right with him. After a day to think it over, Tallchief accepted his proposal.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, Imants Barušs, of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments using the methods of EVP investigator Konstantin Raudive, and the work of [...] "instrumental transcommunication researcher" [...] Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>silence</b> or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP. Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: [...] "While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense." [...] The findings were published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration in 2001, and include a literature review.|$|E
