50|$|The {{game was}} {{generally}} released {{in a large}} game unit, known as the Deluxe cabinet version, or a stand-alone smaller unit was available for smaller sites where space was an issue. The Deluxe cabinet variant permitted players {{to sit down and}} was a fully enclosed unit. The cabinet was designed to be folded into four separate pieces for transport, with the roof being fully removable, as is the floor, and the ends of the game come ready on <b>swivel</b> <b>wheels.</b> The game was very successful onsite for operators and although the Star Trek Voyager series has finished some two years prior to its release. The original license from Paramount Pictures was obtained by Frank J. Pelligreni, President of Team Play Inc, and proved to be a very successful design and product for the company. The license and distribution of the game was granted only to the United States, so no units were exported outside of the USA in brand new form, however, some units have been sold when 2nd hand and have made their way into collectors hands in Australia and possibly Japan, but less than half a dozen units,according to the games original designer, Teamplay Inc.|$|E

40|$|A {{large-scale}} combined legged and {{wheeled vehicle}} with anthropomorphic legs is presented. This concept combines {{the advantages of}} a walking machine with the stability of a wheeled vehicle. The leg utilises a spherical hip joint, a revolute knee joint and a passively pivoting foot. Due {{to the size of}} the system linear hydraulic actuators are used, and thus kinematic loops are created in the mechanism. This paper describes the closed-form recursive solution of the direct and the inverse kinematics, the statics for one leg and some results from computer simulations. 1 Introduction For the manipulation of heavy loads in unstructured environments combined legged and wheeled vehicles, often realized as walking excavators, can be used. These machines consist of a platform with two front legs and two <b>swivelling</b> <b>wheels</b> at the back. They combine the advantages of a walking machine [...] mobility in unknown terrain [...] with the higher stability of wheeled vehicles. Here the forward movement is provi [...] ...|$|R
30|$|Design 1.1 {{involves}} bespoke cargo boxes, specifically dimensioned to {{fit within}} {{the constraints of}} the current metro. The boxes would have detachable shelving that can be rearranged as needed, to suit different freight sizes. Using shelving allows different goods to be stored in one box while being easily differentiated, acting similar to a bento box [10]. The height of the box is just under that of the average human height, to allow the user to see ahead when manoeuvring the box. The boxes will be mounted with <b>swivel</b> <b>wheels</b> possessing brakes to allow them to be moved onto the metro by hand. This application eliminates the need for forklifts as these {{would not be able to}} load the cargo onto the metro effectively.|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the relationship between interhandle distances and upper limb exertion during simply pushing and pulling of a cart with four <b>swivel</b> <b>wheels,</b> defined by a roll box pallet (RBP) in a Japanese industrial standard. Methods: Six healthy young male participants were asked to push and pull an RBP at a distance of 5. 2  m under six conditions corresponding to different interhandle distances (40  cm, 60  cm, and 80  cm) and weights (130  kg and 250  kg). The upper limb exertion was studied by shoulder abduction and flexion, and elbow flexion, as well as surface electromyogram (EMG) in shoulder extensor, and elbow flexor and extensor. Participants were required to provide subjective evaluations on operability after each trial. Results: Subjective operability indicated that a narrower interhandle distance had a better operability for pushing. Interhandle distance was also related to upper limb exertion especially for pushing. A narrow interhandle distance caused smaller shoulder adduction but larger elbow flexion. The normalized EMG data revealed that muscular activity became smaller with a narrow interhandle distance in shoulder extensor. During the pulling task, elbow flexion was smaller at a narrow interhandle distance, although subjective operability and normalized EMG were not significantly varied. Conclusion: A wider interhandle distance, such as 80  cm, was not suitable in the forwardbackward movement of the RBP. Therefore, this study concluded that an interhandle distance of 40  cm would be suitable for pushing and pulling an RBP to protect the workers' hands against the risk of injury by installing inner handles...|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} flung back, and there stepped in upon the mat a man not {{particularly}} young for a lover, nor particularly mature {{for a person}} of affairs. There was reserve in his glance, and restraint upon his mouth. He carried a horn lantern which hung upon a <b>swivel,</b> and <b>wheeling</b> as it dangled marked grotesque shapes upon the shadier part of the walls.|$|R
5000|$|Chair Testing: Each {{patient was}} asked to walk 20-30 feet forward and {{backward}} toward the examiner. Patients {{were then asked to}} sit in a <b>swivel</b> chair with <b>wheels</b> and to propel the chair forward and backward.|$|R
50|$|A draughtsman's {{chair is}} a <b>swivel</b> chair without <b>wheels</b> {{that is usually}} taller than an 'office chair' for use {{in front of a}} drawing board. They also have a foot-ring to support the legs when it is not {{possible}} to reach the ground.|$|R
25|$|The {{company had}} been formed at Staten Island, New York in 1906 by Charles and Adolph Wittemann as Wittemann Aeronautical Engineers. The first {{aircraft}} built was a Wright pusher biplane in 1907, unusual for the time it had a <b>swivelling</b> tail <b>wheel.</b> A series of Wright pusher triplanes were built between 1908 and 1914 {{for a number of}} notable aviators. In 1911 they built a number of Hall-Scott pusher biplanes for Thomas Baldwin, known as the Baldwin Red Devil for the red-doped covering. Between 1913 and 1914 they built several Curtis-type biplanes.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development and}} certification of the H 1640 caster tool. This tool is used to rotate <b>swivel</b> caster <b>wheels</b> 90 degrees on bomb hand trucks or shipping containers. The B 83 is a heavy bomb system and weighs close to 5, 600 pounds for a two-high stack configuration. High castering moments (handle length times the force exerted on handle) are required to caster a wheel for a two-high stack of B 83 s. The H 1640 is available to the DoD (Air Force) through the Special Equipment List (SEL) for the B 83 {{as a replacement for}} the H 631 and H 1216 caster tools...|$|R

50|$|BRUTEs were a wheeled platform, {{generally}} with mesh {{around three}} {{sides of the}} body, the fourth side being open with canvas (or later plastic) straps for restraint of the load. The front included a panel for notes to be chalked to help sort traffic. A few BRUTEs had just the front, for carrying bulky loads {{too big for the}} cage, or two hinged ramps (no sides) to load or unload BRUTEs into railway vans. Each BRUTE had two fixed wheels at the rear and two <b>swivelling</b> caster <b>wheels</b> at the front, with polyurethane tyres and taper bearings. Coupling were at front and rear, the front being a pin, the rear a hinged loop on a sprung shaft. A lever on the front operated brakes on the rear wheels and lifted the coupling pin.|$|R
5000|$|A {{credenza}} desk (often simply, credenza) is {{a modern}} desk form usually placed next to a wall as a secondary work surface to that of another desk, such as a pedestal desk, in a typical executive office. When used as an active work surface, the credenza desk is often placed against the wall immediately behind or perpendicular to the main desk, but close enough that the user can reach it from the seated position at the main desk by simply <b>swivelling</b> and <b>wheeling</b> their office chair over to it. When its planned use is to be less frequent, such as holding books or files which are not regularly referenced, or {{to act as an}} extra surface to help facilitate larger meetings, credenza desks are often placed on a wall in some other location of the office, such as adjacent to a conference table if one is present. Many conference rooms which have meeting tables but not desks will also have a credenza desk against one wall. The credenza desk is sometimes flat, like a pedestal desk, {{but more often than not}} it has a stack of shelves, small drawers and other nooks, above its main working surface. The sum of these overhead amenities is usually called a hutch. Hence, the credenza desk is often called a [...] "credenza with hutch".|$|R
