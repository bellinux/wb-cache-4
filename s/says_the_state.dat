25|$|One can {{conclude}} that certain essential, or fundamental, rights should exist in any just society. It does not follow that each of those essential rights is one that we as judges can enforce under the written Constitution. The Due Process Clause is not a guarantee of every right that should inhere in an ideal system. Many argue that a just society grants a right to engage in homosexual conduct. If that view is accepted, the Bowers decision in effect <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> of Georgia {{has the right to}} make a wrong decision—wrong {{in the sense that it}} violates some people's views of rights in a just society. We can extend that slightly to say that Georgia's right to be wrong in matters not specifically controlled by the Constitution is a necessary component of its own political processes. Its citizens have the political liberty to direct the governmental process to make decisions that might be wrong in the ideal sense, subject to correction in the ordinary political process.|$|E

50|$|Through {{the late}} 1990s the {{majority}} of Denver's economy was concentrated in a few key sectors: energy, government and the military, technology, and agriculture. Over the next decade Denver and Colorado attracted new industries and the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade (OEDIT) <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> now has 14 core industries including health care, financial services and tourism. This diversification of the economy helped cushion the city and state from the global recession of 2008-2010. The fact that Denver's tax base is made up mostly of sales and income tax meant that it felt the economic downturn faster than others, but this meant it also recovered more quickly, helping Denver weather the recession better than many other U.S. cities reliant mainly on property taxes.|$|E
50|$|Within Tyndale’s {{political}} {{theories are}} the conceptual {{emergence of the}} modern state and nationalism. He <b>says</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> should not be divided into the monarchy and the church, with each fighting for supremacy, although he is not what is termed an “Erastian” (but neither was Erasmus himself): someone who believes that the church should be subordinate to the state. But Tyndale does not call for sedition. In Tyndale’s political system, the king is supreme in the state: “To preach God’s Word {{is too much for}} half a man. And to minister a temporal kingdom is too much for half a man also. Either other requireth an sic whole man” (68). The king is to enforce the law as it is written in scripture. The king is not more important than the church: he is its facilitator and supreme authority. The king is to ensure that ministers are preaching properly and to maintain the integrity of the church. Tyndale states that it is the king’s responsibility to serve others, and not for others to serve him, but the bishops have corrupted kings into considering otherwise. The king is required to swear his allegiance to the bishops and the Pope, which causes Tyndale to ask, “How hath the Pope the such temporal authority over king and emperor?” (124).|$|E

40|$|One of the {{theoretical}} premises of the patent system is that it enhances the dissemination of valuable information by assuring creators of new inventions a limited monopoly for the exploitation of their inventions. As a tool of state policy, the patent system seeks to catalyze the industrialization of the state, disclosure of information by inventors, and ultimately, the enrichment of the public domain {{in a manner that}} benefits both the inventor and the Society. Consequently, the patent system is often characterized as a form of contract between the inventor and the state.
