Network disconnections are encountered in many scenarios, including being out-of-range in a wireless network, during network handoff, and also in the case of Networked Surfaces, a novel LAN technology which provides the motivation for this work. A "smart link layer" employing repetition of selected packets at reconnection time is shown to improve TCP's utilisation of a disconnecting network to nearly 100 %. This solution is also demonstrated {{in the context of a}} Networked Surface prototype, improving TCP performance for both bulk transfers and interactive traffic. The <b>smart</b> <b>link</b> layer solution is lightweight, requiring little processing and buffering only one packet per TCP connection. It is therefore easily retro-fitted to existing TCP-capable devices, without modifying the internal operation of those devices...|$|E

From the everyday processes that run within companies, {{huge amounts of}} such data is col-lected within different software systems. However, the value of analyzing this data holistically is often not exploited. This is mainly due to the inherent heterogeneity of the different data sources and the missing flexibility of existing approaches to integrate additional sources in an ad-hoc fashion. In this paper the <b>Smart</b> <b>Link</b> Infrastructure is introduced. It offers tools that enable data integration and linking to support a holistic analysis of process data. The infras-tructure consists of easy to use components for matching schemas, linking entities, storing entities as a graph and executing pattern queries {{on top of the}} integrated data. We showcase the value of the presented integration approach with two real world use-cases, one based on knowledge management in manufacturing from the LinkedDesign project and another one based on an agile software development process. ...|$|E

40|$|The Internet {{provides}} a highly suitable infrastructure for sharing multimedia meeting records, especially as multimedia technologies become more lightweight and workers more mobile. LiteMinutes {{is a system}} that uses both the Web and email for creating, revising, distributing, and accessing multimedia information captured in a meeting. Supported media include text notes taken on wireless laptops, slide images captured from presentations, and video recorded by cameras in the room. At the end of a meeting, text notes are sent by the note taking applet to the server, which formats them in HTML with links from each note item to the captured slide images and video recording. <b>Smart</b> <b>link</b> generation is achieved by capturing contextual metadata such as the on/off state of the media equipment and the room location of the laptop, and inferring whether it makes sense to supply media links to a particular note item. Note takers can easily revise meeting minutes after a meeting by modifying the email message sent to them and mailing it back to the server's email address. We explore design issues concerning preferences for email and Web access of meeting minutes, as well as the different timeframes for access. We also describe the integration with a comic book style video summary and visualization system with text captions for browsing the video recording of a meeting.

40|$|This thesis {{will provide}} an insight on how weather factors such as temperature, {{humidity}} and air pressure affects radio links and use this body of knowledge to better understand how to mitigate unnecessary radio switching to take place and then use this knowledge to suggest ways of developing a Link Quality Estimator that utilize online weather data {{to be able to}} conduct <b>smart</b> <b>link</b> switching. In the context of this thesis, we focus on the case study of a water utility company as these entities are under increasing economic and environmental pressures to optimise their infrastructure, in order to save energy, mitigate extreme weather events, and prevent water pollution. One promising approach consists in using smart systems. However, a smart infrastructure requires reliable communication links which are difficult to provide. In particular, communication links that are distributed and geographically located in rural areas are highly affected by changing weather conditions, hence efficient control of these distributed hosts requires robust communications. Multiple communication transceivers are used to mitigate this issue and to enable nodes to switch to reliable links. Short-term link quality estimators are used to decide which link to use which often leads to the situation where a link switch is initiated which does not prove helpful in the long term. It is not beneficial to switch a link and associated routing for only a brief duration hence we conduct test bed experiments to better understand the relationships between the radio links and weather factors and use this body of data to devise a LQE that can use this data and then make a smart choice based on this data which reduces switching costs...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the dawn}} of microelectronic {{industry}} integrated technologies have been fuelling tremendous advances in science, engineering and applications leading to an increasing inclusion of intelligence in infrastructures, equipments and products. This trend, leveraging on silicon device miniaturization, is still on-going and is having a profound impact in all fields, medical science and therapeutics included. In the forthcoming years, availability of decananometer silicon technologies, advances in micro-mechanical and packaging manufacturing, energy-conversion techniques and material engineering are expected to provide the solutions needed to develop fully miniaturized, low-power, energy- autonomous smart systems. These systems will promote a more intimate <b>smart</b> <b>link</b> between humans, from a high level interaction down to cellular level, "things" and environment. Implantable recording systems are a challenging test field for deeply scaled technologies since demanding performance required for the application and the tight constraints imposed by the surrounding environment, i. e. the body. But big challenges translate in big opportunities: the potentials of this trend are already clearly visible, neurotechnology {{being one of the}} leading examples. Technological advances are enabling innovative interfaces between neurons and electronics, opening the way to new therapeutic devices for neurological diseases as well as to detailed investigation tools of the cognitive processes. The chapter reviewed the performance requirements and the perspectives of fully integrated neural recording systems, pointing out the issues faced in the definition of optimal architectures and function partitioning. In this frame, energy-efficiency and low noise design are key ingredients. The fundamental metrics to quantitatively judge the trade off between noise, power consumption, and processing speed have been introduced and adopted to compare the most recent system implementations. It has been shown that a 10 uW power budget target per sensing channel is attainable by using cutting edge technologies and careful design. Finally, we focused on the particular issue of neural amplifier design: leveraging on a detailed break-down of the noise sources and by mean of an insightful design strategy we addressed the problem of noise-power trade-off and we presented a neural amplifier that achieved the best performance so far reported...|$|E

40|$|Wavelet radiosity is the unication of two {{important}} methods {{to solve the}} radiosity equation: hierarchical radiosity and Galerkin radiosity. Although wavelet radiosity can {{reap the benefits of}} both methods, there is still a lot of overhead and in practice several problems occur. For example, using Haar wavelets the traditional push-pull scheme leads to obviously wrong results near common patch boundaries. Moreover, interaction between partially visible patches leads to unnecessarily ne subdivisions, and higher order wavelets introduce a significant overhead for low-power links. In this article we propose a set of <b>smart</b> <b>links</b> that cope with these problems and can increase both the efficiency of the algorithm {{and the quality of the}} solution.

The main problem with XML is that it {{stresses}} syntax and format rather than semantics and knowledge. Hence, XML exhibits the advantages of data association and data interoperability, {{but it is still}} short of computer-interpretability to support intelligent Web applications. The next generation Web technologies addressing this issue are developing an intelligent Web, called the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web, {{as an extension of the}} current Web, aims to bring structure and semantics for computer programs to understand and process information. In this vision, humans and machines may work in cooperation to reason and solve complex tasks. The aim of this dissertation is to explore topics related with the new opportunities for XML-based applications created by the advent of the Semantic Web. We explore two different XML-based domain applications, Web content transcoding and Web resource linking, which employ Semantic Web technologies to enhance knowledge representation and hence improve intelligence to facilitate machine understanding. In the Web content transcoding domain, we develop OWL-based Extensible Transcoding System (OETS) and Semantic Hybrid Transcoding Platform (SHT Platform). The OETS is based on an extensible transcoding policy infrastructure, while SHT Platform integrates both Semantic Web Services and hybrid transcoding technologies to cope with the heterogeneous effects. In the Web resource linking domain, an intelligent XLink shell, called XLinker, is developed from the multi-layered semantic framework to enhance the knowledge representation of XLink. XLinker is capable of associating with various domain knowledge and metadata. The basic function of XLinker is to provide <b>smart</b> <b>link</b> generations for Internet applications. There is a new issue, navigation problem, caused from the overlap of the above two different XML-based application domains. To deal with the new problem, this dissertation implements an XLink Transcoding Web Server (XTWS) to demonstrate how XLinker can integrate Web content transcoding for different devices. 1.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} two {{techniques}} for the <b>smart</b> <b>linking</b> of 2 D and 3 D views in medical applications are presented. Although real-time interactive 3 D volume visualization is available even for very large data sets, {{it is used}} quite rarely in the clinical practice. A major obstacle for a better integration in the clinical workflow is the time-consuming process to adjust the parameters to generate diagnostically relevant images. The clinician has {{to take care of}} the appropriate viewpoint, zooming, transfer function setup, clipping planes, and other parameters. Because of this, current applications primarily employ 2 D views generated through standard techniques such as multi-planar reformatting (MPR). The LiveSync interaction metaphor is a new concept to synchronize 2 D slice views and 3 D volumetric views of medical data sets. Through intuitive picking actions on the slice, the users define the anatomical structures they are interested in. The 3 D volumetric view is updated automatically with the goal that the users are provided with diagnostically relevant images.

40|$|The author uses {{a network}} {{simulator}} to explore rate-based congestion control in networks with <b>smart</b> <b>links</b> that can feed back information to tell senders {{to adjust their}} transmission rates. This method differs in a very important way from congestion control in which a congested network component just drops packets - {{the most commonly used}} method. It is clearly advantageous for the links in the network to communicate with the end users about the network capacity, rather than the users unilaterally picking a transmission rate. The components {{in the middle of the}} network, not the end users, have information about the capacity and traffic in the network. The author experiments with three different algorithms for calculating the control rate to feed back to the users. All of the algorithms exhibit problems in the form of large queues when simulated with a configuration modeling the dynamics of a packet-voice system. However, the problems are not with the algorithms themselves, but with the fact that feedback takes time. If the network steady-state utilization is low enough that it can absorb transients in the traffic through it, then the large queues disappear. If the users are modified to start sending slowly, to allow the network to adapt to a new flow without causing congestion, a greater portion of the network's bandwidth can be used...|$|R
