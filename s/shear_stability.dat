30|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to study the dependence of <b>shear</b> <b>stability</b> of nanofluids on temperature, particle loading and shear rate. Observed weak dependence of thermal conductivity enhancement on temperature supports the claim of particle aggregation as a principal mechanism behind the enhancement. Moreover, the aggregates in quiescent flow fields were stable in temperatures up to 60 °C. The data on <b>shear</b> <b>stability</b> show that the aggregates are sufficiently stable over a range of rigorous shear rates and temperatures. The observations of thermal conductivity and particle size complement each other in terms of predicting the former from the latter.

40|$|Functional {{properties}} of some underexploited tuber and root starches (true yam, gourd yam, taro, lotus, and sweet potato) were investigated {{before and after}} hydroxypropylation, cross-linking, and hydroxypropylation and cross-linking using potato starch as the reference. Low swelling ability, poor viscosity development but high <b>shear</b> <b>stability,</b> gel hardness, and resistance to enzyme hydrolysis was observed in starches from true yam and gourd yam. The extent of retrogradation was also highest in these two starches. Most of the functional {{properties of}} lotus starch {{were similar to those}} of potato starch. Hydroxypropylation to a molar substitution level of ≈ 0. 1 increased the swelling factor and susceptibility to α-amylase hydrolysis but decreased acid tolerance of paste viscosity, retrogradation, gelatinization parameters, gel hardness, and <b>shear</b> <b>stability.</b> Cross-linking decreased the swelling factor and amylose leaching, and increased <b>shear</b> <b>stability</b> and resistance to enzyme and acid tolerance. Cross-linking had very little influence on gelatinization and retrogradation properties but a larger effect on pasting properties. Increased or decreased peak viscosities and gel hardness values were noted for different cross-linked starches. Cross-linking of hydroxypropylated starches increased commonly desirable functional properties providing a wider range of potential applications. © 2007 AACC International, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Genotype had a {{significant}} effect on protein and starch concentrations in pea and fababean, on pasting, trough, cooling and final viscosities of starch from pea and fababean, and on onset and peak temperatures of gelatinization of starch from fababean. Significant genotype x environment interactions were observed for the concentrations of starch in pea and fababean, the concentration of amylose, endothermic enthalpy and trough viscosity in starch from fababean, and pasting viscosities of starch from pea. The effects of genotype and environment on the physicochemical characteristics of starch from pea and fababean grown in western Canada would likely not be of practical significance. Native, heat-moisture-treated and pregelatinized blends of pea starch and starch from corn, waxy corn, high-amylose corn or potato exhibited a variety of functionalities due to differences in the functionalities of the constituent starches and to the effects of heat-moisture treatment and pregelatinization. Compared to calculated weighted average values, blends of pea starch and corn starch exhibited lower degrees of syneresis and lower <b>shear</b> <b>stabilities,</b> blends of pea starch and waxy corn starch exhibited higher degrees of syneresis and lower <b>shear</b> <b>stabilities,</b> and blends of pea starch and high-amylose corn starch exhibited lower viscosities and lower <b>shear</b> <b>stabilities.</b> In general, heat-moisture treatment of blends reduced pasting viscosities, swelling and degree of syneresis as compared to respective native starch blends. Compared to pea starch, combinations of pea starch and galactomannans (guar gum and locust bean gum) exhibited increased viscosities during pasting, whereas combinations of pea starch and anionic hydrocolloids (xanthan gum and carboxymethylcellulose) exhibited increased viscosities at lower inclusion rates only. Generally, combinations of pea starch and guar gum exhibited less syneresis than combinations of pea starch and locust bean gum, xanthan gum or carboxymethylcellulose. It was concluded that some blends of pea starch and starch from corn, waxy corn, high- amylose corn or potato may have potential in food applications such as confectionery, batters and breadings, breakfast cereals, retorted products, snack foods and baked goods, and that some combinations of pea starch and hydrocolloids might offer functionality that would be of practical use...|$|R

30|$|Partially hydrolyzed {{polyacrylamide}} (HPAM) as {{the main}} component of slickwater fracturing fluid is a shear-sensitive polymer, which suffers from mechanical degradation at turbulent flow rates. Five different concentrations of HPAM as well as mixtures of polyacrylamide/xanthan gum were prepared to investigate the possibility of improving <b>shear</b> <b>stability</b> of HPAM. Drag reduction (DR) measurements were performed in a closed flow loop. For HPAM solutions, the extent of DR increased from 30 % to 67 % with increasing HPAM concentration from 100 to 1000  wppm. All the HPAM solutions suffered from mechanical degradation and loss of DR efficiency over the shearing period. Results indicated that the resistance to shear degradation increased with increasing polymer concentration. DR efficiency of 600  wppm xanthan gum (XG) was 38 %, indicating that XG was not as good a drag reducer as HPAM. But with only 6 % DR decline, XG solution exhibited a better <b>shear</b> <b>stability</b> compared to HPAM solutions. Mixed HPAM/XG solutions initially exhibited greater DR (40 % and 55 %) compared to XG, but due to shear degradation, DR% dropped for HPAM/XG solutions. Compared to 200  wppm HPAM solution, addition of XG did not improve the drag reduction efficiency of HPAM/XG mixed solutions though XG slightly improved the resistance against mechanical degradation in HPAM/XG mixed polymer solutions.|$|E
40|$|To {{address the}} problem {{regarding}} poor shear resistance of commonly employed polymers for oil displacement, modified nano-SiO 2 /AA/AM copolymer (HPMNS) oil displacement agents were synthesized using acrylic acid (AA), acrylamide (AM), and modified nano-SiO 2 of different modification degrees as raw materials. HPMNS was characterized by means of infrared spectroscopy (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR), dynamic/static light scattering, and scanning electron microscope. A comparative study of the shear resistance properties for partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and HPMNS was conducted. Compared to HPAM, the introduced hyperbranched structure endowed HPMNS with good shear resistance, which was quantified from the viscosity retention ratio of the polymer solutions. From the perspective of rheological property, HPMNS also showed great <b>shear</b> <b>stability</b> after shearing by a Mixing Speed Governor and porous media shear model. Furthermore, with {{a higher degree of}} modification, HPMNS- 2 had better <b>shear</b> <b>stability</b> in terms of viscosity and rheological property than HPMNS- 1. The phenomena were due to its lower hydrodynamic radius, weight-average molecular weight, and better flexibility of its molecular chains. In addition, upon the indoor displacement test, the resistance factor and residual resistance factor values of HPMNS- 2 were higher than those of HPAM. This behavior is beneficial for increasing oil recovery...|$|E

Over the past six seasons we have consistently evaluated shear quality when evaluating snowpack <b>stability.</b> <b>Shear</b> quality is subjectively evaluated on a 3 -tiered scale from Q 1 (clean, fast shears) to Q 2 (average shears) to Q 3 (irregular or dirty shears). Our method is a formalization of what ski patrollers {{and others have been}} doing in the U. S. and elsewhere for at least several decades. We used a dataset of nearly 700 individual stability tests (rutschblock, stuffblock and compression tests) collected by seven observers on slopes from Alaska to Chile. In addition to stability test results, observers noted whether slopes they felt were similar to their snowpit location had avalanches, or collapsing or cracking snowpacks, on that day. Results suggest that shear quality provides important stability information, especially when stability test results appear to indicate relatively stable conditions, but the shear quality is rated Q 1. This might be because stability test results are often spatially variable, while our experience indicates that shear quality is more homogeneous.
