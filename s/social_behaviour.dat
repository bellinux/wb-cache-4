5|$|This section {{describes}} {{the types of}} <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> in animals, including the principles of animal communication, aggression, dominance systems, and insect castes.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} a part of human culture, in the broad sense of <b>social</b> <b>behaviour,</b> customs and {{practices}} including but not limited to expressive forms such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years. Human society makes use of birds both economically, including for food, and non-economically, for sport, pleasure, and inspiration.|$|E
40|$|Goal-directed <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as mating and {{fighting}} {{are associated with}} scalable and persistent internal states of emotion, motivation, arousal or drive. How those internal states are encoded and coupled to behavioural decision making and action selection is not clear. Recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster and mice have identified circuit nodes that have causal roles in the control of innate <b>social</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Remarkably, in both species, these relatively small groups of neurons can influence both aggression and mating, and also {{play a part in}} the encoding of internal states that promote these <b>social</b> <b>behaviours.</b> These similarities may be superficial and coincidental, or may reflect conserved or analogous neural circuit modules for the control of <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> in flies and mice...|$|R

5|$|Not all ants {{have the}} same kind of societies. The Australian bulldog ants are among the biggest and most basal of ants. Like {{virtually}} all ants, they are eusocial, but their <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> is poorly developed compared to other species. Each individual hunts alone, using her large eyes instead of chemical senses to find prey.|$|E
5|$|Philip Nel {{highlighted}} {{the influence of}} Jane Austen, whom Rowling has greatly admired {{since the age of}} twelve. Both novelists encourage re-reading, because details that look insignificant foreshadow important events or characters much later in the story-line– for example Sirius Black is briefly mentioned near the beginning of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and then becomes a major character in the third to fifth books. Like Austen's heroines, Harry often has to re-examine his ideas near the ends of books. Some <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> in the Harry Potter books is remininiscent of Austen, for example the excited communal reading of letters. Both authors satirise <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> and give characters names that express their personalities. However in Nel's opinion Rowling's humour is more based on caricature and the names she invents are more like those found in Charles Dickens's stories, and Amanda Cockrell noted that many of these express their owners' traits through allusions that run from ancient Roman mythology to eighteenth-century German literature. Rowling, like the Narnia series' author C.S. Lewis, thinks there is no rigid distinction between stories for children and for adults. Nel also noted that, like many good writers for children, Rowling combines literary genresfantasy, young adult fiction, boarding school stories, Bildungsroman and many others.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{understanding}} of Iguanodon {{has evolved over}} time as new information has been obtained from fossils. The numerous specimens of this genus, including nearly complete skeletons from two well-known bonebeds, have allowed researchers to make informed hypotheses regarding {{many aspects of the}} living animal, including feeding, movement, and <b>social</b> <b>behaviour.</b> As one of the first scientifically well-known dinosaurs, Iguanodon has occupied a small but notable place in the public's perception of dinosaurs, its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains.|$|E

40|$|The school {{playground}} is recognised broadly in {{the literature}} as a crucial setting for children to develop <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> by engaging in a diverse range of physical and social activities. In this study, we examined children’s social interactions in two distinctly different primary school playgrounds – a school playground with fixed equipment, and a school playground with moveable play equipment. The aim {{of this research was}} to explore how primary school children’s <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> in schoolyard activities vary in two different playground contexts. Through field notes and observation scheduling, descriptions of the range of children’s <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> in the two school playgrounds emerged. This study provides some insights into how the development of schoolchildren’s social and emotional well-being can be supported, or hindered, by the physical design of playgrounds made available to children...|$|R
50|$|Social change {{refers to}} an {{alteration}} in the social order of a society. Social change may include changes in nature, <b>social</b> institutions, <b>social</b> <b>behaviours,</b> or <b>social</b> relations.|$|R
5|$|The section {{describes}} {{the distribution of}} <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> in different taxa. The theme is that evolution is progressive, with four pinnacles of social evolution, namely the colonial invertebrates such as corals, the social insects, mammals other than humans, and finally humans. The last chapter argues that natural selection has made humans far more flexible in social organisation than any other species.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{data on the}} <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> of {{the grey}} currawong is lacking, and {{roosting}} habits are unknown. It is generally shyer and more wary than its pied relative, but has become more accustomed to people in areas of high human activity in southwest Western Australia. Its undulating flight is rapid and silent. It hops or runs when on the ground. Birds are generally encountered singly or in pairs, but may forage in groups of three to eleven birds. Up to forty birds may gather to harvest a fruit tree if one is found. The black-winged subspecies is seldom seen in groups larger than four or five, while the clinking currawong may form groups of up to forty birds over the non-breeding season.|$|E
40|$|This paper reports an {{exploration}} of the concept of social intelligence in the context of designing home dialogue systems for an Ambient Intelligence home. It describes a Wizard of Oz experiment involving a robotic interface capable of simulating several human <b>social</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Our results show that endowing a home dialogue system with some social intelligence will: (a) create a positive bias in the user’s perception of technology in the home environment, (b) enhance user acceptance for the home dialogue system, and (c) trigger <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> by the user in relation to the home dialogue system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} how different forms of peer relationships offer children unique support for loneliness and to examine the direct as well as indirect effects of <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> and academic performance through the mediation of peer relation-ships on the prediction of loneliness in Korean children. Four hundred and sixty-six children were recruited from a primary school in Korea. Peer nomination, self-reports, and teacher ratings were used to measure <b>social</b> <b>behaviours,</b> peer relationships, academic performance, and loneliness. The results showed that peer relationships, including peer acceptance, the number of friends, and positive friendship quality, uniquely contributed to loneliness. Peer relationships parti-ally mediated between withdrawal and loneliness. Peer acceptance and friendship quality fully mediated the link between academic functioning and loneliness. The findings were discussed with respect to how the <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> and academic performance are perceived and valued in Korean culture.

40|$|<b>Social</b> play <b>behaviour</b> is a {{vigorous}} {{form of social}} interaction, abundant during the juvenile and adolescent phases of life in many mammalian species, including humans. Social play is highly rewarding {{and it is important}} for social and cognitive development. Being a rewarding activity, social play can be dissociated in its pleasurable and motivational components. We have previously shown that endocannabinoids modulate the expression of <b>social</b> play <b>behaviour</b> in rats. In the present study, we investigated whether endocannabinoids modulate the motivational and pleasurable properties of <b>social</b> play <b>behaviour,</b> using operant and place conditioning paradigms, respectively. Treatment with the anandamide hydrolysis inhibitor URB 597 did not affect operant responding or social play-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) when administered at a dose (0. 1 mg/kg) known to increase the expression of <b>social</b> play <b>behaviour,</b> while it modestly reduced operant responding at a higher dose (0. 2 mg/kg). The cannabinoid- 1 (CB 1) receptor antagonist rimonabant reduced operant responding when administered at a dose (1 mg/kg) known to decrease the expression of <b>social</b> play <b>behaviour,</b> although this effect may be secondary to concurrent drug-induced stereotypic behaviours (i. e., grooming and scratching). These data demonstrate that enhancing endocannabinoid levels does not differentially affect the motivational and pleasurable aspects of <b>social</b> play <b>behaviour,</b> whereas CB 1 receptor blockade reduces the motivational aspects of <b>social</b> play <b>behaviour,</b> possibly due to response competition. Thus, endocannabinoids likely drive the expression of <b>social</b> play <b>behaviour</b> as a whole, without differentially affecting its motivational or pleasurable properties...|$|R
5|$|<b>Social</b> <b>behaviour</b> is {{influenced}} by the climate and geography; as such, the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times, and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations. For instance, populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut, whereas in eastern African populations, territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season. Moreover, territorial males often tolerate bachelors, and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year. A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94% of the males, territoriality was observed for less than four months.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} {{is known}} to hybridise with the black wildebeest. The differences in <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation, however it may occur when both species are confined within the same area, and the offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had congenital abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the Wormian bones of the skull. Another study reported {{an increase in the}} size of the hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some hybrid animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{native to}} Australia. Found in drier regions {{across much of the}} continent, it inhabits scrub and open woodland. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) in length, the robin has a small thin black bill, and dark brown eyes and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to advertise territories and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> has been little studied.|$|E
40|$|Social {{support is}} {{accepted}} as a protective factor for stressful life events, which helps maintain physical and psychological health (e. g. Cohen and Willis, 1985). Studies have been conducted to reveal the forms, mechanisms and sources of social support, by using different samples like trauma survivors (e. g. Swickert and Hittner, 2009), people with psychological disorders (e. g. Scrandis, 2005) and caregivers (e. g. Frank et al., 2001). There are three forms of social support; net-work resources, <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> and appraisal of support. Network resources are {{the actual number of}} people who are ready to supply social support when needed, and <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> include the behaviours in pursuit of getting social support, that is, support seeking coping (Hobfoll and Vaux, 1993). While network resources and <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> are regarded as objective, the third form – appraisal of support – is subjective in nature (Norberg et al., 2006). The subjective level of satisfaction with received support is named as perceived social support (PSS). It refers to the belief that when support is needed, others will be ready to provide it (Pierce et al. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} method for the {{creation}} of autonomous agent memory systems that support real-time <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> relating to perception and attention. Our memory design methodology is modular in nature: modules are connected by transformation operators representative of different forms of information processing and which fall into two general categories: information filters and integrators. Filters are selective and only retain relevant information, while integrators process information into more compact and high-level representations. We demonstrate the flexibility and feasibility of our methodology by elaborating two examples which have been implemented and shown successful for supporting fundamental agent <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> in a virtual environment.

5|$|Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{defines a}} Malay as a Malaysian citizen {{born to a}} Malaysian citizen who professes to be a Muslim, habitually speaks the Malay language, adheres to Malay customs, and is {{domiciled}} in Malaysia or Singapore. Though this definition is not according to ancestry lineage, it is however correct {{in the sense of}} social behaviours. Culture, which controls a great proportion of general mentality and <b>social</b> <b>behaviour,</b> is succeeded through the mother tongue and religion. Article 160 unites Malays from different ethnic groups as the prevailing race and thus embraces them with the political prowess to dominate and rule over other races: Chinese, Indians, Kadazan, Iban, Orang Asli etc. This is also apparent from the name of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), who are a staunch political proponent of this role.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids are diurnal. Social {{activity}} and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk. Bovids typically rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. They have various methods of social organisation and <b>social</b> <b>behaviour,</b> which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Bovids use {{different forms of}} vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. Most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day. While small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed on high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands. Most bovids are polygynous. Mature bovids mate {{at least once a}} year and smaller species may even mate twice. In some species, neonate bovids remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers; in other species, neonates are followers, accompanying their dams, rather than tending to remain hidden.|$|E
5|$|Sociobiology is {{the study}} of how <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> and {{organization}} have been influenced by evolution and other biological process. The field blends sociology with a number of other sciences, such as anthropology, biology, and zoology. Sociobiology has generated controversy within the sociological academy for allegedly giving too much attention to gene expression over socialization and environmental factors in general (see 'nature versus nurture'). Entomologist E. O. Wilson is credited as having originally developed and described Sociobiology. Besides Sociobiology the bio-communication theory investigates interactions between non-human organisms such as animal communication, plant communication, fungal communication and communication in micro-organisms on the basis of rule-governed sign-use. In this respect any coordination of behaviour between at least two organisms is sign-mediated that underlies combinatorial (syntactic), context-dependent (pragmatic) and content-relevant (semantic) rules.|$|E
50|$|Self-conscious {{emotions}} {{have been}} shown to have social benefits. These include areas such as reinforcing <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> and reparation of social errors. There is also possible research suggesting that a lack of self-conscious emotion is a contributing cause of bad behaviour.|$|R
50|$|The {{field of}} social {{evolution}}, of which Hamilton's rule has central importance, is broadly defined {{as being the}} study of the evolution of <b>social</b> <b>behaviours,</b> i.e. those that impact on the fitness of individuals other than the actor. <b>Social</b> <b>behaviours</b> can be categorized according to the fitness consequences they entail for the actor and recipient. A behaviour that increases the direct fitness of the actor is mutually beneficial if the recipient also benefits, and selfish if the recipient suffers a loss. A behaviour that reduces the fitness of the actor is altruistic if the recipient benefits, and spiteful if the recipient suffers a loss. This classification was first proposed by Hamilton in 1964.|$|R
40|$|Children’s <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> have {{significant}} implications to their adjustments. Aggressive children display emotional, behavioural, and social problems. On the other hand, prosocial children are better adjusted (for review, see Card, Stucky, Sawalani, & Little, 2008). Adopting the social cognitive approach, {{the present study}} aimed to investigate the relationships between several social-cognitive capacities related to empathy (i. e., perspective-taking, affect sharing, and emotion regulation) and <b>social</b> <b>behaviours</b> (physical aggression, relational aggression, and prosocial behaviours) in children. The results showed that perspective-taking was the most predictive factor of both prosocial and aggressive behaviours, whereas the capacity to share emotions and to modulate emotion {{was found to have}} little predictive value to both positive and negative <b>social</b> <b>behaviours.</b> In addition, the present study also investigated the sex-related and age differences of aggressive behaviours in children. Consistent with the findings of previous studies, this study found that boys enacted more physical aggression than girls. However, sex-related difference in relational aggression was not found. Besides, older children were found to use more relational aggression but the trend of decreasing physical aggression across development was not evident. Clinical implications of the present findings were discussed. published_or_final_versionClinical PsychologyDoctoralDoctor of Psycholog...|$|R
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} {{is known}} to hybridise with its taxonomically close relative, the blue wildebeest. Male black wildebeest {{have been reported to}} mate with female blue wildebeest and vice versa. The differences in <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> and habitats have historically prevented interspecific hybridisation between the species, however hybridisation may occur when they are both confined within the same area. The resulting offspring is usually fertile. A study of these hybrid animals at Spioenkop Dam Nature Reserve in South Africa revealed that many had disadvantageous abnormalities relating to their teeth, horns and the wormian bones in the skull. Another study reported an increase {{in the size of the}} hybrid as compared to either of its parents. In some animals the auditory bullae are highly deformed and in others the radius and ulna are fused.|$|E
5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and <b>social</b> <b>behaviour,</b> which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain of}} Deinocheirus was reconstructed through CT scans and {{presented}} at the 2014 Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology conference. The brain was globular and similar in shape to that of birds and troodontid theropods, the cerebrum was expanded in a way similar to most theropods, and the olfactory tracts were relatively large. The brain was proportionally small and compact, and its Reptile Encephalisation Quotient (brain-body ratio) was estimated at 0.69, which is low for theropods, and similar to sauropods. Other ornithomimosaurs have proportionally large brains, and the small brain of Deinocheirus may reflect its <b>social</b> <b>behaviour</b> or diet. Its coordination and balance {{would not have been}} as important as for carnivorous theropods. A bone microstructure study {{presented at the}} 13th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists in 2015 showed that Deinocheirus probably had a high metabolic rate, and grew rapidly before reaching sexual maturity.|$|E
