40|$|The {{measurement}} of instantaneous angular speed is being increasingly investigated {{for its use}} {{in a wide range}} of condition monitoring and prognostic applications. Central to many measurement techniques are incremental shaft encoders recording the arrival times of shaft angular increments. The conventional approach to processing these signals assumes that the angular increments are equidistant. This assumption is generally incorrect when working with toothed wheels and especially zebra tape encoders and has been shown to introduce errors in the estimated shaft speed. There are some proposed methods in literature that aim to compensate for this geometric irregularity. Some of the methods require the shaft speed to be perfectly constant for calibration, something rarely achieved in practice. Other methods assume the shaft speed to be nearly constant with minor deviations. Therefore existing methods cannot calibrate the entire shaft encoder geometry for arbitrary shaft speeds. The present article presents a method to calculate the shaft encoder geometry for arbitrary <b>shaft</b> speed <b>profiles.</b> The method uses Bayesian linear regression to calculate the encoder increment distances.

40|$|Two {{types of}} neurons have been {{distinguished}} in Golgi and electron microscopic preparations of the dorsal {{lateral geniculate nucleus}} of young mice. In addition to a thalamo striate relay cell (TSR neuron) with brush like dendritic arbors and a thick, unbranched axon, a small to medium size cell (PA neuron) of oval or spindle shaped body and few, long and seldom branched dendrites is frequently identified in the Golgi preparations. This second type of cell may exhibit none, one or several sparsely branched axon like processes which terminate {{in the vicinity of}} the cell body. The dendrites of the PA neurons show characteristically large, spheroidal processes (p) 1 - 3 μ in diameter issuing forth singly, in clusters or as a 'string of beads' from delicate, often long, pedicles attached to the dendritic <b>shafts.</b> <b>Profiles</b> comparable to these processes and in apparent continuity with PA dendrites have been identified with the electron microscope and show synaptic vesicles and a system of sacs of smooth E. R. The portions of the dendrites from which these vesicle containing processes issue also show clusters of vesicles, ribosomes and an orderly array of microtubules. Golgi impregnated axons are followed from the optic tract and seen terminating as irregular enlargements (2 - 6 μ) on proximal dendrites of relay cells and on distal dendrites of the PA neuron. The intimate contact of the terminal branches of an optic collateral with a distal PA dendrite is carefully illustrated. Small calibered axons are likewise traced from the internal medullary lamina and seen to end by means of end knobs on distal dendrites of both types of neurons. Electron microscopic observations substantiate the Golgi images and reveal 3 different types (I, II, III) of endings in the geniculate neuropil. The large type I endings correspond to the retinal afferents which generally make asymmetric synaptic contact with type II profiles and/or with clusters of microspines on the TSR dendrites. Type II, thought to be the spheroidal dendritic appendages of the PA neurons, form symmetrical synaptic contacts with profiles of its own kind or more commonly with dendrites of the TSR neuron. The type III ending, probably cortical in origin, establishes asymmetrical synaptic contacts with small dendritic profiles. Only profiles of types I and II endings, together with those of other dendritic profiles, form part of the nest like junctions known as the synaptic glomeruli.

Experimentally, {{it is well known that}} the microasperities on the shaft surface can significantly affect the performance of a lip seal, even though the shaft roughness, after run-in, is much smaller than the lip roughness. In the present study, several deterministic numerical models are developed to investigate the effect of shaft surface finish on rotary lip seal behavior, through an understanding of the basic physics of lip seal operation. This project is performed in a step by step manner with gradually increasing complexity. Four models are included in this study: hydrodynamic analysis, elastohydrodynamic analysis for full film lubrication, mixed-EHL model for mixed lubrication with asperity contact, and transient dynamic mixed-EHL model for startup and shutdown processes. Those analyses allow the examination of some important seal characteristics, such as the load support sharing between hydrodynamic and contact pressure, contact and cavitation area ratio, reverse pumping rate, liftoff speed for tracing the liftoff process and average film thickness. The development of fluid, contact and cavitation areas as a result of the changing operation condition is also examined.

40|$|A {{feasibility}} study of short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping of telogen phase hairs in particular, and hair shaft in general, is presented. A number of extraction procedures in common use were investigated and the quantities of nuclear DNA (nuDNA) delivered were quantified via a real-time PCR assay. The extracts {{were subjected to}} two variations on AmpFℓST® Profiler Plus™ PCR amplification strategies (extended cycles, two rounds of PCR) and the genotypes compared. Nuclear DNA was found to persist in human hair shafts, albeit at very low levels. Full Profiler Plus™ profiles consistent with the hair donor were obtained from 100 mg hair shaft samples (bleached and unbleached). These were, however, mixed profiles, indicating low copy number (LCN) contamination in the extracts. Single telogen hair clubs and single hair <b>shafts</b> delivered partial <b>profiles</b> with usually only one allele of heterozygous loci. Telogen phase hairs yielded {{the same amount of}} nuDNA (and no more) as hairshafts (either anagen or telogen). Whether hair shafts dissolved or not in lysis buffer had no effect on either the quantitated yield of DNA or on the chance of obtaining a correct genotype. These results provide evidence that genomic DNA resides on the exterior of the hair shaft and we use this information to suggest an optimal procedure for nuDNA extraction from keratinised hair samples: soaking hairs in simple digestion buffers containing Tris–HCl, a salt and a chelating agent without prior cleaning of the hair shafts. It is proposed that cleaning removes most of the recoverable DNA. This procedure was applied to obtain genotypes from 3 cm hair shafts which matched reference profiles from the donors at up to 9 out of 10 AmpFℓST® Profiler Plus™ STR loci. When the genotyping success was measured by counting the number of matches between the two dominant alleles at each locus for each extract with the reference DNA profile of the hair donor, the success was found to be highly dependent on the donor. The number of matching alleles varied between not less than 10 for one donor to no more than two for another donor. These results may well be linked to the environmental experience of the hairs from each donor prior to removal...|$|R
40|$|Thermal Integrity Profiling (TIP) is a {{relatively}} new non-destructive test method for evaluating the post-construction quality of drilled shafts. Therein anomalies in a shaft are indicated by variations in its thermal profile when measured during the curing stages of the concrete. A considerable benefit with this method is in the ability to detect anomalies {{both inside and outside the}} reinforcement cage, as well as provide a measure of lateral cage alignment. Similarly remarkable, early developments showed that the shape of a temperature profile (with depth) matched closely with the shape of the shaft, thus allowing for a straightforward interpretation of data. As with any test method, however, the quality of the results depends largely on the level of analysis and the way in which test data is interpreted, which was the focus of this study. This dissertation presents the findings from both field data and computer models to address and improve TIP analysis methods, specifically focusing on: (1) the analysis of non-uniform temperature distributions caused by external boundary conditions, (2) proper selection of temperature-radius relationships, and (3) understanding the effects of time on analysis. Numerical modeling was performed to identify trends in the temperature distributions in drilled shafts during concrete hydration. Specifically, computer generated model data was used to identify the patterns of the non-linear temperature distributions that occur at the ends of a shaft caused by the added heat loss boundary in the longitudinal direction. Similar patterns are observed at locations in a shaft where drastic changes in external boundary conditions exist (e. g. shafts that transition from soil to water or air). Numerical modeling data was also generated to examine the relationship between measured temperatures and shaft size/shape which is a fundamental concept of traditional TIP analysis. A case study involving a shaft from which 24 hrs of internal temperature data was investigated and compared to results from a computer generated model made to mimic the field conditions of the shaft. Analysis of field collected and model predicted data was performed to examine the treatment of non-linear temperature distributions at the ends of the shaft and where a mid-shaft change in boundary was encountered. Additionally, the analysis was repeated for data over a wide range of concrete ages to examine the effects of time on the results of analysis. Finally, data from over 200 field tested shafts was collected and analyzed to perform a statistical evaluation of the parameters used for interpretation of the non-linear distributions at the top and bottom of each shaft. This investigation incorporated an iterative algorithm which determined the parameters required to provide a best-fit solution for the top and bottom of each shaft. A collective statistical evaluation of the resulting parameters was then used to better define the proper methods for analyzing end effects. Findings revealed that the effects of non-uniform temperature distributions in drilled <b>shaft</b> thermal <b>profiles</b> can be offset with a curve-fitting algorithm defined by a hyperbolic tangent function that closely matches the observed thermal distribution. Numerical models and statistical evaluations provided a rationale for proper selection of the function defining parameters. Additionally, numerical modeling showed that the true temperature-to-radius relationship in drilled shafts is non-linear, but in most cases a linear approximation is well suited. Finally, analysis of both model and field data showed that concrete age has virtually no effect on the final results of thermal profile analysis, as long as temperature measurements are taken within the dominate stages of concrete hydration...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{tilting pad}} journal {{bearings}} (TPJBs) {{has increased in}} recent years due to their stabilizing effects on the rotor bearing system. Most of the studies addressing steady state and dynamic behaviors of TPJBs have been evaluated by means of thermo-hydrodynamic (THD) models, assuming nominal dimensions for the bearing, (i. e., the physical dimensions of all pads are identical and loads applied along the vertical direction). However machining errors could lead to actual bearing geometry and dimensions different from the nominal ones. In particular, for TPJB the asymmetry of the bearing geometry has not been well-investigated {{and can lead to}} an unexpected behavior of the bearing. The asymmetry of the bearing geometry can arise from large machining errors on only one or more pads, as a consequence of a pivot failure or after bad-mounting of the pads during assembly. These conditions can sometimes be detected by high values of the pad temperature, as measured by the temperature probes installed on the bearing pads, or by the abnormal vibration caused by pad-flutter phenomena. In this paper the authors investigate large machining errors on the pad thickness for a five-pad TPJB and analyze their effects on the bearing operating characteristics. Pad thickness errors correspond to a different preload factor or clearance for each pad. A sensitivity analysis was performed for several combinations of pad thickness using a THD model and the behavior of the bearing was analyzed, including dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients, clearance <b>profile,</b> <b>shaft</b> locus, minimum oil-film thickness, power loss, flow rate, and maximum pressure. The experimental case of a five pads TPJB with an intentional large machining error on the thickness of the pads is also described in the paper. The bearing has a nominal diameter of 100 mm, a diameter to length ratio (L/D) equal to 0. 7 and can run at up to 3000 rpm. The experimental measurements are compared with the results obtained from the analytical model. The results show that the effects of asymmetry of the bearing geometry are more evident if the direction of the static load applied on the rotor bearing system, which is different from the vertical load, is also considered. For instance, the shape of shaft locus obtained by experimental tests changing the static load direction at a constant speed is an irregular pentagon if it is compared to the case of the nominal bearing. Based on our findings, we concludes that the machining error on the pads has a large influence on the shaft locus, minimum oil-film thickness and maximum pressure on pads, especially at high rotational speed, but has little effect on the flow rate and power loss. In addition, this error significantly affects the dynamic stiffness and damping coefficients, both in terms of rotational speed and load direction...|$|R
40|$|Axisymmetric {{analysis}} of cylindrical contacts is {{considered in the}} context of axisymmetric assemblies such as shrink-fits. Fretting fatigue induces sub-critical cracks along the contact interface of press fits especially when they are subjected to vibration. The surface and near surface stresses {{play a major role in}} the fretting fatigue crack initiation process. Assuming near surface contact stresses to be largely independent of the actual geometry of components in contact, half-plane analyses and experimental results obtained from a strip configuration are often cited in the literature to predict and understand crack initiation in the actual components (ASTM STP 1425). This thesis starts with half plane and strip models for cylindrical contact such as in a shrink fitted <b>shaft.</b> Different traction <b>profiles</b> underpinning a typical fretting contact constitute a study of different geometrical parameters and friction coefficients. The cylindrical shrink fitted contact is considered using mixed boundary formulation. The different cases of contact such as full slip, partial stick-slip and full stick are considered. A formulation for cyclically varying tractions is attempted using dynamic elasticity. Finally, the problem of cylindrical cracks is highlighted to understand interface delamination in a fiber reinforced composite. Stress functions in conjunction with Fourier transforms are used for analysis. Dynamic potentials based on Helmholtz decomposition are used for dynamic loading. For static loading Love’s stress function is used for axisymmetric problems while Airy’s stress function is used for 2 D problems. Solution procedures for solving traction boundary and mixed boundary conditions are described. Preliminary experiments are described to appreciate the contact stresses and crack initiation in cylindrical contact. Photoelastic fringes in a cylinder under a band of pressure illustrate fretting contact stresses concentrated close to the surface with the core of the cylinder relatively unstressed. Further, some material testing experiments using a specially designed cylindrical fretting rig demonstrated typical features of fretting fatigue crack initiation for providing the theoretical motivation. Fretting fatigue induces the initiation of a number of sub critical cracks along the contact interface of components in mechanical assemblies especially under vibration. The dominant crack among the initiated cracks may grow in size to the critical length in the presence of bulk cyclic loading finally resulting in fracture of the entire component. Fretting fatigue leads to unexpected failure of the component well below the expected life. It is therefore, critical to analyse, detect and control fretting. The blade root-disk joint in gas turbines as a critical example of fretting fatigue has spurred extensive research effort. There is relatively little literature available on cylindrical fretting in shrink fitted joint focused in this thesis. Analytical solutions for static fretting tractions are presented using both axisymmetric and plane elastic stress functions for later comparison. While Fourier transforms in conjunction with Airys stress functions are exploited for attacking plane problems, Loves axisymmetric stress functions are explored for cylindrical fretting. Near surface stresses are of great interest in fretting fatigue research. Although two dimensional models provide general understanding of stresses caused during fretting, these models become inadequate to explain the interaction of local stresses with the bulk stresses inevitably present in cylindrical components. Global stress analysis tools are desirable for estimating the fatigue life of components experiencing fretting. While numerical techniques immensely aid fatigue life estimation they have their limitation when it comes to coated components. Stress {{analysis of}} coated cylinders unveils the intricate influence of the elastic mismatch as well as the width of the loading for varying friction coefficients. Comparison of results obtained from axisymmetric elasticity with plane elasticity is discussed in detail. The validity and scope of relying on plane fretting results to cylindrical fretting contacts is examined by comparing the results obtained for three different traction profiles. Fretting is generally modeled as a stress boundary value problem wherein the normal and frictional shear stresses are prescribed on the cylindrical surface. In reality fretting generally turns out to be a mixed boundary value problem with unknown regions of stick and slip requiring prescribing traction and displacement simultaneously. This belongs to a formidable class of unsolved contact mechanics problems in cylindrical axisymmetric elasticity. The famous spherical axisymmetric Hertz problem has no cylindrical counterpart except in the limiting case of a cylinder of large radius. These aspects are investigated for studying the hub-shaft interfacial geometry. A conformal contact profile is considered to model a shrink fit; the contact pressure is zero at the ends of contact. The case of full slip condition is analysed assuming a frictionless contact. With friction, partial stick-slip condition is analysed. The unknown contact traction is resolved in terms of Chebyshev expansions whose unknown coefficients are solved using Schmidt method. The unknown contact length and stick zone length are determined through an iterative procedure. A rigid uneven undulating axisymmetric hub in total contact over an elastic shaft under full stick condition is analysed for obtaining the near surface stresses for a given value of hub penetration. Even though the stresses oscillate in fretting, almost all the analyses reported in the literature use static formulation. Understanding this need, a dynamic analysis for modeling fretting of a cylinder subjected to harmonic pressure and shear is attempted. The Pochhammer dispersion relation becomes a prerequisite for a dynamic analysis. The results show that the stresses do not decay away from the contact, in contrast to the static results. This shows the propagation of stresses along the axial direction. Further extension of the dynamic analysis to a layered cylinder is also described. The results obtained on contact stresses and contact tractions under the cylindrical contact represent a significant advance to the literature for modeling fretting fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Formulating cylindrical crack problems is somewhat similar to cylindrical contacts. Such cylindrical cracks arise from the debonding along the fiber-matrix interface of a composite. A unified formulation for the problem of a pressurised cylindrical crack as also a pair of 2 D parallel cracks in infinite media is attempted using Love’s stress function in conjunction with Fourier transforms. The results obtained for stress intensity factors, strain energy release rate, mode mixity, crack opening and sliding displacements are compared with that of a 2 D pair of parallel cracks obtained using the unified formulation. The asymptotic situation of a large crack length to spacing ratio is examined in detail. In the case of a pair of parallel cracks, this implies a single crack in mode-I as far as the total energy release rate is concerned while at the same time retaining an asymptotic value for the mode mixity. This unique feature of near field mixed mode blending smoothly to mode-I in the far field is also seen for the stress field around a symmetrically branched crack. Thus, this thesis presents a collection of cylindrical elastostatic and elastodynamic axisymmetric solutions to provide better understanding of fretting and delamination problems encountered in press fit assemblies...|$|R
