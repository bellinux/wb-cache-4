25|$|In 1950, Anger {{moved to}} Paris, France, where he {{initially}} stayed with {{friends of his}} (who themselves {{had been forced to}} leave Hollywood after being blacklisted for formerly having belonged to trade union organisations). He would later remark that he travelled to the country after receiving a letter from the French director Jean Cocteau in which he told Anger of his admiration for Fireworks (shown in 1949 at Festival du Film Maudit in Biarritz, France). Upon arrival, Anger and Cocteau became friends, with the Frenchman giving the young protege his permission to make a movie of his ballet The Young Man and Death, although at the time there were no financial backers for the project. While in Paris he continued producing short films; in 1950 he started filming on Rabbit's Moon, which was also known as La Lune des Lapins and revolved around a clown who was <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the moon, in which a rabbit lived, something found within Japanese mythology. Anger produced 20 minutes of footage at the Films du Pantheon Studio in the city before he was rushed out of the studio, leaving the film uncompleted. He stored the footage in the disorganized archives of the Cinémathèque Française, and only collected it again in 1970, when he finally finished and released Rabbit's Moon. It was at the Cinémathèque Française that he was given by the head, Henri Langlois, prints of Sergei Eisenstein's Que Viva Mexico!, which he attempted to put into Eisenstein's original order.|$|E
500|$|As Prince Gian Gastone disliked his father's hyper-pious character, he {{elected to}} stay away from him and the royal court. The closed court that Gian Gastone did keep was {{dominated}} by his favourite, Dami. Meanwhile, the Grand Prince Ferdinando was slowly dying from syphilis, making Gian Gastone's immediate succession more likely. Ferdinando, nonetheless, was not alone in his suffering: Guyot de Merville, a French adventurer, took note of Gian Gastone's mental decline: [...] "He carries [...] so far that it is said he never opens a letter, to avoid having to answer." [...] Additionally, Gian Gastone's fragile temperament required long periods of isolation; he spent several hours alone each night, drinking and <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the moon.|$|E

2500|$|Father Merrin's arrival {{scene was}} filmed on Max von Sydow's {{first day of}} work. The scene where the elderly priest, Father Merrin (portrayed by Max von Sydow) steps out of a cab and {{stands in front of}} the MacNeil residence, between the open gates of the driveway — silhouetted in a misty streetlamp's glow and <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> an intense beam of light shining from a bedroom window above — is one of the most famous scenes in the movie. The shot was used for film posters and home DVD/VHS release covers. The scene and photo was {{inspired}} by the 1954 painting [...] "Empire of Light" [...] ("L'Empire des lumières") by René Magritte.|$|E
2500|$|Frodo and Sam {{discover}} and capture Gollum, {{who has been}} stalking them {{in their quest to}} reach Mount Doom and destroy the One Ring, as Gollum attempts to reclaim the Ring for himself. Sam loathes and distrusts him, but Frodo pities the poor creature. Gollum promises by the Ring (his [...] "Precious")to lead the pair to the Black Gate of Mordor, and for a time appears to be like his old self Sméagol. He leads them through a hidden passage of the Dead Marshes in order to avoid being spied by Orcs. Frodo and Sam learn that the Dead Marshes were once part of an ancient battlefield, upon which the War of the Last Alliance was fought. [...] They see many dead faces of ancient warriors and orcs <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|E
60|$|Dea Flavia {{had thrown}} {{herself on the}} couch on her back; her arms were folded behind her head, her fair hair lay in heavy masses on the {{embroidered}} coverlet.

60|$|Lawford sat drawn <b>up,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> his companion's face in {{an intense}} and {{helpless}} silence. His mouth opened but no words came.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{he commented}} {{on his new}} feat, {{but it was also}} a {{reminder}} to me, a trifle cruel, that he was not my boy. After all, you see, Mary had not given him the whole of his laugh. The watch said that five and twenty minutes had passed, and looking out I saw Irene at one end of the street <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my window, and at the other end Mary's husband <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my window, and beneath me Mary <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> my window. They had all broken their promise.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} stooping and <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her, realising {{the implication}} of her words only very slowly.|$|E

60|$|Erös Béla {{had been}} found--out in the open--murdered {{by an unknown}} hand. Fehér Károly and his brother, who lived down the Fekete Road, had taken a cut across the last maize-field--the one {{situated}} immediately behind the inn kept by Ignácz Goldstein, and they had come across Béla's body, lying in the yard, with face upturned and eyes <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> sightlessly <b>at</b> the brilliant blue sky overhead.|$|R
5000|$|Thom, Toni, and Laura are {{kicked out}} of their hotel after {{interviewing}} Charlie, and stay at Arletty's father's house.

[...] Meanwhile, each night, creatures gather {{on the beach in}} front of bonfires, <b>staring</b> straight <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the moon. The locals call it [...] "The Waiting." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{lay on his}} back, <b>staring</b> {{straight}} <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{one single}} star that rocked mistily through a thinning of cloud-stuff overhead. The old ache was in his throat, the old harsh dryness in mouth and eyes. And he knew--what no other man knew--why {{he was in the}} Solomons, skipper of the teak-built yacht Arangi, running niggers, risking his head, and drinking more Scotch whiskey than was good for any man.|$|R
6000|$|... and lay <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him in startled silence, till he stooped {{and kissed}} her. Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wonder whether Jack Garraway is ready!" [...] he murmured, {{throwing}} {{down the}} Scotsman, and <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the roof. [...] "It's nearly eleven o'clock." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{body was}} brought and laid upon the platform, its wide eyes <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the moon. Then {{soldiers}} who had gathered thrust forward the weeping girl.|$|E
60|$|Klara {{was quite}} close to that dark and inert thing at last; she put out her hand and touched it. The man was lying on his face; {{just as he had}} fallen, no doubt; with a superhuman effort she {{gathered}} up all her strength and lifted those hunched-up shoulders from the ground. Then she gave a smothered cry; the pallid face of Erös Béla was <b>staring</b> sightlessly <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the moon.|$|R
60|$|I was not expected, for {{she left}} me locked in the yard, while she went to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she {{returned}} and took me <b>up,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> me all the way.|$|R
6000|$|She made {{a quaint}} little gesture with pink fists upraised, and then {{stood with her}} hand held <b>up,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the plans and {{drawings}} that were littered over the inlaid table.

60|$|The time passed. No sound {{broke the}} silence but the lumpish snoring of Schwartz. No change {{appeared}} in Jack; there he lay, <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the moon.|$|E
60|$|But the fan dropped: {{her arms}} lay limp in her lap; {{and she was}} <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me piteously, with a world of self-reproach in her {{beautiful}} eyes.|$|E
50|$|The most {{dangerous}} pilot-induced oscillations can occur during landing. Too much up elevator during the flare {{can result in}} the plane getting dangerously slow and threatening to stall. A natural reaction to this is to push the nose down harder than one pulled it up, but then the pilot ends <b>up</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the ground. An even larger amount of up elevator starts the cycle over again.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bennett {{began to}} forget his remorse {{in a sense}} of injury. He felt like a man with a good story to tell who can get nobody to listen to him. He nudged the other again, more vehemently this time. Mr. Mortimer made a noise like a {{gramophone}} when the needle slips, moved restlessly for a moment, then sat <b>up,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the candle.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She soon will, {{when she}} finds out your English heart,' said Eustace. 'The poor {{child is a}} most unwilling exile, and is acting like our old friends the urchins, {{opposing}} the prickles to all. But if my mother has Annora to watch over, {{you also have a}} charge. A boy of this little man's rank,' he said, stroking the glossy curls of Gaspard, who was leaning on my lap, <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> in wonder <b>at</b> the unknown tongue spoken by his uncle, 'and so near the age of the king, will certainly be summoned to attend at court, and if you shut yourself up, you will be unable to follow him and guide him by your counsel.' ...|$|R
60|$|But now {{his eyes}} fell upon Twinkle, who {{lay in the}} clover <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him; and the woodchuck gave a laugh and grabbed her fast by one arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it he wants?" [...] asked Grey Dick, <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the great}} fellow {{with a look}} in his eyes that caused Ambrosio to cease flourishing his fists.|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} our young Englishman, who {{still had his}} back turned to us and was <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the picture. [...] "I will tell you some other time," [...] I said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I waked out {{of sleep}} with {{the light of the}} morning sun on my face. I sat up and looked around me. The fire was out, and the camp was desolate; save for one figure which lay prone close to me. It was that of the Arab chief, who lay on his back, dead. His face was almost black; and his eyes were open, and <b>staring</b> horribly <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the sky, as though he saw there some dreadful vision. He had evidently been strangled; for on looking, I found on his throat the red marks where fingers had pressed. There seemed so many of these marks that I counted them. There were seven; and all parallel, except the thumb mark, as though made with one hand. This thrilled me as I thought of the mummy hand with the seven fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uggug, indeed!" [...] I exclaimed, in a {{burst of}} indignation I could no longer control. To bring out even that one word seemed a {{gigantic}} effort: but, the cry once uttered, all effort ceased at once: a sudden gust swept away the whole scene, and I found myself sitting <b>up,</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the young lady in the opposite corner of the carriage, who had now thrown back her veil, and was looking at me with an expression of amused surprise.|$|R
60|$|I obeyed {{him because}} I must, <b>staring</b> <b>up</b> the hall <b>at</b> the empty throne. At first I saw nothing. Then figures seemed to flit around it. From among these figures emerged {{the shape of}} the Count Amenmeses. He sat upon the throne, looking about him proudly, and I noted that he was no longer clad as a prince but as Pharaoh himself. Presently hook-nosed men {{appeared}} who dragged him from his seat. He fell, as I thought, into water, for it seemed to splash up above him. Next Seti the Prince appeared to mount the throne, led thither by a woman, of whom I could only see the back. I saw him distinctly wearing the double crown and holding a sceptre in his hand. He also melted away and others came whom I did not know, though I thought that one of them was like to the Princess Userti.|$|R
