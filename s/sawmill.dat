5|$|BuzzSaw is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush. Eleven years later, in 1887, the town's Gold supply was {{completely}} gone. The town then established a <b>sawmill</b> and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a <b>sawmill</b> worker named Jack Darke was killed by the buzz saw after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the <b>sawmill</b> and slipped into the path of the buzz saw. The <b>sawmill</b> has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.|$|E

This <b>sawmill</b> {{contributed significantly to the}} construction of numerous wooden buildings in the vicinity.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} sawing {{accuracy}} of 273 machines in hardwood <b>sawmills</b> to 291 machines in softwood <b>sawmills.</b> Characteristics compared were kerf width, sawing variation (within-board, between-board, and total), machining wood loss per sawline, and oversizing/undersizing practices. While results varied between machine types by region, hardwood <b>sawmills</b> generally performed as well as, or sometimes better than, softwood <b>sawmills</b> {{for many of}} the machine characteristics studied...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} the influence of the type of adopted production technology on the technical efficiency of Czech <b>sawmills,</b> using one-year data of <b>sawmills</b> and applying a stochastic frontier production function model. Individual technical efficiencies have been obtained for small, medium and large <b>sawmills,</b> and their determinants have been estimated using a procedure proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995). The results support the hypothesis that <b>sawmills</b> in the sample failed to achieve full technical efficiency...|$|R
50|$|Canadian {{ownership}} of US <b>sawmills</b> continues to climb with the count now reaching 40 mills, up from just two a decade earlier. West Fraser now owns more <b>sawmills</b> in the US South (16) than in Canada (13), Canfor Corp owns 11 <b>sawmills</b> in the South, one less than its Canadian total. Interfor owns 13 <b>sawmills</b> in the US - {{nine in the}} South and four in the Northwest. It owns five <b>sawmills</b> in Canada. The growing trend of Canadian {{ownership of}} US mills {{is driven by the}} potential for a lumber trade conflict, by timber availability and lower labour costs in the US. Amid the Mountain Pine Beetle infestation in Western Canada, these firms' ability to grow is severely diminished without looking outside of Canada.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{surviving}} documentation for {{the creation}} of Van Cortlandt Lake. In 1699, Jacobus Van Cortlandt dammed Tibbetts Brook to power a <b>sawmill,</b> creating a mill pond at the site where the lake is. Later, he also added a gristmill. The <b>sawmill</b> was relocated around 1823 and stayed in operation until 1889. The gristmill was destroyed by lightning in 1901.|$|E
5|$|US41 turns north solo from Covington, {{crossing}} the Sturgeon River, {{on the way}} to the historic <b>sawmill</b> town of Alberta. Henry Ford built the village to serve the <b>sawmill</b> in 1935. The Alberta mill supplied wood for Ford Motors until it was closed by Henry Ford II; the property was donated to Michigan Technological University (MTU) in 1954.|$|E
5|$|After the war, in 1848, Palmer {{joined the}} California Gold Rush but {{returned}} in 1849 to co-found Dayton, Oregon {{on the lower}} Yamhill River where he built a <b>sawmill</b> on his donation land claim.|$|E
50|$|By 1935, the {{population}} of Coachman's Cove was 294. The early settlers of Coachman's Cove depended mainly on the cod and herring fisheries for their livelihood, but by 1935 the lumbering and <b>sawmilling</b> industries became increasingly {{the main source of}} employment for the community. Five years later, in 1940, there were three <b>sawmills</b> and by 1950 lumbering had become the main employer in Coachman's Cove. In the winter months, the fishermen worked in the woods and in the local <b>sawmills.</b> It was reported that the <b>sawmills</b> in the area supplied the timber for all the piers on the northeast coast.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the city's incorporation, German farmers {{settled the}} area and built <b>sawmills</b> to process local lumber. A 1936 county highway map states that the area had {{scattered}} residences near one of its <b>sawmills.</b>|$|R
40|$|Timer decay {{is caused}} by {{primarily}} enzymatic activities of microorganisms. For the first time fungal diversity of timber degrading fungi was studied in Gujarat, India. Timber Degrading Fungi belonging to Aphyllophorales are economically important {{as many of these}} cause serious damage in <b>sawmills</b> of Gujarat. To find out the association of the timber degrading fungi and timber decay problems in <b>sawmills</b> a survey was conducted during 2007 to 2011 in different <b>sawmills</b> of 5 districts of Gujarat i. e. Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Bharuch, Rajkot and Jamnagar. In the present study teak wood present in <b>sawmills</b> was infected with 14 types of fungi in which Lenzites sterioides and Trametes versicolor damaged the wood severely was reported for the first time. In all 94 <b>sawmills</b> were surveyed, the 28 <b>sawmills</b> were from Vadodara, 29 from Ahmedabad, 12 from Bharuch, 21 from Rajkot and 4 from Jamnagar. Out of 94 <b>sawmills</b> survyed, 84 <b>sawmills</b> were having timber rotting fungi associated with wood. Maximum fifteen and thirteen fungal species were observed in saw mills of Chhani road, followed by 11 in Station road, 7 in Dhabhoi road and 6 in Harni, Vadodara. Fours woods uninfected are Beyo, Marinty, Ash, and Arjun. Fourteen different types of fungi were found associated with teak, followed by seven in pinus, madhuca, Acacia nilotica, six in babul, neem, four in tamarind, Pithacoelobium and three in mango, Eucalyptus, African Mahagoni, Kapoor, Peltophoram rouxburghii, Derris pinnata wood respectively.

5|$|Catherine Martell (Piper Laurie) {{learns that}} a new life {{insurance}} policy has been taken out in her name, by Josie Packard (Joan Chen) and Benjamin Horne (Richard Beymer). Martell had been planning with Horne to burn down Packard's <b>sawmill</b> in order to cheaply purchase the land it occupies. Packard speaks to Horne over the telephone, cooperating with the <b>sawmill</b> arson, but arranging to burn it down with Martell inside. As Packard hangs up, it is seen that the recently paroled killer Hank Jennings (Chris Mulkey) has been beside her.|$|E
5|$|Saunders {{attended}} the local mission school at Lake Condah, {{where he did}} well in maths, geometry and languages. His father, meanwhile, taught Reg and Harry about the bush, and encouraged them to read Shakespeare and Australian literature. After completing eight years of schooling, Saunders earned his merit certificate. His formal education thus ended, {{he went to work}} at the age of 14 as a millhand in a <b>sawmill.</b> Employers regularly withheld payments for Aboriginal labourers at this time, but Saunders refused to work unless he was paid his full entitlement, and his employer relented. He worked and furthered his education until 1937, when he went into business with his father and brother, operating a <b>sawmill</b> in Portland, Victoria; the <b>sawmill</b> was destroyed in a bushfire in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{armistice}} {{that ended}} World War I was signed on 11November 1918. The next day, all Spruce Production Division logging ended, most construction projects were stopped, and <b>sawmill</b> operations were curtailed. Government {{machinery and equipment}} {{from all over the}} Northwest was shipped back to Vancouver Barracks, and division personnel were quickly discharged from military service. Over $12million worth of logging equipment, <b>sawmill</b> machinery, and other property was eventually sold in a government auction.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical forest {{industry}} produces wooden items mechanically: sawing, turning and glueing. <b>Sawmills</b> {{are the largest}} employer of the sector. <b>Sawmills</b> and board production are highly automatised, but manual skills are still needed in carpentry. Mechanical {{forest industry}} employs 26 000 people in Finland. In addition 9000 have a job in furniture production. There are also about 130 industrial <b>sawmills</b> {{as well as other}} companies in the wood products industry.|$|R
500|$|This and {{the lack}} of logging railroads along the creek led to the {{development}} of many small sawmills: the Larrys Creek watershed once had 53 <b>sawmills</b> within [...] of the mouth (as well as other industries of the time). No other stream in the country had so many <b>sawmills</b> in so small a territory. Twelve <b>sawmills</b> were on the Second Fork, six on the First Fork, one each on Canoe Run and Lawshe Run, and the rest were on Larrys Creek itself. Eight were structures rebuilt on the site of previous <b>sawmills,</b> and only four were steam powered (the rest were water powered). The earliest of these <b>sawmills</b> was built in 1796 (near Seeley Run), the last in 1902 (on Lawshe Run), and by 1903 just two mills were still standing and only one of those was operating.|$|R
50|$|By 1940, Lakeview {{had seven}} <b>sawmills</b> {{operating}} in town. All of the mills had recently installed new dry kilns which allowed year around operations. This increased winter employment opportunities in Lakeview, increasing economic {{stability in the}} community. The number of <b>sawmills</b> decrease during World War II, leaving only three by 1946. That year, only 39,000,000 board feet of timber was cut on the Fremont National Forest. However, that national forest's timber harvest increased to 81,200,000 board feet per year by 1952. To accommodate this increase, Lakeview's <b>sawmills</b> were expanded and modernized. In the 1950s, the payrolls and income from Lakeview's <b>sawmills</b> {{accounted for more than}} half of the town's economy.|$|R
5|$|The first <b>sawmill</b> in Union Township, Luzerne County {{was built}} by Isaac Benscotter in 1802. The first {{gristmill}} in the township {{was built on the}} creek by George Gregory in 1804. The Search brothers built a number of mills on Shickshinny Creek in 1858. They included a <b>sawmill,</b> a flour mill, a plaster mill, and a brickyard and were collectively known as the Shickshinny Mills or Search's Mills.|$|E
5|$|A forge was {{constructed}} on Nanticoke Creek in 1778 by Mason F. Alden and John Alden. A log gristmill was also {{built in the}} area in the same year by a Mr. Chapman. The mill was heavily guarded in 1780. In 1793, there was a <b>sawmill</b> and gristmill on the creek.|$|E
5|$|A {{gristmill}} {{built at}} the mouth of the creek was one of the first manufacturing buildings on the West Branch Susquehanna River upstream of Big Island. In 1864 a large <b>sawmill</b> was constructed on Tangascootack Creek a short distance above the mouth and several years later a shingle mill was built in the area. The <b>sawmill</b> was also expanded and six dams were constructed on the creek. The total cost of this project was $100,000. Agriculture was another industry that was practiced in the area of the creek in the early 1900s. In 1859 the Sunbury and Erie Railroad went into the creek's valley.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} Mount Molloy Ltd was {{building}} a railway towards a timber source made the company's shift to timber viable, as logs could be efficiently transported to <b>sawmills</b> located along the railway network. The Queensland <b>sawmilling</b> industry was initially located in major towns, close to the markets for sawn timber. As the industry evolved there was a tendency to locate mills near the resource only if there were sufficient supplies to last during {{the life of the}} investment. <b>Sawmills</b> were also initially sited by rivers and creeks, where logs could be rafted or moved by ship, but when railways were established, <b>sawmills</b> were sited on or near the railway.|$|R
50|$|About 1800 grist and <b>sawmills</b> {{were built}} on the {{headwaters}} of Cobb's Creek by Peter Brown, and in 1810 Jonathan Miller built grist and <b>sawmills</b> at {{what is now the}} Juncture of Mill Road and Karakung Drive.|$|R
30|$|The {{historic}} Woodside Store {{was built}} in 1853 just below present day Huddart Park. This store was at the hub of activity during this early logging operations since about 15 <b>sawmills</b> were within 8 km of its location. The areas surrounding both Huddart Park sites was probably logged in the mid- 1850 ’s. Many early <b>sawmills</b> were stream powered and operated only seasonally. All <b>sawmills</b> were abandoned after the timber was harvested (Stanger 1967).|$|R
5|$|Chinese <b>sawmill</b> owners at Sibu and Bintulu were {{instructed}} by the Japanese to produce timber for repairs at oil fields and ship building. During the Japanese occupation, sawmills at Bintulu produced {{a total of}} 4,000 tons of sawn timber.|$|E
5|$|Christian Collett (1771–1833), a {{graduate}} of the Mining Academy at Kongsberg, designed the splendid Ulefoss manor, built between 1802 and 1807 by <b>sawmill</b> owner Niels Aall. This {{is one of the few}} brick houses in Norway, boasting a palladian layout, a central cupola, and a classical colonnade. Collett designed several other manors and town houses.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{activities}} {{were taken in}} hand by the US Navy Seabees of the 18th Construction Regiment, which consisted of the 27th, 61st and 63rd Construction Battalions and the 17th Special Battalion, which arrived between 25 and 30 March, and the 77th Construction Battalion which arrived on 14 April. The 27th built a PT boat base, an LCT floating drydock and slipway, and roads. The 61st constructed housing, ammunition storage facilities, a runway, {{and some of the}} buildings at the PT boat base. It also handled <b>sawmill</b> operations. The 63rd assisted at the <b>sawmill</b> and worked on the roads, camps, harbor facilities, warehouses, magazines and avgas dumps. The 77th built taxiways, hardstands, aviation workshops and the avgas tank farm. The 88th worked on runways, roads, radar stations and a causeway at the eastern end of the island.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sawmilling</b> {{was a major}} {{industry}} on the North Coast hinterland in the 1930s: the coastal area between Brisbane and Gympie contained the highest concentration of <b>sawmills</b> in Queenslnd. More hardwood was cut on the North Coast (now known as the Sunshine Coast) {{than anywhere else in}} Queensland. Improvements in the road network and mechanised transport in the 1920s made <b>sawmilling</b> in remote areas such as Conondale more viable from the later interwar period.|$|R
5000|$|All <b>sawmills</b> use rip saws {{of various}} types {{including}} the circular saw and band saw. Historically <b>sawmills</b> used one or more reciprocating saws more specifically known as an [...] "up-and-down" [...] or [...] "upright saw" [...] which are of two basic types, the frame saw or a muley (mulay) saw {{which is similar to}} the hand powered pit saw. Some <b>sawmills</b> also use crosscut saws to cut boards and planks to length.|$|R
40|$|The <b>sawmilling</b> {{industry}} within North Queensland, Australia {{has traditionally}} processed a {{diverse range of}} high quality rainforest cabinet timbers from locally occurring tropical rainforests. Over 100 species are suitable for milling, many of which produce highly prized timber for cabinet work and flooring. The <b>sawmilling</b> industry contracted dramatically with the World Heritage listing in 1988 and associated logging bans on Crown and some private land. <b>Sawmilling</b> is currently restricted to {{a small number of}} fixed-site and portable mills which source timber from privately owned native forests. The low stumpage prices paid by these mills relative to the final sawn timber prices is a source of contention, with landholders believing that the mills are profiteering from an oligopsony situation. There has been increased use of portable <b>sawmills</b> in recent years by full-time and part-time millers. While portable <b>sawmills</b> do compete with traditional fixed-site <b>sawmills</b> on the local market, they are not seen as a major threat to the future of traditional fixed-site <b>sawmills.</b> Anecdotal evidence suggests that portable sawmillers do not account for all costs relevant to their milling activities but rather work on a cash flow basis. For portable sawmillers, labour is the major cost element, especially if associated costs such as workers compensation and superannuation are included. This paper examines cost structures of portable <b>sawmills</b> in North Queensland. The various sources of cost data and the limitations of these data are discussed. Short-run cost curves are derived and sensitivity analysis undertaken with respect to a number of key cost parameters. An attempt is also made to develop a timber milling long-run average cost curve. Results of this analysis are used to shed light on the accusations of rent capture by fixed-site sawmillers and to examine the potential role of portable <b>sawmills...</b>|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the heavy}} {{forestation}} in the area, sawmilling was an important and early industry, starting in the 1830s. In the early 20th century, there were around 20 sawmills in Meander and the surrounding localities. Due to a move towards closer settlement—smaller land plots and resulting greater population density—demand for timber in Meander increased and new sawmills were built in Meander in the 1910s and 1920s. Some of these mills continued into the late 20th century. Sawmilling later declined, partly {{due to lack of}} timber. Timberworld is the only remaining <b>sawmill,</b> though this is not its only business. It opened in 1985 as a <b>sawmill</b> supplying local Australian blackwood, myrtle beach and Blackheart Sassafras, originally operating from the former Baptist Church building. From 1990 it was owned and run by Kerin Booth and Kim Booth and it relocated to the former site of the Cummings Bros <b>sawmill.</b> Kim Booth, leader of the Tasmanian Greens, later passed management of the company to his son, Bronte. At one time Timberworld employed 30 people. The company now focuses on supply of prefabricated homes.|$|E
