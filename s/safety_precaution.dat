5|$|Many bathhouses {{are open}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day, seven days a week. There is {{typically}} a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry {{to those who are}} visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary <b>safety</b> <b>precaution.</b>|$|E
5000|$|RISSP {{stands for}} Record of Inter System <b>Safety</b> <b>Precautions</b> [...] It is a written record of inter-system <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> to be compiledin {{accordance}} with the provisions of Operating Code no. 8 (OC8). Where a High Voltage electrical boundary occurs, for instance between a power station and electrical utility, the safety controllers {{each side of the}} boundary must co-ordinate their activities. For the electrical transmission system in England, Wales and Scotland, the Ofgem-defined industry standard document OC8 of the Grid code defines how <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> can be managed with the Record of Inter System <b>Safety</b> <b>Precautions</b> (RISSP) independently from the safety rules of the connected parties. The purpose of the RISSP is to guarantee that <b>safety</b> <b>precautions</b> provided by a third-party can be quoted in a safety document so that work can take place.|$|R

5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution</b> against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|A {{concrete}} wall was {{built at the}} Grosvenor Road End for over £3,000 in 1956, as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution</b> and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957–58: Birmingham City were beaten 3–0, followed by a 0–0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at {{the ground in the}} summer of 1959, costing £14,500, a substantial part of which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8–2 before a crowd of 9,414.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{relatively}} strong ground motions, {{damage to}} the area was very limited; structures around the epicenter were a mix of fairly vulnerable and resistant to earthquake shaking. Buildings swayed with the tremor in Mexico City, causing panic among many citizens and prompting some to evacuate. Several schools in Guerrero were evacuated as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution.</b> The earthquake and its aftershock sequence contributed to intermittent power outages in Acapulco; more than 40,000 residences in some 40 districts remained without power by the next day. There were no reports of major losses or fatalities {{in the wake of}} the tremor, though two police stations located in Acapulco and Marquelia suffered light damage. Elsewhere, some fallen roof tiles and small landslides occurred east of the epicenter in Cuautepec.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} the {{possibility}} of aftershocks, police evacuated shopping malls and office buildings around the city. Essential organisations in the area were evacuated as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution,</b> including the police headquarters and offices of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. At Christchurch International Airport, officials halted operations after the earthquake, but all flights resumed later that day. Months before the event, a severe magnitude 6.3 earthquake occurred in a similar area adjacent to Christchurch, causing widespread destruction and fatalities in the city. Concerns arose about the condition of previously damaged structures, and the 13 June earthquakes caused further distress among many victims. Dozens of dissatisfied residents were expected {{to move out of the}} city, and many others sought professional help for anxiety and depression-related issues.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution,</b> Lexus GPS navigation systems in many regions feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
5|$|With the bow now irretrievably stuck, and {{the threat}} of even worse weather coming which could {{completely}} destroy the ship, White Star officials decided to attempt an unorthodox method of saving the stern half of the ship, which was not grounded nor damaged, by separating it from the damaged bow. Suevic, like other White Star liners, had been built with watertight compartments as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution.</b> Depending on the integrity of this design, engineers used carefully placed charges of dynamite to sever the bow at a bulkhead just aft of the bridge on 4 April. This move was successful, and the aft half of the ship floated free. The watertight compartments held their integrity, and Suevic was able to steam under her own power, in reverse and guided by tugs, to Southampton. The damaged bow was left to break up on the rocks.|$|E

5|$|With the club's {{finances}} in {{a strong}} position, York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Over the late 1940s and early 1950s, concreting was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand and the Shipton Street End. The Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street over the summer of 1955, {{and a year later}} a concrete wall was built at the Grosvenor Road End, as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution</b> and as a support for additional banking and terracing. The ground was fitted with floodlights in 1959, which were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United. The floodlights were updated and improved in 1980, and were officially switched on for a friendly with Grimsby Town. A gymnasium was built at the Grosvenor Road End in 1981, and two years later new offices for the manager, secretary, matchday and lottery manager were built, along with a vice-presidents' lounge.|$|E
5|$|As Felice {{neared the}} coast, gale {{warnings}} were hoisted from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Galveston, while a hurricane watch extended from Morgan City to Port O'Connor, Texas. Small craft advisories were also posted, cautioning light vessels {{to remain in}} port. All coastal advisories were discontinued by {{the early hours of}} September 16. Residents {{in the path of the}} storm generally evacuated in a timely manner. Over 3,000 fled the storm in Cameron Parish, Louisiana; around half of the residents in the low-lying southern part of the parish had already left before the mandatory evacuation was ordered. Farther west, one of two evacuation routes out of Sabine Pass, Texas had been rendered unusable a few days before the storm when a bridge was damaged in a maritime accident. As the remaining highway was considered susceptible to coastal flooding, officials quickly worked to evacuate 1,300 people in Sabine Pass before the storm's approach. The American Red Cross converted nine public schools into temporary storm shelters in and around Beaumont. Shelters were also set up in Houston and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, though they went mostly unused. The post offices in Sabine Pass, Gilchrist, and Port Bolivar transferred money orders, first-class parcels and postage stamps to the Beaumont office as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution.</b>|$|E

25|$|As a fire <b>safety</b> <b>precaution,</b> the carrier's two hangars {{were divided}} into {{sections}} (five on the upper and four on the lower), separated by fire-proofed fabric curtains. The curtains were intended to limit the supply of air to and delay the spread of any fire breaking out on the hangar decks. Further protection against fire was supplied by a foam spray system fed by two rows of pipes and nozzles running along the walls and ends of the hangars. The lower hangar could also be flooded with carbon dioxide where the likelihood of fuel vapor build-up was greatest.|$|E

25|$|Ahmet Albayrak {{explains}} in The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia that regarding apostasy as a wrongdoing {{is not a}} sign of intolerance of other religions, and is not aimed at one’s freedom to choose a religion or to leave Islam and embrace another faith, but that on the contrary, it is more correct to say that the punishment is enforced as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution</b> when warranted if apostasy becomes a mechanism of public disobedience and disorder (fitna). At this point, what is punished is the action of ridiculing the high moral flavour of Islam and posing a threat to public order. Otherwise, Islam prohibits spying on people and investigating their private lives, beliefs and personal opinions.|$|E
25|$|On 17 September 2016 an airBaltic Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 NextGen {{aircraft}} made {{an emergency}} landing on the runway of Riga International Airport without its nose landing gear deployed.

The runway was closed between 10:26 and 15:55 as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution</b> following {{an emergency landing}}. Seven inbound flights and four outbound flights were cancelled, 17 flights were diverted to Tallinn Airport and Kaunas Airport and others were delayed. The aircraft involved was YL-BAI and the flight BT 641 was scheduled to fly from Riga to Zürich Airport. No injuries were reported.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the quake}} was located several miles offshore, {{moderate}} to very strong shaking was reported as far inland as Tokyo, about 333km (207mi) from its epicentre. Upon {{the detection of}} the earthquake, the Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning for Miyagi Prefecture, as well as tsunami alerts for Iwate Prefecture, Fukushima Prefecture, Aomori Prefecture, Ibaraki Prefecture and the Pacific Rim. Waves of between 0.5 and 1m were anticipated, and residents along coastal areas were urged to evacuate. All warnings and alerts were canceled within 90minutes, however. The tremor caused widespread power outages, with power still not restored to some 3.6million households across several prefectures by 8April. Nuclear power plants within the region also suffered from the outages; two of three power lines supplying power to fuel coolers were cut off at the Onagawa power plant. Radioactive water consequently leaked out of spent fuel pools at three of its reactors, though {{no change in the}} radiation levels outside the plant was reported. Five coal-powered power plants also shut down, adding to concerns over energy shortages. Fukushima I power plant, which had earlier been struck by the 11 March quake, evacuated its workers as a <b>safety</b> <b>precaution,</b> but the plant sustained no damage.|$|E
