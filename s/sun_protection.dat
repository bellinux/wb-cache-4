25|$|Minimizing {{exposure}} to sources of ultraviolet radiation (the sun and sunbeds), following <b>sun</b> <b>protection</b> measures and wearing sun protective clothing (long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, and broad-brimmed hats) can offer protection.|$|E
25|$|Sunscreen absorbs or {{reflects}} {{ultraviolet light}} and prevents {{much of it}} from reaching the skin. Sunscreen with a <b>sun</b> <b>protection</b> factor (SPF) of 8 based on the UVB spectrum decreases vitamin D synthetic capacity by 95%, and SPF 15 decreases it by 98%.|$|E

25|$|For clothing, the Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) {{represents}} {{the ratio of}} sunburn-causing UV without and with {{the protection of the}} fabric, similar to SPF (<b>Sun</b> <b>Protection</b> Factor) ratings for sunscreen. Standard summer fabrics have UPF of approximately 6, which means that about 20% of UV will pass through.|$|E
25|$|Men's swimsuits {{commonly}} resemble shorts, or briefs. Casual men's swimsuits (for example, boardshorts) {{are rarely}} skintight, unlike competitive swimwear, like jammers or diveskins. In most cases, {{boys and men}} swim with their upper body exposed, except in countries where custom or law prohibits it in a public setting, or for practical reasons such as <b>sun</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E

25|$|A full six-mile (10km) round-trip ascent on {{a popular}} trail {{takes two to}} five hours for walkers, one to one-and-a-half hours for bicyclists and runners. Difficulty with the midday sun, such as dehydration, is common. Guidelines {{recommend}} carrying two liters of water per person, extra water for dogs, and <b>sun</b> <b>protection.</b> Signs prohibit off-trail shortcuts which can cause erosion, and some shortcuts have barbed wire fencing to reduce trespassing.|$|E
25|$|Sunscreen {{appears to}} be {{effective}} in preventing melanoma. In the past, use of sunscreens with a <b>sun</b> <b>protection</b> factor (SPF) rating of 50 or higher on exposed areas were recommended; as older sunscreens more effectively blocked UVA with higher SPF. Currently, newer sunscreen ingredients (avobenzone, zinc oxide, and titanium dioxide) effectively block both UVA and UVB even at lower SPFs. Sunscreen also protects against squamous cell carcinoma, another skin cancer.|$|E
25|$|Swimsuits {{range from}} designs that almost {{completely}} cover {{the body to}} designs that expose {{almost all of the}} body. The choice of swimsuit will depend on personal and community standards of modesty and on considerations such as how much or how little <b>sun</b> <b>protection</b> is desired, and prevailing fashions. Almost all swimsuits cover the genitals and pubic hair, while most except thongs or G-string cover much or all of the buttocks.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians feed {{in several}} ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining nutrients from symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the <b>sun</b> and <b>protection</b> against predators.|$|R

25|$|Sunscreen—Sunscreen is more {{transparent}} once {{applied to the}} skin and also {{has the ability to}} protect against UVA/UVB rays, although the sunscreen's ingredients have the ability to break down at a faster rate once exposed to sunlight, and some of the radiation is able to penetrate to the skin. In order for sunscreen to be more effective it is necessary to consistently reapply and use one with a higher <b>sun</b> <b>protection</b> factor.|$|E
25|$|Asian {{people and}} black {{people have a}} thicker dermis than white people. The skin of Asian people and black people also has more <b>sun</b> <b>protection</b> than the skin of white people due to Asian people and black people having larger and more {{numerous}} melanosomes in their skin than white people. The thicker dermis and the more numerous melanosomes of larger size might be the reasons that Asian people and black people have a lower incidence facial wrinkles than white people.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} process, {{triggered}} primarily by UVB, {{there is an}} increase in production of melanin (melanogenesis), which is the body's reaction to direct DNA photodamage (formation of pyrimidine dimers) from UV radiation. Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning, and typically becomes visible two or three days after exposure. The tan that is created by increased melanogenesis typically lasts for a few weeks or months, much longer than the tan that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin, and is also actually protective against UV skin damage and sunburn, rather than simply cosmetic. Typically, it can provide a modest <b>Sun</b> <b>Protection</b> Factor (SPF) of 3, meaning that tanned skin would tolerate up to 3 times the UV exposure as pale skin. However, in order to cause true melanogenesis-tanning by means of UV exposure, some direct DNA photodamage must first be produced, and this requires UVB exposure (as present in natural sunlight, or sunlamps that produce UVB).|$|E

5000|$|Historical records {{suggest the}} Mauna Kea silversword was once {{dominant}} on Mauna Kea, adapting particularly well to wind-swept exposed alpine desert at altitudes of 2,600-3,800 m. [...] In this region, humidity is virtually zero and precipitation is generally {{in the form}} of winter snow. Mean annual rainfall is less than 51-102 cm per year, chiefly during the winter, with extreme drought during the summer. There is no shade from the hot tropical <b>sun</b> nor <b>protection</b> from nighttime temperatures which fall below freezing any time of year. The soil is thin, rocky, volcanic cinder. At the upper ranges of this habitat, no other plants grow.|$|R
40|$|Background Survivors of {{childhood}} cancer {{are at high}} risk for developing non-melanoma skin cancer and therefore are firmly advised to avoid or minimize sun exposure and adopt skin protec-tion measures. We aimed to compare <b>sun</b> exposure and <b>protection</b> habits in a cohort of pediatric patients with a history of malignancy to those of healthy controls. Methods Case-control study of 143 pediatric patients with a history of malignancy (aged 11. 2 ± 4. 6 y, Male = 68, mean interval from diagnosis 4. 4 ± 3. 8 y) and 150 healthy controls (aged 10. 4 ± 4. 8 y, Male = 67). <b>Sun</b> exposure and <b>protection</b> habits were assessed using validated questionnaires. Results Patients and controls reported similar sun exposure time during weekdays (94 ± 82 minutes/ day vs. 81 ± 65 minutes/day; p = 0. 83), while during weekends patients spent significantly less time outside compared to controls (103 ± 85 minutes/day vs. 124 ± 87 minutes/day; p...|$|R

40|$|Adequate {{photoprotection}} {{is essential}} to control UV-related disorders, including sunburn, photoaging and photocarcinogenisis. <b>Sun</b> avoidance, <b>protection</b> of skin with clothing, and sunscreens are presently {{the best way of}} photoprotection, assuming that they are used properly. However, new strategies -which are based on or make use of the endogenous protective response to UV light-, may further improve currently used photoprotective means. The addition of repair enzymes and/or antioxidants has a positive effect on skin's recovery from UV-induced DNA-damage. Several botanical agents, mainly vitamins and polyphenols, have shown to influence signal transduction pathways leading to photoprotective effects. Also stimulation of endogenous UV- response pathways via irradiation with a low UV dose or via simulation of UV-induced DNA-damage results in photoprotective effects. Future research in this field and combination of different photoprotective strategies will hopefully lead to improved photoprotection. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Chen was {{instrumental}} in backing <b>Sun</b> Yat-sen's Constitutional <b>Protection</b> Movement. He also restored Sun to power after the Guangdong-Guangxi War. Chen disagreed with Sun about the direction that reform should take--Sun wanted to unite the country by force and institute change through a centralized government based on a one-party system, while Chen advocated multiparty federalism with Guangdong becoming the model province and the peaceful unification of China. Sun became suspicious that the federalist movement was being exploited by the warlords to justify their military fiefdoms.|$|R
