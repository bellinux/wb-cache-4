50|$|Jack Ford was {{stationed}} in Times Square throughout the broadcast, and was also joined by entertainer Dick Clark (the creator and host of his namesake New Year's Rockin' Eve, which did not air due to ABC 2000) as a correspondent to conduct his traditional countdown. Other correspondents were Charles Gibson in London, Diane <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> Barbara Walters in Paris, Sam Donaldson at the Y2K Command Center in Washington, Connie Chung in Las Vegas, Deborah Roberts at Walt Disney World, Morton Dean in Moscow, and literally hundreds of others at ABC News, technicians and newsmen, who worked throughout the day to bring the broadcast. Those hundreds of others included ABC News personalities stationed {{around the world to}} cover the new year in every time zone, including Elizabeth Vargas in Sydney, Australia, Cokie Roberts at the Vatican, with her mother, the then U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican, Carole Simpson in Chicago, and Bob Brown, who narrated many segments consolidating the day's events. Local stations also featured their own coverage during time local breaks, which varied from traditional breaks for local news and weather to full-scale coverage of local countdowns and possible Y2K bug effects (which in ABC and local coverage, eventually became minimal as little to any issues came out of that).|$|E
50|$|While at The American Academy Rosenberg {{produced}} {{a series of}} etchings between the Fall of 1921 and the Spring of 1922 - The Rome Series, which initiated {{his career as a}} fine artist. One of the prints, St. Peter's Colonnade, would win a Silver Medal from The California Printmakers Society in 1922. But Rosenberg was not yet ready to give up the practice of architecture for the uncertain rewards of an artist's life, and returned to the United States where he took a job with the firm of York and <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> Once more chance intervened in his life: the British artist Muirhead Bone, an acquaintance of Phillip Sawyer, visited New York, and was immediately struck by Rosenberg's technical and artistic work. By Bone's encouragement, and through his influence, Rosenberg was able to attend The School of Engraving at The Royal College of Art in London, where he studied under the master printmaker Malcolm Osborne, A.R.A. Rosenberg moved to London in 1924, and over the next near produced two dozen prints, two of which won the Chicago Society of Etchers Logan Prize, one the Society of Brooklyn Etchers Prize, and seven of which were included in his volume of The American Etcher series (Volume X).|$|E
5000|$|Peter Sawyer (fl. 1850-1866) was an American thief and robber <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> City {{during the}} 1860s. A native of California, <b>Sawyer</b> {{appeared}} <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> Forth Ward and the waterfront {{in the years}} following the American Civil War. He is credited as being the first criminal to drug victims for the purposes of mugging them. Although sailors' homes and crimp houses had previously been using [...] "knock-out drops" [...] and [...] "slipping mickeys" [...] to shanghai sailors, Sawyer was the first to make effective use for armed robbery. At first, Sawyer used simple snuff which he dropped into the victim's alcohol but perfected the practice later on with chloral hydrate. This was the drug of choice, with exception to the occasional use of morphine, preferred by those who followed <b>Sawyer</b> <b>in</b> similar robberies. Indeed, the practice became so common in the city that these men were referred to as [...] "Peter Players" [...] by the police and underworld alike.|$|R
50|$|In 1874 Thomas Snell and James Sawyer, seventeen-year-old {{friends from}} London, {{secretly}} planned a voyage to the New World.

The <b>Sawyer</b> brothers arrived <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> on April 1, {{and after a few}} weeks headed toward Athens, Georgia, and then to Madison County, where they stayed and worked on a farm for $10 a month. Snell did eventually follow his friends to <b>New</b> <b>York</b> and made his way south to meet them. The three then made their way through Jefferson and Lawrenceville. Shortly after Snell's arrival, Charles left for Pennsylvania, later returning to the South and settling in Alabama, where he went into the turpentine business. James had gone also, in search of his brother, leaving Snell to work on the farm of A. A. Dyer.|$|R
