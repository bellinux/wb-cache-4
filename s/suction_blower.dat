40|$|The {{contamination}} {{mechanics and}} resulting failure modes of high voltage electrical insulation due to carbon/graphite fibers were examined. The high voltage insulation vulnerability to carbon/graphite fiber induced failure was evaluated using a contamination system {{which consisted of}} a fiber chopper, dispersal chamber, a contamination chamber, and air ducts and <b>suction</b> <b>blower.</b> Tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of fiber length, weathering, and wetness on the insulator's resistance to carbon/graphite fibers. The ability of nuclear, fossil, and hydro power generating stations to maintain normal power generation when the surrounding environment is contaminated by an accidental carbon fiber release was investigated. The vulnerability assessment included only the power plant generating equipment and its associated controls, instrumentation, and auxiliary and support systems...|$|E
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{proposes a}} practical methodology for estimating the operational vacuum for landfill biogas extraction from municipal landfills. The procedure {{is based on}} two sub-models which simulate landfill gas production from organic waste decomposition and distribution of gas pressure and gas movement induced by <b>suction</b> at a <b>blower</b> station. The two models are coupled in a single mass balance equation, obtaining {{a relationship between the}} operational vacuum and the amount of landfill gas that can be extracted from an assigned system of vertical wells. To better illustrate the procedure, it is applied to a case study, where a good agreement between simulated and measured data, within Â± 30 %, is obtained...|$|R
