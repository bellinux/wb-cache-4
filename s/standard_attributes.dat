40|$|Attribute subsetting is a meta-classification technique, {{based on}} {{learning}} multiple base-level classifiers on {{projections of the}} training data. In prior work with nearest-neighbour base classifiers, attribute subsetting was modified to learn only one classifier, then to selectively ignore attributes at classification time to generate multiple predictions. In this paper, the approach is generalized to any type of base classifier. This 'virtual attribute subsetting' requires a fast subset choice algorithm; one such algorithm is found and described. In tests with three different base classifier types, virtual attribute subsetting is shown to yield {{some or all of}} the benefits of <b>standard</b> <b>attribute</b> subsetting while reducing training time and storage requirements...|$|R
5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production, {{was caused by the}} failure of the government to adequately increase the money supply, which had remained steady on a per capita basis. Advocates of the gold <b>standard</b> <b>attributed</b> the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} {{characteristic of the}} method is that the panelists score the perceived intensities with reference to pre-learned, absolute intensity scales without regard to hedonic response or personal liking. The objective of the method {{is to make the}} resulting profiles universally understandable and usable anytime at any laboratory where panelists have been properly trained. The method provides for this purpose an array of <b>standard</b> <b>attributes</b> (the lexicon), each with its set of standards that define a scale of intensity from 0 to 15, which can be measured on a 15 cm line scale or simply recorded as a straight number. The method allows for use of other scaling schemes, following the principle that intensity strength is measured in the same way across attributes. The advantage of using a trained descriptive sensory panel is that resulting analytical sensory data allows full documentation of a sample's sensory properties that can be related to consumer responses and instrumental physical tests. The precision derives from strict protocols for manipulation and the use of accurately defined terms to discriminate and describe the qualitative properties (characteristics) and their relative intensities (strength) in each product.|$|E

Firstly, {{the court found}} that Brand was not registered to do business in CA, had no registered agent and no burden for state taxes. Secondly, the court stated, regarding (1) the advertisement that nonresident defendant's advertisement is influential only when it markets its own product by targeting forum residents but not when just other entities use the defendant's publication to promote their own businesses as in this case. With regard to (2) ticket sales, the court pointed out that they were third parties' business and insufficient to recognize the jurisdiction. Relating to (3) the employment of California web-design firm, the court decided it as [...] "fortuitous circumstance" [...] which is insufficient to premise jurisdiction because the firm formed California branch after its establishment of celebrity-gossip website. Also, the court stated (5) business relationship with California company was not sufficient, citing that [...] "engaging in commerce with residents of the forum state is not in and of itself the kind of activity that approximates physical presence within the state's borders." [...] And finally, regarding (6) interactive website, the court deemed it as <b>standard</b> <b>attributes</b> of many website. It said that if it permit general jurisdiction based on access to such website, it would lead to the result inconsistent with constitutional requirement of [...] "the continuous corporate operation within a state" [...] be [...] "so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against" [...] the non-resident defendant.|$|E

This paper develops a novel set of machine-learning classifiers for the domain of classifying files taken from software projects; the target classifications are based on origin analysis. Our approach adapts the output of four copy-analysis tools, generating a number of different measurements. By combining the measures and the files on which they operate, a large set of features is generated in a semi-automatic manner. After which, <b>standard</b> <b>attribute</b> selection and classifier training techniques yield a pool of high quality classifiers (accuracy in the range of 90 %), and information on the most relevant features...|$|R
