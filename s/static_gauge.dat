50|$|Great Britain has (in general) {{the most}} {{restrictive}} loading gauge (relative to track gauge) in the world. This is {{a legacy of}} the British railway network being the world's oldest, and having been built by a plethora of different private companies, each with different standards for the width and height of trains. After the nationalisation a standard <b>static</b> <b>gauge</b> W5 was defined in 1951 that would virtually fit everywhere in the network. The W6 gauge is a refinement to W5 and the W6a changed the lower body to accommodate third-rail electrification. While the upper body is rounded for W6a with a static curve, there is an additional small rectangular notch for W7 to accommodate transport of 2.44 m ISO containers and the W8 loading gauge has an even larger notch spanning outside of the curve to accommodate transport of 2.6 m ISO containers. While W5 to W9 are based on a rounded roof structure, those for W10 to W12 define a flat line at the top and, instead of a strict <b>static</b> <b>gauge</b> for the wagons, their sizes are derived from dynamic gauge computations for rectangular freight containers.|$|E
50|$|While <b>static</b> <b>gauge</b> {{pressure}} is of primary importance to determining net loads on pipe walls, dynamic {{pressure is}} used to measure flow rates and airspeed. Dynamic pressure can be measured by taking the differential pressure between instruments parallel and perpendicular to the flow. Pitot-static tubes, for example perform this measurement on airplanes to determine airspeed. The presence of the measuring instrument inevitably acts to divert flow and create turbulence, so its shape is critical to accuracy and the calibration curves are often non-linear.|$|E
40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{effective}} field theory of long relativistic strings such as confining flux tubes in QCD. We derive the Polchinski–Strominger interaction by a calculation in <b>static</b> <b>gauge.</b> This interaction implies that a non-critical string which initially oscillates in one direction gets excited in orthogonal directions as well. In <b>static</b> <b>gauge</b> no additional term in the effective action is needed to obtain this effect. It results from a one-loop calculation using the Nambu–Goto action. Non-linearly realized Lorentz symmetry is manifest at all stages in dimensional regularization.

40|$|Subject of our {{investigations}} is QCD {{formulated in}} terms of physical degrees of freedom. Starting from the Faddeev-Popov procedure, the canonical formulation of QCD is derived for <b>static</b> <b>gauges.</b> Particular emphasis is put on obstructions occurring when implementing gauge conditions and on the concomitant emergence of compact variables and singular fields. A detailed analysis of non-perturbative dynamics associated with such exceptional field configurations within Coulomb- and axial gauge is described. We present evidence that compact variables generate confinement-like phenomena in both gauges and point out the deficiencies in achieving a satisfactory non-perturbative treatment concerning all variables. Gauge fixed formulations are shown to constitute also a useful framework for phenomenological studies.

40|$|The {{low-energy}} {{effective action}} on long string-like objects in quantum field theory, such as confining strings, includes the Nambu-Goto action and then higher-derivative corrections. This action is diffeomorphism-invariant, {{and can be}} analyzed in various gauges. Polchinski and Strominger suggested a specific way to analyze this effective action in the orthogonal gauge, in which the induced metric on the worldsheet is conformally equivalent to a flat metric. Their suggestion leads to a specific term at the next order beyond the Nambu-Goto action. We compute the leading correction to the Nambu-Goto spectrum using the action that includes this term, and we show that it agrees with the leading correction previously computed in the <b>static</b> <b>gauge.</b> This gives a consistency check for the framework of Polchinski and Strominger, and helps to understand its relation to the theory in the <b>static</b> <b>gauge.</b> Comment: 21 page...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} U(1) gauged {{version of the}} 3 + 1 {{dimensional}} Faddeev-Skyrme model supplemented by the Maxwell term. We show that there exist axially symmetric static solutions coupled to the non-integer toroidal flux of magnetic field, which revert to the usual Hopfions A_m,n of lower degrees Q=mn {{in the limit of}} the gauge coupling constant vanishing. The masses of the <b>static</b> <b>gauged</b> Hopfions are found to be less than the corresponding masses of the usual ungauged solitons A_ 1, 1 and A_ 2, 1 respectively, they become lighter as gauge coupling increases. The dependence of the solutions on the gauge coupling is investigated. We find that in the strong coupling regime the gauged Hopfion carries two magnetic fluxes, which are quantized in units of 2 π, carrying n and m quanta respectively. The first flux encircles the position curve and the second one is directed along the symmetry axis. Effective quantization of the field in the gauge sector may allow us to reconsider the usual arguments concerning the lower topological bound in the Faddeev-Skyrme-Maxwell model.

40|$|We examine in non-Abelian {{gauge theory}} the heavy quark limit in the {{presence}} of the (anti-) self-dual homogeneous background field and see that a confining potential emerges, consistent with the Wilson criterion, although the potential is quadratic and not linear in the quark separation. This builds upon the well-known feature that propagators in such a background field are entire functions. The way in which deconfinement can occur at finite temperature is then studied in the <b>static</b> temporal <b>gauge</b> by calculation of the effective potential at high temperature. Finally we discuss the problems to be surmounted in setting up the calculation of the effective potential nonperturbatively on the lattice. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{low-energy}} effective action governing the transverse fluctuations {{of a long}} string, such as a confining flux tube in QCD. We work in the <b>static</b> <b>gauge</b> where this action contains only the transverse excitations of the string. The <b>static</b> <b>gauge</b> action is strongly constrained by the requirement that the Lorentz symmetry, that is spontaneously broken by the long string vacuum, is nonlinearly realized on the Nambu-Goldstone bosons. One solution to the constraints (at the classical level) is the Nambu-Goto action, and the general solution contains higher derivative corrections to this. We show that in 2 + 1 dimensions, the first allowed correction to the Nambu-Goto action {{is proportional to the}} squared curvature of the induced metric on the worldsheet. In higher dimensions, there is a more complicated allowed correction that appears at lower order than the curvature squared. We argue that this leading correction is similar to, but not identical to, the one-loop determinant (√(-h) R ^- 1 R) computed by Polyakov for the bosonic fundamental string. Comment: 15 page...|$|E

The original proposal, for a 3 -year program to explore in-plane streamline curvature effects on a supersonic turbulent boundary layer using three-dimensional pressure fields generated by fins and wall geometry, ended after one year.

40|$|The {{presence}} of highly non-linear friction damping in the suspensions of many freight vehicles reduces prediction accuracy when using traditional kinematic gauging techniques.

40|$|The Lagrangians and Hamiltonians of {{classical}} field theory require to comprise gauge fields {{in order to}} be form-invariant under local gauge transformations.

In this paper, this principle is extended to require additionly the form-invariance of a classical field theory Hamiltonian under variations of the space-time curvature emerging from the gauge fields. This approach is devised {{on the basis of the}} extended canonical transformation formalism {{of classical}} field theory which allows for transformations of the space-time metric in addition to transformations of the fields. Working out the Hamiltonian that is form-invariant under extended local gauge transformations, we can dismiss the conventional requirement for gauge bosons to be massless in order for them to preserve the local gauge invariance.
