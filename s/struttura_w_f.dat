Changes were installed in the OPUS pipeline on May 16, 1997. With a few exceptions, changes to non-UV filter modes were relatively minor: generally ~ 1 - 2 % or less (changes in F 785 LP, F 850 LP, and F 1042 M were higher: ~ 1 - 4 %, ~ 1 - 6 %, and ~ 2 - 15 % respectively, depending on the chip.). The UV filters required somewhat larger changes to bring synphot into agreement with the observations, ranging from ~ 2 % (e. g., <b>F</b> 255 <b>W</b> and <b>F</b> 300 <b>W)</b> to ~ 5 % (<b>F</b> 170 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 218 <b>W)</b> to 10 % or more (F 160 BW, F 375 N).

We observed 15 Mon, an O 7 Ve-type star, using five different pointings to position the star at different locations on three WFPC 2 chips (PC 1, WF 2, and WF 3) to study possible filter inhomogeneities. We also observed g Gem, a K 4 III-type star, with WF 3 as a follow-up to further study selected filters. Our results for F 160 BW, <b>F</b> 170 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 300 <b>W,</b> and <b>F</b> 336 <b>W</b> show good agreement (within 20 %) between the observed off-band count rates and those predicted by SYNPHOT.

40|$|There is an ``algebraisation'' of {{the notion}} of weak factorisation system (<b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> s.) known as a natural weak factorisation system. In it, the two classes of maps of a <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> s. are {{replaced}} by two categories of maps-with-structure, where the extra structure on a map now encodes a choice of liftings with respect to the other class. This extra structure has pleasant consequences: for example, a natural <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> s. on C induces a canonical natural <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> s. structure on any functor category [A, C]. In this paper, we define cofibrantly generated natural weak factorisation systems by analogy with cofibrantly generated <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> s. 's. We then construct them by a method which is reminiscent of Quillen's small object argument but produces factorisations which are much smaller and easier to handle, and show that the resultant natural <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> s. is, in a suitable sense, freely generated by its generating cofibrations. Finally, we show that the two categories of maps-with-structure for a natural <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> s. are closed under all the constructions we would expect of them: (co) limits, pushouts / pullbacks, transfinite composition, and so on.

40|$|We present grids of {{magnitudes}} and colours for the WFPC 2 of the refurbished HST using passbands {{from the}} far UV to the near infrared, i. e. the filters <b>F</b> 170 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 218 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 255 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 300 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 336 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 439 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 450 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 555 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 606 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 702 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 814 <b>W,</b> and <b>F</b> 850 LP. In addition to this, we consider also the filters <b>F</b> 150 <b>W</b> + <b>F</b> 130 LP, <b>F</b> 175 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 220 <b>W</b> and <b>F</b> 342 <b>W</b> of the old HST in the FOC mode in which {{a great deal of}} observations have been taken. The theoretical magnitudes and colours are calculated convolving spectral energy distributions with different metallicity (Z), effective temperature (T-eff), and gravity with the pass-band transmission, response of the camera, and telescope assembly. In order to enable an easy usage of the present results we provide tabulations of Bolometric Corrections BCDelta lambdaHST as function of gravity, T-eff, and chemical composition for each pass-band under consideration. As already pointed out by Yi et al. (1995), the UV filters suffer from the visible/red-leak problem, which destroys the monotonic relation between colours and T-eff and causes serious difficulties to analyze the data. With the aid of the above technique we calculate isochrones in the observational colour - magnitude diagram (CMD) and integrated magnitudes and colours of single stellar populations (SSP). The ages span the range from 18 Gyr to 0. 01 Gyr. For the sake of brevity, results are described here in some detail limited to the solar chemical composition [Y = 0. 28 Z = 0. 020]. In addition to this, rye present synthetic CMDs for a composite sample of stars containing both young and old objects as they would appear in various pass-bands. Finally, we address the question whether the variation of the UV colours of elliptical galaxies {{as a function of the}} red-shift shows signatures from which one can infer the age and the type of source emitting the UV flux. The goal is achieved looking at the red-shift dependence of colours obtained from the pass-bands <b>F</b> 170 <b>W,</b> <b>F</b> 210 <b>W,</b> and <b>F</b> 555 <b>W</b> at varying the Hubble constant Ho and deceleration parameter go defining the model of the Universe. It is found that those colours run differently according to underlying source, i. e either P-AGB or P-AGB plus H-HB and AGB-manque stars (see below for details) and the cosmological parameters. If the UV flux is mainly generated by P-AGB plus H-HB and AGB-manque stars a marked discontinuity in suitable UV colours is expected at the red-shift corresponding to the age of about 5. 6 Gyr...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The wild forest {{reindeer}} is a subspecies of the reindeer. Wild forest reindeer {{earlier had}} a wide distribution range in Sweden, {{but it was}} extinct {{in the middle of}} the 19 :th century because of extensive hunting. In Finland, the <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> reindeer was extinct a few decades later by similar reasons. Later they migrated back to the eastern parts of Finland {{in the middle of the}} 20 : th century. Around 1980, the <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> reindeer was actively rentroduced to western Finland, and there the population has had a positive development. In eastern Finland though, the population have declined fast during the last years. This is partly due to an increased abundance of large predators, particularly wolf. In this study I investigated the possibilities for, and attitudes towards, a reintroduction of <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> reindeer in parts of Sweden. My result indicates that the environmental possibilities for a reintroduction of <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> reindeer to parts of Sweden probably are fairly good to good. The attitudes towards the <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> reindeer is both positive and negative, much depending if you ask a hunter or an owner of semi-domestic reindeer. Many persons in my study can see several benefits with a reintroduction of <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> reindeer, e. g. increase of hunting and recreational value of the nature. A problem that a reintroduction of <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> reindeer in Sweden could cause, is that the <b>w.</b> <b>f.</b> reindeer can be mixed with the herds of semi-domestic reindeer. Experiences from Finland show that the reindeermanagement is disturbed when this happens. This is an important problem, or challenge, to solve if a reintroduction should be possible in the future...|$|R
