50|$|National flag vessels at sea. The vessel is {{considered}} {{to be part of the}} territory of the nation whose flag it flies, and subject to the laws of that nation. A vessel without a national flag may be considered a <b>stateless</b> <b>vessel.</b> A <b>stateless</b> <b>vessel</b> is, on the high seas, not subject to any State's exclusive jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|MV Morning Glory, {{formerly}} Gulf Glory, Bandar Ayu, and Pergiwati, is an 1993-built Aframax {{crude oil}} tanker. Considered a <b>stateless</b> <b>vessel</b> with stolen cargo, the tanker {{was seized by}} United States Special Forces southeast of Cyprus in the eastern Mediterranean on March 16, 2014. The intervention occurred upon {{the request of the}} Libyan and Cypriot governments.|$|E
50|$|Universal {{jurisdiction}} {{differs from}} a state's prosecuting crimes {{under its own}} laws, whether on its own territory (territorial jurisdiction) or abroad (extraterritorial jurisdiction). As an example, the US asserts jurisdiction over <b>stateless</b> <b>vessels</b> carrying illicit drugs on international waters—but here the US reaches across national borders to enforce its own law; rather than invoking universal jurisdiction and trans-national standards of right and wrong.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} numerous reports of vessels without nationality fishing in contravention of international {{conservation and management}} measures. During the summer of 1998, for example, four vessels registered to Sierra Leone were sighted fishing {{on the high seas}} in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) regulatory area. These vessels were known throughout the international community to be flying 2 ̆ 2 flags of convenience 2 ̆ 2 [...] having only the most tenuous link to their flag state. Bowing to direct diplomatic pressure, Sierra Leone refuted the vessels 2 ̆ 7 registration, rendering them stateless and, therefore, subject to the jurisdiction of any state that approached them on the high seas. Such situations are becoming more common. The apparent increase in vessels fishing on the high seas without the protection of a flag state likely has several causes. Many states, like Sierra Leone, known to grant flags of convenience, have yielded to direct diplomatic pressure and purged their registries of illegitimate vessels. Others have begun voluntarily applying the principles underlying the 1995 United Nations Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and the 1993 Food and Agriculture Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas. Unfortunately, neither the international community nor the United States has effective tools at its disposal to deal with <b>stateless</b> <b>vessels</b> fishing illegally on the high seas. This Article reviews the current status of international and United States domestic law applicable to vessels without nationality seen fishing the high seas in contravention of international conservation and management measures. The discussion begins in Part II with a survey of the international regime of the high seas, and reviews the importance of the exclusivity rule of flag state jurisdiction on the high seas and exceptions therein, including <b>stateless</b> <b>vessels</b> and <b>vessels</b> assimilated to <b>stateless</b> status. Part III is a brief analysis of international tools and how they interact in the current international legal regime of the high seas. Part IV outlines the High Seas Fishing Compliance Act of 1995 as it is currently written, and suggests a legislative change that would allow the United States to enforce international and multilateral agreements against <b>stateless</b> <b>vessels</b> and those assimilated to stateless status seen fishing on the high seas...|$|R
40|$|This article examines, {{from a legal}} perspective, {{a recent}} Council of Europe {{multilateral}} Agreement on the interdiction of vessels engaged in drug trafficking activities in International waters. The paper notes the intimate connection between this Agreement and the 1988 UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and {{the nature and extent}} of the efforts made in the former to supplement and strengthen the latter. Particular attention is paid to developments relating to action against <b>stateless</b> <b>vessels,</b> measures taken at the request of the Flag State, and the central role accorded to the concept of preferential jurisdiction in instances where law enforcement activities are initiated by one party with the prior consent of the Flag State. Other issues of interest in a law of the sea context ranging from the regulation of the use of force to the payment of compensation are also addressed. ...|$|R
50|$|In March 2016, HMAS Darwin, intercepted a small, <b>stateless</b> fishing <b>vessel</b> about 170 {{nautical}} {{miles off the}} coast of Oman. On board they found more than 2,000 pieces of weaponry, including 1,989 AK-47 assault rifles and 100 rocket propelled grenades. According to a U.S. assessment, the weapons were initially sent from Iran and were likely intended for Houthi rebels in Yemen.|$|R
40|$|Drug {{smuggling}} {{into the}} United States {{has grown to}} epidemic proportions during the last decade. The primary avenue for drug shipment is the high seas. To preserve comity among nations, U. S. courts seek to abide by principles of international law to obtain jurisdiction over acts of trafficking committed aboard U. S., <b>stateless,</b> and foreign <b>vessels</b> on the open seas. In the past, courts generally were able to establish adequate jurisdictional grounds based on these principles. Nevertheless, stringent substantive laws that required proof of a nexus between the narcotics aboard the vessels and the United States hampered the control of illegal drug importation...|$|R
