40|$|This study {{proposes that}} family <b>systems</b> <b>therapy</b> can prove useful in {{understanding}} Biblical families and thus {{add to our}} understanding of the Bible. Employing family <b>systems</b> <b>therapy</b> is appropriate because the Biblical narrative contains a comprehensive treatment of the human family. The Bible deals with family overall, many speciﬁc families as in the Jacob cycle, and ends with a vision of the family of God that exists already in the kingdom of heaven. Family systems theory is often useful to the pastor in understanding his/her own family, and the larger extended family of their church congregation. Thus, with new freshness family systems helps us grasp the truth that Biblical families are like the families we know, our own families. Such appreciation can provide useful material for preaching, teaching and pastoral counselling. This study will begin by outlining some basic concepts of family <b>systems</b> <b>therapy</b> in the ﬁrst chapter. It will follow by examining the Old Testament concept of family in Genesis I- 3 and analyse a number of representative families in the Old Testament such as Adam and Eve, Jacob, Moses, Ruth and Naomi, and David’s families. Proceeding to the New Testament there will be a focus especially on issues of fusion, differentiation, and triangulation applying these concepts to Jesus, Paul, Peter and the Prodigal Son. The chapter on the New Testament will close by offering a suggestion about what the eschatological end of the family might be. Finally, this study points out limitations in the use of family <b>systems</b> <b>therapy</b> for Biblical interpretation, outlines possible pastoral applications, and discusses how far we can use Biblical models of family in support of the concept “traditional family values. ...|$|R

40|$|The Impact of Erigo Robotic <b>System</b> <b>Therapy</b> in Patients After Spinal Cord Injury Abstract: This {{bachelor}} thesis aims to {{shed light}} on the effects of Erigo robotic <b>system</b> <b>therapy</b> in patients after spinal cord injury. Currently, careful attention is devoted to research seeking new ways to cure or treat spinal cord injury. Even though we are just beginning to understand neuroregeneration processes, new rehabilitation robotic systems and devices are gradually starting to occupy a significant role especially in early rehabilitation after spinal cord injury. The first part of this thesis describes spinal cord injuries with a focus on health implications and complications the injured person has to come to terms with. Employing robot-assisted therapy in early rehabilitation stages can prevent a number of problems. By doing so, such therapy can improve the patients' functional condition, self-reliance their recovery and return to ordinary life. The use of robotic systems is becoming a standard in many rehabilitation facilities. This bachelor thesis will focus on the frequently used Erigo robotic system and on evaluating the effects of Erigo therapy. The thesis will describe the functions of the Erigo and its advantages. Moreover, several aspects of focus and evaluation criteria will be identified. These aspects will [...] ...|$|E

40|$|SummaryAlthough {{endogenous}} {{recruitment of}} adult neural stem cells {{has been proposed}} as a therapeutic strategy, clinical approaches for achieving this are lacking. Here, we show that metformin, a widely used drug, promotes neurogenesis and enhances spatial memory formation. Specifically, we show that an atypical PKC-CBP pathway {{is essential for the}} normal genesis of neurons from neural precursors and that metformin activates this pathway to promote rodent and human neurogenesis in culture. Metformin also enhances neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain in a CBP-dependent fashion, and in so doing enhances spatial reversal learning in the water maze. Thus, metformin, by activating an aPKC-CBP pathway, recruits neural stem cells and enhances neural function, thereby providing a candidate pharmacological approach for nervous <b>system</b> <b>therapy.</b> Video Abstrac...|$|E

Conservative {{treatment}} of secondary recurrent unguis incarnatus {{are not very}} effective and Dupuytren’s method, Emmert-Schmiden surgeries etc. are very traumatic, disfigure nail bone, distort anatomic and functional unity of a nail. Objective. The aim of our research was the optimal sequence of holiatry, surgical moving away from nails, local and <b>system</b> <b>therapy</b> after excision of the staggered nails in case of destructive onychomycosis complicated by secondary ingrown nail for some patients with complicated mycotic defeat of nails. Clinical options of surgical treatment were clarified; morphologic changes were studied; causes of unsatisfactory outcomes of chronic pathology complex treatment were analyzed for prospective approaches to preventing of relapses. Methods. The analysis justifies the feasibility of establishing of predictive relationships between clinical variants of chronic purulent necrotic infections and combined comorbidity. <b>System</b> <b>therapy</b> by itraconazole before operative treatment (basic onychial defeats sanation) and in a postoperative period was carried out. Types of operative treatment applied may be divided into five statistic groups. Results. Over a five-year period (2010 - 2015) 436 unguis incarnates diagnosis (325 cases of incarnated onychomycosis) in 259 men and 177 women aged 12 - 67 were performed, 38 of them with incarnated onychogryphosis had diabetes mellitus and 24 had metabolic syndrome. Analysis of subonychial scraping allowed stating the prevalence of red trichophytia in 31 % of cases with the bacterial flora. Patients with combined pathology got 4 - 5 five-day system ‘pulses’ of 400 mg/day itraconazole therapy. In patients with primary advantage of providing low-impact methods of nail excision with access via onycholisation structure a nail extirpation and marginal matricectomy was carried out; dermatophytoms and stratification on a nail bed were deleted.
