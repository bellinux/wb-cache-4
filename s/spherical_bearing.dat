50|$|Spherical {{bearings}} {{can be of}} a hydrostatic or mechanical construction. A <b>spherical</b> <b>bearing</b> {{by itself}} consists of an outer ring {{and an inner ring}} and a locking feature that makes the inner ring captive within the outer ring in the axial direction only. The outer surface of the inner ring and the inner surface of the outer ring are spherical (or more correctly, toroidal) and are collectively considered the raceway and they slide against each other, either with a lubricant, a maintenance-free (typically polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE) based liner, or they incorporate a rolling element such as a race of ball-bearings, allowing lower friction.|$|E
5000|$|Spherical {{bearings}} {{are used}} in countless applications, wherever rotational motion {{must be allowed to}} change the alignment of its rotation axis. A good example is the drive axle bearings of a vehicle control arm (or A-arm) suspension. The mechanics of the suspension allow the axle to move up and down (and the wheel to turn in order to steer the vehicle), and the axle bearings must allow the rotational axis of the axle to change without binding. While in practice, spherical bearings are not used here, it is a simple concept that illustrates a possible application of a <b>spherical</b> <b>bearing.</b> In fact, spherical bearings {{are used in}} smaller sub-components of this type of suspension, for example certain types of constant-velocity joints.|$|E

In this study, a novel metal-on-metal hip implant employing a specific aspherical bearing surface, Alpharabola, as the acetabular surface was investigated for both contact mechanics and elastohydrodynamic lubrication under steady-state conditions. When compared with conventional <b>spherical</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces, a more uniform pressure distribution and a thicker lubricant film thickness within the loaded conjunction were predicted for this novel Alpharabola hip implant.
