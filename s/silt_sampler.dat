40|$|Earthquakes {{are natural}} calamities that {{occur as a}} result of sudden release of strain energy stored in fault planes. Earthquakes have been {{observed}} to cause huge damage to infrastructures and lives. Earthquakes result in development of fissures, abnormal or unequal movement of foundations, and loss of strength and stiffness of the soils. Liquefaction is attributed as a major cause for the loss of strength and stiffness of soil during earthquakes. In the past, liquefaction was attributed only to coarse-grained to medium-grained sand and was extensively studied but the fine-grained soils were generally considered as non-liquefiable. However, from observations during recent earthquakes, fine-grained soils having low plasticity (plasticity index (PI) 3 ̆c 20) have experienced ground failures due to liquefaction or large deformations. Moreover, laboratory experiments show that not only saturated cohesionless soils but also fine-grained soils may liquefy if certain criteria are met. One of the parameters which influences the liquefaction characteristics of fine-grained soils is its plasticity. This study may become helpful in understanding the effect of plasticity on liquefaction resistance of fine-grained soils. The objective of this study were to investigate the (1) effect of plasticity on pore pressure built up and deformation characteristics of fine-grained soils, and (2) effects of cyclic shear stress on liquefaction resistance of fine-grained soils. A total of 24 tests were conducted using a stress controlled cyclic triaxial testing machine on identically prepared specimens at an initial effective confining pressure of 5. 0 psi. The plasticity index (PI) was varied from non-plastic (NP) to 14. 53. Sil-Co-Sil # 40, a non-plastic commercial silt (product of US Silica Company) and EPK Kaolin clay (product of Edgar Minerals Inc.) were used as base materials. These materials were mixed in different proportions to obtain desired plasticity index. Out of the twenty-four tests, eleven tests were conducted on clean <b>silt</b> <b>samples.</b> Among the tests on clean <b>silt</b> <b>samples,</b> four tests were conducted on specimens having a post consolidation void ratio of 0. 74 to 0. 76. Further, six tests were conducted on specimens having a post consolidation void ratio of 0. 74 to 1. 04 by using a cyclic stress ratio (CSR) of 0. 2 and 0. 25. Seventeen tests were grouped to study the influence of plasticity on liquefaction characteristics of fine-grained soil. The PI of specimens tested ranged from non-plastic (NP) to 14. 53. Each of the specimens with a definite PI was tested at an initial confining pressure of 5. 0 psi using a CSR of 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 4. The results obtained from the tests were used to compare the effects of plasticity on liquefaction characteristics of fine-grained soils. Based on the limited tests conducted, it was observed that plasticity index had distinct influence on the cyclic strength of the samples. It was found that CSR required to cause a pre-determined strain in a given number of loading cycles reduces as the plasticity index increases from non-plastic (NP) to 3. 46, but increases for soils having PI greater than 3. 46.

The c- spacing of the K- saturated montmorillonite, beidel-lite, and nontronite in the normal hydrated state was variable, and this {{was found to be}} correlated to the humidity in the atmosphere. When the humidity was controlled, reproducible results were ob-tained. All of the unheated K- saturated minerals collapsed to about 10. 451 when X-rayed under a controlled humidity of 7 %. It was concluded that humidity control during X- raying is essential. It was also found that the rate of hydration and dehydration of the samples was very rapid and detectable within the time it took to scan a sample by the usual method. Ca and Mg- montmorillonite expanded to 17. 2 and 17. 5 Á with ethylene glycol and glycerol, respectively. Ca and Mg-ver-miculite expanded to 14. 3 with either liquid. Ca and Mg- beidel-lite expanded to 17. 2 Á. with ethylene glycol but only to 14. 5 Á with glycerol.

40|$|Interpretation {{of results}} from CPTU testing in silty soils is very {{challenging}} {{and it is}} hard to obtain reliable design parameters. The main reason is that penetration in silts may occur under partially drained conditions. Interpretation methods for sand are based on drained behaviour while for clay undrained behaviour is assumed. For silts there is an intermediate drainage condition that should be better understood. The present PhD work focuses on studying: a) the failure mechanism and b) the pore pressure generation/dissipation during CPTU in silty soils by combining experimental laboratory tests and numerical simulations. The experimental work is performed in model scale in laboratories. The work applies techniques like freezing after penetration, x-ray imaging using a medical scanner and x-ray micro computerized tomography (x-ray micro CT) combined with 3 D-volumetric digital image correlation (3 D-DIC). These techniques allow the direct observation and quantification of the failure mechanism around a cone tip that has penetrated a soil sample. The non-destructive technique of combining x-ray micro CT and 3 D-DIC gives the most accurate results in terms of volumetric and shear strains. The samples used have low moisture content. Silt is known to dilate during static shearing to failure. In spite of this, the analysis shows a well-developed compaction zone below the cone tip with significant dilation zones adjacent to the probe, below and outside the compaction zone. Laboratory CPTU tests with variable penetration rates are further performed on saturated samples. The samples used are identical in size and boundary conditions to the ones used for the x-ray micro CT tests. Measurements of pore pressure on the penetrating cone {{as well as in the}} <b>silt</b> <b>sample</b> reflect how pore pressure is linked to dilation, contraction and internal drainage. Measurements of cone penetration resistance and soil stresses in the sample are also carried out. The cone resistance and cone pore pressure vary with penetration rate. Different behaviouristic responses are identified for varying sample density: (1) for high density, a more dilative response where cone resistance increases and cone pore pressure decreases with an increase in penetration rate; (2) for low density, a somewhat contractive response where cone resistance decreases and cone pore pressure increases with an increase in penetration rate and (3) for medium density, the presence of both patterns of behaviour where increasing the penetration rate from very slow rate (drained behaviour) gives a reduction in resistance, as the rate grew and for further increase in rate towards very fast rate (approaching undrained conditions) the resistance increases again. A procedure is developed and applied to study the micromechanical properties of miniature <b>silt</b> <b>samples</b> extracted from medium density specimens. The saturated silt specimens are penetrated by the CPTU, frozen and cut through its centre to prepare thin sections of the zones around the probe. Electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) enable quantification of porosity and dominating particle orientation in various locations around the tip and indicate the presence of both compaction and dilation zones like found from 3 D-DIC. Micromechanical studies also suggest that for slow penetration rate, compaction dominates the failure process while for fast penetration rate, dilation dominates. At an intermediate rate, the results indicate the effect of partial drainage. Finite element (FE) analyses are performed to shed further light on the processes governing the experimental results. An advanced soil model with dilatancy control is used in a simplified simulation procedure. The numerical simulations involve a simplified FE technique that accounts for large deformations to a certain extent and seems to capture several features of the observed behaviour. Comparisons are made between measurements and simulations of penetration force, soil stresses and pore pressure. A short discussion on possible recommendations for interpretation of CPTU test on silty soils in the field supports the application of the NTH-method for the interpretation of effective stress parameters.

40|$|Short box cores (to 30 cm bsf) and {{seafloor}} carbonate grab {{samples were}} acquired at mapped hydrocarbon seep sites (600 – 1200 m water depths) during the 2007 RV SONNE SO 191 cruise on the Hikurangi Margin offshore eastern North Island, New Zealand, {{to evaluate the}} influence of methane seepage on sedimentologic, biotic, mineralogic and stable isotopic attributes of seabed sediments. Sedimentary horizons in the box cores consist of siliciclastic silts and sands, shell beds and nodular, microcrystalline aragonite bands up to 15 cm thick. The megafauna is dominated by infaunal to semi-infaunal chemosymbiotic bivalves (Calyptogena, Lucinoma, and Acharax), as well as associated worms and carnivorous and grazing gastropods. Burrows in silts, some occupied by worms or juvenile Acharax, mainly have simple morphologies more typical of high-energy, nearshore settings than deep-sea environments, while a few are large and sparsely branched with wall scratch marks inferred to be of decapod crustacean origin. The box core silts and nodular carbonate samples vary in TOC content from 0. 2 to 0. 9 wt. %, carbonate content from 4 to 78 %, and d 13 C and d 18 O values from - 50. 3 to - 0. 6 ‰ PDB and + 0. 77 to + 3. 2 ‰ PDB, respectively. Low carbonate content <b>silt</b> <b>samples</b> have the most enriched d 13 C values, implying a seawater source for their pore water bicarbonate. Negative d 13 C and positive d 18 O values typify the nodular, microcrystalline aragonite bands, indicating formation during microbially mediated, sulphate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in a cold, near-seafloor environment, as is also supported by lipid biomarker data. A clear isotopic mixing trend of decreasing d 13 C and increasing d 18 O and carbonate content in the fine (13 C c. - 20 ‰ PDB, d 18 O up to + 7 ‰ PDB) suggest derivation from an oxidised methane pool, and pore fluid freshening by gas hydrate dissociation or from mobilized burial fluids that have undergone clay mineral dehydration...|$|R
40|$|Earthquakes are {{the violent}} {{expression}} of plate motion {{caused by a}} sudden release of elastic energy along fault planes known {{from a variety of}} tectonic settings. The seismically most active regions on Earth are the subduction zones, where lithospheric plates descend. Especially the Nankai subduction zone southeast of the Japanese islands of Honshu and Shikoku is known for the repeated occurrence of strong earthquakes and devastating tsunamis. The large-scale processes of stick-slip instabilities responsible for earthquake generation are vastly studied, but at least in parts not well understood. This thesis aims to investigate the fundamental processes of faulting and earthquake generation in a setting of converging lithospheric plates. Deformation processes in front of the seismogenic zone and in the accretionary wedge are in the main focus of this work. The question whether the rocks of the Nankai accretionary prisms are capable to produce surface breaks and related tsunamis by brittle faulting, or whether these rocks are capable of distributing deformation within large volumes (slow, stable slip) will be answered. For this purpose, deformation experiments of drill cores from the Nankai accretionary prism were conducted to provide information on the geotechnical properties of the near-surface sediments. Analogue cases exposed along the coast line of Shikoku Island and Boso Peninsula cover those parts in the accretionary prism not accessible by deep sea drilling, so far. Microstructural studies will connect the laboratory data to the natural case. The first study provides a unique dataset of sonic velocities measured during triaxial deformation under laboratory conditions. The slity clay and clayey <b>silt</b> <b>samples</b> were obtained from IODP Expeditions 315, 316 and 333. Seismic time series analysis helped to increase the data quality and to identify erroneous first arrival picks identified by trace-by-trace picking. During axial deformation, the compressional and shear wave velocities (Vp and Vs) range between 1300 – 2200 m/s and 150 - 800 m/s, respectively. Different velocities were measured for the tectonic settings. Samples from the frontal thrust (accretionary prism toe) show higher Vp compared to the samples from the megasplay fault settings, whereas lowest Vp were measured for the incoming plate sediments, being characterized by higher clay contents compared to the accretionary prism sediments. Generally, Vp increases slightly with increasing effective confining pressure and effective principal stress. Similar observations were made for Vs, irrespective of tectonic setting and composition. Shear, bulk and elastic moduli were calculated from the velocities to differentiate between tectonic settings. The shear moduli ranges between 0. 2 – 1. 3 GPa and the bulk modulus between 3. 8 – 8. 4 GPa, while the elastic moduli, ranges between 0. 5 – 3. 8 GPa pointing to over-consolidation of the accretionary prism toe samples and normal consolidation of the footwall of the megasplay fault and incoming plate. The results of Rietveld refinement-based synchrotron texture analysis and microfabric studies of the slity clay and clayey <b>silt</b> <b>samples</b> are reported {{in the second part of}} the thesis. Crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) of illite, kaolinite and smectite basal planes is bedding-parallel and increases with depth. Bedding parallel orientation of the basal planes of the phyllosilicates is preserved in samples tilted by tectonic deformation, indicating progressive burial and compaction as texture forming processes. Shape preferred orientation (SPO) of micropores and detrital illites investigated by Scanning Electron micrographs indicate natural compaction as well. Samples deformed in triaxial experiments differ from these observations as basal planes of phyllosilicates and calcite are oriented almost always perpendicular to the experimental shortening direction. SPO analyses indicate reorientation or flattening of the micropores due to experimental deformation. From these data we show that even in water-rich fine-grained and phyllosilicate rich sediments synchrotron x-ray radiation allows to quantify textures. In the third part, the results of triaxial deformation tests of mudstone samples derived from the tectonically exhumed accretionary prisms belonging to the Boso and Shimanto Belts, representing pre-exhumation burial depths up to 9000 m are presented. To investigate the geomechanical properties of these rocks, pressure stepping tests, constant confining pressure tests and a cyclic loading tests were conducted. To determine the effective shear parameters angle of internal friction and cohesion experimental results were used. Friction angles between 30 and 50 ° are rather high. The sample cohesion for Boso and Shimanto ranges between 2 and 6 MPa and 13 and > 30 MPa, respectively. Due to structural and compositional similarities to the Nankai accretionary prism, the results can be used to estimate the geomechanical properties of the deeper parts of the Nankai accretionary prism, which are not accessible by deep sea drilling. The data shows that the forearc rocks are relatively strong. Diagenesis and/ or low-grade metamorphism increase the cohesion. From the data we conclude that stresses up to 18 MPa can be transmitted to the updip limit of the seismogenic zone and between 5 to 13 MPa to the actively deforming frontal prism. In the article of Stipp et al. (2013), to which I contributed as co-author, whole-round core samples drilled during IODP Expedition 315, 316 and 333 were experimentally deformed in a triaxial cell having been drilled in depths between 28 – 128 m below sea floor (mbsf). During undrained experimental deformation, at 400 to 1000 kPa confining pressure, between 0. 001 – 9. 0 mm/min displacement rate, up to ~ 64 % axial compressive strain was reached. Although composition and grain size distribution of the slity clay and clayey <b>silt</b> <b>samples</b> is rather similar, geomechanical data lead to the distinction of two ‘rheological groups’. (1) Structurally weak samples, showing peak deviatoric stress conditions after few percent of compressional strain, continuous stress decrease after peak conditions and contractant behavior (increasing pore pressure) and (2) structurally strong samples, showing continuous strength increase or weaken only moderately at much higher strength levels and higher strains. Strong samples from the accretionary prism toe are overconsolidated, while the weak samples from further upslope are normally consolidated, similar to the samples from the incoming plate. The mechanical state of the décollement can be inferred from the results of the triaxial tests. Up to 18 MPa can be transmitted to the updip limit of the seismogenic zone and up to 13 MPa to the backstop of the active deforming prism. Overconsolidated frontal thrust sediments are able to stable slip and strain partitioning resulting in folding. The middle part of the accretionary prism tends to creep under cyclic loading. Normal consolidated sediments of the megasplay setting are capable to unstable slip and brittle faulting and thus can produce surface breaks. Crystallographic preferred orientation and shape preferred orientation may act as runaway structures transmitting strains to the (near) sea floor...|$|R
