50|$|Applying {{the facts}} to the case, {{the court held that}} (1) the mistake of the bank in {{overlooking}} the instruction to stop the cheque caused the payment; that (2) as the bank was acting without mandate, no obligation of the Association to the payee was discharge, and it follows from this that the payee gave no consideration to the bank for payment; (3) {{there was no evidence of}} any change of position by the recipient. Accordingly, the court ordered that the <b>sums</b> be <b>repaid</b> to the bank.|$|R
50|$|For his services, Aylmer {{was made}} a Companion of the Order of the Bath. He was also awarded the royal order of St Ferdinand and of Merit for {{transporting}} freed Italian slaves to Naples together with the <b>sum</b> of money <b>repaid</b> by the Algerians. Spain also honoured him as a knight of the royal military order of St Fernando.|$|R
50|$|When it {{was time}} to renew the charter in 1766, the first {{directors}} were Robert Finlay of Irish and Scottish origin, Swedish Fabian Löwen and Georg Herman Conradi of German descent, all residing in Stockholm. With this the power within the management shifted from Gothenburg to Stockholm, where two new ships also were bought. The Swedish government extorted a loan at 6% interest to the SOIC to be paid during 1766-69, estimated in 1813 to have been the equivalent of £100,000, and another, interest-free, for half of that <b>sum,</b> to be <b>repaid</b> out of import duties, in essence an advance payment of duty.|$|R
5000|$|Lord Goff {{noted that}} {{normally}} {{a failure to}} repay a loan results in a claim in contract, but on {{the facts of this}} case that remedy was not available because of the fraudulent changes to the documentation. Accordingly, he turned to the problem of whether there had been a total failure of consideration. He noted that [...] "although no part of the principal <b>sum</b> had been <b>repaid</b> by the appellants, two instalments of interest had been paid; and the question arises whether these two payments of interest precluded recovery on the basis that in such circumstances the failure of consideration for the advance was not total." [...] He then answered that the view of the Court was that it did not. Payments of interest were different from payments of capital sums. However the court noted that it was possible that the documents were altered prior to one of the payments, in which case the payments would be treated as repayment of capital. However Lord Goff was unequivocal: [...] "even if part of the capital <b>sum</b> had been <b>repaid,</b> the law would not hesitate to hold that the balance of the loan outstanding would be recoverable on the ground of failure of consideration; for at least in those cases in which apportionment can be carried out without difficulty, the law will allow partial recovery on this ground (see David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1992) 175 CLR 353, 383)." ...|$|R
5000|$|For some loans, {{the amount}} {{actually}} loaned to the debtor {{is less than}} the principal <b>sum</b> to be <b>repaid.</b> This may be because upfront fees or points are charged, or because the loan has been structured to be sharia-compliant. The additional principal due {{at the end of the}} term has the same economic effect as a higher interest rate. This is sometimes referred to as a , a play on [...] "baker's dozen" [...] - owe twelve (a dozen), receive a loan of eleven (a banker's dozen). Note that the effective interest rate is not equal to the discount: if one borrows $10 and must repay $11, then this is ($11$10)/$10 = 10 percent interest; however, if one borrows $9 and must repay $10, then this is ($10-$9)/$9 = 11-1/9 percent interest.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{this measure}} further {{increased}} political tension; {{the two major}} monarchist parties, Partido Regenerador and Partido Progressista (who were accustomed to sharing power in an informal rotation), were infuriated. In reaction to King Carlos' action (which favored Franco's faction), they joined forces with the Partido Republicano Português to resist Franco and his cohorts. The political strategy was [...] "Machiavellian", as Brito Camacho (leader of the Partido Unionista) later attested. There were personal attacks on João Franco and the monarch from pro-republican sympathizers, progressive dissidents and academics. At one point, Afonso Costa (a leader in the Republican Party) criticized the government for permitting unauthorized transfers for expenses within the royal household without the Cortes' sanction. Declaring that the <b>sums</b> should be <b>repaid,</b> he then insisted that the King should leave the country or be imprisoned: For less than Dom Carlos has done, the head of Louis XVI fell.|$|R
50|$|Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget, as it {{was known}} as at the time, was the main bank of Swedish {{businessman}} Ivar Kreuger, the founder of Swedish Match AB, and was struck hard by the financial crisis of the 1930s, triggered in Sweden by the breakdown of Ivar Kreuger's concern, due to his untimely death in Paris in 1932. As a result, Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget had to accept stock as payment in several companies unable to repay their credit, {{as well as a}} SEK200 million bail-out from the Swedish government. The bank continued to prosper and the bail-out <b>sum</b> was already <b>repaid</b> in 1936, and the new company stocks were transferred into an investment holding company, AB Custos, founded in 1937. In 1939, Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget changed its name to Skandinaviska Banken, which continued its expansion by acquiring local banks throughout the 20th century until 1972 when it merged with Stockholms Enskilda Bank to form Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB), today one of the largest Nordic banks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{temple was}} {{completed}} {{at a cost}} of nearly six lakh varahas. After learning the truth, the Shah was enraged, and Gopanna was summoned to the court. Gopanna explained that he never intended to misuse the treasury funds and planned to reimburse using donations he expected to receive in the future. The Shah ordered his soldiers to hang Gopanna if the <b>sum</b> was not <b>repaid</b> within twelve years, and imprisoned him. On {{the last day of the}} twelfth year, Rama and Lakshmana appeared in Shah's dream and <b>repaid</b> the entire <b>sum</b> in Rama madas (gold coins with Rama's inscriptions on them). When the Shah woke up, he saw real gold coins and released Gopanna. He gave Gopanna a pension for life and donated the area around Bhadrachalam as an endowment to the temple. Some scholars dismissed the idea of Rama paying the money, saying that the Shah had held a fair and impartial inquiry, found Gopanna innocent, and exonerated him with due Honour.|$|R
2500|$|In {{commercial}} practice the term [...] "debenture" [...] typically {{refers to the}} document that evidences a secured debt, although in law the definition may also cover unsecured debts (like any [...] "IOU"). The legal definition is relevant for certain tax statutes, so for instance in British India Steam Navigation Co v IRC Lindley J held that a simple [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] was a debenture, which meant that a paper on which directors promised to pay the holder £100 in 1882 and 5% interest each half year was enough, {{and as a result}} subject to pay duty under the Stamp Act 1870. The definition depends on the purpose of the statutory provision for which it is used. It matters because debenture holders have the right to company accounts and the director's report, because debenture holders must be recorded on a company register which other debenture holders may inspect, and when issued by a company, debentures are not subject to the rule against [...] "clogs on the equity of redemption". This old equitable rule was a form of common law consumer protection, which held that if a person contracted for a mortgage, they must always have the right to pay off the debt and get full title to their property back. The mortgage agreement could not be turned into a sale to the lender, and one could not contract for a perpetual period for interest repayments. However, because the rule limited on contractual freedom to protect borrowers with weaker bargaining power, it was thought to be inappropriate for companies. In Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd the House of Lords held that an agreement by New Patagonia to sell sheepskins exclusively to Kreglinger in return for a £10,000 loan secured by a floating charge would persist for five years even after the principal <b>sum</b> was <b>repaid.</b> The contract to keep buying exclusively was construed to not be a clog on redeeming autonomy from the loan because the rule's purpose was to preclude unconscionable bargains. Subsequently, the clog on the equity of redemption rule as a whole was abolished by what is now section 739 of the Companies Act 2006. In Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne the House of Lords applied this so that when Knightsbridge took a secured loan of £310,000 from Mr Byrne and contracted to repay interest over 40 years, Knightsbridge could not then argue that the contract should be void. The deal created a debenture under the Act, and so this rule of equity was not applied.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{concerns the}} limits on contractual freedom in corporate bonds issues pursuant to the recent corporate law reform. First part of the paper studies the procedure of corporate bonds issuing provided the traditional Italian double limit regarding companies allowed to the issuance and the measure of it. The legal choice to maintain a cap to the issuing of bonds is critically reviewed, {{especially with regard to}} the case whether this maximum amount may be exceeded thanks to selected institutional investors (under control of the authorities in charge), who undertake the issue and guarantee the punctual and due final cash settlement towards those retail investors who are not sophisticated. This peculiar obligation of institutional investors is compared as well with a similar rule provided for small corporations (i. e. s. r. l., art. 2473, civil code), in order to demonstrate that it is a specific kind of accountability for someone else debt, different from a liability for violation of intermediary duties but even different both from the warranty for debtor’s solvency guaranteed to the transferee by the transferor of a credit (art. 1265, civil code) and from the liability of the transferor of a negotiable bill by endorsement. Institutional investors liability pursuant to art. 2412, 2 par., civil code is due to their choice to give up a restrictive selling policy in favour of a retail offer: this determines who, to whom and to what extent institutional investors may be liable. The paper also points out in what way this case is diverse from the selling restrictions the issuer or the lead manager endow for the offer of bonds. Second part of the essay is involved in the various kind of corporate bonds, even with some comparison with French, German, UK and US law. The aim is to clarify how many different negotiable instruments similar to the bonds may be ruled pursuant to the new art. 2411 civil code and not pursuant to the new rules provided for so called “strumenti finanziari partecipativi” by art. 2346, 2351 civil code. The standard used is the one of “repayable funds under the legal and contractual conditions applicable” used to describe the business of taking repayable funds exceptionally allowed to persons different from credit institutions. This means {{a different point of view}} of the usual coincidence between bonds and <b>sum</b> to be <b>repaid</b> as provide for mortgage. Securities similar to bonds and ruled as bonds are identified trough the examination of those kinds expressly described by the law, with special regard to those whose final cash settlement is influenced by corporate losses or profits. Moreover the paper examines the chance to deem as bonds some peculiar securities repayable with reference to an index, or only in a winding up of the company, or with commodities other than money. The category of debentures in this way set forth is finally reconsidered in the prospective of securities and markets regulations, where the aim of the law may differ from corporate law and so lead to rearrange this category...|$|R
