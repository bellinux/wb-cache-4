50|$|The {{steep sides}} of the plateau cause deep-water {{currents}} to rise up {{when they hit the}} bank; this upwelling brings with it nutrients and minerals from the bottom, feeding the local ecosystem. Over 130 species from numerous classes of the animal kingdom call the bank home at least temporarily. Some such fish are the Atlantic cod, silver hake, yellow-tail flounder, blue-fin and yellow-fin tuna, striped bass, blue fish and numerous species of shark including the great white shark. Shellfish such as the American lobster, sea scallops, squid and ocean quahogs are also prevalent. Many marine birds call the bank home including gannets, shearwaters, storm petrels, fulmars, puffins and razorbills. Reptiles are even present, primarily being represented by the leatherback sea turtle. Possibly the most famous animals on Stellwagen Bank are the mammals. Five species of <b>seals</b> (<b>harp</b> <b>seal,</b> gray seal, harbor seal, hooded seal, and ringed seal), and numerous whale species swim in the waters of Stellwagen. Whale watchers can frequently see humpback whales, minke whales and fin whales. There are occasional sightings {{of one of the most}} critically endangered whale species, North Atlantic right whale. Several other whale species can also be seen here including the sperm whale, beluga, orca, pilot whale, White-beaked dolphin, Atlantic white-sided dolphin, common dolphin, bottlenose dolphin, Risso’s dolphin, harbor porpoise, blue whale, and sei whale.|$|E

40|$|New {{findings}} are presented about {{the occurrence of}} hooded <b>seals</b> (Cystophora cristata), <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> (Phoca groenlandica), bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus) and ringed seals (Phoca hispida) in Icelandic waters for 1989 – 94. These animals had been entangled in gill nets for lumpsuckers (Cyclopterus lumpus) and cod (Gadus morhua), shot by local hunters, or found dead on the shore. The majority of the animals were from the north coast of Iceland, during the spring and summer. The majority of the hooded seals, were pups and one-year-olds, although older ani-mals occurred frequently. Males were significantly more abundant in the catch than fe-males. Young seals, pups and one-year-olds, dominated in the catch of <b>harp</b> <b>seals.</b> Males were not significantly more abundant than females. During the period 1989 – 94, there {{seemed to have been}} an increase in the frequency of visits of hooded and <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> to Icelandic waters, and they seemed to be more numerous off the north coast than about a decade ago. However, they are probably not as numerous now as in earlier times, especially in years of heavy land-ice and polar-ice in the 18 th and 19 th century. Ringed seals were mainly caught during the spring and early summer, while most of the bearded seals were caught in winter. The majority of the bearded seals visiting the Icelandic coast were young immature animals, while the ringed seals were sub-adults and adults.

40|$|Results {{from the}} {{development}} and analysis of a novel temperature dataset for the high latitude North-West Atlantic are presented. The new 1 ° gridded dataset (“ATLAS”) has been produced from about 13, 000 Argo and 48, 000 marine mammal (hooded <b>seal,</b> <b>harp</b> <b>seal,</b> grey seal and beluga) profiles spanning 2004 – 8. These data sources are highly complementary as marine mammals greatly enhance shelf region coverage where Argo floats are absent. ATLAS reveals distinctive boundary current related temperature minima in the Labrador Sea (? 1. 1 °C) and at the east Greenland coast (1. 8 °C), largely absent in the widely-used Levitus' 09 and EN 3 v 2 a datasets. The ATLAS 0 – 500 m average temperature is lower than Levitus' 09 and EN 3 v 2 a by up to 3 °C locally. Differences are strongest from 0 – 300 m and persist at reduced amplitude from 300 – 500 m.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{studying}} {{the influence of}} optical characteristics of sea water {{on the ability of}} earless seals to differentiate tablets of blue and red colours have been presented. The experiment involved four specimens of gray seals (Halichoerus grypus, Fabricius, 1791), five species of <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> (Pagophilus groenlandicus, Erxleben, 1777), and two ringed seals (Pusa hispida, Schreber, 1775). The seals have been trained to choose from a pair of plates the plate of blue colour and to mark it by touching. The experiments have been conducted on air (control study) to produce the sensitivity curve in the air without affecting transparency and colour depth and on 2 m underwater. It has been found that at the illumination above 50 lux in all model animals the proportion of correct answers corresponds to the control one and is 89 ± 3. 6 % for gray seals, 74. 8 ± 6. 2 % for <b>harp</b> <b>seals,</b> 71 ± 5. 7 % for ringed seals.

5000|$|The West Ice {{is a major}} {{breeding}} ground for <b>seals,</b> especially <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> and hooded seals. It was discovered in the early 18th century by British whalers. At the time, whalers {{were not interested in}} seal hunting as long as there was ample stock of bowhead whales in the area. However, after the 1750s, the whale population had been depleted in the area, and systematic seal hunting started, first by British ships and then by German, Dutch, Danish, Norwegian, and Russian ships. The annual catches were 120,000 animals around 1900, mostly by Norway and Russia, and rose to 350,000 by the 1920s. They then declined, first because of imposed restrictions on total allowable catch and then in response to decreasing market demand. Nevertheless, the seal population in the West Ice was rapidly falling, from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1956 to 100,000 in the 1980s. In the 1980s-1990s, takings of <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> totaled 8,000-10,000, and annual catches of hooded seals totaled a few thousand between 1997 and 2001.

40|$|Abstract: The {{reasons for}} the decline in some Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) stocks in Newfoundland and {{southern}} Labrador are not fully understood, but many resource users consider predation by seals in rivers and nearshore waters to be a contributing factor. To address these concerns, local ecological knowledge (LEK) interviews with resource users (n = 57) were conducted at 29 rivers throughout the Province to evaluate the potential for seal predation over a 25 -year period when major changes were occurring {{in the structure of}} the Northwest Atlantic ecosystem. Based on LEK, eight rivers frequented by <b>harp</b> <b>seals</b> (Pagophilus groenlandicus), nine by harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and three by gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) were evaluated as having a high potential for predation. According to respondents, the relative abundance of seals at these rivers started increasing in the mid 1990 s or 2000, depending on the seal species involved. Variation in potential predation from river to river was attributed to a number of factors including the distribution of forage fish, variability in local ice conditions, the geography of the river and ecology of seal species frequenting the area. Resource users provided a useful and, in many cases, new perspective on the spatial and temporal overlap of <b>seals,</b> particularly <b>harp</b> <b>seals,</b> capelin (Mallotus villosus) and salmon in some areas. However, quantitative seal diet information and knowledge of seal-salmon relative abundances are required to assess the biological significance of these results from a salmon conservation perspective...|$|R
