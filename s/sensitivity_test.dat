A preparatory study had been submitted to the central administration of the Reichsbahn (Zentralen Hauptverwaltung der Reichsbahn, ZHvDR) in November 1991. It served {{as the basis for the}} preliminary drafting plan, which was prepared by the Planungsgesellschaft Bahnbau Deutsche Einheit ("Planning Corporation for German Unity Railway Construction") from early 1992 and confirmed by the ZHvDR at the end of 1992. At the same time, a national and environmental protection planning study was carried out with the participating federal states and the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation. Within the scope of a space <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test,</b> a large-scale corridor investigation was carried out on the scale of 1:100,000 to determine route options. Among other things, conflicts and risks in relation to spatial and environmental factors along with railway operations and economic aspects were taken into account. According to the planning as of mid-1991, commissioning would be carried out by 2000 if possible.|$|E
2500|$|The Mantoux test or Mendel-Mantoux test (also {{known as}} the Mantoux {{screening}} test, tuberculin <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test,</b> Pirquet test, or PPD test for purified protein derivative) is a tool for screening for tuberculosis (TB) and for tuberculosis diagnosis. It {{is one of the}} major tuberculin skin tests used around the world, largely replacing multiple-puncture tests such as the tine test. The Heaf test, a form of tine test, was used until 2005 in the UK, when it was replaced by the Mantoux test. The Mantoux test is endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [...] It was also used in the USSR and is now prevalent in most of the post-Soviet states.|$|E

40|$|Mitchison in 1962 defined {{resistance}} as "a {{decrease in}} sensitivity of sufficient degree to be reasonably {{certain that the}} strain concerned is different from a sample of wild strains of human type that have never {{come into contact with}} the drugs". <b>Sensitivity</b> <b>tests</b> are designed with the object of detecting such a decrease in sensitivity. The most efficient criterion of resis-tance may be slightly different from one labora-tory to another. Further, measures of sensitivity are expressed on different scales by the 3 methods of <b>sensitivity</b> <b>tests.</b> Comparison of such methods can be valid only if objective methods of cali-bration of <b>sensitivity</b> <b>tests</b> are employed...|$|R

40|$|In a paper {{arising out}} of an {{informal}} international consultation of specialists in the bacteriology of tuberculosis held in 1961, {{an attempt was made}} to formulate criteria, and specify technical procedures, for reliable <b>tests</b> of <b>sensitivity</b> (the absolute-concentration method, the resistance-ratio method and the proportion method) to the 3 main antituberculosis drugs (isoniazid, streptomycin and p-aminosalicylic acid). Seven years later, a further consultation was held to review the latest developments in the field and to suggest how <b>sensitivity</b> <b>tests</b> might be put to practical use in tuberculosis control programmes. The participants reached agreement on how to define drug sensitivity and resistance, and stressed the importance of using a discrimination approach to the calibration of <b>sensitivity</b> <b>tests.</b> Their views are contained in the present paper, which also includes descriptions of the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>tests</b> used by the Medical Research Council of Great Britain for first- and second-line drugs (minimal inhibitory concentration and resistance-ratio methods), the two main variants of the proportion method developed by the Institut Pasteur, Paris, and a method for calibrating <b>sensitivity</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

The four bacteria species were all sensitive to kanamycin, gentamycin and enrofloxacin, with variable sensitivity to the other antibiotics tested.

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{adherence to}} the 2002 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines for perinatal group B streptococci (GBS) prevention in penicillin-allergic obstetric patients. Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study of penicillin-allergic obstetric patients who tested positive for GBS and delivered at our institution in 2010. Electronic medical records were reviewed for {{the nature of the}} penicillin allergy, documentation of having previously tolerated cephalosporins, gestational age at delivery, type of delivery, antimicrobial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>testing,</b> and antibiotics administered. Antimicrobial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>testing</b> and “appropriate” antibiotic choice, which was determined using 2002 CDC guidelines, were analyzed. Results. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis was administered in 97. 8 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 93. 5 – 99. 5 %) of patients, but it was considered appropriate in only 62. 2 % (95 % CI[*] 53. 8 – 70. 0 %) of patients. Clindamycin was the most commonly used antibiotic, but 26. 4 % (95 % CI[*] 16. 3 – 39. 7 %) of patients who received clindamycin did not have confirmation of susceptibility via antimicrobial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>testing.</b> Overall, the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>testing</b> was performed in only 65. 5 % (95 % CI[*] 56. 2 – 73. 7 %) of patients in whom it was indicated.

50|$|In {{patients}} {{suspected of}} having pyelonephritis, a urine culture and antibiotic <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> is performed, and initial therapy is tailored {{on the basis of}} the infecting organism. As most cases of pyelonephritis are due to bacterial infections, antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. The choice of antibiotic depends on the species and antibiotic sensitivity profile of the infecting organism, and may include fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, either alone or in combination.|$|E
5000|$|A {{urine culture}} and {{antibiotics}} <b>sensitivity</b> <b>test</b> is issued {{for patients who}} {{are believed to have}} pyelonephritis.

Depending on the species of the infecting organism and the antibiotics sensitivity profile of the organism, treatments may include fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or trimethoprim individually or in combination. For patients with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, treatment might include antibiotics as well as surgery. Nephrectomy is the most common surgical treatment for a majority of cases invloving xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.|$|E
