25|$|When Pope Julius died in 1513, Bramante was {{replaced}} with Giuliano da Sangallo, Fra Giocondo and Raphael. Sangallo and Fra Giocondo both died in 1515, Bramante himself having died the previous year. The main change in Raphael's plan is the nave of five bays, with a row of complex apsidal chapels off the aisles on either side. Raphael's plan for the chancel and transepts made the <b>squareness</b> of the exterior walls more definite by reducing {{the size of the}} towers, and the semi-circular apses more clearly defined by encircling each with an ambulatory.|$|E
500|$|In 1881 the [...] "Scottish Terrier Club of England" [...] was founded, {{being the}} first club {{dedicated}} to the breed. The club secretary, H.J. Ludlow, is responsible for greatly popularising the breed in the southern parts of Great Britain. The [...] "Scottish Terrier Club of Scotland" [...] was not founded until 1888, seven years after the English club. Following {{the formation of the}} English and Scottish clubs there followed several years of disagreement regarding the breed's official standard. The issue was finally settled by a revised standard in 1930, which was based on four prepotent dogs. The dogs were Robert and James Chapman's Heather Necessity, Albourne Barty, bred by AG Cowley, Albourne Annie Laurie, bred by Miss Wijk and Miss Wijk's Marksman of Docken (the litter brother of Annie Laurie). These four dogs and their offspring modified the look of the Scottie, particularly the length of the head, closeness to the ground and the <b>squareness</b> of body. Their subsequent success in the show ring led to them becoming highly sought after by the British public and breeders. As such, the modified standard completely revolutionized the breed. This new standard was subsequently recognised by the Kennel Club UK circa 1930.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to {{the show}} has been {{generally}} positive. Many reviews have praised Mitchell's presentation of the programme, saying, [...] "Mitchell's quick, intelligent wit gives it an edge that it would otherwise lack." [...] Elizabeth Mahoney in The Guardian enthused: [...] "From the first moments of its plinky plonky theme tune, 'The Unbelievable Truth' is a delight... {{the success of the}} format isn't about how convincingly you can spin a tall story, but how well you can sneak incongruous true facts into a lot of silly nonsense. The pleasure here– David Mitchell's endearing <b>squareness</b> apart– is the depths to which this silliness sinks". Jane Anderson in The Radio Times described the show as [...] "the funniest thing I've heard on Radio 4 in years and I'm considering suing the network for irreparable damage to my sides" [...] and Chris Campling in The Times called it [...] "The most consistently entertaining comedy panel show of the past few years" [...] and praises David Mitchell's chairmanship.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 {{model year}} had the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba {{share the same}} new body based on the B platform. The Chrysler Cordoba had {{replaced}} the Plymouth Satellite Sebring. [...] The Charger SE (Special Edition) was the only model offered. It came {{with a wide variety}} engines from the [...] "LA" [...] series small block V8 to three versions of [...] big block V8. The standard engine was the [...] 2-bbl small block, along with the code E58 4-bbl and dual exhaust high performance version (225 hp) being available as an option. Sales in 1975 amounted to 30,812. Because of the extreme <b>squareness</b> of the bodystyle, NASCAR teams were forced to rely on the previous years (1974) sheetmetal for race-spec cars. In order for Dodge to be represented, NASCAR allowed the 1974 sheetmetal to be used until January 1978, when the new Dodge Magnum was ready for race use. In 1976 a Dodge Charger was one of two NASCAR stock cars to compete in the 24hrs at LeMans, having been modified with head-lamps, tail-lamps and windshield wipers. It was driven by Herschel and Doug McGriff and sponsored by Olympia Beer, earning the nickname [...] "Oly Express".|$|E
60|$|Savine {{at first}} made no reply. The furrows deepened on his forehead, and Helen felt a thrill of anxiety {{as she watched}} him. She had noticed that his {{shoulders}} were losing their <b>squareness,</b> and that his face had grown thin.|$|E

60|$|Austen Vane {{leaned forward}} across the desk, and even Mr. Flint (if the truth were known) recoiled {{a little before}} the anger he had aroused. It shot forth from Austen's eyes, proclaimed itself in the <b>squareness</b> of the face, and vibrated in every word he spoke.|$|E
60|$|We retreat {{a little}} way and find a sort of angle, an {{elevation}} in the sod, a suggested <b>squareness</b> amid the mass of irregularities around. Here, he tells me, if anywhere, the king's house stood. Three months of measurement and calculation have confirmed him in this conclusion.|$|E
60|$|And {{then they}} agree that the qualities of things which thus depend upon our {{perception}} of them, and upon our human nature as affected by them, shall be called Subjective; and the qualities of things which they always have, irrespective of any other nature, as roundness or <b>squareness,</b> shall be called Objective.|$|E
60|$|Its <b>squareness</b> was, indeed, the {{characteristic}} which most struck the eye in this antiquated borough, the borough of Casterbridge--at that time, recent as it was, {{untouched by the}} faintest sprinkle of modernism. It was compact as a box of dominoes. It had no suburbs--in the ordinary sense. Country and town met at a mathematical line.|$|E
60|$|The {{recently}} built {{house of}} Sam Clark, in which {{was given the}} party to welcome Carol, {{was one of the}} largest in Gopher Prairie. It had a clean sweep of clapboards, a solid <b>squareness,</b> a small tower, and a large screened porch. Inside, it was as shiny, as hard, and as cheerful as a new oak upright piano.|$|E

60|$|The {{difference}} in height between the combatants was considerable. Edmund stood five feet ten, but looked shorter from the <b>squareness</b> and width of his shoulders. Sweyn was nearly four inches taller, and {{he too was}} very strongly built. His muscles indeed stood out in stronger development than did those of Edmund, and if pure strength was to win the day few of those who looked on doubted that the Dane would be the victor.|$|E
60|$|The mode {{of vision}} {{is not one}} and final. The mode of vision is manifold. And the optical image is a mere {{vibrating}} blur to a child--and, indeed, to a passionate adult. In this vibrating blur the soul sees its own true correspondent. It sees, in a cow, horns and <b>squareness,</b> and a long tail. It sees, for a horse, a mane, and a long face, round nose, and four legs. And in each case a darkly vital presence. Now horns and <b>squareness</b> and a long thin ox-tail, these are the fearful and wonderful elements of the cow-form, which the dynamic soul perfectly perceives. The ideal-image is just outside nature, for a child--something false. In a picture, a child wants elemental recognition, and not correctness or expression, or least of all, what we call understanding. The child distorts inevitably and dynamically. But the dynamic abstraction is more than mental. If a huge eye sits {{in the middle of}} the cheek, in a child's drawing, this shows that the deep dynamic consciousness of the eye, its relative exaggeration, is the life-truth, even if it is a scientific falsehood.|$|E
6000|$|I {{am afraid}} you will say I have [...] "wound about with circumstance," [...] when I {{should have asked}} plainly--however as I said I am a little maidenish or so, and I feel my virginity come strong upon me, the while I request the loan of a £20 and a £10, which, if you would enclose to me, I would {{acknowledge}} and save myself a hot forehead. I am sure you are confident of my responsibility, and {{in the sense of}} <b>squareness</b> that is always in me.|$|E

She had {{undertaken}} a duty, {{and she was not}} the woman to shrink from it. So she told herself at that moment. And yet she was very much afraid of him as she saw the <b>squareness</b> of his forehead, and the set of his mouth. And there was a frown across his brow, as though he were preparing himself to fight. 'You must have found it hard to accommodate yourselves to them, Mr. Caldigate?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "our {{idle time}} is past, and fortune has at length brought {{activity}} into our track. Whether {{the ship in}} sight be of just seven hundred and fifty tons, is more than I can pretend to pronounce, but something there is which any seaman may know. But the <b>squareness</b> of her upper-yards, the symmetry {{with which they are}} trimmed, and the press of canvass she bears on the wind, I pronounce her to be a vessel of war. Do any differ from my opinion? Mr. Wilder, speak." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a bright}} morning when Charnock {{drove up to the}} door of Keller's hotel. The street was one-sided, {{and for the most part}} of its length, small, ship-lap-board houses boldly fronted the prairie. A few had shallow verandas that {{relieved}} their bareness, but the rest were frankly ugly, and in some the front was carried up level with the roof-ridge, giving them a harsh <b>squareness</b> of outline. A plank sidewalk, raised a foot or two above the ground, ran along the street, where the black soil was torn by wagon wheels.|$|E
6000|$|As far as {{he could}} see out in the world at large, nobody was square. You had to keep your mouth shut, or your teeth would be stolen out of it. He didn't look into a paper without seeing that on all sides of him men had {{abandoned}} the idea of <b>squareness.</b> Chairmen, directors, members of Parliament, ambassadors,--all the world, as he told himself,--were trying to get on by their wits. He didn't see why he should be more square than anybody else. Why hadn't Silverbridge taken him down to Scotland for the grouse? ...|$|E
60|$|His arms, {{which were}} unusually long and thick, hung down nearly {{to his knees}} and were {{decorated}} throughout with knobs and ridges of muscle that popped up and down and in and out as he moved, in a manner both fascinating and frightening. His face increased the illusion of <b>squareness,</b> for he had thick, straight eyebrows, a straight mouth, and a chin of almost the minimum degree of roundness. He inspected Bailey with a pair of brilliant brown eyes which no detail of his appearance could escape. And Bailey, that morning, as has been said, was not looking his best.|$|E
60|$|Here stood a cottage, {{between the}} fence and the stream, on a {{slightly}} elevated spot of ground, round which the river took a turn. The characteristic feature of this snug habitation was its one chimney in the gable end, its <b>squareness</b> of form disguised by a huge cloak of ivy, which had grown so luxuriantly and extended so far from its base, as to increase the apparent bulk of the chimney to the dimensions of a tower. Some little distance {{from the back of}} the house rose the park boundary, and over this were to be seen the sycamores of the grove, making slow inclinations to the just-awakening air.|$|E
60|$|Doctor South amused {{him by his}} odd manner. He got up now, and Philip {{saw that}} {{he was a man of}} middle height, thin, with white hair cut very short and a long mouth closed so tightly that he seemed to have no lips at all; he was clean-shaven but for small white whiskers, and they {{increased}} the <b>squareness</b> of face which his firm jaw gave him. He wore a brown tweed suit and a white stock. His clothes hung loosely about him as though they had been made for a much larger man. He looked like a respectable farmer of the middle of the nineteenth century. He opened the door.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a mistake}} to suppose that sharp sight is {{accompanied}} by clear visual memory. I have not a few instances in which the independence of the two faculties is emphatically commented on; and I have at least one clear case where great interest in outlines and accurate appreciation of straightness, <b>squareness,</b> and the like, is unaccompanied by the power of visualising. Neither does the faculty go with dreaming. I have cases where it is powerful, {{and at the same time}} where dreams are rare and faint or altogether absent. One friend tells me that his dreams have not the hundredth part of the vigour of his waking fancies.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the morning}} of his departure. His {{brothers}} had already left the Vicarage to proceed on a walking tour in the north, whence one was {{to return to his}} college, and the other to his curacy. Angel might have accompanied them, but preferred to rejoin his sweetheart at Talbothays. He would have been an awkward member of the party; for, though the most appreciative humanist, the most ideal religionist, even the best-versed Christologist of the three, there was alienation in the standing consciousness that his <b>squareness</b> would not fit the round hole that had been prepared for him. To neither Felix nor Cuthbert had he ventured to mention Tess.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And he {{measured}} {{the city with}} a reed, twelve thousand furlongs, the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.' Before {{he told us that}} the length was as large as the breadth, which I then told you did signify the nature of her rule and the measure of her obedience. But now he adds and saith, that both in length and breadth and in height she is equal. Wherefore in that he adds at last a <b>squareness</b> of height to her <b>squareness</b> of length and breadth; and also in that he adds it not before he had told us of the measure of her portions, he would have us to understand that as the rule in which this city shall walk shall be complete, and as her obedience to that rule shall be complete, so her enjoyment of God and his grace at that day shall be proportionable also. She is square in her rule, square in her obedience, and square in her enjoyment of God and his goodness: the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. Indeed the Scripture saith, that in keeping his commandments there is great reward (Psa 19:11). And again, 'This man shall be blessed in his deed' (James 1:25). This showeth unto us then what glorious days these will be to the house and city of God, even days in which saints shall see the mind of God clearly, have hearts to do it completely, and have continually the answerable enjoyment of God and spiritual happiness. Now will his paths drop fatness with a witness! (Psa 65:11). And now will he meet 'him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways' (Isa 64:5). And the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. Wherefore the prophet in the vision of the measures of the portions doth observe that there was a <b>squareness</b> in them, as well as in their ordinances and obedience: and hence it is that he tells us that every little chamber was one reed broad and one reed long (Eze 40:7). And again, the oblation, that is, the portion for the tribes, shall be five and twenty thousand (Eze 48:20). By five and twenty thousand ye shall offer the holy oblation FOUR SQUARE, with the portion of the city.|$|E

I can't see how a man gets anything but cheated when he buys such things. It's funny, ain't it? Take my boss an' his horses. He owns women, too. He might a-owned you, just because he's got the price.

60|$|Beatrice met both alike as {{old friends}} and almost brothers, but Alexander, though {{returning}} her greeting with equal cordiality, looked shyly at the new aunt and cousin, and as Henrietta suspected, wished them elsewhere. She had heard much of him from Beatrice, and knew that her brother regarded him as a formidable rival; and she was therefore {{surprised to see that}} his broad honest face expressed more good humour than intellect, and his manners wanted polish. He was tolerably well-featured, with light eyes and dark hair, and though half a year older than his cousin, was much shorter, more perhaps in appearance than reality, from the breadth and <b>squareness</b> of his shoulders, and from not carrying himself well.|$|E
60|$|Two of {{the ships}} ahead struck me as frigates, having their broadsides exposed to us: we had raised one line of ports, but it was {{possible}} they {{might turn out to}} be two-deckers; ships of war they were, beyond all question, and I fancied them English from the <b>squareness</b> of their upper sails. They, too, were consorts, making signals to each other, and closing fast on opposite tacks. The lugger was no longer equivocal: it was the Polisson, and she was standing directly for us, though it was ticklish business, since the remaining ship, a corvette, as I fancied, was already in her wake, carrying sail hard, going like a witch, and only about two leagues astern.|$|E
60|$|It {{will be seen}} at {{a glance}} that, except {{in the very early}} fillet traceries of the Frari and St. John and Paul, Venetian work {{consists}} of roll traceries of one general pattern. It will be seen also, that 10 and 11 from the Frari, furnish the first examples of the form afterwards completely developed in 17, the tracery bar of the Ducal Palace; but that this bar differs from them in greater strength and <b>squareness,</b> and in adding a recess between its smaller roll and the cusp. Observe, that this is done for strength chiefly; as, in the contemporary tracery (21) of the upper windows, no such additional thickness is used.|$|E
60|$|He retired a {{few steps}} into the loft and waited. From this {{elevated}} perch his eyes could sweep the roofs round about, the upper parts of the luxurious chestnut trees, now delicate in leaves of a week's age, and the drooping boughs of the lines; Farfrae's garden and the green door leading therefrom. In course of time--he could not say how long--that green door opened and Farfrae came through. He was dressed as if for a journey. The low light of the nearing evening caught his head and face when he emerged from {{the shadow of the}} wall, warming them to a complexion of flame-colour. Henchard watched him with his mouth firmly set, the <b>squareness</b> of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being unduly marked.|$|E
6000|$|... "Square be d----!" [...] There was a {{great deal}} in the lesson there enunciated which demanded consideration. Hitherto the Major had fought his battles with a certain {{adherence}} to <b>squareness.</b> If his angles had not all been perfect angles, still there had always been an attempt at geometrical accuracy. He might now and again have told a lie about a horse--but who that deals in horses has not done that? He had been alive to the value of underhand information from racing-stables, but who won't use a tip if he can get it? He had lied about the expense of his hounds, in order to enhance the subscription of his members. Those were things which everybody did in his line. But Green had meant something beyond this.|$|E
60|$|The {{windows on}} all sides were long and many-mullioned; the roof lines broken up by dormer lights of the same pattern. The apex stones of these dormers, {{together}} {{with those of the}} gables, were surmounted by grotesque figures in rampant, passant, and couchant variety. Tall octagonal and twisted chimneys thrust themselves high up into the sky, surpassed in height, however, by some poplars and sycamores at the back, which showed their gently rocking summits over ridge and parapet. In the corners of the court polygonal bays, whose surfaces were entirely occupied by buttresses and windows, broke into the <b>squareness</b> of the enclosure; and a far-projecting oriel, springing from a fantastic series of mouldings, overhung the archway of the chief entrance to the house.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Maurice, boy! come here,' she called, as {{she caught}} sight of a {{creature}} prancing astride on one stick, and waving another. On perceiving a visitor, the urchin came careering up, bouncing full tilt upon her, and clasping her round with both his stalwart arms. 'Gently, gently, boy,' she said, bending down, and looking with proud delight at her brother, as she held between her hands a face much like her own, as fair and freshly tinted, but with a peculiar <b>squareness</b> of contour, large blue eyes, with dark fringes, brimming over with mischief and fun, a bold, broad brow, and thick, light curls. There was a spring and vigour as of perpetual irrepressible life about the whole being, and the moment he had accepted his uncle's kiss, he poised his lance, and exclaimed, 'You are Bonaparte, I'm the Duke!' ...|$|E
60|$|I crept {{forward and}} looked across at the {{familiar}} window. As my eyes fell upon it, I gave a gasp and {{a cry of}} amazement. The blind was down, and a strong light was burning in the room. The shadow {{of a man who}} was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard, black outline upon the luminous screen of the window. There was no mistaking the poise of the head, the <b>squareness</b> of the shoulders, the sharpness of the features. The face was turned half-round, and the effect was that of one of those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame. It was a perfect reproduction of Holmes. So amazed was I that I threw out my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me. He was quivering with silent laughter.|$|E
60|$|As {{the weeks}} went by, my {{interest}} in him and my curiosity as to his aims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and appearance were such as to strike {{the attention of the}} most casual observer. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of alertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and <b>squareness</b> which mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.|$|E
60|$|The {{woman was}} {{looking down at the}} {{unconscious}} man. Gerald rose slowly to his feet and stood by her side. The face of Mr. John P. Dunster, even in unconsciousness, had something in it of strength and purpose. The shape of his head, the <b>squareness</b> of his jaws, the straightness of his thick lips, all seemed to speak of a hard and inflexible disposition. His hair was coal black, coarse, and without the slightest sprinkling of grey. He had the neck and throat of a fighter. But for that single, livid, blue mark across his forehead, he carried with him no signs of his accident. He was a little inclined to be stout. There was a heavy gold chain stretched across his waist-coat. From where he lay, the shining handle of his revolver protruded from his hip, pocket.|$|E
