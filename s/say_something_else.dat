But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prosecutors {{brought up}} {{another piece of}} [...] "damaging evidence" [...] against Castor when they cited having heard [...] "typing sounds" [...] while Castor was on the phone. During one of the wiretapped {{recordings}} presented, [...] "typing sounds" [...] can be heard while Castor talks to a friend, though Castor denied memory of using the computer that day. Prosecutors argued the [...] "typing sounds" [...] were those {{of one of the}} several drafts Castor had written of the suicide note. Ashley had already testified to having witnessed her mother working on the computer on something she had hidden to prevent Ashley's seeing it. Fitzpatrick claimed this was the day Castor wrote the note, which had Castor's fingerprints but not Ashley's, to frame her daughter. He told the jury about the word antifreeze being written as [...] "anti-free" [...] in four places within the note and noted that Castor had also said [...] "anti-free" [...] during an interview. Castor said she had cut herself off while saying [...] "antifreeze" [...] because she had intended to <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

40|$|What {{would it}} be like if we said one thing, and heard {{ourselves}} <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>else?</b> Would we notice something was wrong? Or would we believe we said the thing we heard? Is feedback of our own speech only used to detect errors, or does it also help to specify the meaning of what we say? Comparator models of self-monitoring favor the first alternative, and hold that our sense of agency is given by the comparison between intentions and outcomes, while inferential models argue that agency is a more fluent construct, dependent on contextual inferences about the most likely cause of an action. In this paper, we present a theory about the use of feedback during speech. Specifically, we discuss inferential models of speech production that question the standard comparator assumption that the meaning of our utterances is fully specified before articulation. We then argue that auditory feedback provides speakers with a channel for high-level, semantic "self-comprehension". In support of this we discuss results using a method we recently developed called Real-time Speech Exchange (RSE). In our first study using RSE (Lind et al., in press) participants were fitted with headsets and performed a computerized Stroop task. We surreptitiously recorded words they said, and later in the test we played them back at the exact same time that the participants uttered <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> while blocking the actual feedback of their voice. Thus, participants said one thing, but heard themselves <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> The results showed that when timing conditions were ideal, more than two thirds of the manipulations went undetected. Crucially, in {{a large proportion of the}} non-detected manipulated trials, the inserted words were experienced as self-produced by the participants. This indicates that our sense of agency for speech has a strong inferential component, and that auditory feedback of our own voice acts as a pathway for semantic monitoring. We believe RSE holds great promise as a tool for investigating the role of auditory feedback during speech, and we suggest a number of future studies to serve this purpose...|$|R
50|$|After a wild night out, {{a teenage}} girl named Jordan (Anna Attanasio) is brought to Princeton Plainsboro with {{severely}} swollen appendages. The team must work to diagnose Jordan, who is less than honest about what happened the night she fell ill. House suspects she is suffering from rhabdo and the fall caused crushed muscles which released toxins that caused swollen joints. But the CT {{shows no signs of}} trauma, so House goes in and gets Jordan to pretend to play the drums. Her hands are very weak. House notes that her chart shows low potassium, and rhabdo elevates potassium levels, meaning her potassium had to be extremely low the previous night. This means she can't have climbed stairs, meaning there was no fall. House <b>says</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> is causing her low potassium and rhabdo.|$|R

According to Olasky, Lieutenant Commander Beidler, a subject profiled with his wife in the man-on-the-street piece, recalled <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> to LeDuff and believed the quotes and depictions of himself and his wife used were inaccurate and fabricated by Mr. LeDuff.

40|$|In {{everyday}} conversations {{we often}} convey information that goes {{above and beyond}} what we strictly speaking say: exaggeration and irony are obvious examples. H. P. Grice introduced the technical notion of a conversational implicature in systematizing the phenomenon of meaning one thing by <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> In introducing the notion, Grice drew a line between what is said, which he understood as being {{closely related to the}} conventional meaning of the words uttered, and what is conversationally implicated, which can be inferred from the fact that an utterance has been made in context. Since Grice’s seminal work, conversational implicatures have become one of the major research areas in pragmatics. This article introduces the notion of a conversational implicature, discusses some of the key issues that {{lie at the heart of}} the recent debate, and explicates tests that allow us to reliably distinguish between semantic entailments and conventional implicatures on the one hand and conversational implicatures on the other...|$|R
40|$|Speech {{is usually}} assumed {{to start with}} a clearly defined preverbal message, which {{provides}} a benchmark for self-monitoring and a robust sense of agency for one's utterances. However, an alternative hypothesis states that speakers often have no detailed preview of what they are about to say, and that they instead use auditory feedback to infer the meaning of their words. In the experiment reported here, participants performed a Stroop color-naming task while we covertly manipulated their auditory feedback in real time so that they said one thing but heard themselves <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Under ideal timing conditions, two thirds of these semantic exchanges went undetected by the participants, and in 85 % of all nondetected exchanges, the inserted words were experienced as self-produced. These findings indicate that the sense of agency for speech has a strong inferential component, and that auditory feedback of one's own voice acts as a pathway for semantic monitoring, potentially overriding other feedback loops...|$|R
