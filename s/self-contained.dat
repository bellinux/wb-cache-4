5|$|In 1926, West Mersea {{became a}} self-governing urban district, which {{allowed it to}} set up a <b>self-contained</b> water and sewer system. Unlike several other coastal resorts, the island did not {{immediately}} develop any holidaymaker facilities aside from the beach huts which now stretch along the Esplanade.|$|E
5|$|Margaret Weis {{includes}} {{allusions to}} A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens, {{one of her}} favorite stories. References include But there was something disquieting about him—secret, silent, <b>self-contained,</b> and solitary as an oyster and The fate of mankind is my business. This quote is turned from meaning good to meaning harm.|$|E
5|$|Roads {{and trails}} {{in the state}} forest are also open for horseback riding and {{mountain}} biking. Some trails are dedicated to cross-country skiing and snowmobiling in winter. The state forest is open for primitive camping, although certain areas require a permit. Small campfires are allowed, except from March to mid-May and October through November, or by order of the district forester, when <b>self-contained</b> stoves are allowed.|$|E
5|$|The Elder Scrolls III: Tribunal, {{announced}} on September 2, 2002, and {{scheduled for a}} PC-only release, went gold on November 1 and was released, with little fanfare, on November 6. Tribunal puts the player in the <b>self-contained,</b> walled city of Mournhold, {{the capital of the}} province of Morrowind; the new city is not connected to Morrowinds land mass, Vvardenfell, and the player must teleport to it. The storyline continues the story of the Tribunal deities.|$|E
5|$|The book {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} by the editor Carol Serling and ends with brief biographies of all the authors. Each of the 19 <b>self-contained</b> short stories includes an introduction and conclusion with the same tone and style as Rod Serling's narration {{at the beginning and}} end of each Twilight Zone episode.|$|E
5|$|The {{buildings}} are considered fireproof by the New York City Fire Department because partitions between individual units {{are designed to}} stop the spread of flames, also known as compartmentalization. This is evidenced by a 2004 fire caused by a cigarette, where no one was seriously injured because the fire was <b>self-contained.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} breath-hold diving goes {{back at least}} to {{classical}} times, and there is evidence of prehistoric hunting and gathering of seafoods that may have involved underwater swimming. Technical advances allowing the provision of breathing gas to a diver underwater at ambient pressure are recent, and <b>self-contained</b> breathing systems developed at an accelerated rate following the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|True Detective is an American {{anthology}} crime drama {{television series}} created and written by Nic Pizzolatto. The series, broadcast by the premium cable network HBO in the United States, premiered on January 12, 2014. Each {{season of the}} series is structured as a disparate, <b>self-contained</b> narrative, employing new cast ensembles and following various sets of characters and settings.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on June 28, 2011, the PHP Group {{implemented}} a timeline {{for the release}} of new versions of PHP. Under this system, at least one release should occur every month. Once per year, a minor release should occur which may include new features. Every minor release should at least be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year release process for every minor release. No new features, unless small and <b>self-contained,</b> are to be introduced into a minor release during the three-year release process.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family group of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many <b>self-contained</b> individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Each {{neighbourhood}} has <b>self-contained</b> recreational areas, {{and there}} are other larger parks throughout the town. The Memorial Gardens, on the eastern side of Queen's Square, feature art displays, children's play areas and lawns, and a plaque commemorating those who died in two Second World War bombing incidents in 1943 and 1944. Goffs Park in Southgate covers , and has lakes, boating ponds, a model railway and many other features. Tilgate Park and Nature Centre has walled gardens, lakes, large areas of woodland with footpaths and bridleways, a golfing area and a collection of animals and birds.|$|E
5|$|Edward built further luxurious, <b>self-contained</b> lodgings for {{his court}} around {{the east and}} south edges of the Upper Ward, {{creating}} the modern shape of the quadrangle. The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. The earliest weight-driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354. William of Wykeham went on to build New College, Oxford and Winchester College, where the influence of Windsor Castle can easily be seen.|$|E
5|$|From 241 {{participants}} representing 14 {{nations in}} 1896, the Games {{have grown to}} about 10,500 competitors from 204 nations at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The scope and scale of the Winter Olympics is smaller. For example, Sochi hosted 2,873 athletes from 88 nations competing in 98 events during the 2014 Winter Olympics. During the Games most athletes and officials are housed in the Olympic Village. This village {{is intended to be}} a <b>self-contained</b> home for all the Olympic participants, and is furnished with cafeterias, health clinics, and locations for religious expression.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} {{plant at}} the power station for the low temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before being burned in boilers and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment plant was manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} <b>self-contained</b> boiler house which contained four boilers, four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its boilers produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This plant was extended in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Regalian Properties {{purchased}} the site, and appointed Terry Farrell as architect. Farrell designed a <b>self-contained</b> community of shops, housing, offices and public spaces for the site. Regalian disliked the proposals and requested Farrell design a single large office block. Despite containing 50% more office space than the rejected Green Giant proposal, the design was accepted. The government then bought {{the site and}} design as a future headquarters for the Secret Intelligence Service, and the design was accordingly modified to increase security. In 1995 the SIS Building was opened on the site, and today dominates other buildings {{in the vicinity of}} the bridge.|$|E
5|$|In {{the adult}} {{versions}} of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of Kanon without the erotic content. The versions that include the adult content have one explicit sex scene {{in each of the}} five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene. Outside of these, there are two scenes with nudity. Yūichi Suzumoto, a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in Kanon are very <b>self-contained,</b> and can be easily removed without altering the story. Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with reproduction in mind.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the MTA began {{automating}} the subway by Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC). CBTC supplements, rather than replaces, the fixed-block signal system; it allows trains to operate closer together. The BMT Canarsie Line, {{on which the}} L train runs, was chosen for pilot testing {{because it is a}} <b>self-contained</b> line that does not operate in conjunction with other lines. CBTC became operational in February 2009. Due to an unexpected ridership increase, the MTA ordered additional cars, and increased service from 15 trains to 26 trains per hour, an achievement beyond the capability of the block system. The total cost of the project was $340 million.|$|E
5|$|Inside No. 9 is an {{anthology}} series, with each episode featuring a new story, {{with a new}} setting and new characters. Episodes last around half an hour, with the <b>self-contained</b> story reaching a conclusion. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place in number 9, be that a mansion, a dressing room or a flat. Every episode stars at least one of Shearsmith or Pemberton, and normally both. Each episode is effectively a short play, and could easily be performed on stage. Most episodes take place in real-time, following half an hour {{in the lives of the}} characters.|$|E
5|$|Levin {{published}} {{his first book}} in 1970. Called The Pendulum Years, its subtitle, Britain and the Sixties, summed up its subject. In 22 <b>self-contained</b> chapters, Levin considered various aspects of British life during the decade. Among his topics were prominent people including Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson – dubbed the Walrus and the Carpenter by Levin – and {{institutions such as the}} monarchy, the churches and the British Empire in its last days. Among the individual events examined in the book were the 1968 student riots and the prosecution for obscenity of the publishers of Lady Chatterley's Lover.|$|E
5|$|Marvel One-Shots are {{a series}} of direct-to-video short films {{produced}} by Marvel Studios, set within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), released from 2011 to 2014. They are included as special features in the MCU films' Blu-ray and digital distribution releases, but are not included in the DVD releases. Each of the films, which range from 4 to 15 minutes, are designed to be a <b>self-contained</b> story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. Two of the shorts have been the inspiration for television series set in the MCU.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} garden suburbs in the world, Noel Park was designed to provide affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city; every property had both a front and back garden. It was planned from the outset as a <b>self-contained</b> community {{close enough to the}} rail network to allow its residents to commute to work. In line with the principles of the Artizans Company's founder, William Austin, no public houses were built within the estate, and there are still none today.|$|E
5|$|Search {{teams were}} sent {{from the lower}} floors and searched the 30th floor, but did not find the missing firefighters. The teams then moved onto the upper levels where one team got lost on the 38th floor {{and ran out of}} air in their <b>self-contained</b> {{breathing}} apparatus (SCBA). That team was rescued by a search team that had been placed on the roof by a helicopter. Rescue attempts continued until helicopter operations were suspended due to heavy smoke and thermal drafts caused by the blaze.|$|E
5|$|The Consultant (2011) and A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer (2011) star Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson, {{and offer}} up <b>self-contained</b> stories {{about a day}} in the life of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Item 47 (2012) stars Lizzy Caplan and Jesse Bradford as a down-on-their-luck couple who find a {{discarded}} Chitauri gun after the events of Marvel's The Avengers. Agent Carter (2013) stars Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter after the events of , while All Hail the King (2014) stars Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery after the events of Iron Man 3.|$|E
5|$|The Special Troops Battalion {{was formed}} {{as part of}} a {{reorganization}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade into a modular brigade. The battalion was designed to be the <b>self-contained</b> command component of the brigade, allowing it to function independently of any higher command. The battalion was activated on 8 June 2006. Most of its components were drawn from the 82nd Engineer Battalion, which inactivated on 30 March 2006. On 21 April 2006, a coat of arms and a distinctive unit insignia were approved for the battalion.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnamese {{as a whole}} exhibit {{varying levels}} of fluency in the Khmer and Vietnamese languages. Vietnamese that live in <b>self-contained</b> fishing {{communities}} along the Tonle Sap use Vietnamese in their day-to-day conversations and have individuals that have limited Khmer language skills {{and those that are}} bilingual in both languages. On the other hand, Vietnamese that live in predominantly Khmer-speaking neighbourhoods send their children to public schools, and as a result the children are able to speak Khmer fluently but show very limited understanding of Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|The bunker complex was <b>self-contained.</b> However, as the Führerbunker {{was below}} the water table, {{conditions}} were unpleasantly damp, with pumps running continuously to remove groundwater. A diesel generator provided electricity, and well water was pumped {{in as the}} water supply. Communications systems included a telex, a telephone switchboard, and an army radio set with an outdoor antenna. As conditions deteriorated {{at the end of}} the war, Hitler received much of his war news from BBC radio broadcasts and via courier.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of True Detective, an American {{anthology}} crime drama television series created by Nic Pizzolatto, premiered on January 12, 2014, on the premium cable network HBO. The principal cast consisted of Matthew McConaughey, Woody Harrelson, Michelle Monaghan, Michael Potts, and Tory Kittles. The season comprised eight episodes, and its initial airing concluded on March 9, 2014. As an anthology, each True Detective season {{has its own}} <b>self-contained</b> story, following a disparate set of characters in various settings.|$|E
5|$|The forts were {{positioned}} to defend harbours and anchorages, and designed both to focus artillery fire on enemy ships, {{and to protect}} the gunnery teams from attack by those vessels. Some, including the major castles, including the castles of the Downs in Kent, were intended to be <b>self-contained</b> and able to defend themselves against attack from the land, while the smaller blockhouses were primarily focused on the maritime threat. Although there were extensive variations between the individual designs, they had common features and were often built in a consistent style.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth season}} of the Bleach anime series was {{directed}} by Noriyuki Abe and produced by Studio Pierrot. Like {{the rest of the}} series, it follows the adventures of Ichigo Kurosaki, but instead of adapting Tite Kubo's Bleach manga, it features an original, <b>self-contained</b> story arc. The twenty-eight episodes form the , which focuses on the introduction of the Bount, a race of humans that consume human souls to extend their lives, and their conflicts with Ichigo Kurosaki and his allies.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{selling point}} of Front Mission was its {{storytelling}} approach. Taking {{place during the}} 21st and 22nd centuries, the series revolves around military conflicts and political tension between powerful supranational unions and their member states. Although the Front Mission video games use <b>self-contained,</b> standalone stories, these tie into a greater overarching storyline that encompasses the entire series. In combination with the stories from its other media, the series possesses a level of storytelling depth and continuity comparable to a serial drama.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} of Fargo, an American {{anthology}} black comedy–crime drama television series created by Noah Hawley, premiered on October 12, 2015, {{on the basic}} cable network FX. Its principal cast consists of Kirsten Dunst, Patrick Wilson, Jesse Plemons, Jean Smart, and Ted Danson. The season had ten episodes, and its initial airing concluded on December 14, 2015. As an anthology, each Fargo season possesses its own <b>self-contained</b> narrative, following a disparate set of characters in various settings.|$|E
5|$|The {{sometimes}} utopian {{concept of}} the new town, aimed at improving society through the foundation of architecturally designed communities, was {{an important part of}} Scottish thinking from the mid-eighteenth to the twentieth century. In addition to the new towns of Edinburgh and Glasgow, these included the complete rebuilding of Inverary for John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll by John Adam and Robert Mylne, between 1772 and 1800. Helensburgh near Glasgow was laid out in 1776 on a gridiron plan. From 1800, Robert Owen's New Lanark, designed as a <b>self-contained</b> community, combining industry with ordered and improved living conditions, was an important milestone in the historical development of urban planning.|$|E
5|$|The {{step from}} rationals to reals {{is a major}} extension. There {{are at least two}} popular ways to achieve this step, both {{published}} in 1872: Dedekind cuts and Cauchy sequences. Proofs that 0.999... = 1 which directly use these constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis, where the modern trend for the last few decades has been to use an axiomatic analysis. Even when a construction is offered, it is usually applied towards proving the axioms of the real numbers, which then support the above proofs. However, several authors express the idea that starting with a construction is more logically appropriate, and the resulting proofs are more <b>self-contained.</b>|$|E
5|$|With The History of The Hobbit, {{published}} {{in two parts}} in 2007, John D. Rateliff provides {{the full text of}} the earliest and intermediary drafts of the book, alongside commentary that shows relationships to Tolkien's scholarly and creative works, both contemporary and later. Rateliff moreover provides the abandoned 1960s retelling and previously unpublished illustrations by Tolkien. The book keeps Rateliff's commentary separate from Tolkien's text, allowing the reader to read the original drafts as <b>self-contained</b> stories.|$|E
5|$|Alligators and {{crocodiles}} {{were first}} farmed {{in the early}} 20th century, but the facilities involved were zoo-like and their main source of income was from tourism. By the early 1960s, the feasibility of farming these reptiles on a commercial scale was investigated {{in response to the}} decline of many crocodilian species around the world. Farming involves breeding and rearing captive stock on a <b>self-contained</b> basis, whereas ranching means the use of eggs, juveniles, or adults taken each year from the wild. Commercial organisations must satisfy the criteria of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) by demonstrating that, in the area concerned, they do not adversely impact the wild population.|$|E
