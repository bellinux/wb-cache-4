40|$|<b>Shared</b> <b>Space</b> is a {{new concept}} {{for the design of}} the public realm that is {{increasingly}} applied in Western countries. In <b>Shared</b> <b>Space,</b> the various functions of the public domain are combined, rather than separated. The behavior of road users is mainly determined by social relations and not exclusively by conventional traffic regulations. For visually impaired people the required visual human interaction is difficult or impossible, and the lack of conventional infrastructure might lead to problems with orientation and navigation. Therefore, the <b>Shared</b> <b>Space</b> concept is a potential disadvantage, if not a danger, for this specific group. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide an objective overview of the problems that this group encounters in <b>Shared</b> <b>Space.</b> Ten <b>Shared</b> <b>Space</b> environments in the Netherlands have been selected to assess their common characteristics and to be judged on possible problems for the accessibility for visually impaired people. In addition seventeen visually impaired persons living in the vicinity of a <b>Shared</b> <b>Space</b> environment were interviewed about their experiences. Finally we conducted a field study in which twenty visually impaired participants performed tasks in two <b>Shared</b> <b>Space</b> environments and in two conventional environments. The inventory of characteristics of the selected <b>Shared</b> <b>Space</b> environments resulted in a list of possible threats for visually impaired persons. The interviews confirmed these possible threats, although there were large differences between the experiences of various visually impaired persons. Participants in the field study generally felt less comfortable and were more dependent in <b>Shared</b> <b>Space</b> environments. Especially guide dog users had severe problems to complete the tasks in the <b>Shared</b> <b>Space</b> environments.

50|$|In mathematics, more {{specifically}} measure theory, {{there are various}} notions of the convergence of measures. For an intuitive general {{sense of what is}} meant by convergence in measure, consider a sequence of measures μn on a <b>space,</b> <b>sharing</b> a common collection of measurable sets. Such a sequence might represent an attempt to construct 'better and better' approximations to a desired measure μ that is difficult to obtain directly. The meaning of 'better and better' is subject to all the usual caveats for taking limits; for any error tolerance ε > 0 we require there be N sufficiently large for n ≥ N to ensure the 'difference' between μn and μ is smaller than ε. Various notions of convergence specify precisely what the word 'difference' should mean in that description; these notions are not equivalent to one another, and vary in strength.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} bin packing {{that occurs in}} {{practice}} is when items can share space when packed into a bin. Specifically, a set of items could occupy less space when packed together {{than the sum of}} their individual sizes. This variant is known as VM packing since when virtual machines (VMs) are packed in a server, their total memory requirement could decrease due to pages shared by the VMs that need only be stored once. If items can share space in arbitrary ways, the bin packing problem is hard to even approximate. However, if the <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> fits into a hierarchy, {{as is the case with}} memory sharing in virtual machines, the bin packing problem can be efficiently approximated.Another variant of bin packing of interest in practice is the so-called online bin packing. Here the objects of different volume are supposed to arrive sequentially and the decision maker has to decide whether to select and pack the currently observed item, or else to let it pass. Each decision is without recall.|$|E

40|$|<b>Shared</b> <b>space</b> is that “all street users {{move and}} {{interact}} {{in their use}} of space on the basis of informal social protocols and negotiations” (Hamilton-Baillie 2008). By minimizing demarcations, the dominance of motor vehicles reduces and it enables all users to <b>share</b> the <b>space.</b> As a result, drivers and cyclists have to reduce their speed, pedestrians watch more carefully to surroundings traffic. The purpose of <b>shared</b> <b>space</b> is to improve the road safety and build a pedestrian priority environment. But there are also concerns about the <b>shared</b> <b>space</b> safety.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Space</b> <b>sharing</b> {{and time}} sharing have been {{traditionally}} used for scheduling in multiprocessor systems. At medium to heavy loads, time sharing policies perform well. However, at these loads, <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> policies lead to wastage {{of resources and}} premature queuing of jobs, but perform well at low loads. In this paper, we investigate the previous work done in hybrid approaches to schedule in multiprocessor systems which is called hierarchical scheduling.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{managing}} limited retail shelf or storage space for basic products by considering two inventory management strategies: space dedication and <b>space</b> <b>sharing.</b> When space is dedicated to each product, there is more flexibility in planning as different products can be replenished independently. In contrast, when space is shared across different products, there is potential for saving space; however, replenishment has to be coordinated across products and this leads to additional costs {{due to the lack}} of flexibility in replenishing each product individually. We model this problem as a non-linear mixed integer program and develop an effective heuristic and an upper bound for each strategy. We introduce three different but consistent criteria to compare each strategy. Through an extensive computational study, we identify the most relevant factors that impact the relative benefit of <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> over space dedication. In addition, we show that <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> with an optimal replenishment scheduling program can on average reduce space consumption by 31 %...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. When estimating heritability in free-living populations, it is common practice to account for common environment effects, because of their potential to generate phenotypic covariance among relatives thereby biasing heritability estimates. In quantitative genetic studies of natural populations, however, philopatry, which results in relatives being clustered in space, is rarely accounted for. The two studies to have done so suggest absolute declines in heritability estimates of up to 43 % when accounting for <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> by relatives. However, due to methodological limitations these estimates may not be representative. We used data from the St. Kilda Soay sheep population to estimate heritabilities with and without accounting for <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> for five traits {{for which there is}} evidence for additive genetic variance (birth weight, birth date, lamb August weight, and female post mortem jaw and metacarpal length). We accounted for <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> by related females by separately incorporating spatial autocorrelation, and a home range similarity matrix. Although these terms accounted for up to 17 % of the variance in these traits, heritability estimates were only reduced by up to 7 %. Our results suggest that the bias caused by not accounting for <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> may be lower than previously thought. This suggests that philopatry does not inevitably lead to a large bias if <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> by relatives is not accounted for. We hope our work stimulates researchers to model shared space when relatives in their study population share space, as doing so will enable us to better understand when bias may be of particular concern.

40|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> parallel job scheduling policies is that applications are allocated non-overlapping processor subsets. The interference among jobs is reduced, the synchronization delays and message latencies can be predictable, and distinct processors may be allocated to cooperating processes {{so as to}} avoid the overhead of context switches associated with traditional time-multiplexing;The processor allocation strategy, the job selection criteria, and workload characteristics are fundamental factors that influence system performance under <b>space</b> <b>sharing.</b> Allocation can be static or dynamic. The processor subset allocated to an application is fixed under static <b>space</b> <b>sharing,</b> whereas it can change during execution under dynamic <b>space</b> <b>sharing.</b> Static allocation can produce more predictable run times, permits a wide range of compiler optimizations (e. g., static data distribution and binding), and avoids the processor releases and reallocations associated with dynamic allocation. Its major problem is that it can induce high processor fragmentation;In this dissertation, alternative static and dynamic <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> policies that differ in the allocation discipline and the job selection criteria are studied. The results show that significantly superior performance can be achieved under static <b>space</b> <b>sharing</b> if applications can be folded (i. e., allocated fewer processors than they requested). Folding typically increases program efficiency and can reduce processor fragmentation. Policies that increase folding with the system load are proposed and compared to schemes that use unconstrained folding, no folding, and fixed maximum folding factors. The adaptive policies produced higher and more stable system utilization, significantly shorter mean response times, and good fairness curves. However, unconstrained folding resulted in considerably more severe processor fragmentation than no folding. Its advantage is that it exploits the efficiency improvement that typically results when an application is allocated fewer processors. Consequently, it can produce shorter mean response times than no folding under medium to heavy loads;Also because of this efficiency improvement, dynamic policies that reduce waiting times by executing a large number of jobs simultaneously are more promising than schemes that limit the number of active jobs. However, limiting the number of active applications can be the superior approach when folding does not improve application efficiency...|$|E

40|$|<b>Shared</b> <b>space,</b> {{a street}} design {{philosophy}} {{which aims to}} improve the mobility of nonmotorized users by deemphasizing the priority given to automobiles, has received much international attention within the last decade. Today, <b>shared</b> <b>spaces</b> can be found across the world as planners and decision-makers look to different street design schemes {{as a way of}} providing much-needed public space to urbanized populations. Despite their growing popularity, rigorous evaluations of how <b>shared</b> <b>spaces</b> operate are rather limited.

40|$|Many urban environments {{are being}} {{redesigned}} around {{a relatively new}} approach to street design termed <b>shared</b> <b>space.</b> <b>Shared</b> <b>space</b> is a traffic engineering concept that eliminates physical barriers separating motor vehicles, pedestrians, and other road users to encourage a <b>sharing</b> of street <b>space.</b> Such <b>sharing</b> {{is seen as a}} means to calm traffic and to create convivial urban spaces. The evidence shows that local authorities in the UK and overseas are enthusiastic about <b>shared</b> <b>space</b> for its potential to enhance the urban realm. Vulnerable street users, such as vision-impaired people, do not share this enthusiasm. They perceive <b>shared</b> <b>space</b> as likely to bring them into increasing contact with motor vehicles, and as compromising their safety and well-being. <b>Shared</b> <b>spaces</b> are, potentially, what I refer to as auto-disabling environments. Referring to data from the UK, I develop the proposition that <b>shared</b> <b>space</b> can be characterised as ‘disembodied urban design’ that fails to capture the complexity of corporeal form and the manifold interactions of bodies-in-space.
