500|$|James Montgomery of MTV called A Thousand Suns a [...] "sprawling, discordant, {{ambitious and}} an all-out game changer" [...] and {{compared}} it with Radiohead's 2000 album Kid A, but said A Thousand Suns is more optimistic than Kid A. Jordy Kasko with Review Rinse Repeat gave A Thousand Suns a perfect rating, calling it an [...] "epic quest". He {{compared it to}} Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and Radiohead's Kid A, saying [...] "A Thousand Suns is an ALBUM. It is not a collection of songs. It {{is not meant to}} be listened to as such. The band is {{going so far as to}} release an iTunes version that is one track, 47 minutes and 56 seconds long. This is no more an 'album' by conventional standards than Dark Side of the Moon or Kid A are. <b>Sure,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> identifiable songs, but to understand or to appreciate any of them you must take them in the context of the entire album." ...|$|E
500|$|In India, {{the film}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting [...] "On the whole, Dhoom 2 {{is a winner}} all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge {{as one of the}} biggest hits of their career." [...] Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. <b>Sure,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> faults when you stop to think rationally. But that does not stop you from being dazzled by the film." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is {{the heart and soul of}} the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it seven out of ten stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai’s performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer.|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{continues}} the storyline of Tom and Lynette's separation. Huffman enjoyed her character's storyline, stating: [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{things that they}} knew the viewers want, which is for Tom and Lynette to get back together. But I do like that it's kind of {{up in the air}} and maybe they won't." [...] Doug Savant commented, [...] "For many years on this show, we knew that Tom and Lynette were the grounding force on the street. They were the couple that most resembled most couples in America. It just got to a point after so many years when [...] really wanted to explore the things that made this relationship work by first pulling it apart." [...] Both actors expressed their desire for the couple to reunite by the series' end. Charles Mesure made his debut as new neighbor Ben Faulkner, a self-made contractor and Renee's new love interest. According to Vanessa Williams, [...] "She’s working hard to make it happen and it’s not happening easily for her. And she’s not used to that and that’s where the comedy ensues and it gives her something to pursue." ...|$|E

When challenged on whether there were any circumstances in which he would deploy military services overseas he said [...] "I'm <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some but I can't think of them at the moment."

He has called for Tony Blair to be investigated for alleged war crimes during the Iraq War.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 July 2008, {{after signing}} an {{agreement}} between the United States and the Czech Republic to host a tracking radar for an antiballistic missile system, the flow of Russian oil through the Druzhba pipeline to the Czech Republic started to reduce. Although officially the linkage between reduction of oil supplies and the radar agreement was not claimed, it was suspected. [...] Transneft denied any connections with radar agreement, saying that reduction was purely commercial as Tatneft and Bashneft started to refine more oil at their own refineries. Although Prime Minister Putin asked Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin to 'work with all partners to make <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no disruptions', in reality the supplies were reduced to 50%.|$|E
2500|$|Tom Easton, {{writing in}} Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact, takes a {{different}} view, calling the book [...] "less good than its predecessors, partly because it is {{too much of a}} reprise. Too often, the pages ask (and answer), [...] "Whatever happened to so and so?" [...] and the story suffers for its lack of original novelty." [...] He cautions that [...] "anyone who first visits Krishna through Bones is going to wonder what all the fuss is about," [...] noting that [...] "though the complications lend pace and fury to the action, they seem arbitrary, staged, like a tornado in a wind tunnel." [...] But he concludes [...] "evertheless, I am <b>sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> enough Krishna fans to buy out the Phantasia edition.

2500|$|Corbyn {{does not}} {{consider}} himself an absolute pacifist and has named the Spanish Civil War, the British naval blockade to stop the slave trade in the 19th century {{and the role of}} UN peacekeepers in the 1999 crisis in East Timor as justified conflicts. However, opposing violence and war has been [...] "the whole purpose of his life". He prominently opposed the invasion of Iraq and war in Afghanistan, NATO-led military intervention in Libya, military strikes against Assad's Syria, and military action against ISIS, and served as the chair of the Stop The War Coalition.

2500|$|Bosley Crowther of The New York Times {{said the}} [...] "most {{haunting}} of American musical dramas has been transmitted {{on the screen}} {{in a way that}} does justice to its values and almost compensates for the long wait [...] [...] [...] N. Richard Nash has adapted and Otto Preminger has directed a script that fairly bursts with continuous melodrama and the pregnant pressure of human emotions at absolute peaks [...] [...] [...] Mr. Preminger, with close and taut direction, keeps you keyed up for disaster all the time. To this structure of pictorial color and dramatic vitality, there is added a musical expression that is possibly the best this fine folk opera has ever had. Under André Previn's direction, the score is magnificently played and sung, with some of the most beautiful communication coming from the choral group [...] [...] [...] To be <b>sure,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some flaws in this production [...] [...] [...] But, for the most part, this is a stunning, exciting and moving film, packed with human emotions and cheerful and mournful melodies. It bids fair to be as much a classic on the screen as it is on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|It is the Soviet Union {{that runs}} against {{the tide of}} history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep {{economic}} difficulty. The rate {{of growth in the}} national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then. The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine.... Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones. ...In the Communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts to snuff out this quest for self-rule – 1953 in East Germany, 1956 in Hungary, 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 1981 in Poland. But the struggle continues in Poland. And {{we know that there are}} even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself. ...What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people. And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO even as we move forward with our Zero-Option initiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads." ...|$|E

2500|$|In mid 2000 {{the band}} began writing and {{recording}} demos for their debut album.

[...] "Crank the System", released in November 2000 was the first single and also their first for the new Shock Records subsidiary, Pivotal.

The single contained a B-side called [...] "Bullet for You", a track that was initially scrapped for the release of the Prize Recruit and was recorded at Back Beach during initial demoing for the album. This would eventually be slightly reworked, re-recorded and released as Bullet and become the second single for the album released in March 2001. Some would say Bullet became the band’s most popular live track. [...] In April 2001, 8 years after their inception, Superheist launched their first full-length studio album, The Prize Recruit, The album debuted at No. 12 on the ARIA Albums Chart. A reviewer for Rolling Stone described it as [...] "what the new heavy breed should sound like". Theprp.com website's Wookubus felt the band [...] "continue to evolve and each facet of their aural expression has been stepped up a notch, from the more encompassing use of programming to the stronger vocal variation and sleeker song structures" [...] with the album generally [...] "a very lush and colorful ride that the listener can figuratively slip right through, with little to no snags. <b>Sure</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a few moments where things become a little too overtly radio friendly or sound a bit commercially focused, but with the bulk of the material included representing an eclectic blend of energetic modern metal crunch, such things are easy enough to overlook".|$|E
