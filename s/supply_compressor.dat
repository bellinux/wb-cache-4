A near parabolic solar collector focuses sunlight onto the t-C 4 F 9 I (perfluoro-t butyl iodide) lasant within a transverse flow optical cavity. Using waste heat, a thermal system was designed to <b>supply</b> <b>compressor</b> and auxiliary power. System components were designed with weight and cost estimates assigned. Although cost is very approximate, the cost comparison of individual system components leads to valuable insights for future research. In particular, {{it was found that}} laser efficiency was not a dominant cost or weight factor, the dominant factor being the laser cavity and laser transmission optics. The manufacturing cost was approx. two thirds of the total cost with transportation to orbit the remainder. The flowing nonrenewable lasant comprised 20 % of the total life cycle cost of the system and thus was not a major cost factor.

40|$|An IGCC (integrated {{gasification}} combined cycle) plant {{consists of}} a power block and a gasifier block, and a smooth integration of these two parts is important. This work has analyzed the influences of the major design options {{on the performance of}} an IGCC plant. These options include the method of integrating a gas turbine with an air separation unit and the degree of nitrogen supply from the ASU to the gas turbine combustor. Research focus was given to the effect of each option on the gas turbine operating condition along with plant performance. Initially, an analysis adopting an existing gas turbine without any modifications of its components was performed to examine the influence of two design options on the operability of the gas turbine and performance of the entire IGCC plant. It is shown that a high integration degree, where much of the air required at the air separation unit is supplied by the gas turbine compressor, can be a better option considering both the system performance and operation limitation of the gas turbine. The nitrogen supply enhances system performance, but a high supply ratio can only be acceptable in high integration degree designs. Secondly, the modifications of gas turbine components to resume the operating surge margin, such as increasing the maximum compressor pressure ratio by adding a couple of stages and increasing turbine swallowing capacity, were simulated and their effects on system performance were examined. Modification can be a good option when a low integration degree is to be adopted, as it provides a considerable power increase.

40|$|Considerably high {{concentrations}} of ozone have been detected in cabin air of civilian aircraft during transatlantic flights. Aim {{of the study was}} to determine, if inflight-measured ozone concentrations are dangerous to health of pilots, air crew members and passengers. From a review of recent literature of ozone under technical aspects of cabin air <b>supply</b> (<b>compressor</b> temperature, use of ozone catalysators) it was concluded, that there is no medical hazard of elevated ozone concentrations in a single or dual seat fighter aircraft of the Federal Armed Forces. For technical reasons however, i. e. with the available measuring device, it was not possible to measure ozone concentrations of cabin air in such aircraft (impossible mounting of adequate device or no appropriate certification for installation of that device). The above statement does not apply to the aircraft C- 160 Transall and Boeing 707. Contrary to the commercial aircraft the Boeing of the Federal Armed Forces does not have any ozone catalysators. In the C- 160 Transall the temperatures in engine compressors are not high enough to reduce ozone concentrations during air supply inside the aircraft. In both types of aircraft ozone concentrations of cabin air have been investigated in 70 flights. We concluded, that ozone concentrations measured inflight are not high enough to be considered dangerous to health (200 #mu#g/m" 3). Several values above threshold were caused by interference of smoke particles (i. g. cigarettes). There was unfortunately no strict order for no smoking, which had been required by the investigators in advance. Lung function tests carried out before and after the flights could not prove any impairment caused by ozone. Questionnaires filled in by the crews and passengers before, during and after the flights showed changes in the evaluation of individual well-being caused due to the duration of the flight and the low level of humidity in the breathing air and connot be seen as a result of increased ozone concentrations.

40|$|The Free Piston Engine (FPE) {{which is}} capable of {{operating}} in a variable compression ratio mode, allows flexible auto-ignition control on a cycle-to-cycle basis without any hardware modifications. In this study combustion processes in an FPE were examined using the KIVA- 3 V CFD code with detailed chemical kinetics (305 reactions among 70 species) of a Diesel surrogate fuel incorporated. Since the piston motion and frequency, {{the rate of heat}} release and the initial in-cylinder conditions all affect each other, but were predicted using different modeling tools that were not directly coupled, an iterative procedure was applied among models describing: 1. Piston dynamics governed by Newtonâ€™s second law including a high-level control system (using MATLAB/SIMULINK) 2. Combustion processes (using KIVA- 3 V) 3. Intake and exhaust system dynamics (using the GT-POWER module of the GT-SUITETM) The control system changes the electrical force applied during the stroke, thus obtaining the desired compression ratio. It is considered the most vital part of this FPE, designed for electricity generation in a series-hybrid electric vehicle. The effects of varying the compression ratio, <b>supplied</b> <b>compressor</b> power, injection pressure and timing were investigated for both conventional diesel and Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) -like combustion, the target being to identify optimal conditions for the combustion process in which the engine can be operated highly efficiently with low emissions. Identification of the best operating conditions facilitates costly experimental work. In order to ensure proper predictions of liquid sprays in the engine, the spray penetration length was studied in a constant volume vessel and the model constants adjusted. In addition, the Rate of Heat Release (RoHR) predictions for kinetically-driven combustion, i. e. HCCI, deviated unacceptably from experimental values. Therefore, the Diesel Oil Surrogate (DOS) model was revised by introducing new global fuel decomposition reactions, yielding higher n-heptane to toluene ratios. Their activation energies, collision frequency factors and oxygen concentration exponents were carefully selected when integrated into the CFD code. These adjustments resulted in the RoHR being substantially closer to the experimental data obtained from a High Speed Direct Injected (HSDI) crank-shaft controlled engine, and data obtained from the first firing cycles of the free piston engine. In order to acquire knowledge about the temperature vs. equivalence ratio (T-phi) conditions in which key products and intermediates are formed and destroyed T-phi maps were constructed.

As the optimization criteria the electricity capacity and efficiency of combined energy-technology units were adopted.
