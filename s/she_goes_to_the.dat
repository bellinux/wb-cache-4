5|$|Despite {{knowing that}} she is innocent, Chrissie allows Zoe {{to believe that she}} has killed Den. Consequently, a power {{struggle}} breaks out between Sam – who wants her pub back in return for her silence – and Chrissie, with each woman trying to gain control of Zoe. In the meantime, Chrissie publicly accounts for Den's sudden absence by declaring that he has run off with another woman and attempts to make her story convincing by throwing his clothes into the street and engaging in a bogus phone conversation with him in front of a packed pub. She successfully removes Zoe from the Square for a time, and begins a relationship with Jake Moon (Joel Beckett); however, Sam has taken the doorstop and hidden it in her flat. She then proceeds to blackmail Chrissie by saying that unless the pub is given back to her, she will inform the police. Chrissie stalls for time, and eventually calls Sam's bluff, declaring that she will take Sam down with her if <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police. Desperate, Sam tries to corner Chrissie by telling Zoe the truth. Zoe confronts Chrissie before fleeing to Spain, telling her mother Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) what has happened before she goes.|$|E
