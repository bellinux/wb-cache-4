500|$|Limited occurrences {{resembling}} CCD {{have been}} documented as early as 1869 and this set of symptoms has, {{in the past several}} decades, been given many different names (disappearing disease, <b>spring</b> <b>dwindle,</b> May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease). Most recently, a similar phenomenon in the winter of 2004/2005 occurred, and was attributed to varroa mites (the [...] "vampire mite" [...] scare), though this was never ultimately confirmed. The cause of the appearance of this syndrome has never been determined. Upon recognition that the syndrome {{does not seem to be}} seasonally restricted, and that it may not be a [...] "disease" [...] in the standard sense—that there may not be a specific causative agent—the syndrome was renamed.|$|R
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder (CCD) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees {{to care for the}} remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of apiculture, and were known by various names (disappearing disease, <b>spring</b> <b>dwindle,</b> May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in conjunction with a drastic {{rise in the number of}} disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree, and the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.|$|R
50|$|Troubled Waters is a 1936 British mystery film {{directed}} by Albert Parker and starring James Mason, Virginia Cherrill, Alastair Sim, Raymond Lovell and Sam Wilkinson. A government agent (James Mason) exposes smugglers in a British {{town with a}} <b>dwindling</b> <b>spring</b> mineral water business.|$|R
50|$|Though JCOH {{once again}} uses tents for holiday services—the {{congregation}} is now 500 families—the facility remains largely as Jaffe had intended. Gates of the Grove {{continues to hold}} weekly Shabbat services year-round. In the off-season (fall, winter, and <b>spring),</b> attendance <b>dwindles</b> to from 100 to 200 people on any given week. During the peak of summer, this figure can easily double. Nevertheless, a dedicated year-round staff supports the center’s operations {{with the assistance of}} a few seasonal employees during busy months.|$|R
5000|$|Spring Coulee once boasted {{a general}} store, a hotel, three grain elevators, a pool hall, a bank, a United Church, a {{community}} hall, {{a school and}} a few other businesses. Over time, as the farms around the hamlet became larger and people started moving away, <b>Spring</b> Coulee <b>dwindled</b> somewhat. The general store still stands but is in disrepair and has not been open for almost 15 years. The hotel, grain elevators, pool hall, bank and community hall have all been torn down. The United Church building was moved to near Glenwood and has been converted into a private home. The old four-room school still stands and has also been converted into a private home.|$|R
5000|$|The annual {{precipitation}} in the Cottonwood Creek watershed is 36 in, {{with a range}} from 60 in in the mountains to 25 in in the lowlands. The vast majority occurs between December and April, {{with the result that}} the [...] "creek" [...] is often a large river during the winter and <b>spring,</b> while <b>dwindling</b> to a relative trickle in the summer and fall. Because of the relatively low elevation of the watershed, {{the vast majority of the}} flow comes from rain, although in some years significant snowpack can accumulate in the mountains and raise flows during a late spring melt. Because of the rugged topography and seasonality of precipitation, the Cottonwood Creek is highly prone to flash flooding. The average annual discharge is about the average summer flow is only , while winter flows routinely reach thousands of cubic feet per second.|$|R
40|$|The {{regions in}} {{depression}} due to deindustrialisation – the old industrial regions – {{can be defined}} by common internal characteristics, characterised by brownfields <b>springing</b> into existence, <b>dwindling</b> human potential, labour market depression and secondary migrational push. The primary focus of the article is the rust belts appearing following deindustrialisation, brownfields and their complex revitalization, {{especially in terms of}} the labour market. The aim is to prove the correlation between brownfields and the labour market at subregional level in Hungary by analysing two regions characterised by negative deindustrialization, namely Észak-Magyarország and Dél-Dunántúl. Local Moran’s I was used to analyze regional autocorrelation between brownfields and the labour market indicators. Furthermore, subregions smitten by industrial depression are discussed in detail. The study considers the following hypothesis: in Hungary, brownfields came into being following deindustrialisation, especially negative deindustrialisation, which influences the labour market at subregional level. It is also supposed that the failure of development is due to misconceived revitalization. Using my previous results, I set up a new model of revitalization, which, in my opinion, can be facilitated by utilizing a new development...|$|R
