X- and g-irradiation of the Ge-containing glasses induces simultaneously electron and hole paramagnetic defects, stable at room temperature, whereas the same irradiation of glasses with Ca 3 Ga 2 O 6 composition yields only in <b>stable</b> <b>hole</b> paramagnetic defects. The electron defects are assigned to ensembles of E` (Ge) centres with different local environments. The hole defects belong to ensembles of O- centres, localised at different non-bridging oxygens of the glass network. The pronounced TSL glow curves in the g- and X-irradiated Ge-containing glasses peaked at about 280 C are attributed to recombination of the E` (Ge) centres. The TSL glow curves with the maximum near 230 C in the g- and X-irradiated Ge-containing glasses and the glass and ceramics with Ca 3 Ga 2 O 6 composition are related to recombination of the O- centres.

40|$|The {{excellent}} light yield proportionality of europium-doped strontium iodide (SrI_ 2 :Eu) {{has resulted}} in state-of-the-art γ-ray detectors with remarkably high energy resolution, far exceeding that of most halide compounds. In this class of materials the formation of self-trapped hole polarons is very common. However, polaron formation is usually expected to limit carrier mobilities and {{has been associated with}} poor scintillator light-yield proportionality and resolution. Here, using a recently developed first-principles method, we perform an unprecedented study of polaron transport in SrI_ 2, both for equilibrium polarons, as well as nascent polarons immediately following a self-trapping event. As a result, we put forward a rationale for the unexpected high energy resolution of SrI_ 2. We identify nine <b>stable</b> <b>hole</b> polaron configurations, which consist of dimerized iodine pairs with polaron binding energies of up to 0. 5 eV. They are connected by a complex potential energy landscape that comprises 66 unique nearest-neighbor migration paths. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that a large fraction of polarons is born into configurations that migrate practically barrier free at room temperature. As a result, carriers created during γ-irradiation can quickly diffuse away reducing the chance for non-linear recombination reactions that are the primary culprits for non-proportionality and resolution reduction. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} flat, albeit complex, landscape for polaron migration in SrI_ 2 is key for understanding its outstanding performance. This insight provides important guidance not only for the future development of high-performance scintillators but also of other materials, for which large polaron mobilities are crucial such as batteries and solid state ionic conductors.

Energetics of materials used in organic solar cells are already known to {{play a key role in}} various aspects of device performance, including charge generation and ambient stability. In {{order to make}} progress on either of these fronts, a clear understanding of frontier molecular orbital energy levels in semiconducting polymers is key, which is one issue that this thesis aims to address. Less understood is what role energetics plays in operational stability, which is another issue that this thesis aims to address. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to study the effect of relative semiconducting polymer crystallinity on highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels in neat films. Two HOMO energy levels were found, with a difference in energy of ca 60 meV, corresponding to relatively ordered and disordered phases in the film. The effect of various thermal treatments on the relative ratio of ordered:disordered phases is investigated. During solar cell operation, the semiconducting polymers are partially oxidised, with bulk hole polaron densities of ca 10 ^ 15 - 17 cm- 3. Chronoamperometry and absorption spectroscopy were combined to develop a methodology for accelerating degradation caused by the presence of hole polarons in neat films. The methodology was initially employed to investigate the relative stabilities of the hole polarons formed when P 3 HT and two structurally analogous semiconducting polymers with deeper HOMO energy levels are partially oxidised.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is {{to search for a}} superconducting phase {{transition}} in a conjugated polymer with implanted magnetic atoms. To carry out this investigation we have performed a modified worldline quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm concentrating on the polymer cis-polyacetylene at finite temperatures. The Hamiltonian used is that of the extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger discrete tight-binding electron-lattice model which incorporates on-site and nearest-neighbour electron-electron Hubbard terms, Brazovskii-Kirova symmetry breaking, and Kondo impurities. We have found that through changing the conduction charge doping level real space-charge pairs, bipolarons, can be stabilised in the presence of magnetic impurities within certain parameter regimes. This has been established through direct observation of the calculated lattice order parameter/staggered lattice distortion and net charge distributions. Thus we have demonstrated that real space charge pairs and magnetic atoms can coexist. In order to search for a second-order phase transition, indicative of possible superconducting behaviour, we have calculated the impurity magnetic staggered and uniform susceptibilities. This was done at discrete temperatures in the 60 K – 300 K range in the presence of <b>stable</b> <b>hole</b> bipolarons. The results show, at higher temperatures, an enhancement of the staggered over the uniform susceptibility for next-nearest-neighbour impurity separation. This is indicative of anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations arising from indirect exchange. In contrast, at lower temperatures the staggered and uniform susceptibilities converge consistent with the Kondo effect and destruction of the indirect exchange mechanism. When the impurity separation is increased to six lattice sites both susceptibilities are qualitatively the same at all temperatures as the impurities fluctuate independently. Thus the indirect exchange mechanism is short-ranged and the impurities should be relatively close to each other to facilitate anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations in the presence of bound hole pairs. The susceptibility measurements showed no signature of a phase transition within the aforementioned temperature range. The investigation is however inconclusive as lower temperatures proved computationally prohibitive. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Large interfragmentary {{movements}} may delay bone-healing. The {{hypothesis of}} the present study was that a reduction of interfragmentary movements, especially of torsional rotation and bending angles, would support the healing process and lead to improved healing following unreamed tibial nailing. The objective of this study was to investigate healing of an unstable tibial osteotomy site following stabilization with unreamed nailing with a modified tibial device that had angle <b>stable</b> <b>holes</b> for the locking bolts. We compared those findings with healing after stabilization of such sites with standard unreamed tibial nailing. The duration of the study period was nine weeks. METHODS: The site of a standardized displaced osteotomy (3 -mm gap) in twelve ovine tibiae was stabilized with unreamed tibial nailing: six animals were treated with a modified nail that had angle <b>stable</b> <b>holes</b> for the locking bolts, and six were treated with standard unreamed tibial nailing. In vivo gait analysis with optical measurements of interfragmentary movements and simultaneous measurements of ground reaction parameters were performed three days after the operation and once weekly afterward. After the animals were killed at nine weeks, the treated and contralateral tibiae were explanted, the implants were removed, and radiographs were made and evaluated for bridged cortices. Each pair of tibiae was also mechanically tested until torsional failure, after which the whole callus region was subjected to histological and histomorphometric analysis. RESULTS: Throughout the examination period, the interfragmentary movements in all directions were significantly smaller in the group treated with the angle stable tibial nail than they were in the group treated with standard unreamed tibial nailing. The limbs treated with the angle stable tibial nails returned to almost full weight-bearing during the period of the investigation, whereas those treated with standard nailing did not. Histomorphometric analysis, radiographic data, and mechanical testing showed superior bone-healing following treatment with the angle stable tibial nail. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an angle stable tibial nail may help to reduce interfragmentary movements in vivo and thus lead to superior bone-healing compared with that following standard unreamed tibial nailing...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of graphene in 2004, two dimensional materials (2 D) have {{become the focus of}} tremendous research owing to their unprecedented properties. Atomically thin nature of 2 D materials gives rise to unique physicochemical properties, which makes them attractive for flexible electronics, chemical and biological sensing, energy storage, and solar cells. In this dissertation, sensing and energy related applications of 2 D materials are studied. 	In chapter 1, graphene based ammonia sensors are presented, in which nano-structuring graphene significantly improves the sensitivity towards ammonia due to the formation of highly reactive edge defects. It was found that sensitivity could be further enhanced by decoration of Pd nanoparticles on the nano-structured graphene. In chapter 2, hydrogen sensors based on solution processed transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) nanosheets-Pd nanoparticles composites are introduced. The sensors can detect hydrogen at room temperature with high sensitivities. The ease of fabrication holds a great potential for low-cost and scalable manufacturing of chemical sensors. 		In chapter 3, the fabrication and characterization of graphene/Si heterojunction solar cells are described and various methods to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) are presented. A single layer graphene is highly transparent; therefore suitable as a transparent Schottky electrode for solar cells. However, the PCEs of the pristine graphene/Si solar cells are low due to the high sheet resistance of graphene as well as the low Schottky barrier height between pristine graphene and Si. We improved the PCE by a magnitude of order (achieving 9 % PCE) with Au nanoparticle decoration followed by a nitric acid treatment owing to the dramatic reduction in the series resistance of the cells and the enhanced Schottky barrier height. Furthermore, we used NiO as a transparent and <b>stable</b> <b>hole</b> doping material for graphene, in which NiO doped cell shows enhanced PCE with high stability.
