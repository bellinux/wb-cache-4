50|$|<b>Subsidized</b> {{apartment}} <b>buildings,</b> {{often referred}} to as housing projects or colloquially, have a complicated and often notorious history in the United States. While the first decades of projects were built with higher construction standards and a broader range of incomes and applicants, over time, public housing increasingly became the housing of last resort in many cities. Several reasons have been cited for this negative trend including the failure of Congress to provide sufficient funding, a lowering of standards for occupancy, and mismanagement at the local level. Furthermore, housing projects have also been seen to greatly increase concentrated poverty in a community, leading to several negative externalities. Crime, drug usage, and educational underperformance are all widely associated with housing projects, particularly in urban areas.|$|R

5000|$|According to {{a report}} by The Institute for Sustainable Futures (ISF) http://www.isf.uts.edu.au/ at University of Technology Sydney, titled: [...] "Energy and Transport Subsidies in Australia", roughly 70% of the country's {{greenhouse}} gas emissions are caused by the energy and transport industries. The uptake of renewable energy in these sectors is slow because of subsidies to fossil fuels and the high cost of acquiring the sophisticated technology required to produce cleaner fuels. Furthermore, fossil fuels are easier to transport and use, compared to renewable energy, which often require sophisticated instruments to acquire and store. The report revealed that for the 2005-2006 financial year, transport subsidies were measured to reach up to $10.1 billion, of which 74% related to transport, 18% to electricity and 4% to renewable and efficient energy. These subsidies help energy generation companies increase their profits, therefore encouraging the building of additional coal-fuel power plants. Investing in other, more sustainable, types of electricity generation plants would have cost less than continuing to <b>subsidize</b> the <b>building</b> of these power plants. On a positive note, alternative transport fuels such as natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas are excused from fuel excise/tax.|$|R

5000|$|The {{leadership}} of Detroit was not passive {{in the face}} of the adverse trends that developments in the auto industry posed. Because the city had flourished in the heyday of the auto industry, the city made periodic attempts to stimulate a revival of the industry within the city. For example, in the 1980s the cities of Detroit and Hamtramck used the power of eminent domain to level part of what had been Poletown to make a parking lot for a new automobile factory. On that site, a new, low-rise suburban type Cadillac plant was built, with substantial government subsidies. The new Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly employs 1,600 workers. [...] In the 1990s, the city <b>subsidized</b> the <b>building</b> of a new Chrysler plant on the city's east side - Jefferson North Assembly - which currently employs 4,600 people. These efforts, however, were an uphill struggle against overall trends in the industry. In 2009 Chrysler filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy case, and survives in a partnership with Fiat SpA of Italy. while GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 1, 2009, and survives as a much smaller company - smaller now than Japan's Toyota Motor Company.

40|$|This {{capstone}} project {{deals with}} standards {{imposed on the}} trade of agricultural imports from developing countries by developed countries. BSE, foot and mouth disease, and avian flu are all major concerns for US and European consumers. These governments are extremely risk averse and want {{to reduce the risk}} of transmitting any kind of disease, especially those borne by agricultural products, to zero. There is no tolerance for risk. But is there a less burdensome system that also can achieve the zero-tolerance policy?One of the requirements is that there be no contact between different animals. For example, hoofed animals, which may be possible carriers of foot and mouth disease, must be completely separated from each other. This requires building artificial barriers to separate the animals. But this has deleterious effects for tourism in African countries, where tourists from the developed world go on safaris to see animals. Building fences and artificial barriers reduces the naturalness of the habitat and reduces the attraction for tourism. In order to reduce the cost of the fences, agencies like USAID may <b>subsidize</b> the <b>building</b> of the fences, but they do not subsidize the loss in tourism. Thus there are real costs to these countries. So the main questions this project addressed were these: 1. Are there any alternatives? 2. Is it possible to institute policies that are less burdensome and yet achieve the desired outcome (which is {{to reduce the risk of}} spreading diseases) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates {{what are}} the {{residential}} rent determinants in Helsinki and how {{the impact of the}} housing attributes differs between districts, questions that interest many parties, such as investors, of the real estate market. The study focuses on new rental agreements of rental apartments for which there are no restrictions with regard to their rent levels. These kinds of rental dwellings are most strongly linked to the owner-occupied housing market as well as the financial market. The rentable area, age and location of a flat have the greatest effects on the rents of market based rental apartments in Helsinki, according to the estimated models. Rent levels decrease exponentially as the rentable area increases, while the flat's age decreases the rent level most when considering flats of the age of 30 and substantially over 90 years olds. In addition, a sauna increases rent level by approximately 5 percent, and rental flats located in non-subsidized buildings also have circa 4 - 5 percent higher rents compared to flats located in interest <b>subsidized</b> <b>buildings</b> in Helsinki. Furthermore, new apartments have a premium in the rent level. The floor level also increases rent level. However, the neighbourhood and locational characteristics also play important roles in determining the rent level of rental apartments. Distance to the CBD decreases housing rents as the distance increases, in ceteris paribus. Apartments located in the proximity of a metro or train station have lower rent levels than dwellings located within a circa 1 - 2 kilometre distance from the nearest station - thus the impact of the station on the rent level is rather quadratic than linear. Distance to a highway, main road and seashore also impact the residential rents. Furthermore, the image of the district reflects either positively or negatively on rent levels in Helsinki. Nevertheless, the effects of the attributes vary across Helsinki, indicating spatial heterogeneity of the parameters. For example, a flat's age has a different impact on the flat's rent level between the major districts of Helsinki. The effect in the Southeastern Major District of Helsinki is not as large compared to the Northeastern Major District. Moreover, the rent premium of new flats is strongest in the southeastern areas of Helsinki. In addition to spatial heterogeneity, spatial autocorrelation is also strongly involved in housing rents due to clustered apartments in same buildings and same areas. In consequence, the traditional OLS models produce biased estimates due to the spatial effects while the spatial models outperform the OLS models in terms of AIC and Likelihood ratio test statistics as well as when the goodness-of-fit between the models is compared. However, the spatial models do not describe the rent level variation correctly either since there are several unobserved housing characteristics that the models do not take into account but which still {{have an effect on the}} rent levels. Moreover, one has to take into account the representativeness of the data used in estimation when inferring and applying the results. Therefore, the estimated models have some shortcomings when they are applied, for example, in rent level evaluation across Helsinki...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Organic {{vegetable}} {{production is}} a system {{based on the principle}} of taking care of nature accounting all life forms. The research aimed to characterize organic vegetables production environment in Central Luzon, Philippines. Survey, key informants interview and focus group discussion were used in generating data from 72 organic vegetable farmers and 32 conventional vegetable growers from Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Zambales. Descriptive statistics, cost and return, input utilization, technology attributes, and extent of technology utilization were used in data analysis. The bio-physical, socio-economic and institutional environment in Central Luzon can provide good opportunity that can be tapped in promoting organic vegetable production in the region. The economic returns in organic vegetable production is promising and at par compared to conventional vegetable production. Low utilization of organic vegetable production technologies is apparent among farmers and their capacity to adopt organic farming standards including certification is also low. The constraints in organic vegetable production are many, but can be addressed through an integrated organic vegetable production program in the region. This calls for a holistic organic consciousness campaign, prioritization and localization of organic vegetable production, intensifying capability <b>building,</b> <b>subsidizing</b> and localizing organic certification, and effective price monitoring and dissemination mechanism...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} a study examining occupational deprivation involving impoverished persons living with HIV/AIDS. The {{purpose of this}} research {{study was to determine}} how members of an HIV/AIDS support group living in government <b>subsidized</b> apartment <b>buildings</b> in a high risk neighborhood choose to find workable solutions to challenges in their lives. Persons with HIV/AIDS are often forced to live in poverty in order to obtain the governmental support needed for life sustaining prescription medicine. As a result, many of them experience barriers to participating fully in society and in their communities. This study used an active research design as put forth by McNiff 2 ̆ 6 Whitehead, (2006) in which participants acted as their own agents of change. A series of 3 focus groups was used, field notes written, transcribed, coded, and sorted. Spradley 2 ̆ 7 s (1976) ethnographic interviewing style and methods for coding focus group field notes were used in the three focus groups. Solution-focused action research based on findings from the first 2 focus group meetings was taken by focus group members. The first meeting discussed challenges for which solutions were desired by group members. In the second meeting field note codes from the first focus group were sorted, and an action research plan made. A third meeting involved sharing action research findings. Field notes from each focus group were transcribed, coded, and audit group reviewed. Preliminary findings suggest that individuals living with HIV/AIDS are willing and able to take action to make positive changes in their lives despite societal barriers. Initial themes regarding occupational deprivation focused on transportation, laundry, and housecleaning issues. Both barriers and facilitators to these occupations were found at the societal, agency, community, and individual levels. This study is limited to a subset of a group of people with HIV/AIDS in the Southeastern United States and therefore findings cannot be generalized to other groups. For impoverished individuals with HIV/AIDS, research into ways of facilitating occupational justice is needed. Occupational scientists and occupational therapists may benefit from this research as it represents one model in which occupational justice in populations can be facilitated ˆ regardless of their specific circumstances...|$|R
40|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (EVs) offer great potential in reducing local {{air pollution and}} carbon emissions and in alleviating dependency on fossil fuel. However, there are significant barriers to the diffusion process of this new technology. The EV market features indirect network effects (or the chicken-and-egg problem) in that consumers {{may be reluctant to}} adopt EVs with the lack of public charging stations while investors are less willing to build charging stations when the installed base of EVs is small. Indirect network effects could amplify shocks whether negative or positive through feedback loops and therefore could slow down or speed up the diffusion process. Using a data set of quarterly EV sales in 353 metro areas from 2011 to 2013, this paper provides the first empirical analysis on the importance of indirect network effects in this market: a 10 % {{increase in the number of}} charging stations would increase the EV sales by 10. 8 % while a 10 % growth in the EV stock would lead to a 5. 8 % increase in the number of charging stations. Our simulation results find that the current federal tax credits of up to $ 7, 500 have contributed to 48. 5 % of the EV sales during 2011 - 2013, with indirect network effect explaining 42 % of that sales increase. The total tax credit of $ 1. 05 billion given out during these three years brought about $ 0. 23 billion in long-term environmental benefits, while a policy of equal-size spending but <b>subsidizing</b> charging station <b>building</b> would be several times more effective. 2020 - 05 - 2...|$|R
40|$|East Liberty, a {{neighborhood}} in Pittsburgh, has seen major urban transformations since the mid-twentieth century. It was settled as a walkable neighborhood with short blocks, a continuous street grid, a commercial district, and good transit service. As the city lost businesses and residents {{to the suburbs}} in the 1960 ’s, the neighborhood experienced decline. It was inadvertently precipitated by a major urban renewal project that disrupted streets to create a highway-like ring road around the business district, destroyed over a thousand buildings to create large parking lots, and replaced hundreds of houses with <b>subsidized</b> high-rise apartment <b>buildings.</b> Forty years of disinvestment left the neighborhood with high rates of vacancy, neglect, and crime. Beginning with the Community Plan in 1999, East Liberty has been engaged in a multi-faceted community development effort, which has involved ongoing community-based planning. East Liberty Development, Inc. (ELDI), its non-profit community development organization, {{has worked with the}} local Chamber of Commerce and other community partners to bring back businesses, build mixed-income housing, and improve community amenities.

40|$|A mixed methods {{approach}} {{was used for}} this study. The setting was a low-income, <b>subsidized</b> housing apartment <b>building</b> for community-dwelling older and younger disabled adults identified as a health care hot spot due to high rates of ambulance use. The study purpose was to identify reasons for ED use and problems during transition from ED to home, predictors of zip code 23220 (health care hot spot) in emergent and non-emergent ED visits, and predictors of total ED costs in community-dwelling older adults living in a health care hot spot. Semi-structured interviews with residents who used the ED, an existing database from an interprofessional care coordination and wellness program for residents, and community-dwelling older adults’ electronic medical record and billing data from 2010 - 2013 ED visits from an academic medical center were used. The Gelberg-Andersen Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations was utilized. A total of 14 interviews were conducted. Themes related to ED use included: high use of ambulance services, timely use of the ED or attempt at self-care, and lack of communication with a health care provider prior to ED visit. Themes related to care transitions were: delay in medication receipt after discharge, lack of a current medication list and personal health record, PCP follow-up instruction, and education on warning signs of a worsening condition. The interprofessional program’s care coordination activities were education, disease monitoring, referral for PCP visit, and discrepancy reconciliation. A total of 7, 805 ED visits were included, of which 3, 871 were non-emergent and 1, 179 were emergent. Common primary ED visit diagnoses were chest pain and abdominal pain.

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. Dengue {{is arguably}} the most {{important}} arboviral disease of humans, having increased dramatically in geographic range and prevalence over the last 25 years. Dengue virus has two main vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. For decades both vectors have also been increasing their geographic range on regional and global scales. This study took place in Singapore, where dengue fever is a major public health threat despite a successful vector control program. Similar to other hyperendemic countries, local dengue transmission dynamics in Singapore are not well understood: where dengue transmission is occurring, the relative contribution of the two dengue vectors, and the ability to correlate traditional vector surveillance methods to transmission risk remains controversial. In collaboration with the Program of Infectious Diseases at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School, Singapore Ministry of Health, Singapore National Environmental Agency, and Ang Mo Kio Town Council an adult Aedes female fixed position vector surveillance program was established that detailed temporal and spatial Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus distribution and abundance in Ang Mo Kio, Central Singapore. This surveillance method yielded similar results to standard surveillance techniques over a range of habitats and time points. Furthermore, sensitivity of the adult surveillance method presented here is uniquely increased by placing traps {{on the second floor of}} Housing Development Board (HDB), government <b>subsidized</b> multistory residential <b>buildings,</b> as opposed to ground level; average Ae. aegypti catch rate of the ground floor was 0. 09 and average Ae. aegypti catch rate of the second floor was 0. 42. Starting on the second floor a very strong inverse relationship between Ae. aegypti catch rate and floor height (Pearson linear correlation r=- 0. 91, t=- 4. 47, df= 4, p= 0. 01) was also identified. In addition, intensive entomological investigations, in focal areas with varying levels of Aedes abundance, identified by the fixed position surveillance system, uncovered details about mosquito ecology and "hotspots" at a local scale that can improve our understanding of dengue transmission dynamics. Dengue transmission is believed to primarily occur in residential units but host seeking Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopcitus were collected at similar frequencies in congregation areas on the ground floors of, HDBs and at greater abundance than inside residential units. Improving knowledge on the focal nature of dengue transmission is critical to designing more targeted and cost-effective surveillance and control strategies in the future, both in Singapore and urban areas elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Social {{scientists}} and urban planners have long argued that social movements for housing, especially in metropolises {{of the so-called}} Global South, have been determinant in the politicization of the urban poor. Since the mid-twentieth century, the demand for rights to physical presence in the city has resulted in large-scale right-to-housing mobilizations in which lower-income dwellers seek to become homeowners by taking over peripheral empty plots and building themselves their homes and neighborhoods (e. g. Mangin 1967; Turner 1968; Castells 1983; Holston 1991; 2008; Garcés 2002; Fawaz 2009; Das 2011; Caldeira 2015 a; Murphy 2015). Scholars have thus suggested that the urban poor, on account of their involvement in widespread practices of city making carried out mostly in the urban peripheries, have become citizens capable of addressing a language of rights to the state. This dissertation engages in these debates by posing some critical questions: What are the mechanisms through which the urban poor constitute themselves as legitimate rights-bearers when {{they are no longer}} the actual builders of their residential spaces? What kind of political subjectivity is formed when their demand for urban rights is performed less through mass land seizures and “autoconstruction” processes (Holston 1991; 2008; Caldeira 2000; 2015 a) than through their participation in state-regulated housing assemblies? This dissertation examines the rise and development of housing movements in Santiago, Chile based on archival analysis of past urban mobilizations and ethnographic observation of contemporary housing assemblies. This study scrutinizes thus the ways in which working-class dwellers articulate a rights-based political language and produce new political subjectivities while enrolled in housing programs through which they apply for state subsidies. Since the 1950 s, housing struggles in Chile have been grounded in a kind of social agency known as pobladores (urban poor). In the 1960 s and early 1970 s, pobladores made use of two interrelated performances of city making to become homeowners: illegal land occupations and autoconstruction. This gave rise to mass social protests known as “pobladores movement” (Castells 1973; 1983; Pastrana and Threlfall 1974; Espinoza 1988; Garcés 2002; Cortés 2014). However, the arrival of Augusto Pinochet’s military dictatorship (1973 – 1990) drastically repressed these mobilizations. Likewise, it implemented a neoliberal, subsidy-based housing policy, which changed significantly the way pobladores obtain and envisage social housing. Accordingly, since the late 1970 s state policies conceive housing less as the result of collective practices of city making than as a commodity that the poor can obtain through both state subsidies and private savings (Bruey 2012; Özler 2012). Over the past twenty-five years, post-dictatorial governments have tried to avoid the reappearance of urban movements by pre-emptively <b>building</b> <b>subsidized</b> housing projects. During the 1990 s, the state endeavored to construct at least 90, 000 subsidized housing units per year (Arriagada and Moreno 2006). This eventually helped reduce the housing shortage from 918, 756 units in 1990 to 743, 450 in 2000, which represents a decrease from 53 % to 37 % in the number of households in need of housing. This reduction of the housing deficit persisted in the following decades reaching 459, 347 units in 2013 (Ministerio de Desarrollo Social 2014 a). In that context, by 2000 large-scale land occupations almost totally disappeared, calling into question the very existence of pobladores as subjects endowed with a capacity to intervene in the political sphere. However, while the government has massively delivered housing, these subsidized homes are often located in peripheral areas lacking infrastructure and services. This fact has triggered an emerging process of remobilization {{in the last ten years}} in which the new generations of pobladores are increasingly claiming the right to “dignified housing” (vivienda digna) and a “dignified life” (vida digna). Interestingly, the tactics of these new protests consist less of land occupations than of pobladores’ enrollment in housing programs through which they expect to obtain subsidized housing. My dissertation, in this regard, discusses the mechanisms through which contemporary pobladores recreate their political agencies when they no longer organize their protests as squatters nor autoconstructors, but rather as “formal” dwellers enrolled in subsidy-based programs. I conclude that the Chilean urban poor, by identifying themselves as pobladores, form themselves as political agents capable of dealing with the state on the basis of a rights-based language. To do so, they bring the performative power of the word poblador into the present by executing a territorially situated political practices through which they evoke the pobladores movement of the mid-twentieth century. This work examines thus how the past informs the mobilizations of the present and how lower-income residents becomes pobladores even when the performances of city making that characterized past urban movements are recalled rather than actually performed. Likewise, this dissertation discusses to what extent such a subject-formation process makes possible the emergence of new kinds of citizenship in which pobladores, by conceiving of themselves as city-makers, legitimize their claims to have dignified housing and a dignified life...|$|R
