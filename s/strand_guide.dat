Casting rollers are divided into different types according to cooling system such as: a) central cooling b) revolver cooling c) spiral cooling. The main objective of designing and presenting this work are the need for changing the design of available rollers, existing outdated cooling system in rollers, weakness of roller’s base and the need of thermal and mechanical calculation for optimum design of roller’s cooling system, with attention to limitation of cover thickness and calculation of mechanical stress tolerance after implementation of optimum system with attention to weakness of roller’s base. At the end of this work, qualitative and quantitative comparison of existing and improved thermal state using FLUENT software will be presented.

50|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a biological}} {{process in which}} the RNA molecules inhibit gene expression. The method of inhibition is via the destruction of specific mRNA molecules or by simply suppressing the protein translation. The RNA interference has a significant role in defending cells against parasitic nucleotide sequences. In many eukaryotes, including animals, the RNA interference pathway is found, and it is initiated by the enzyme Dicer. Dicer cleaves long double-stranded RNA molecules into short double stranded fragments of around 20 nucleotide siRNAs. The dsRNA is then separated into two single-stranded RNAs (ssRNA) - the passenger <b>strand</b> and the <b>guide</b> <b>strand.</b> Consequently, the passenger strand is degraded, while the <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> is incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The most well-studied outcome of the RNAi is post-transcriptional gene silencing, which occurs when the <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> pairs with a complementary sequence in a messenger RNA molecule and induces cleavage by Argonaute, that lies in the core of RNA-induced silencing complex.|$|R

In particular, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins are a potentially {{powerful tool for}} modifying a genome by targeted cleavage of DNA sequences complementary to designed <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> RNAs. Although CRISPR/Cas systems can have on-target cleavage rates close to the transfection rates, they may also have relatively high off-target cleavage at similar genomic sites that contain one or more base pair mismatches, and insertions or deletions relative to the <b>guide</b> <b>strand.</b> We have developed a bioinformatics-based tool, COSMID (CRISPR Off-target Sites with Mismatches, Insertions, and Deletions) that searches genomes for potential off-target sites ([URL] Based on the user-supplied <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> and input parameters, COSMID identifies potential off-target sites with the specified number of mismatched bases and insertions or deletions {{when compared with the}} <b>guide</b> <b>strand.</b> For each site, amplification primers optimal for the chosen application are also given as output.

Here we describe position-specific, sequence-independent chemical modifications that reduced silencing of partially complementary transcripts by all siRNAs tested. Silencing of perfectly matched targets was unaffected by these modifications. The chemical modification also reduced off-target phenotypes in growth inhibition studies. Key to the modification was 2 ′-O-methyl ribosyl substitution at position 2 in the <b>guide</b> <b>strand,</b> which reduced silencing of most off-target transcripts with complementarity to the seed region of the siRNA <b>guide</b> <b>strand.</b> The sharp position dependence of 2 ′-O-methyl ribosyl modification contrasts with the broader position dependence of base-pair substitutions within the seed region, suggesting a role for position 2 of the <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> distinct from its effects on pairing to target transcripts...|$|R

In this work, we consider the association of two related RNA structures that share a common guide strand: the microRNA duplex and the microRNA-target binding structure. We have analyzed thousands of such structure pairs and found many of them share high structural similarity. Therefore, we conclude that when predicting microRNA target genes, considering just the microRNA <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> matches to gene sequences may not be sufficient — The microRNA duplex structure formed by the <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> and its companion passenger strand must also be considered.

25|$|The siRNA induced post {{transcriptional}} {{gene silencing}} starts with the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The complex silences certain gene expression by cleaving the mRNA molecules coding the target genes. To begin the process, {{one of the two}} siRNA <b>strands,</b> the <b>guide</b> <b>strand,</b> will be loaded into the RISC while the other strand, the passenger strand, is degraded. Certain Dicer enzymes may be responsible of loading the <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> into RISC. Then, the siRNA scans for and direct RISC to perfectly complementary sequence on the mRNA molecules. The cleavage of the mRNA molecules is thought to be catalyzed by the Piwi domain of Argonaute proteins of the RISC. The mRNA molecule is then cut precisely by cleaving the phosphodiester bond between the target nucleotides which are paired to siRNA residues 10 and 11, counting from the 5’end. This cleavage results in mRNA fragments that are further degraded by cellular exonucleases. The 5’ fragment is degraded from its 3’ end by exosome while the 3’ fragment is degraded from its 5’ end by 5' -3' exoribonuclease 1(XRN1). Dissociation of the target mRNA strand from RISC after the cleavage allow more mRNA to be silenced. This dissociation process is likely to be promoted by extrinsic factors driven by ATP hydrolysis.|$|R

For 2 ’-O-benzyl, four incorporations were tolerated with similar activity to the unmodified siRNA in vivo, while for 2 ’-O-CH 2 Py(4) six incorporations were tolerated. Increased in vivo activity was observed when the modifications were combined at positions 8 and 15 on the <b>guide</b> <b>strand.</b> Understanding the optimal placement of siRNA-optimized modifications needed for maximal in vivo activity is necessary for development of RNA-based therapeutics...|$|R

High levels of the onco-genic miRNA (oncomiR) <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> called miR- 17 - 5 p is overexpressed in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and can inhibit ribosomal translation of tumor suppressor gene mRNAs, such as programmed cell death 4 (PDCD 4) or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). We hypothesized that knocking down the oncogenic microRNA (oncomiR) miR- 17 - 5 p might restore the expression levels of PDCD 4 and PTEN tumor suppressor proteins, illustrating a route to oligonucleotide therapy of TNBC. Contrary to conventional wisdom, antisense knockdown of oncomiR miR- 17 - 5 p <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> reduced PDCD 4 and PTEN pro-teins by 1. 8 ± 0. 3 fold in human TNBC cells instead of raising them.

We demonstrate that this complex can cleave target RNA using precursor microRNA (pre-miRNA) hairpin as the source of siRNA. Although RISC can also utilize duplex siRNA, it displays a nearly 10 -fold greater activity using the pre-miRNA Dicer substrate.

They are located in intergenic and intragenic regions, and are transcribed as pri-miRNA by RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III. They then undergo extensive post-transcriptional modifications, starting with the processing of the pri-miRNA in the nucleus to generate a 70-100 nt long pre-miRNA by ribonucleases Drosha and DGCR8. This pre-miRNA is then transported out of the nucleus by Exportin-5, and is then further processed by Dicer into a mature 18-25 nt long double <b>stranded</b> microRNA.

The positions of any mismatched base pairs in an miRNA determine which Argonaute subtype is used. Subsequently, the Argonaute-guide complex binds and silences complementary target mRNAs; certain Argonautes cleave the target. Mismatches between <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> and the target mRNA decrease cleavage efficiency. Thus, loading and silencing both require that signals {{about the presence of}} a mismatched base pair are communicated from the mismatch site to effector sites. These effector sites include the active site, to prevent target cleavage; the binding groove, to modify nucleic acid binding affinity; and surface allosteric sites, to control recruitment of additional proteins to form the RISC. To examine how such signals may be propagated, we analyzed the network of internal allosteric pathways in Argonaute exhibited through correlations of residue-residue interactions. The emerging network can be described as a set of pathways emanating from the core of the protein near the active site, distributed into the bulk of the protein, and converging upon a distributed cluster of surface residues. Nucleotides in the <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> "seed region" have a stronger relationship with the protein than other nucleotides, concordant with their importance in sequence selectivity. Finally, any of several seed region guide-target mismatches cause certain Argonaute residues to have modified correlations {{with the rest of the}} protein. This arises from the aggregation of relatively small interaction correlation changes distributed across a large subset of residues.

The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The <b>guide</b> <b>strand</b> tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation.

The miRNA or <b>guide</b> <b>strand,</b> is loaded onto the Argonaute (AGO) effector, and the miRNA* or passenger strand is typically degraded. The loaded AGO-containing RNA-induced silencing complex specifically recognizes a target mRNA, leading to its degradation or translational inhibition. In plants, miRNA-mediated cleavage of a target triggers in some cases the production of secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which in turn can silence other genes in trans. This alternative pathway depends on the length of the miRNA and the specific AGO in the effector complex. However, 22 -nt miRNAs are sufficient, but not essential for this pathway. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, we show that transitivity can be triggered when the small RNA that is not retained in AGO is 22 -nt long. Moreover, we demonstrate that asymmetrically positioned bulged bases in the miRNA:miRNA* duplex, regardless of miRNA or miRNA* length, are sufficient for the initiation of transitivity.

Furthermore, we show that hAgo 2 binds RNA and DNA <b>guide</b> <b>strands</b> in the same fashion. On the other hand, despite striking homology between the two Ago variants, MjAgo cannot orientate guide RNA substrates in a way that allows interaction with the target DNA in a cleavage-compatible orientation...|$|R
40|$|The human Argonaute 2 (hAgo 2) {{protein is}} a key player of RNA {{interference}} (RNAi). Upon complex formation with small non-coding RNAs, the protein initially interacts with the 5 ′-end of a given guide RNA through multiple interactions within the MID domain. This interaction {{has been reported to}} show a strong bias for U and A over C and G at the 5 ′-position. Performing molecular dynamics simulations of binary hAgo 2 /OH–guide–RNA complexes, we show that hAgo 2 is a highly flexible protein capable of binding to <b>guide</b> <b>strands</b> with all four possible 5 ′-bases. Especially, in the case of C and G this is associated with rather large individual conformational rearrangements affecting the MID, PAZ and even the N-terminal domains to different degrees. Moreover, a 5 ′-G induces domain motions in the protein, which trigger a previously unreported interaction between the 5 ′-base and the L 2 linker domain. Combining our in silico analyses with biochemical studies of recombinant hAgo 2, we find that, contrary to previous observations, hAgo 2 is capable of functionally accommodating <b>guide</b> <b>strands</b> regardless of the 5 ′-base...|$|R
