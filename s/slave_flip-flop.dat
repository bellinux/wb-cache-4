Flip-flops, {{an important component of}} pipelined architectures, are becoming more susceptible to soft errors. This work analyzes soft error rates on a variety of flip-flops. The analysis was performed by implementing and simulating the various designs in 70 nm, 1 V CMOS technology. First, we evaluate {{the critical}} charge for the susceptible nodes in each design. Further, we implement two hardening techniques and present the results. One attempts to increase the other improves the overall robustness of the circuit by replicating the master stage of the master <b>slave</b> <b>flip-flops,</b> which leads to reduced power and area overhead.

40|$|As {{transistor}} sizes {{scale down}} {{and levels of}} integration increase, leakage power has become a vital downside in modern low-power VLSI technology. This is often very true for ultra-low- voltage (ULV) circuits, wherever high levels of leakage force designers to selected relatively high threshold voltages, which limits performance. In this paper, we design different design approach of master <b>slave</b> D <b>flip-flop</b> with stacking power gating leakage reduction technique. Here these techniques essentially increase the effective resistance of leakage paths by adding sleep transistors between logic stacks and power supply rails. Power gating technique also provides many of the property from transistor stacking technique. The proposed approach saves maximum amount of the Leakage power without degrading {{the performance of the}} circuit. In this work we analyses the leakage power of three different types of CMOS design style such as pass transistor logic (PTL), transmission gates and gate diffusion input (GDI) design. All these proposed circuits are simulated with and without the application of leakage reduction techniques. The circuits are simulated using Cadence Virtuoso tool at 45 nm technology for various parameters...|$|R
40|$|Silicon Carbide (SiC) has {{received}} a special attention in the last decades thanks to its superior electrical, mechanical and chemical proprieties. SiC is mostly used for applications where Silicon is limited, becoming a proper material for both unipolar and bipolar power device able to work under high power, high frequency and high temperature conditions. Aside from the outstanding theoretical and practical advantages still to be proved in SiC devices, {{the need for more}} accurate models for the design and optimization of these devices, along with the development of integrated circuits (ICs) on SiC is indispensable for the further success of modern power electronics. The design and development of SiC ICs has become a necessity since the high temperature operation of ICs is expected to enable important improvements in aerospace, automotive, energy production and other industrial systems. Due to the last impressive progresses in the manufacturing of high quality SiC substrates, the possibility of developing ICs applications is now feasible. SiC unipolar transistors, such as JFETs and MESFETs show a promising potential for digital ICs operating at high temperature and in harsh environments. The reported ICs on SiC have been realized so far with either a small number of elements, or with a low integration density. Therefore, this work demonstrates that by means of our SiC MESFET technology, multi-stage digital ICs fabrication containing a large number of 4 H-SiC devices is feasible, accomplishing {{some of the most important}} ICs requirements. The ultimate objective is the development of SiC digital building blocks by transferring the Si CMOS topologies, hence demonstrating that the ICs SiC technology can be an important competitor of the Si ICs technology especially in application fields in which high temperature, high switching speed and harsh environment operations are required. The study starts with the current normally-on SiC MESFET CNM complete analysis of an already fabricated MESFET. It continues with the modeling and fabrication of a new planar-MESFET structure together with new epitaxial resistors specially suited for high temperature and high integration density. A novel device isolation technique never used on SiC before is approached. A fabrication process flow with three metal levels fully compatible with the CMOS technology is defined. An exhaustive experimental characterization at room and high temperature (300 ºC) and Spice parameter extractions for both structures are performed. In order to design digital ICs on SiC with the previously developed devices, the current available topologies for normally-on transistors are discussed. The circuits design using Spice modeling, the process technology, the fabrication and the testing of the 4 H-SiC MESFET elementary logic gates library at high temperature and high frequencies are performed. The MESFET logic gates behavior up to 300 ºC is analyzed. Finally, this library has allowed us implementing complex multi-stage logic circuits with three metal levels and a process flow fully compatible with a CMOS technology. This study demonstrates that the development of important SiC digital blocks by transferring CMOS topologies (such as Master <b>Slave</b> Data <b>Flip-Flop</b> and Data-Reset Flip-Flop) is successfully achieved. Hence, demonstrating that our 4 H-SiC MESFET technology enables the fabrication of mixed signal ICs capable to operate at high temperature (300 ºC) and high frequencies (300 kHz). We consider this study an important step ahead regarding the future ICs developments on SiC. Finally, experimental irradiations were performed on W-Schotthy diodes and mesa-MESFET devices (with the same Schottky gate than the planar SiC MESFET) in order to study their radiation hardness stability. The good radiation endurance of SiC Schottky-gate devices is proven. It is expected that the new developed devices with the same W-Schottky gate, to have a similar behavior in radiation rich environments. Postprint (published version...|$|R
