50|$|M. latifolia occurs only on Norfolk Island, and is {{considered}} critically endangered because it is dioecious, having separate male and female plants. The total number of mature individual plants is less than 150, the effective reproductive population limited {{by the number of}} surviving female plants, which number approximately 20. It occurs on ten sites on Norfolk Island, but most of these contain only one or two plants and only one site has more than 13. Although one site contains approximately 115 trees, regeneration is not occurring at this site. Continuing declines in the number of mature individuals, and number of locations and subpopulations are projected for several reasons including: lack of formal protection or management programs, the vulnerability of small populations to <b>stochastic</b> <b>disturbance</b> events (e.g. cyclones), ongoing competition with invasive weeds, predation by rats, senescence of over-mature plants, and sex ratio bias. The species is adapted to moist forest conditions and is therefore susceptible to unfavourable climate change (projected increases in the incidence of drought and extreme rainfall events that cause physical damage).|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the robust distributed state estimation problem for a class of uncertain sensor networks with multiple stochastic communication delays. A sequence of mutually independent random variables obeying the Bernoulli distribution is introduced to account for the randomly occurred communication delays. Both the discrete-time target plant and the sensor model are subject to parameter uncertainties as well as <b>stochastic</b> <b>disturbance.</b> The parameter uncertainties are norm-bounded and enter both the system and the measurement matrices. The external <b>stochastic</b> <b>disturbance</b> is given {{in the form of a}} scalar Wiener process. Through available output measurements from not only each individual sensor but also its neighbouring sensors, we aim to design distributed state estimators in order to approximate the state of the target plant. By using the Kronecker product, stochastic analysis is carried out to derive a sufficient criterion ensuring the estimation error systems to be convergent in the mean square sense for all randomly occurred delays, admissible <b>stochastic</b> <b>disturbance</b> and parameter uncertainties. Then, an explicit expression of the individual estimator is given in terms of the solution to a convex optimisation problem that can be easily solved by using the semi-definite programme method.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the filtering problem for a class of discrete-time uncertain stochastic nonlinear time-delay systems with both the probabilistic missing measurements and external <b>stochastic</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The measurement missing phenomenon is assumed to occur in a random way, and the missing probability for each sensor is governed by an individual random variable satisfying a certain probabilistic distribution over the interval [0 1]. Such a probabilistic distribution could be any commonly used discrete distribution over the interval [0 1]. The multiplicative <b>stochastic</b> <b>disturbances</b> are {{in the form of a}} scalar Gaussian white noise with unit variance. The purpose of the addressed filtering problem is to design a filter such that, for the admissible random measurement missing, <b>stochastic</b> <b>disturbances,</b> norm-bounded uncertainties as well as stochastic nonlinearities, the error dynamics of the filtering process is exponentially mean-square stable. By using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method, sufficient conditions are established that ensure the exponential mean-square stability of the filtering error, and then the filter parameters are characterized by the solution to a set of LMIs. Illustrative examples are exploited to show the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.
