5|$|In June 1976, Gravel was {{the focus}} of a federal {{investigation}} into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) stated that in August 1972, she had sex with Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of <b>subcommittees</b> that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel said {{at the time that he}} had never met either of the women.

Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.|$|E
5|$|This National War Museum Committee {{set about}} {{collecting}} material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into <b>subcommittees</b> examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, {{the production of}} munitions, and women's war work. There was an early appreciation {{of the need for}} exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. Sir Martin Conway, the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals'. The museum's first curator and secretary was Charles ffoulkes, who had previously been curator of the Royal Armouries at the Tower of London. In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the Western Front in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and Field Marshal Haig, who reportedly took great interest in his work. In December 1917 the name was changed to the Imperial War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum.|$|E
