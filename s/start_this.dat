5|$|The men at Boulogne {{formed the}} core for what Napoleon would later call La Grande Armée. At the <b>start,</b> <b>this</b> French army had about 200,000 men {{organized}} into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannon each and {{were capable of}} independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps (properly situated in a strong defensive position) could survive {{at least a day}} without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign.|$|E
5|$|In June 2001, Combs ended Bad Boy Entertainment's {{joint venture}} with Arista Records, gaining full control of Bad Boy, its catalogue, and its roster of artists. The Saga Continues..., {{released}} on July 10 in North America, was the last studio album released by the joint venture. The album reached number 2 on the Billboard 200 and the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums charts, and was eventually certified Platinum. It is the only studio album under the P. Diddy name, and the first album by Sean Combs not to feature any guest appearances by Jay-Z or Lil Kim. Combs was {{executive producer of the}} reality TV show Making the Band, which appeared on MTV from 2002 to 2009. The show involved interviewing candidates and creating musical acts that would then enter the music business. Acts that got their <b>start</b> <b>this</b> way include Da Band, Danity Kane, Day26, and Donnie Klang.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} types of starts for races of different distances. Middle- and long-distance races mainly use the waterfall <b>start.</b> <b>This</b> is when all athletes begin on a curved line that moves farther out at {{the outer edge of}} the track. Competitors are allowed to move towards the inside lane right away, as long as it is safe to do so. For some middle-distance races, such as 800m, each athlete starts in their own lane. Once the gun fires, they must run in the lane they began in until markers on the track notify them it is time to move towards the inside lane. For sprint races, athletes begin in start blocks and must stay in their own lane for the entire race.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 <b>start.</b> <b>This</b> changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Piquet was {{the only}} driver not {{to start with the}} softer {{compound}} dry-weather tyres on a track which was still drying from morning rain, with the Brazilian opting for the harder tyre available. There was a strong chance of showers predicted during the race. Several cars were slow away on the slippery track, most notably Kovalainen. The main beneficiaries off the line were Piquet and Trulli, who each gained five places. Trulli was hit from behind at the first corner by Bourdais, who also had a quick start. The Toyota suffered diffuser and gearbox damage from the incident, spinning later in the lap. Kovalainen and Heidfeld also collided at the <b>start.</b> <b>This</b> allowed Alonso to gain several places. Sebastian Vettel locked his brakes and ran wide, losing two places. Fisichella collided with Nakajima on the first lap and had to pit to fix a broken front wing and punctures. Hamilton led from Räikkönen who managed to pass his Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa on the Kemmel straight.|$|E
5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, were not {{included}} in the final cut. Much of this back-story was unscripted and the filmmakers were never sure of including it into the final cut, and had considered releasing some of these clips on the internet. Editor Kyle Cooper, creator of the Marvel logo (with the flipping pages) and the montage detailing Iron Man's biography in that film, edited together much of this footage into the opening credits. Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's <b>start.</b> <b>This</b> replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice. Leterrier said he did not want this scene to be lost amid the opening montage.|$|E

25|$|In May 1925, the Exec Committee of Comintern in a {{plenary session}} ordered communists in Indonesia {{to form a}} united anti-imperialist front with non-communist {{nationalist}} organizations, but extremist elements dominated by Alimin & Musso called for a revolution to overthrow the Dutch colonial government. At a conference in Prambanan, Central Java, communist-controlled trades unions decided the revolution would start with a strike by railroad workers that would signal a general strike and then a revolution would <b>start.</b> <b>This</b> {{would lead to the}} PKI replacing the colonial government.|$|E

25|$|Such was {{the lack}} of warning that {{there was no time to}} engage in {{defensive}} manoeuvres, leading to a change in British policy whereby any Royal Navy vessel that suspected it might be under missile attack would turn toward the threat, accelerate to maximum speed and fire chaff to prevent a ship being caught defenceless again.

25|$|He married Mary McBride Smith on July 3, 1920, {{and they}} had two children. His {{daughter}} Barbara was married to singer and actor Ken Curtis from 1952 to 1964. The marriage between Ford and Smith lasted for life despite various issues, one of which could have proved problematic from the <b>start,</b> <b>this</b> being that John Ford was Catholic while she was a non-Catholic divorcée. What difficulty {{was caused by the}} two marrying is unclear as the level of John Ford's commitment to the Catholic faith is disputed. A strain would have been Ford's many extramarital relationships.|$|E
25|$|The {{published}} {{figures show}} that both capacitor types, tantalum and aluminum, are reliable components, comparable with other electronic components and achieving safe operation for decades under normal conditions. But a great difference exists {{in the case of}} wear-out failures. Tantalum capacitors with solid electrolyte have no wear-out mechanism so that the constant failure rate is least, up to the point when all capacitors fail. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, however, have a limited time of constant random failures up to that point when the wear-out failures <b>start.</b> <b>This</b> time of the constant random failure rate corresponds with the lifetime or service life of “wet” aluminum electrolytic capacitors.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} fuel {{declined}} in the Soviet Union from the 1970s to the 1980s, both per ruble of gross social product and per ruble of industrial product. At the <b>start,</b> <b>this</b> decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975. From 1975 and 1980, it grew even slower, only 2.6 percent. David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40 percent of Soviet fuel production {{by the end of}} the century. His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse. The USSR, in theory, would have continued to have an economic growth rate of 2–2.5 percent during the 1990s because of Soviet energy fields. However, the energy sector faced many difficulties, among them the country's high military expenditure and hostile relations with the First World (pre-Gorbachev era).|$|E
25|$|Class 86 {{is based}} on a {{delivery}} of ten aluminum carriages by Strømmen to NSB in 1936 and 1938. Following their success, NSB took delivery of a series of motor units. The first three units were delivered in 1938; one with DWK engine (no. 43) and two with engines from MAN (no. 44–45). The former was designated the a-series, the latter the b-series. A further ten units were delivered in 1940, split between the c and d-series (no. 50–53 and 54–59). Six carriages were delivered in 1943 and 1944. Because of lack of reserve parts to the DWK engines, NSB in 1948 decided to replace them with the Hercules engines, which was completed by 1953. In 1950, NSB took delivery of five e-class units (no. 60–64), which were the first to receive Hercules engines from the <b>start.</b> <b>This</b> was followed up with twenty f-series units (no. 9–28), fourteen delivered in 1953 and six in 1954. Between 1952 and 1954, NSB also took delivery of 25 trailer units.|$|E
