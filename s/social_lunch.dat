The older fellows did the scientific, and their prizes were duly awarded by the judges. But our young party had their share of fun, and Fred and Herbert, who were chums in everything, won the race for the little flag yearly given to the lads for any success on the river. Then the weary heroes loaded the big dory with a cargo of girls, and with the banner blowing gayly in the wind, rowed away to the wide meadow, where seven oaks cast shade enough to shelter a large picnic. And a large one they had, for the mammas took kindly to the children's suggestion, agreeing to club together in a <b>social</b> <b>lunch,</b> each contributing her stores, her family, and her guests, all being happy together in the free and easy way so pleasant and possible in summer weather.|$|E

Four different approaches are presented: a linear model, a bin-packing-based-approach, a quadratic assignment problem, and a greedy heuristic. The different formulations are computationally compared over a set of artificial instances and on the real data for the EURO Winter Institute  2007 Gala dinner. © 2012 Sociedad de Estadi­stica e Investigacion Operativa...|$|E

40|$|During recent years, {{the concept}} of social capital {{has become one of}} the most popular exports from sociological theory into {{everyday}} languages. Social capital has evolved into something of a cure-all for the maladies affecting society in all the countries around the world. The idea of social capital is particularly concerned with the cultivation of good well, fellowship, sympathy, and social intercourse among those that make up a social unit. Most recently, the idea of social capital has been the work of Robert (1993, 2000) who has <b>lunched</b> <b>social</b> capital as a focus for research and policy discussion. Although, scholars concentrate their efforts on the issue of social capital and its impact on societies and nations, this paper examines social capital in relation to other notable contributions from Henri (1991, 1996) who made links among urban life, social fabric, space in time, and social capital. This paper aims to figure out the issues involved in public spaces as representational spaces, and it also shed the light on the role of public spaces in creating social capital. “The city must be a place of transactions, encounters, festivities. Its spaces must not only reflect these functions; they must provide a stage upon which they can be visibly enacted. ” This paper utilizes content analysis methodology as an approach to analyzing ideas generated in the field of social capital and theories in urban planning...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionLittle {{is known}} about {{influences}} on e-cigarette use among early adolescents. This study examined influences that have been previously {{found to be associated}} with gateway drug use in adolescents: demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, free <b>lunch),</b> <b>social</b> contextual influences of parents and peers, and executive function deficits (EF). MethodsA cross-sectional survey was administered to 410 7 th grade students from two diverse school districts in Southern California (M age;= 12. 4 years, 48. 3 % female, 34. 9 % on free lunch (low socioeconomic status), 45. 1 % White, 25. 4 % Hispanic/Latino, 14. 9 % Mixed/bi-racial.) Logistic regression analyses examined influences of demographic, parent e-cigarette ownership and peer use, and EF on lifetime e-cigarette, and gateway drug use (cigarette and/or alcohol use). ResultsLifetime use prevalence was 11. 0 % for e-cigarettes, 6. 8 % for cigarettes, and 38. 1 % for alcohol. Free lunch and age were marginally related to e-cigarette use (p<. 10). Parent e-cigarette ownership was associated with use of all substances, while peer use was associated with gateway drug use (p's<. 05 -. 001). EF deficits were associated with use of all substances five times more likely than others to use e-cigarettes and over twice as likely to use gateway drugs. ConclusionsE-cigarette and gateway drug use may have common underlying risk factors in early adolescence, including parent and peer modeling of substance use, as well as EF deficits. Future research is needed to examine longitudinal relationships of demographics, parent and peer modeling, and EF deficits to e-cigarette use in larger samples, trajectories of e-cigarette use compared to use of other substances, and the potential of EF skills training programs to prevent e-cigarette use...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT By Cleo M. Moody December 2010 Advisor:	Dr. Michael Addonizio Major:	Educational Leadership and Policy Studies Degree:	Doctor of Education Policy and {{practice}} regarding in-grade level retention {{and their effects}} on high school graduation rates and successful student academic outcomes have currently assumed great importance in the education reform debate. Further, the effectiveness of our public schools and the achievement of our students have implications that can affect individuals and the communities in which they live. Now, more than ever, individual economic success and economic growth depend crucially on academic achievement and human capital. The purpose {{of this research is}} to identify the determinants of student performance on the Michigan Education Assessment Program test and high school completion. Regression analysis was used to estimate a district-level model of student achievement. District policies regarding social promotion may be explicit or, more likely, implicit. In either case, this widespread practice raises important questions about in-grade retention and the requirements that must be met in order for a student to meet graduation and grade level promotional standards. The typical eighth grade student that has experienced two grade level retentions by all likelihood could turn sixteen years old during his eighth grade year. While other students that are their same age are acquiring driver 2 ̆ 7 s licenses, they are going to school with fourteen year olds. Retention and promotional policies along with high school completion rates will continue to have a substantial impact on the future of Michigan as well as society in general. The formation of sound policies and the improvement of Michigan 2 ̆ 7 s high school graduation rate require clear achievement benchmarks for Michigan 2 ̆ 7 s students and accurate calculations of high school graduation rates. The independent variable with the most significance in most cases was free and reduced <b>lunch.</b> <b>Social</b> supports, health care, and other non-school services must complement opportunities for educational growth for students and educational accountability and responsibility must be required of parents, educators, administrators, and policy makers if the goals of NCLB are to be achieved and the achievement gap narrowed...|$|R
