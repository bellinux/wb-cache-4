5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves. But one method, motion dazzle, requires rapidly moving bold patterns of contrasting stripes. Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Motion dazzle distorts speed perception and is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied. Since motion dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to <b>see</b> <b>when</b> stationary, {{there would be an}} evolutionary trade-off between motion dazzle and crypsis.|$|E
25|$|On {{top of the}} slug, {{behind the}} head, is the saddle-shaped mantle, and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right hand side) of the mantle is a {{respiratory}} opening, which is easy to <b>see</b> <b>when</b> open, but difficult to <b>see</b> <b>when</b> closed. This opening {{is known as the}} pneumostome.|$|E
25|$|Slightly Included {{category}} (SI) diamonds have noticeable inclusions {{that are}} easy to very easy for a trained grader to <b>see</b> <b>when</b> viewed under 10x magnification. The SI category is divided into two grades; SI1 denotes a higher clarity grade than SI2. These {{may or may not be}} noticeable to the naked eye.|$|E

25|$|Eleven {{presidents have}} lain in {{state in the}} Rotunda for public viewing, most {{recently}} Gerald Ford. The tomb meant for Washington stored the catafalque {{which is used to}} support coffins lying in state or honor in the Capitol. The catafalque is now on display in the Capitol Visitors Center for the general public to <b>see</b> <b>when</b> not in use.|$|E
25|$|This is {{an opera}} for {{children}} because {{it tries to}} recapture my own childhood. You <b>see,</b> <b>when</b> I was a child I lived in Italy, and in Italy we have no Santa Claus. I suppose that Santa Claus is much too busy with American children {{to be able to}} handle Italian children as well. Our gifts were brought to us by the Three Kings, instead.|$|E
25|$|In testing, it {{was found}} that the faint range-only signal became hard to <b>see</b> <b>when</b> the signal was noisy and jumping about. A final change added a slight fixed delay to the range-only signal, causing its trace to shift to the right. Now three {{distinct}} blips appeared on the elevation display, the range blip on the right, and the two elevation signals aligned vertically just to the left.|$|E

25|$|Very Slightly Included {{category}} (VS) diamonds have minor inclusions {{that are}} difficult to somewhat easy for a trained grader to <b>see</b> <b>when</b> viewed under 10x magnification. The VS category is divided into two grades; VS1 denotes a higher clarity grade than VS2. Typically the inclusions in VS diamonds are invisible without magnification; however, infrequently some VS2 inclusions may still be visible. An example would be on a large emerald cut diamond which has a small inclusion under the corner of the table.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the edges}} of south eastern towns, {{perfectly}} good agricultural land often remains uncultivated {{as a result of}} price distortions created by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Indeed, since around 2001 speculators have been buying Green Belt agricultural land, generally adjacent to built up areas, and selling it off in plots, persuading buyers that the government will have to weaken Green Belt protection to solve the housing crisis (see below). It is hard to <b>see</b> <b>when</b> such plots could come back into production.|$|E

25|$|Main Street, U.S.A. is {{patterned}} after a typical Midwest town {{of the early}} 20th century. It is a popular myth that Walt Disney derived inspiration from his boyhood town of Marceline, Missouri, but it was actually more closely based on Imagineer, Harper Goff's hometown of Fort Collins, Colorado. It is the first area guests <b>see</b> <b>when</b> they enter the park (if not entering by monorail), and is how guests reach Central Plaza. At the center of Disneyland and immediately North of Central Plaza stands Sleeping Beauty Castle, which provides entrance to Fantasyland.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of wild animals and birds have been {{observed}} in the area. The ones you might <b>see</b> <b>when</b> rambling around the countryside are wild boar, deer, foxes, hares and rabbits. The birds in your garden will include sparrows, swallows, starlings, crows, rooks, magpies, pigeons, finches and robins {{and you may be}} lucky enough to see flocks of migrating wild geese flying by. In the forest, you will hear - and sometimes see - owls and woodpeckers. Some species have suffered from hunting in recent years but there are now considerable efforts to protect flora and fauna. An area of the commune's forest is now a nature reserve.|$|E
25|$|His {{appointment}} was opposed by one Robert Crichton. Crichton was {{the nephew of}} George Crichton, Bishop of Dunkeld, and had been appointed coadjutor and successor to his uncle {{the year before the}} latter's death - without the consent of the Scottish government. The government thus ignored the appointment, placing Hamilton in charge. Robert litigated - unsuccessfully - against Hamilton in the Papal <b>see.</b> <b>When</b> Hamilton was translated, Crichton was still litigating. The dispute continued into 1553. When Mary of Guise took over the government from Châtellerault in 1554, she acknowledged Crichton's position and Campbell appears to have given up the bishopric. In this year, perhaps in compensation, he was made Keeper of the Privy Seal, a position he held until his death in 1562.|$|E

25|$|The {{work on the}} pediments {{lasted from}} 438 to 432BC, and the sculptures of the Parthenon pediments {{are some of the}} finest {{examples}} of classical Greek art. The figures are sculpted in natural movement with bodies full of vital energy that bursts through their flesh, as the flesh in turn bursts through their thin clothing. The thin chitons reveal the body underneath as the focus of the composition. The distinction between gods and humans is blurred in the conceptual interplay between the idealism and naturalism bestowed on the stone by the sculptors. Every statue in the west pediment has a fully completed back, which would have been impossible to <b>see</b> <b>when</b> the sculpture was on the temple; this indicates that the sculptors put great effort into accurately portraying the human body.|$|E
25|$|Fergus {{is upset}} when he can't find any baby {{pictures}} {{of him in the}} family album. He storms off to the attic and goes through the mirror. Mandy finds a picture of him as a baby, and puts it on the mirror for him to <b>see.</b> <b>When</b> Fergus comes back through the mirror it transforms him into the baby version of himself in the photograph. The children do {{not know what to do}} and send him back through where he is found by Violette. Constance tells the other that her mother found him and they try to get him back. They realise they must find a more recent picture of Fergus. They decide to use the picture which had been taken that morning. They return through the mirror and Fergus is restored to his teenage self, unaware of what had happened.|$|E
25|$|After an {{argument}} between Mercy and Fatboy, she pushes {{him and he}} falls onto a tree planted in memory of Trina Johnson (Sharon Duncan Brewster), breaking it. Worried that Trina's ex-husband Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) will be angry with them, they enlist Leon and Zsa Zsa's help to replace the tree. However, as they dig up the tree, they discover the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy when she says it is all she can <b>see</b> <b>when</b> she closes her eyes. She attends Lucas's Bible class and questions him about false prophets and a passage that states that anyone who questions a priest should be put to death, causing Lucas to make an excuse to leave because he cannot answer her. Grace asks Mercy {{to write a letter}} of apology to Lucas, but Mercy throws it away. Mercy and Fatboy play rounders but smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window, which Fatboy repairs. Mercy asks Dot if she can attend her church. When Zsa Zsa is left homeless, she asks to move in with Mercy and her grandmother.|$|E
