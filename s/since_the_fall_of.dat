5|$|Bradley's {{election}} in 1895 had {{marked the first}} time in Kentucky's history that the Commonwealth had elected a Republican governor. Angry Democrats, who had controlled the governorship <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the Whig Party, sought to regain what they had lost. Bitter divisions in the party led to a contentious convention that nominated William Goebel as the party candidate. A faction of the Democratic Party held a second nominating convention and chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee.|$|E

5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> {{communism}} many {{privately funded}} {{institutions of higher}} educations have been founded and their number is still increasing. Currently Białystok is home to one principal public university (University of Białystok) and two other public specialist universities (Białystok Technical University and Medical University of Białystok). Some institutions, such as Musical Academy in Białystok, are branches of their parent institutions in other cities, usually in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the Republic, the {{authority}} of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the Principate. The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch.|$|E

5|$|Ark Royal and {{the ships}} of Force H {{returned}} to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from {{the sinking of}} the battleship Bismarck, the war in the Mediterranean was going against the Allies. Greece and Crete had fallen to the Axis Powers, and the Afrika Korps was preparing to launch a final push into Egypt. Malta remained an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks, and could no longer be supplied from the east <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> Crete.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the end of}} the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (May 1943) and {{beginning}} of 1944, there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Jews hiding in the Ghetto ruins. The number of Robinsons after the Warsaw Uprising has been estimated at between several hundred and two thousand, spread across all the suburbs of Warsaw. Another source gives the number as between 400 and 1,000. Most of those hiding were Jewish, including some who had been in hiding <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the ghetto uprising, though a significant number were non-Jewish Poles. Unlike Szpilman, whose case was somewhat unrepresentative, most of those in hiding remained in medium-sized to large groups, often of mixed ethnicities. The majority of the Robinsons were men.|$|E

5|$|In 1904, the Brazilian Navy {{found itself}} well behind its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships {{had been ordered}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the Brazilian monarchy in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just {{concluded}} a fifteen-year naval arms race which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play {{an essential role in}} remaking the country into an international power.|$|E

The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch. The civil war of 69 had made it abundantly clear that real power in the Empire lay with control over the army. By the time Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Rome, any hope of restoring the Republic had long dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Somalia, from 1991 to 2006, {{is cited}} as a {{real-world}} example of a stateless society and legal system. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> Siad Barre's government in January 1991, {{there had been no}} central government in Somalia until the establishment of the Transitional National Government and its successor the Transitional Federal Government. Large areas of the country such as Puntland, Somaliland and Galmudug were internationally unrecognized and administered as autonomous regions of Somalia. The remaining areas, including the capital Mogadishu, were divided into smaller territories ruled by competing faction leaders. In many areas, there were no formal regulations or licensing requirements for businesses and individuals.|$|E
5|$|The cellar of the {{building}} contained a barber's shop, a grocery store and a butcher shop. The remaining premises were used as apartments for rent. When Dimitri Orlov died in 1911 while building a railroad in the Russian Far East, his widow, left with five children, had to sell off the house to pay her family's debts. In 1983, renovation works were started on {{the building}} to convert it into a hotel. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet Union in 1991, various reconstruction works have been largely unsuccessful.

5|$|The first commercially {{released}} domestic {{feature film}} {{to deal with}} the events of 1965, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was a commercial and critical success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers– although in many cases audiences were required to see the film. The film was used as a propaganda vehicle by the New Order government until its collapse; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students. <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> Suharto in 1998, such use of the film has become less common. Although the film's artistic aspects remain well-received, its misrepresentation of history has been criticised.|$|E

25|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>falling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uprising, the Japanese {{became more}} merciless and {{conducting}} regular reprisals {{with the local}} inhabitants in North Borneo {{could no longer afford}} another uprising as the Japanese became so active in surveillance. Captain Lionel Matthews, an officer of Australian Army Signals Corps who was held as a prisoner of war by the Japanese in Elopura from August 1942 until March 1944 directed an underground intelligence organisation to get medical supplies, food and money into the camp, as well to setting up a radio link with the outside world. He collected information to relay to these contacts which then passed to Chinese-Filipino traders and helped organise prisoner escapes with American-supported guerrillas in the Philippines. Although this was soon discovered by the Japanese, he continued to display his loyalty towards his services by not revealing anything about the movement while been tortured until he was executed.|$|R
5|$|The {{reality of}} Domitian's autocracy was further {{highlighted}} by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of {{time away from the}} capital. Although the Senate's power had been in decline <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was. Until the completion of the Flavian Palace on the Palatine Hill, the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and Illyricum, conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|This work {{maintains}} a heavy {{importance in the}} Art History world, as {{it is widely believed}} to be the first painting, <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> Rome (ca. 476 AD), to use Scientific Linear One Point Perspective, or, all the orthogonals point to one vanishing point, in this case, Christ. Also, it is one of the first paintings that does away with the use of a head-cluster. A technique employed by earlier Proto-Renaissance artists, such as Giotto or Duccio. If you were to walk into the painting, you could walk around Jesus Christ, in the semicircle created, and back out the painting again with ease.|$|E

Reform <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 1998 <b>fall</b> <b>of</b> Suharto {{has led to}} some recognition of these 'semiformal' arrangements. This complicates the ambitious development agenda of a city like Bandung, pitting two sides with seemingly conflicting interests against each other: the urban poor and the municipal government.
