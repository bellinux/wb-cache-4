In 1941, he faced Babe Ruth {{in a series}} of charity golf matches at courses outside New York, Boston and Detroit and won two out of three. At the 1947 Old-Timers' Day game in Yankee Stadium, he warned catcher Benny Bengough to move back, claiming he was rusty and hadn't swung a bat in almost 20 years. Bengough accordingly <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> avoid being struck by Cobb's backswing. Having repositioned the catcher, Cobb cannily laid down a perfect bunt in front of the plate and easily beat the throw from a surprised Bengough.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of subcategories of modern deism, {{including}} monodeism (this being the default standard concept of deism), polydeism, pandeism, spiritual deism, process deism, Christian deism, scientific deism, and humanistic deism. Some deists see design in nature and purpose in the universe and in their lives (Prime Designer). Others see God and the universe in a co-creative process (Prime Motivator). Some deists view God in classical terms and see God as observing humanity but not directly intervening in our lives (Prime Observer), while others see God as a subtle and persuasive spirit who created the world, but then <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> observe (Prime Mover).|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of February 25, 1855, Baker entered the Stanwix Hall saloon with Jim Turner and Paudeen McLaughlin to confront Poole having {{threatened}} Morrissey with a gun during an argument only hours before. Walking up to Poole, Baker spat {{in his face and}} then pulled a Colt revolver but accidentally shot himself in the arm as he <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> draw the weapon. Dropping to the floor, he did manage to fire a second shot hitting Poole in the leg and similarly incapacitating him. Both men eventually got up from the floor, however Baker managed to get to Poole first and pistol whipped him back to the ground. Baker then shot Poole twice, once in the stomach and the second in his chest, and left the saloon.|$|E

25|$|Despite those controversies and the {{apparent}} {{lessons learned from}} the Vietnam War, some theorists recognized a significant problem with Huntington's theory insofar as it appears to question the notion of a separate, apolitical professional military. While there is little argument that separate civilian and military worlds exist, there is significant debate about the proper interaction between the two. As discussed above, Huntington proposed that the ideal arrangement was one whereby civilian political leaders provided objective control to the military leadership and then <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> permit the experts in violence to do what was most effective. He further stated that the most dangerous arrangement was one whereby civilian leaders intruded extensively in the military world, creating a situation whereby the military leadership was not politically neutral and security of the nation was thus threatened both by an ineffective military and by provoking the military to avoid taking orders.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} {{was carried out}} by a 40- to 50-person group that would later be part of Capcom Production Studio 4. Director Hideki Kamiya led the team, which was composed of newer Capcom employees and over half of the staff from the original Resident Evil. In the initial stages of development, producer Mikami often had creative disagreements with Kamiya, and tried to influence the team with his own direction. He eventually <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> an overseeing role as producer, and only demanded to be shown the current build once a month. Believing the game's assets to be good individually, but not yet satisfactory as a whole, Mikami expected that everything would coalesce in the three {{months leading up to the}} projected May 1997 release date. Shortly thereafter, however, Resident Evil 1.5 was scrapped at a development stage of 60–80 percent. Mikami later explained that the game would not have reached the desired quality in the aforementioned period, and especially frowned upon the gameplay and locations for being [...] "dull and boring".|$|E
500|$|Now on foot, {{the knights}} drew swords and {{returned}} to battle, Le Gris again proving stronger than his opponent and slowly gaining the upper hand. After several minutes of engagement, Carrouges slipped and Le Gris was able to stab his rival through the right thigh. As the crowd gasped and murmured, Le Gris <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> view his opponent's injury and Carrouges desperately counter-attacked, wrestling Le Gris to the ground. Le Gris' heavy armour prevented him from regaining his feet and Carrouges repeatedly stabbed at his floored opponent, his blows denting but not puncturing the thick plate steel. Realising that his sword was inadequate, Carrouges straddled Le Gris and used the handle of his dagger to smash the lock holding Le Gris' faceplate in position. Even as his opponent struggled beneath him, Carrouges tore the plate off and demanded that Le Gris admit his guilt. Le Gris refused and cried out [...] "In the name of God and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent". Infuriated, Carrouges drove his dagger through Le Gris' neck, killing him instantly.|$|E

500|$|As {{his horse}} faltered and collapsed, Le Gris was thrown off {{and lost his}} axe. Undaunted, he rose and drew his longsword, turning to meet Carrouges who was already {{advancing}} on him, sword also drawn. Again the combatants traded blows, their weapons the only sounds heard in the silent battleground. Again, Le Gris' superior strength gave him an advantage, pushing Carrouges back before thrusting his blade through his opponent's thigh. As the crowd murmured, Le Gris made a fatal mistake; withdrawing his weapon, he <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> watch his wounded enemy and was thus off balance when the desperate Carrouges threw himself forwards, wrestling Le Gris {{to the ground and}} hacking at him with his own longsword. Although Le Gris' plate armour was too thick to allow Carrouges' weapon to penetrate, it was also so heavy that he could not regain his feet with Carrouges on top of him. Stranded on the ground, Le Gris struggled as Carrouges straddled him and used his sword to smash open the lock on Le Gris' faceplate. As the crowd watched in silence, Carrouges shouted in Le Gris' exposed face for him to confess his crime before death or face hell. Le Gris replied so all could hear, [...] "In the name of God, and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent of the crime". Enraged, Carrouges drew his misericordia and thrust it through Le Gris' throat, killing him instantly.|$|E
500|$|As the 2017 clay court swing commenced, Federer <b>stepped</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{rest and}} skip the entire clay season {{to focus on}} the grass and hard court seasons, as well as to prolong his career. Djokovic and Murray {{returned}} from their respective elbow injuries to join alongside Nadal in competing in the 2017 Monte-Carlo Masters. Both Djokovic and Murray lost in the early stages while Nadal claimed the 2017 Monte-Carlo Masters title, which saw him becoming the first male player to historically winning a single tournament 10 times and simultaneously winning a new record most clay court titles at 50, surpassing Guillermo Vilas's 49. Nadal and Murray then both participated in Barcelona. Murray lost in the semi-finals to Dominic Thiem, while Nadal beat Thiem to win his tenth Barcelona title. This was the second week in a row in which Nadal became another tournament's 10-time champion, subsequently becoming the only male tennis player to do so for two separate ATP tournaments each, one of the ATP Masters 1000 series and the other being of the ATP 500 series. In the 2017 Madrid Open, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray competed for the title. Murray lost early while Nadal and Djokovic contested the semi-final, which Nadal won in 2 sets. Nadal then {{went on to win the}} Madrid open, again defeating Thiem in the final to claim a record 5th Madrid Open title and equal Djokovic's record of 30 ATP Masters 1000 series titles. In Rome, Murray's poor form continued, with him losing in the second round to Fabio Fognini. Nadal's unbeaten run on clay during 2017 came to an end in the quarter-finals as he was beaten by Thiem in their third meeting of the season. Djokovic, meanwhile, continued his slight improvement in form, making the final after thrashing Thiem in the semi-finals for the loss of only one game. However, he then lost the final in straight sets to Alexander Zverev Jr. where he showed that lack of continuity was still present.|$|E

The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk.
