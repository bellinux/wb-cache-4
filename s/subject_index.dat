5|$|Melvil Dewey (1851–1931) was an American {{librarian}} and self-declared reformer. He was {{a founding}} member of the American Library Association and can be credited with the promotion of card systems in libraries and business. He developed the ideas for his library classification system in 1873 while working at Amherst College library. He applied the classification to the books in that library, until in 1876 he had a first version of the classification. In 1876, he published the classification in pamphlet form with the title A Classification and <b>Subject</b> <b>Index</b> for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a Library.|$|E
5|$|The United States Code Congressional and Administrative News (U.S.C.C.A.N.) is a West Group {{publication}} that collects selected congressional and administrative materials {{for publication in}} a single resource. U.S.C.C.A.N. {{was first published in}} 1941 with the 1st Session of the 77th Congress and has been published with every session of Congress since. U.S.C.C.A.N. is published in monthly pamphlets that contain a cumulative <b>subject</b> <b>index</b> and cumulative Table of Laws Enacted in addition to the selected documents. The pamphlets are then reissued in bound volumes after each session of Congress concludes. Among other documents, U.S.C.C.A.N. publishes the full text of new federal laws, selected committee reports from the House and Senate, signing statements, presidential proclamations, executive orders, reorganization plans, President's messages, federal regulations, proposed constitutional amendments, federal court rules, and sentencing guidelines all arranged in chronological order.|$|E

His son William Edwin Hamilton brought the Elements of Quaternions, a hefty volume of 762 pages, to publication in 1866. As copies ran short, a second edition was prepared by Charles Jasper Joly, when the book was split into two volumes, the first appearing 1899 and the second in 1901.

25|$|Before Wright, the library's {{catalogue}} evolved through annual addenda to its 1842 founding catalogue. The {{practice was}} unsatisfactory, and Wright concentrated on producing a proper modern catalogue. The first edition, compiled by Wright and Christopher Purnell, was printed in 1903; {{the second in}} 1913–14. It contained 1626 pages; supplementary volumes were printed in 1920 and 1929. The catalogue was arranged in six volumes {{for the general public}} and in 38 folio volumes for daily internal use. In addition, Wright published a companion <b>Subject</b> <b>Index</b> (1909, 1923, 1938). His catalogues earned reputation for scrupulous research and attribution of anonymous and pseudonymous publications, and became a standard reference source for British and overseas librarians. His catalogue system forms the foundation of present-day electronic database.|$|E

500|$|The {{completely}} revised {{second edition}} of Lemurs of Madagascar was reviewed {{in detail in}} the American Journal of Primatology by Stacey Tecot. [...] Each chapter, section, and appendix was thoroughly summarized, and as with the reviews of previous editions, the chapter on subfossil lemurs was noted {{as one of the}} more [...] "fascinating" [...] parts of the book, particularly due to its colorful and informative illustrations. [...] Although the book received only praise, Tecot did suggest two additions for the next edition: the need for information about the processes of island biogeography and expansion on captive conservation programs aside from the Duke Lemur Center, particularly at the Lemur Conservation Foundation and St. Catherines Island. [...] A <b>subject</b> <b>index</b> was also recommended, along with better referencing of the figures and illustrations. [...] Otherwise, the book was praised as being better than other field guides due to its inclusion of seemingly obscure yet important details, such as how to get to lemur watching sites, travel time, where to stay, mentions of lesser-known sites, listings of species to be seen, best times to observe, and even, among other things, the number of habituated lemur groups in each area. [...] Tecot noted that the lemur checklist promoted competitive lemur watching, similar to birdwatching, and that the color-coded sections assisted in [...] "on-the-fly species identification." [...] Although very satisfied with the information provided for each species, Tecot commended the promise made in this edition to more extensively cover the published literature in the upcoming third edition. [...] Like its predecessor, the second edition was praised as an excellent tool for ecotourists and researchers. [...] It was also noted for its attempt to promote ecotourism as a conservation strategy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Structured {{semantic}} metadata about unstructured web documents can {{be created}} using automatic <b>subject</b> <b>indexing</b> methods, avoiding laborious manual indexing. A succesful automatic <b>subject</b> <b>indexing</b> tool for the web should work with texts in multiple languages and be independent of the domain of discourse of the documents and controlled vocabularies. However, analyzing text written in a highly in ected language requires word form normalization that goes beyond rule-based stemming algorithms. We have tested the state-of-the art automatic indexing tool Maui on Finnish texts using three stemming and lemmatization algorithms and tested it with documents and vocabularies of di erent domains. Both of the lemmatization algorithms we tested performed signi cantly better than a rule-based stemmer, and the <b>subject</b> <b>indexing</b> quality {{was found to be}} comparable to that of human indexers. ...|$|R

Horn described her goals for this project in the Art:21 documentary series, [...] "“In the case of You Are the Weather, I was curious to see if I could elicit a place from her face, almost like a landscape. Not in the literal sense, but how close those identities were.” [...] Notes written by Horn about this work were included in the catalogue that accompanied Horn's 2009 traveling retrospective Roni Horn aka Roni Horn. The two-volume book included a <b>Subject</b> <b>Index</b> that brought together writings and reflections on works, themes, titles and topics related to Horn's practice. About You are the Weather, Horn writes, [...] "The way this work is shot and installed, the viewer is voyeurized by the view. You are surrounded by a woman who is staring at you." [...] Curator Donna De Salvo continues this suggestively erotic interplay between subject and object in one of her own contributions to the <b>Subject</b> <b>Index,</b> [...] "You are the Weather depicts a living, rather than an inert, thing. Horn complicated the notion of surface and skin. This treatment of the face smudges the distinction between object and subject. Just who is the 'you'? Of course all answers are completely dependent upon who chooses to inhabit the role of 'you.' It's a discovery process, which in some ways reflects the making of the work itself. The subtle and not so subtle difference in these photographs make it difficult for a viewer to dismiss any one image as being identical to the one next to it. 'You' have to look hard." ...|$|E

The aspects of GRIS method relevant to bibliographic and authority data recording and display are considered: the structural peculiarities of subject strings and the authority control of indexing terms. Authority control is derived from UNIMARC/Authorities international format: access point management is not organized according to their function in the bibliographic records (author or <b>subject</b> <b>indexing),</b> but rather according to the type of entity they represent or refer to.

40|$|Academic {{libraries}} {{are still}} working based on the traditional documentation techniques of cataloguing and indexing. The research about subject access in OPACs has demonstrated that inadequate indexing policies have negative influence on the way users search the catalogs: <b>subject</b> <b>indexing</b> and retrieval have a direct correspondence. Searching by subject in bibliographic catalogs must be, as much as possible, a successful experience for the users, and consistent <b>subject</b> <b>indexes</b> contribute to a more efficient information retrieval. The main objective {{of this research was}} to evidence the existing difficulties in <b>subject</b> <b>indexing</b> with alphabetic languages, once the normative instruments and tools supporting the process are diffuse and hard to use for many professionals. So, firstly we wanted to know if the indexing practice in the Portuguese polytechnic libraries was according to adequate standards; secondly, we verified the quality (through a sample analysis) of subject headings in the bibliographic catalogs of five libraries, enabling to evidence existing weaknesses. These two observations have demonstrated that inadequate indexing procedures (first) conduct to inconsistent <b>subject</b> <b>indexes</b> (second). Trying to ease up that complex task for professionals with more difficulties, we propose the use of a simplified method, mainly representing the three basic phases of the indexing process...|$|R
