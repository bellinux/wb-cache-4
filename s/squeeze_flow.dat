These results were compared with the Stefan, perfect slip, and Rady-Laun partial slip equations and found not to match exactly, but best approximated the Stefan equation. The results also show that squeezing force as a function of squeezing speed matched predictions by Stefan, perfect slip, and Rady-Laun equations, while force as a function of viscosity for these equations overestimates the force at high viscosities. <b>Squeeze</b> <b>flow</b> behavior of zeolite suspensions was also considered. The results matched the force vs. gap of the Newtonian fluids tested. The relative viscosities of the suspensions determined by <b>squeeze</b> <b>flow</b> matched the shear viscosity measurements at less than 15 % vol concentrations.

Electrorheological (ER) fluids were then examined under electric field in <b>squeeze</b> <b>flow</b> using constant volume conditions to eliminate the “sealing effect” that prevented knowing the concentration of particles in the fluid.

40|$|The {{rheological}} {{characterization of}} semi-liquid foods has encountered two major difficulties: (1) {{the separation of}} a layer of fluid of different viscosity at {{the wall of the}} rheometer (slippage) and (2) the disruption of the internal structure of the specimen when inserted into the equipment. ^ The increasing utilization of lubricated <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> viscometry in food industry has not only been determined by its relative simplicity but mainly by its ability to overcome the above mentioned problems. ^ Although the mathematical models to describe the lubricated <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> of fluids have been extensively considered, several aspects and possible applications of this methodology remain unstudied. ^ Therefore, this research was focused on evaluating the effect of test conditions, especially the displacement rate, on the measured rheological parameters of several semi-liquid food products. A considerable discrepancy was noted between the observed rate effects and those predicted using a pseudoplastic (power law) model. Consequently, a alternative model was proposed and the effect of the deformation rate was described using the following empirical relationship (Fv 1 − FR) /(Fv 2 − FR) = (V 1 /V 2) m. ^ Since lubricated <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> viscometry barely produces a significant disruption of the sample, it was used to quantify the structural damage caused to a specimen subjected to several disruption mechanisms such as compression and stirring. As expected, compression of the specimen prior to its testing had very little effect on the specimen consistency which supports the view that there was little friction between the Teflon® coated plates and the samples. On the other hand, shearing caused a measurable loss of consistency. ^ In order to study the recovery of the sample consistency after disruption a rest period was introduced and the rheological parameters of the treated samples were determined. Different levels of recovery were observed for different specimens, however in none of the cases a full recovery of the original consistency was observed in the time span considered (1 – 3 hours). ^ Finally, a relation between the instrumental value of consistency obtained using lubricated <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> and sensory perception was estimated. It was established that <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> is more sensitive to textural changes sensory evaluation and that the methodology was appropriate to determine thresholds for sensory detection. ...|$|R

When the shear flow is applied, it is easy to carry out the simulation with relatively small number of particles because of the periodic boundary condition.

The kinematics are {{described by a}} power law velocity profile. Wagner 2 ̆ 7 s model was chosen for its success in analyzing transient viscometric <b>flows.</b> <b>Squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> experiments were performed on well characterized aqueous solutions of polyacrylamide. The <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> apparatus is designed around the INSTRON machine. The crosshead provided a constant downward motion to a circular disk attached to it, while the bottom plate contained a cavity where the test fluid was squeezed. The squeezing force was measured by a sensitive load cell attached to the top disk. ^ Experiments were conducted for the Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids at different squeezing speeds and initial gap thickness. The Newtonian data was quite accurately described by Stefan 2 ̆ 7 s equation, suggesting {{the validity of the}} experimental design. In the case of viscoelastic fluids, the experimental squeezing force overshot the purely viscous predictions of the power law model. This behavior resembles the stress overshoot observed during onset of constant shear rate flow. The mathematical model presented in this thesis was able to describe the experimental squeezing force for viscoelastic fluids quite adequately, especially in the low to moderate shear rate region. The model was also able to predict the time at which the normalized force (normalized with respect to the power law predictions of that instant) reached its maximum value. The success of the model was limited by the range of validity of Wagner 2 ̆ 7 s rheological model, especially at higher shear rates. In agreement with earlier work, these experiments suggest an increased load bearing capacity of polymer loaded lubricants, due to stress overshoot. The range of shear rates that can be studied with this apparatus could be increased by using a more sensitive displacement transducer. ^ A qualitative understanding of the dynamics of viscoelastic <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> with slip at the wall, was obtained by analyzing the flow using Wagner 2 ̆ 7 s rheological model and Newtonian kinematics. Even for viscoelastic fluids, boundary slip reduces the squeezing force substantially, suggesting that the introduction of slip, due to hot wall temperatures, may affect adversely the load bearing capacity of lubricants. ^ The growth of bubbles in a viscoelastic medium presents a situation where there is squeezing of interstitial fluid with slip at the bubble-fluid interface. This flow was analyzed by numerical solution of a modified Rayleigh equation. The analysis suggests that elasticity enhances the growth of the bubbles during both isolated growth and strong interaction. ^ One important area of future work should involve a detailed study of the observed stress relaxation of viscoelastic fluids after cessation of <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow.</b> This would have ramifications in characterizing the elastic strain recovery of polymer melts. The finite element analysis of the hydrodynamics of viscoelastic <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> should also be pursued so that the assumptions made in the present analysis can be relaxed.

40|$|In <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> viscometry the {{presence}} or absence of friction between the specimen and the plates has a dramatic effect on the flow curve characteristics. It is therefore proposed that the method can be used to test whether a given surface, with a particular rough finish, is effective to eliminate slip of a given self-lubricating food. The concept is demonstrated with experimental data of commercial samples of mayonnaise and mustard, which were pressed between pairs of parallel polished and rough metal plates in an imperfect <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> array, and their force height relationship was recorded. In all the cases, the absolute magnitude of slope of the log-force versus log height plot was smaller than one. This shows that these two products are self-lubricating to such an extent that roughening of the plates surface, at least to the extent used in this work, can be an ineffective means to avoid slip. Similar results have been previously reported in three different kinds of tomato products, which suggests that the problem may not be limited to food emulsions...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>squeezing</b> <b>flow</b> {{between two}} large parallel plates by transforming the basic governing equations {{of the first}} grade fluid to an ordinary nonlinear differential equation using the stream functions ur(r,z,t) =(1 /r) (∂ψ/∂z) and uz(r,z,t) =−(1 /r) (∂ψ/∂r) and a transformation ψ(r,z) =r 2 F(z). The velocity profiles are investigated through various analytical techniques like Adomian decomposition method, new iterative method, homotopy perturbation, optimal homotopy asymptotic method, and differential transform method...|$|R
