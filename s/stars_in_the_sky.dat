5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a bright nova that {{appeared}} halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as bright as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, {{is one of the}} hottest bright <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> with a surface temperature of 37,500 K. It {{is one of the more}} massive stars, being between 26 and 32 solar masses, and is 330,000 times as luminous as our Sun.|$|E
5|$|William Herschel was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to attempt to determine the distribution of <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> During the 1780s he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight. From this he deduced {{that the number of}} stars steadily increased toward one side of the sky, {{in the direction of the}} Milky Way core. His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction. In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are also physical companions that form binary star systems.|$|E

5|$|It was {{conceived}} and produced by Coldplay. Originally, {{it had been}} intended for the whole band {{to appear in the}} video, in a sunny setting. Champion's mother's funeral was held {{on the day of the}} shooting, so it was decided that only Martin would appear in the video, which was also the immediate explanation of his mood during this part. The weather also opposed the original plan, with harsh winds and rain instead of the sunny day that had been envisioned. It had also been originally intended for there to be moving <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> as if in a time-lapse. The directors agreed that the moving stars would distract the focus of the video from Martin. The plan of time advancing was kept. The video begins with the beach being somewhat dark until sunlight arrives nearly at the video's midway point.|$|E
25|$|From the 1720s {{increasing}} interest {{was shown in}} these features. In 1796, for example, La Tour d'Auvergne attributed them to druidic gatherings. In 1805, A. Maudet de Penhoët claimed they represented <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{constellation}} Virgo is {{a specific}} constellation of <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> hence the process of forming Virgo cannot be an operational definition, since it is historical and not repeatable. Nevertheless, the process whereby we locate Virgo in the sky is repeatable, so in this way, Virgo is operationally defined. In fact, Virgo can have any number of definitions (although we can never prove {{that we are talking}} about the same Virgo), and any number may be operational.|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, interplanetary {{scintillation}} {{refers to}} random {{fluctuations in the}} intensity of radio waves of celestial origin, on the timescale of a few seconds. It {{is analogous to the}} twinkling one sees looking at <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> at night, but in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum rather than the visible one. Interplanetary scintillation is the result of radio waves traveling through fluctuations in the density of the electron and protons that make up the solar wind.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} color descriptions {{are traditional}} in astronomy, and represent colors {{relative to the}} mean color of an A-class star, which {{is considered to be}} white. The apparent color descriptions are what the observer would see if trying to describe the stars under a dark sky without aid to the eye, or with binoculars. However, most <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> except the brightest ones, appear white or bluish white to the unaided eye because they are too dim for color vision to work. Red supergiants are cooler and redder than dwarfs of the same spectral type, and stars with particular spectral features such as carbon stars may be far redder than any black body.|$|E

25|$|According to halakha (Jewish {{religious}} law), Shabbat {{is observed}} {{from a few}} minutes before sunset on Friday evening until the appearance of three <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> on Saturday night. Shabbat is ushered in by lighting candles and reciting a blessing. Traditionally, three festive meals are eaten: in the evening, in the early afternoon, and late in the afternoon. The evening meal typically begins with a blessing called kiddush and another blessing recited over two loaves of challah. Shabbat is closed the following evening with a havdalah blessing. Shabbat is a festive day when Jews exercise their freedom from the regular labors of everyday life. It offers an opportunity to contemplate the spiritual aspects of life and to spend time with family.|$|E
25|$|Carina {{is known}} for its namesake nebula, NGC 3372, {{discovered}} by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751, which contains several nebulae. The Carina Nebula overall is an extended emission nebula approximately 8,000 light-years away and 300 light-years wide that includes vast star-forming regions. It has an overall magnitude of 8.0 and an apparent diameter of over 2 degrees. Its central region is called the Keyhole, or the Keyhole Nebula. This was described in 1847 by John Herschel, and likened to a keyhole by Emma Converse in 1873. The Keyhole is about seven light-years wide and is composed mostly of ionized hydrogen, with two major star-forming regions. The Homunculus Nebula is a planetary nebula {{visible to the naked eye}} that is being ejected by the erratic luminous blue variable star Eta Carinae, the most massive visible star known. Eta Carinae is so massive that it has reached the theoretical upper limit for the mass of a star and is therefore unstable. It {{is known for}} its outbursts; in 1840 it briefly became one of the brightest <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> due to a particularly massive outburst, which largely created the Homunculus Nebula. Because of this instability and history of outbursts, Eta Carinae is considered a prime supernova candidate for the next several hundred thousand years because it has reached the end of its estimated million-year life span.|$|E

500|$|... "Seize the Night" [...] has {{a strong}} orchestral {{foundation}} underneath the lead vocals and a choir. A duet with Jennifer Hudson, [...] "The Future Ain't What It Used to Be" [...] is a pessimistic song based upon the myth that Pandora closed her jar before allowing [...] "hope" [...] to escape (the song first appeared on the only album performed by female group Pandora's Box). The lyrics reveal the hopelessness of the past (Were there ever any <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky?)</b> and the future (There's nothing so sad as a tomorrow gone bad).|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Star" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{recorded}} by American singer Madonna for her eponymous debut studio album (1983). It was released as the fourth single from the album on September 8, 1983 by Sire Records. [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was produced by Reggie Lucas. However, during recording, Madonna was not impressed by Lucas' version. She called her then-boyfriend John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to remix the track according to her ideas. [...] "Lucky Star" [...] is a medium-paced dance track and combines the heavy beats of a drum {{with the sounds of}} a guitar played in a high riff. The lyrics juxtapose the male body with the heavenly <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
500|$|Navigators {{often use}} star charts to {{identify}} a star by its position relative to other stars. [...] References like the Nautical Almanac and The American Practical Navigator provide four star charts, covering different portions of the celestial sphere. [...] Two of these charts are azimuthal equidistant projections of {{the north and south}} poles. [...] The other two cover the equatorial region of the celestial sphere, from the declination of 30° south to 30° north. [...] The two equatorial charts are mercator projections, one for the eastern hemisphere of the celestial sphere and one for the western hemisphere. [...] Note that unlike familiar maps, east is shown to the left and west is shown to the right. [...] With this orientation, the navigator can hold the star chart overhead, and the arrangement of the stars on the chart will resemble the <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{example is}} the {{position}} of a <b>star</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> <b>The</b> <b>star</b> is the point of interest, the reference plane is the horizon or the surface of the sea, and the reference vector points north. The azimuth is the angle between the north vector and the perpendicular projection of the star down onto the horizon.|$|R
500|$|For a {{traditionally}} trained navigator, these inputs include physical {{signals from the}} sea, skies, and stars, memory signals from his knowledge of star, swell, and wind compasses; and cultural knowledge recorded in chants, dances, and stories. Examples of physical signals include the color, temperature, and taste (salinity) of seawater; floating plant debris; sightings of land-based seabirds flying out to fish; cloud type, color, and movement; wind direction, speed, and temperature; the direction and nature of ocean swells and waves; the position of <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and his estimation of the speed, current set, and leeway of his sailing craft. The [...] "compass" [...] he carried was not magnetic but a mental model of where islands are located and the star points that one could use to navigate between them. This mental model would have taken years of study to build; dances, chants (rong), and stories help him to recall complex relationships of geography and location. The stars give him highly reliable position information when visible, but navigators such as Mau managed to keep their position and tracks in mind even when blocked by clouds, using other references such as wind and swell as proxies.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from sexual}} themes, Miguel wrote about {{conversational}} and existential topics. When writing [...] "Pussy Is Mine", he drew on his sexual {{behavior as a}} single man and [...] "moments of power and vulnerability" [...] with a sexually promiscuous woman. Miguel originally wrote [...] "Where's the Fun in Forever" [...] with Alicia Keys for her 2012 album Girl on Fire at a recording studio in Jamaica. He conceived the song while spending time with Keys {{on the roof of}} the studio, which he recounted in an interview for MTV News: [...] "ll I had was this amazing blanket of <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and the sound of waves in the distance, great vibe ... So here I am trying to be creative for Alicia and it just dawned on me: Well, what if we did live forever? Could we have accomplished all of these amazing things? Would we have come so far? ... Would we have come up with all these theories or built all of these amazing, amazing architectural beautiful things ... or would we have been lazy?" [...] The album's title track was written by Miguel while he was working on All I Want Is You. In reaction to Jive's request for more conventional R songs, he composed the song with unusual lyrics and without a hook, chorus, or form.|$|E
500|$|... "Yellow" [...] {{was written}} in [...] Rockfield studio in Wales called the Quadrangle, where Coldplay began working on their debut album, Parachutes. One night after {{finishing}} recording [...] "Shiver", the band took a break and {{went out of the}} studio. Outside, there were few lights on and the <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> were visible and [...] "just amazing", according to the song's co-producer, Ken Nelson. He told the band to look at the stars, which they did. Lead singer Chris Martin was inspired by the sight and the song's main melody, consisting of a chord pattern, popped into his head. At first, Martin did not take it seriously [...] "as he relayed the tune {{to the rest of the}} band in his worst Neil Young impersonation voice". Martin has said, [...] "The song had the word 'stars' and that seemed like a word you should sing in a Neil Young voice." [...] The melody [...] "started off a lot slower", according to drummer Will Champion, and it sounded like a Neil Young song. Not long after, despite not taking the song seriously, Martin's idea worked out when he had developed the tempo of the verse. When guitarist Jonny Buckland started playing it and supplemented it with his ideas, they had created the riff, [...] "and it sort of got a bit heavier".|$|E
