5|$|The {{synthesis}} of unsaturated fatty acids involves a desaturation reaction, whereby a double bond is {{introduced into the}} fatty acyl chain. For example, in humans, the desaturation of <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 produces oleic acid. The doubly unsaturated fatty acid linoleic acid {{as well as the}} triply unsaturated α-linolenic acid cannot be synthesized in mammalian tissues, and are therefore essential fatty acids and must be obtained from the diet.|$|E

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of ground nuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) {{commonly known as}} peanuts, is an important consideration when a new variety is being released. The composition impacts on nutrition and, importantly, self-life of peanut products. To select for suitable breeding material, {{it was necessary to}} develop a rapid, non-derstructive and cost-efficient method. Near infrared spectroscopy was chosen as that methodology. Calibrations were developed for two major fatty-acid components, oleic and linoleic acids and two minor components, palmitic and <b>stearic</b> <b>acids,</b> as well as total oil content. Partial least squares models indicated a high level of precision with a squared multiple correlation coefficient of greater than 0. 90 for each constitutent. Standard errors for prediction for oleic, linoleic, palmitic, <b>stearic</b> <b>acids</b> and total oil content were 6. 4 %, 4. 5 %, 0. 8 %, 0. 9 % and 1. 3 % respectively.

6000|$|... [Footnote 2: Page 17. The fat or tallow {{consists}} of a chemical combination of fatty acids with glycerine. The lime unites with the palmitic, oleic, and <b>stearic</b> <b>acids,</b> and separates the glycerine. After washing, the insoluble lime soap is decomposed with hot dilute sulphuric acid. The melted fatty acids thus rise as an oil to the surface, when they are decanted. They are again washed and cast into thin plates, which, when cold, are placed between layers of cocoa-nut matting, and submitted to intense hydraulic pressure. In this way the soft oleic acid is squeezed out, whilst the hard palmitic and <b>stearic</b> <b>acids</b> remain. These are further purified by pressure at a higher temperature, and washing in warm dilute sulphuric acid, when {{they are ready to}} be made into candles.

25|$|Being inexpensively {{available}} and chemically benign, <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> finds many niche applications, for example, in making plaster castings from a plaster piece mold or waste mold and {{in making the}} mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered <b>stearic</b> <b>acid</b> is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form {{a thin layer of}} calcium stearate, which functions as a release agent. When reacted with zinc it forms zinc stearate, which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning. In compressed confections, it is used as a lubricant to keep the tablet from sticking to the die.|$|E

40|$|Vegetable {{oils and}} animal fats are {{increasingly}} popular base material to produce environmentally friendly lubricants. This is a renewable and easily biodegradable {{in the natural}} environment material. The main disadvantage of vegetable oils and animal fats as raw materials and its lubricants is pour oxidation stability. There are already {{a wide range of}} environmentally friendly lubricants in the market, while the variety of greases offer is not so high. This research aims to explore the properties of prepared compositions of lubricating greases produced from rapeseed oil and lard, modifying them with monoglycerides, <b>stearic</b> and oleic <b>acids.</b> The plastic properties (penetration) and oxidation influence on tribological and corrosive properties of these compositions were studied. It was found that modifying rapeseed oil and lard with monoglycerides, oleic and <b>stearic</b> <b>acids</b> a few lubricating compositions of NLGI grades can be achieved: soft or very soft rapeseed oil based greases and medium or nearly hard consistency lard based compositions. The oxidation studies showed that it decreases the tribological properties of base and monoglycerides modified lubricants. Oxidation has greater negative impact on lard and lard based compositions. Oleic and <b>stearic</b> <b>acids</b> reduces or completely eliminates the negative influence of oxidation. Corrosion studies have shown that both fresh and oxidized lubricant compositions have no significant affect on copper strip corrosion. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
