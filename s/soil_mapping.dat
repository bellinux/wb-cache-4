40|$|Legacy <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> {{typically}} {{consist of}} a tessellation of polygon <b>soil</b> <b>map</b> unit delineations where the map units {{consist of a}} defined assemblage of soil classes assumed to exist in more-or-less fixed proportions. There are several limitations {{in this kind of}} mapping approach that relate to the original intent of the soil survey, the effect of mapping scale, and the nature of soil polygon boundaries. Yet perhaps a more fundamental limitation is {{the fact that most of}} the time, the soil classes that comprise the <b>soil</b> <b>map</b> units are not mapped individually: in effect their spatial distributions are unknown beyond the qualitative indications given in the accompanying <b>soil</b> <b>map</b> unit report. Spatial disaggregation of <b>soil</b> <b>map</b> units attempts to map the spatial distribution of the individual soil classes that comprise a legacy <b>soil</b> <b>map.</b> We developed an approach called "Disaggregation and Harmonisation of <b>Soil</b> <b>Map</b> Units Through Resampled Classification Trees" (DSMART). DSMART samples the polygons of a legacy <b>soil</b> <b>map</b> and uses classification trees to generate a number of realisations of the potential soil class distribution. The realisations are then used to estimate the probability of occurrence of the individual soil classes. These estimates are mapped as raster grids, which can overcome some of the limitations of mapping scale and polygon boundaries inherent in the original legacy <b>soil</b> <b>map.</b> We demonstrate the DSMART approach on a legacy <b>soil</b> <b>map</b> from the former Dalrymple Shire in central Queensland, Australia. We mapped the estimated probability of occurrence of the 71 soil classes in the legacy <b>soil</b> <b>map,</b> as well as the most probable soil class, second-most-probable soil class and the degree of confusion between them as determined by a confusion index. Validation on 285 observed soil profiles indicated that for 48. 4 % of the validation profiles, the observed soil class was identified in the top three most probable soil classes.

40|$|Three {{centrally}} edited nationwide <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> {{were published}} in Hungary between 1953 and 1988. Each of these <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> has advantages, but serious drawbacks as well. Authors’ hypothesis was that the drawbacks of the individual <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> are correctable {{with the help of}} other <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> and with ancillary data. Therefore, the oldest <b>soil</b> <b>map</b> was digitized and a study was conducted for the harmonization of data on a 266 km 2 area at Keszthely (near Lake Balaton) by using the CHAID classification tree method. CORINE land cover database, digital map of surface geology, digital elevation model and derived slope categories were used as ancillary data. The seven source maps contained 7 – 38 categories. After the intersection of all seven maps, the resulting file contained more than 50, 000 polygons and nearly 14, 000 category combinations. A variable — showing the probability of the category combinations in relation to the expected areas — was calculated. This was the target variable for classification by the CHAID method, using categories of the seven original maps as independent variables. 0. 5 % of the total area was grouped into 13 less probable classes, which represent the inaccuracies of the initial maps. 99. 5 % of the total area was classified into 19 classes and some of them were further subdivided {{on the basis of the}} geological map.

40|$|ABSTRACT Existing <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> (legacy data) {{associated}} with digital mapping techniques are alternatives {{to obtain information}} at lower costs, however, tests are required to do it more efficiently. This study had as objectives to compare different methods to extract information from detailed scale <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> using decision trees for <b>mapping</b> <b>soil</b> classes at two watersheds in Minas Gerais, validate these maps {{in the field and}} use the best method to extrapolate information to larger areas, also validating these maps of larger areas. Detailed <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> of Vista Bela creek (VBW) and Marcela creek (MCW) watersheds were used as source of information. Seven methods to extract information from maps were compared: the whole polygon, eliminating 20 and 40 m from the polygon boundaries, and with buffers around the sampled points with radii of 25 m, 50 m, 75 m, and 100 m. The Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm was employed to create decision trees and enable creation of <b>soil</b> <b>maps.</b> Accuracy was assessed through overall accuracy and kappa index. The best method was used to extrapolate information to larger areas and maps were validated. The best methods for VCW and MCW were, respectively, eliminating 20 m from polygon edges and buffer of 25 m of radii from points. Maps for larger areas were obtained using these methods. Removing uncertainty areas from legacy <b>soil</b> <b>maps</b> contribute to better modeling and prediction of soil classes.
