25|$|Ancient Chinese coins are {{markedly}} different from coins {{produced in the}} west. Chinese coins were manufactured by being cast in molds, whereas western coins were typically cut and hammered or, in later times, milled. Chinese coins were usually made from mixtures of metals such copper, tin and lead, from bronze, brass or iron: precious metals like gold and silver were uncommonly used. The ratios and purity of the coin metals varied considerably. Most Chinese coins were produced with a square hole in the middle. This was used to allow collections of coins to be threaded on a <b>square</b> <b>rod</b> so that the rough edges could be filed smooth, and then threaded on strings for ease of handling.|$|E

Transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) photonic band gaps (PBGs) are calculated under different lattice constants with different air filling fractions (AFFs) and ratios of pillar radius to lattice constant. The analysis of data indicates that the center wavelength of PBG increases with smaller AFF.

60|$|The {{highest and}} sandiest portion next the Atlantic was thinly covered with Beach-grass and Indigo-weed. Next {{to this the}} surface of the upland {{generally}} consisted of white sand and gravel, like coarse salt, through which a scanty vegetation found its way up. It will give an ornithologist some idea of its barrenness if I mention that the next June, the month of grass. I found a night-hawk's eggs there, and that almost any <b>square</b> <b>rod</b> thereabouts, taken at random, would be an eligible site for such a deposit. The kildeer-plover, which loves a similar locality, also drops its eggs there, and fills the air above with its din. This upland also produced Cladonia lichens, poverty-grass, savory-leaved aster (Diplopappus linariifolius), mouse-ear, bear-berry, &c. On a few hillsides the savory-leaved aster and mouse-ear alone made quite a dense sward, said to be very pretty when the aster is in bloom. In some parts the two species of poverty-grass (Hudsonia tomentosa and ericoides), which deserve a better name, reign for miles in little hemispherical tufts or islets, like moss, scattered over the waste. They linger in bloom there till the middle of July. Occasionally near the beach these rounded beds, as also those of the sea-sandwort (Honkenya peploides), were filled with sand within an inch of their tops, and were hard, like large ant-hills, while the surrounding sand was soft. In summer, if the poverty-grass grows {{at the head of a}} Hollow looking toward the sea, in a bleak position where the wind rushes up, the northern or exposed half of the tuft is sometimes all black and dead like an oven-broom, while the opposite half is yellow with blossoms, the whole hillside thus presenting a remarkable contrast when seen from the poverty-stricken and the flourishing side. This plant, which in many places would be esteemed an ornament, is here despised by many on account of its being associated with barrenness. It might well be adopted for the Barnstable coat-of-arms, in a field sableux. I should be proud of it. Here and there were tracts of Beach-grass mingled with the Sea-side Goldenrod and Beach-pea, which reminded us still more forcibly of the ocean.|$|E

Allotment sizes are often quoted in <b>square</b> <b>rods,</b> although {{the use of the}} rod has been illegal for trade purposes since 1965. The rent is set at what a person [...] "may reasonably be expected to pay" [...] (1950); in 1997 the average rent for a ten <b>square</b> <b>rods</b> (250 m2) plot was £22 a year. In February 2012 the UK's first Green-controlled council, Brighton and Hove, caused controversy when they stated their intention to raise the rent for a standard 250 m2 plot to £110 per year, with many people suggesting that this was contrary to the environmental agenda on which they were elected. Each plot cannot exceed forty <b>square</b> <b>rods</b> (1000 m2) and must be used for the production of fruit or vegetables for consumption by the plot-holder and their family (1922), or of flowers for use by the plot-holder and their family.
