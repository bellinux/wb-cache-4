The lowest values of a fermentative acids amount they were show in a silage treated by a chemical preparation, only in these silages the present of an acetatic acid was detected at the same time. Also, the amount of a lactic acid was affected with this type of additive.

40|$|A 9 -month {{deployment}} of high-frequency radio (HFR) current meters and moored ADCPs in {{the lee of}} Oahu, Hawaii, gives some dynamical insights in the generation and evolution of vortices {{in the lee of}} islands. For mountainous islands lying in relatively strong and steady winds, such as the Hawaiian archipelago in the trade winds, vortices can be generated by Ekman pumping associated with orographic wind stress curls. An anticyclone generated in the lee of Oahu in October 2002 reaches a negative absolute vorticity for 4 days, before quickly decaying and broadening, possibly as a result of inertial instability. A large cyclone, generated in December 2002 in the lee of Hawaii, drifted northwestward and stalled southwest of Oahu in March-April 2003. Vortex Rossby waves developing on its periphery were observed by the HFRs with a northeastward phase propagation, 110 km wavelength and 16 days period.

This study investigated the biodiversity of wild dairy Propionibacteria isolates in dairy farms that produce Swiss-type cheeses in Minas Gerais State, Brazil. RAPD and PFGE were used for molecular typing of strains and MLST was applied for phylogenetic analysis of strains of P. freudenreichii. The results showed considerable genetic diversity of the wild dairy propionibacteria, since three of the main species were observed to be randomly distributed among the samples collected from different farms in different biotopes (raw milk, <b>sillage,</b> soil and pasture). Isolates from different farms showed distinct genetic profiles, suggesting that each location represented a specific niche. Furthermore, the STs identified for the strains of P. freudenreichii by MLST were not related to any specific origin.

The {{methodology}} applied {{within the framework}} of the TLF-Étym programme aiming drawing a distinction between borrowings from Classical Latin and those from Medieval Latin The development of ideas on lexicography and the revision of certain etymological notes have given rise to reflections that provide more information about and clarify the route(s) taken by borrowings from Latin. So far, there is no study in French lingüístics devoted to this etymological problem. In connection with this problem of French lexicography, we propose an idea with regard to several examples of etymologies in the TLF-Étym. It falls within both the domain of «les projets lexicographiques dans le <b>sillage</b> du TLF» (lexicographical projects derived from TLF) and «grands chantiers lexicographiques actuels et leurs méthodologies» (current trends and methodology in lexicography).

40|$|A mode {{based on}} an {{additive}} mechanism of heat transfer is proposed for forced convection subcooled boiling of binary mixtures. The contributing modes of heat transfer are: (i) the heat transferred as latent heat by the rising bubbles, (ii) the heat transferred as the heat contained in the superheated thermal layer that {{is removed from the}} surface {{in the wake of the}} rising bubbles and (iii) the single phase forced convection heat transfer from the heating surface not influenced by the bubbles. Experimental data from the literature on binary systems show good agreement with the model, validating the postulated mechanism. On propose un modkle bask sur un mCcanisme de transfert de chaleur additif pour une tbullition sous-refroidie par convection forcCe de melanges binaires.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The use of airboats is {{expanding}} in Alaska, {{particularly in the}} interior. This study describes the nature, magnitude, and distribution of disturbances caused by airboat trails over floating mat fen wetlands in the Tanana Flats near Fairbanks, Alaska. Airphoto interpretation showed over 300 km of airboat trails by 1995, with a 15 % expansion of the trail system since 1989. Field sampling was done at 30 trail and adjacent control sites along this trail system to assess changes in hydrology, soils, and vegetation. Water velocities in the trails at two-thirds of the sites were at least {{an order of magnitude}} greater than velocities of less than 1. 5 cm sec- 1 in the control areas. On average, 30 cm of the 0. 5 – 0. 75 m thick floating mat has been removed or eroded by airboat traffic at the sampling locations. Nearly all emergent floating mat vegetation has been destroyed (5 % cover remaining on average) so that the trails resemble a highly visible open water stream channel 2 – 3 m wide through the floating mats. Although the recovery and regrowth potential of floating mats in trails is high, recovery is unlikely in trails with continuing use.

Plant emergence and harvesting properties investigated were mean emergence dates, emerged rate index, percentage of emerged seedling, plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield. Soil moisture content, bulk density and penetration resistance varied from 24. 39 to 25. 42 %, and from 1. 24 to 1. 33 g/cm 3, and from 0. 58 to 1. 60 MPa, at 0 - 10 cm soil depth respectively; the same properties varied from 24. 65 to 25. 95 %, and from 1. 25 to 1. 34 g/cm 3, and from 0. 95 to 1. 60 MPa, at 10 - 20 cm soil depth respectively. For plant properties; mean emerged dates, emerged rate index, and percentage of emerged varied from 12. 80 to 12. 85 days, and from 0. 335 to 0. 346 seedling/m day, and from 86. 11 to 88. 61, respectively. Plant height, stem diameter, silage yield and dry matter yield varied from 244. 7 to 266. 2 cm, from 2. 88 to 3. 13 cm, from 7525. 89 to 7580. 80 kg/da, and from 1523. 36 to 1534. 35 kg/da, respectively.

The total bacteria content in the preparation was 1 ´ 1011 CFU/g. Different variants of a silage conservation have been accesses under laboratory conditions using laboratory vessels; the variants included a preservative-free (control) variant and the dosages of 1. 0, 2. 0, and 3. 0 g per a ton of conserved maize green mass. The evaluation of the dynamical changes in the ammonia content, pH, organic acid content and their ratio, and the analysis of the chemical composition of a silage performed at the 7 th, 21 st, and 60 th days after the filling showed the dosage of 3. 0 g/ton provided the best results. An industrial testing of the studied preservative (3. 0 g/ton) showed that, comparing to the preservative-free silage, the use of the new preservative during the filling of a maize <b>sillage</b> provided the better preservation of nutrients and more optimal pH and ratio of organic acids in the silage mass.

This yield made 28. 86 kg that exceeds the same value of the control group by 4. 0 %. The feeding of cows with the silage prepared with the use of the new preservative provided an increase of the volatile fatty acid content and bacteria amount in the rumen contents and simultaneously decreased the ammonia content that evidenced the improvement of the digestion processes.
