5|$|<b>Symbols</b> are visuals used to {{represent}} objects, actions, and concepts {{through the use of}} items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based <b>symbols</b> including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.Tactile <b>symbols</b> which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication <b>symbols</b> particularly for individuals with visual impairments and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of <b>symbols.</b> With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the <b>symbols</b> chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication <b>symbols</b> (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various <b>symbols</b> and motor planning. <b>Symbols</b> are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of <b>symbols</b> and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{independence}} of Belarus from the Soviet Union, the country resurrected national <b>symbols</b> that were used before the Soviet era. These included a flag of red and white stripes and a coat of arms consisting of a charging knight on horseback. These national <b>symbols</b> were replaced by Soviet-era <b>symbols</b> in a disputed 1995 vote. Those two <b>symbols,</b> along with the national anthem, are the constitutionally defined national <b>symbols</b> of Belarus.|$|E
5|$|A {{more mundane}} {{example is the}} {{presence}} of astrological <b>symbols</b> found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has proposed that astrological <b>symbols</b> etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological <b>symbols</b> and their connection to medical practice and with the historical records of the time.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the Polish Football Association, in {{an attempt}} to fight racism among Polish {{football}} fans, prepared a blacklist of most common racist and fascist <b>symbols</b> to be banned from Polish football stadiums. The catalogue, co-authored by independent anti-fascist organization Never Again (Nigdy Więcej), listed the Mieczyk Chrobrego as one of the extreme right <b>symbols</b> that are often displayed at the Polish stadiums. The catalogue listed other racist and fascist <b>symbols</b> like the Nazi swastika, the Celtic cross, and the Confederate Flag. After a protest by MEP Sylwester Chruszcz of the League of Polish Families, additional consultations were held with historians, academic researchers and other experts and as a result the symbol is still listed in the catalogue of extreme-right <b>symbols</b> banned at Polish football stadiums. It was also banned by UEFA during Euro 2008 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|Official state {{horses are}} one of many state <b>symbols</b> officially {{designated}} by states.

30|$|According to the <b>symbol</b> code (name) {{obtained}} in the “automatic matching and recognition of symbols” process, the corresponding target <b>symbol</b> code (name) can be found by querying the relationship table. To improve the query efficiency, the corresponding relationship table will be searched according to the category of the “oilfield” symbol: if the <b>symbol</b> is a point, the point relationship table will be searched; {{if it is a}} polyline <b>symbol,</b> then the polyline relationship table would be searched and so on. Based on the target <b>symbol</b> code (name), the target <b>symbol</b> can be found in its standard <b>symbol</b> library and can be rendered using the relevant information for an “oilfield” <b>symbol.</b> Subsequently, the rendered <b>symbol</b> is used to visualise the corresponding spatial entity to complete <b>symbol</b> conversion.
