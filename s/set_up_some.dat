5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{was then}} the second largest gold {{producer}} in the world, after South Africa. The colony's gold output had expanded greatly during the 1930s, and it remained the territory's main source of income during the war, though many extracting operations were diverted towards strategic minerals, most prominently chrome and asbestos. Southern Rhodesia {{became one of the}} two main sources of chrome for the Allies (South Africa was the other) and the world's third largest producer of asbestos after Canada and the Soviet Union. By {{the end of the war}} the mines at Shabani and Mashaba were turning out 1.5million tonnes of asbestos a year, in addition to 600,000 tonnes of chrome. Gold output reached peak levels in 1941–42 and thereafter subsided. Southern Rhodesia also exported tungsten, mica and tin, and provided coal for the copper mines of Northern Rhodesia and the Congo. The Southern Rhodesian government encouraged private enterprise to form secondary industries to exploit the colony's natural resources and increase production, but also <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> state industries in an attempt to spark growth. The establishment of the RATG prompted a minor economic boom, and also caused the primary direct demand placed on Southern Rhodesia's black population during the early stages of the war—a programme of conscripted labour to build the aerodromes.|$|E

500|$|Among the {{preliminary}} terms that Cornwallis insisted on was that Tipu surrender {{two of his}} sons as hostages as a guarantee for his execution of the agreed terms. [...] On 26 February his two young sons were formally delivered to Cornwallis amid great ceremony and gun salutes by both sides. Cornwallis, who {{was not interested in}} significantly extending the company's territory or in turning most of Mysore over to the Mahrattas and Hyderabad, negotiated a division of one half of Mysorean territory, to be divided by the allies, in which the company's acquisition would improve its defences. [...] He later wrote, [...] "If we had taken Seringapatam and killed Tippoo, [...] we must either have given that capital to the Marattas (a dangerous boon) or have <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> miserable pageant of our own, to be supported by the Company's troops and treasures, and to be plundered by its servants." [...] The territories taken deprived Mysore of much of its coastline; Mysore was also obligated to pay some of the allied war costs. [...] On 18 March 1792 Tipu agreed to the terms and signed the Treaty of Seringapatam, ending hostilities.|$|E
500|$|Nolan's {{personal}} [...] "jumping off point" [...] {{of inspiration}} was [...] "The Man Who Falls", {{a short story}} by Denny O'Neil and Dick Giordano about Bruce's travels throughout the world. The early scene in Batman Begins of young Bruce Wayne falling into a well was adapted from [...] "The Man Who Falls". , written by Jeph Loeb and drawn by Tim Sale, influenced Goyer in writing the screenplay, with the villain Carmine Falcone as one of many elements which were drawn from Halloweens [...] "sober, serious approach". The writers considered having Harvey Dent in the film, but replaced him with the new character Rachel Dawes when they realized they [...] "couldn't do him justice". The character was later portrayed by Aaron Eckhart in the 2008 sequel The Dark Knight. The sequel to Halloween, , {{also served as a}} minor influence. Goyer used the vacancy of Bruce Wayne's multi-year absence presented in [...] to help <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> of the film's events in the transpiring years. In addition, the film's Sergeant James Gordon was based on his comic book incarnation as seen in Year One. The writers of Batman Begins also used Frank Miller's Year One plot device, which was about a corrupt police force that led to Gordon and Gotham City's need for Batman.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the reviews}} were several {{negative}} ones, which compared the series negatively to the original. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that like the original, 90210 was [...] "pretty bad". Gilbert {{said that the}} episode [...] "seemed to take forever to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> remarkably bland plotlines", which he found had been executed with more finesse by other teen soaps. The reviewer criticized the writers for their [...] "unimaginative material", exemplified by the risqué anal sex scene which he opined {{would no longer be}} considered outrageous for a series targeted at teenagers. Gilbert claimed that the characters lacked depth and distinction, especially Naomi, whom he compared negatively to Gossip Girls Blair Waldorf. By contrast, Tom Gliatto of People magazine gave Naomi Clark a favorable review, but stated that he felt the cast as a whole had yet to gel. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the pilot as [...] "corny but trying to be hip, crammed with subplots until the producers figure out which ones the audience responds to." [...] Tucker praised Walters acting as a [...] "slashing panache that no one else on screen approaches", and found the only time he laughed with pleasure throughout the pilot was when her character exclaimed, [...] "I'm gonna call Dan Tana's for some takeout!". Hal Boedeker of the Orlando Sentinel described the pilot as [...] "a blah variation on Beverly Hills, 90210", and being too [...] "extravagant and less believable". Boedeker expressed disappointment in the series, and predicted that it would be canceled within a year.|$|E
500|$|In the 2014 World Cup, Italy {{were placed}} in Group D, along with Costa Rica, England and Uruguay, in {{what was called the}} [...] "Group of Death". On 14 June, in Italy's opening match against England, Pirlo wore the captain's armband due to Buffon's last minute injury. The match ended with a 2–1 win to Italy. Pirlo heavily contributed to Italy's win, {{controlling}} the flow of the game, and setting up several goalscoring chances, as Italy dominated possession. During the match, Pirlo made 108 passes in total, only misplacing five, with a pass completion rate of 95.4%, completing the most passes of any other player in the previous opening matches of the 2014 World Cup. With a 93.2 pass percentage, Italy also managed to record the highest pass accuracy percentage of any team in a World Cup match since Denmark in the 1966 World Cup, completing 561 of their 602 passes. Pirlo also contributed to Italy's first goal of the match: Candreva's short corner was played to Verratti, who then passed the ball out wide towards Pirlo, who drew his marker with him. Pirlo let the ball pass in between his legs to Marchisio, leaving him with space to score with a low drive from outside the area. Pirlo also managed to hit the crossbar from a swerving free kick in injury time. Italy suffered 1–0 defeats in both of their remaining matches against Costa Rica and Uruguay, however and were eliminated in the group stage for the second consecutive World Cup, finishing in a disappointing third place in their group, behind Costa Rica and Uruguay. Pirlo's appearance against Uruguay was his 112th cap for Italy, which allowed him to equal Dino Zoff's number of appearances for the Italian National side, and made him the fourth most capped player for the Italian national team. The Italian squad and manager, Cesare Prandelli, were criticised for over-relying on Pirlo to create goalscoring chances. Although Pirlo was able to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> goal scoring opportunities and did test the opposition goalkeepers with some dangerous free kicks in the final two group games, his performances were stifled by the defensive pressure of the opposition, and he was much less dominant than {{he had been in the}} opening match against England. Although he had previously communicated his intention to retire after the World Cup, he stated, upon his return to Italy, that he would still be available to play for the national side.|$|E

2500|$|... "Weekend band" [...] PA {{systems are}} a niche market for small, {{powerful}} touring SR gear. Weekend bands need {{systems that are}} {{small enough to fit}} into a minivan or a car trunk, and yet powerful enough to give adequate and even sound dispersion and vocal intelligibility in a noisy club or bar. As well, the systems need to be easy and quick to set up. Sound reinforcement companies have responded to this demand by offering equipment that fulfills multiple roles, such as powered mixers (a mixer with an integrated power amplifier and effects) and powered subwoofers (a subwoofer with an integrated power amplifier and crossover). These products minimize the amount of wiring connections that bands have to make to set up the system and they take less time to <b>set</b> <b>up.</b> <b>Some</b> subwoofers have metal speaker mount holes built into the top, so that they can double as a base for the stand-mounted full-range PA speaker cabinets.|$|E
2500|$|Asymptotic {{flatness}} is an idealization, and a {{very useful}} one, both in our current [...] "Gold Standard" [...] theory of gravitation -- General Relativity—and in the simpler theory it [...] "overthrew", Newtonian gravitation. [...] One might expect that as a (so far mostly hypothetical) sequence of increasingly sophisticated theories of gravitation providing more and more accurate models of fundamental physics, these theories will become monotonically more [...] "powerful". [...] But this hope is probably naive: we should expect a monotonically increasing range of choices in making various theoretical tradeoffs, rather than monotonic [...] "improvement". [...] In particular, as our physical theories {{become more and more}} accurate, we should expect that it will become harder and harder to employ idealizations with the same ease with which we can invoke them in more forgiving (that is, less restrictive) theories. [...] This is because more accurate theories necessarily demand setting up more accurate boundary conditions, which can render it difficult to see how to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> idealization familiar in a simpler theory in a more sophisticated theory. [...] Indeed, we must expect that some idealizations admitted by previous theories may not be admitted at all by succeeding theories.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{reviews of}} the pilot were average. Metacritic gave the episode a Metascore—a {{weighted}} average based on the impressions of a select 12 critical reviews—of 46, signifying mixed or average reviews. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe felt that like the original, 90210 was [...] "pretty good". Gilbert said that the episode [...] "seemed to take forever to <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>some</b> remarkably bland plotlines", which he found had been executed with more finesse by other teen soaps.

By contrast, Tom Gliatto of People magazine gave Naomi Clark a favorable review, but stated that he felt the cast as a whole had yet to gel. When compared to the original series, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that the spin-off covered the same themes—family, friends, teen melodrama, relationships—but with more humor. Owen praised the compelling characters and the acting, and found the dialogue to be more painful than clever.|$|E
