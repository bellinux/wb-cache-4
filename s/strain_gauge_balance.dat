40|$|Measurement {{of steady}} and {{fluctuating}} forces {{acting on a}} body in a flow {{is one of the}} main tasks in windtunnel experiments. In aerodynamic testing, <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>balances</b> will usually be applied for this task as, particularly in the past, the main focus was directed on the measurement of steady forces. In many applications, however, balances based on piezoelectric multicomponent force transducers are a recommended alternative solution. Contrary to conventional <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>balances,</b> a piezo balance features high rigidity and low interferences between the individual force components. High rigidity leads to very high natural frequencies of the balance itself, which is a prerequisite for applications in unsteady aerodynamics, particularly in aeroelasticity. Moreover for measurement of extremely small fluctuations, the possibility exists to exploit the full resolution independently from the preload. Concerning the measurement of small, steady forces, the application of piezo balances is restricted due to a drift of the signal at constant load. However, this problem is not as critical as generally believed since simple corrections are possible. The aim of this contribution is to give an impression of the possibilities, advantages and limitations offered by the use of piezoelectric balances. Several types of external balances are discussed for wall mounted models, which can be suspended one-sided or twin-sided. Additionally an internal sting balance is described, which is usually applied inside the model. Reports are given on selected measurements performed in very different windtunnels, ranging from low-speed to transonic, from short- to continuous running time and encompassing cryogenic and high pressure principles. The latter indicates that special versions of our piezo balances were applied down to temperatures of - 150 °C and at pressures of up to 100 bar. The projects span from a wing/engine combination in a low-speed wind tunnel to flutter tests with a swept-wing performed in a Transonic Wind Tunnel, and include bluff bodies in a high pressure and cryogenic windtunnel, as well. These tests serve as examples for discussing the fundamental aspects that are essential in developing and applying piezo balances. The principle differences between <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>balances</b> and piezo balances will also be discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Aerodynamic {{forces and}} moments on scaled models are {{measured}} in wind tunnels by multi-component <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>balances</b> whose performance and accuracy {{are characterized by}} careful calibrations. It is well recognized that calibration loads that {{are representative of the}} combined loads experienced by the balance/model in wind tunnel test conditions lead to high accuracy of the measured loads. But, in the traditional method the calibration loads are restricted to single-component and two component loads that are unrepresentative of model loads. A recently developed method called Global Regression Method (GRM) places no such restrictions and therefore, permits application of multi-component calibration loads similar to model loads, leading to improved accuracy of measured loads. In addition, with use of GRM it is possible to substantially reduce the number of calibration loads and hence, the calibration effort by optimization of load schedule. The GRM was recently implemented and a MATLAB software developed for balance calibration data analysis at NAL. In order to illustrate the application of GRM and use of the computer program calibrations of a 6 -component internal balance were carried out with different types and number of calibration loads that included combined loads similar to model loads and the data were analyzed using GRM. The balance accuracy was assessed for a set of check loads consisting primarily of combined loads. Results showed that the accuracy when the calibration loads were similar to model loads was significantly better than that obtained using single- and two–component calibration loads. It was also found that improved accuracy could be obtained with substantially reduced number of loadings. The paper presents an overview of the GRM and brief details of application of the GRM to calibration of multicomponent balances.

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the design and}} development of two special novel thin internal <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>balances</b> for testing thin slab delta wings at hypersonic speeds. Of the two balances, one is a thin three-component balance {{and the other is}} a thin six-component balance. Unlike the conventional balances, which are circular in cross section, the balances discussed here are flat and have rectangular cross sections. Here, the design philosophy and the metallic architecture of these balances are discussed in detail. This paper is divided into three parts wherein the first part deals with the thin three-component balance the second part addresses the thin six-component balance and, in the third part, typical results obtained using these two balances are presented. The thin three-component balance has a thickness of 2. 5 mm and can be housed inside a wing as thin as 6 mm. Because of its thinness, the axial output exhibited non-linear interaction from the normal force loading. Hence, combined loading is performed. In order to deduce the second-order coefficients, a new method has been proposed and a comparison with the existing method shows that this is better than the previous method. This balance has been used to generate aerodynamic data on thin slab delta wings with and without lee-side balance housing bodies. In this way, it is demonstrated that the lee-side bodies do interfere even when they come into the aerodynamic shadow of the wing. The thin six-component balance has a thickness of 4 mm and can be housed inside an 8 mm thick wing. Although this balance is also thin, it exhibited excellent linearity in all the bridges. In spite of this, it is subjected to several possible combinations of combined loading and the 2 ̆ 7 work back 2 ̆ 7 loads are calculated using the linear coefficients. The work back loads agree very well with the applied loads. Hence, linear coefficients have been used for the purpose of data reduction. The effects of flap deflection on the aerodynamic characteristics of thin slab d elta wings have been studied using this balance.

40|$|Another {{concern for}} the vehicle during its design {{trajectory}} was {{the separation of the}} first stage solid rocket booster from the upper stage component after it had depleted its solid fuel propellant. There has been some concern about the interstage of the first stage from clearing the nozzle of the J 2 -X engine. A detailed separation aerodynamic wind tunnel investigation was conducted in the AEDC VKF Tunnel A to help to investigate the interaction aerodynamic effects 5. A comparison of the separation plane details between the Ares I architecture and the Ares I-X demonstration flight architecture is shown in figure 12. The Ares I design requires a more complex separation sequence and requires better control in order to avoid contact with the nozzle of the upper stage engine. The interstage, which houses the J 2 -X engine for the Ares I vehicle, must be able to separate cleanly to avoid contact of the J 2 -X engine. There is only about approximately 18 inches of buffer inside the interstage on each size of the nozzle so this is a challenging controlled separation event. This complex experimental investigation required two separate Ares I models (upper stage and first stage with interstage attached) with independent <b>strain</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>balances</b> installed in each model. It also required the Captive Trajectory System (CTS) that was needed to precisely locate the components in space relative to each other to fill out the planned test matrix. The model setup in the AEDC VKF Tunnel A is shown in figure 13. The CTS remotely positioned the first stage at the required x, y, and z positions and was able to provide interactions within 0. 2 " of the upper stage. A sample of the axial force on the first stage booster is shown in figure 14. These results, as a function of separation distance between the two stages, are compared to pre-test CFD results. Since this is a very challenging, highly unsteady flow field for CFD to correctly model, the experimental results have been utilized by GN&C discipline to more accurately represent the interaction aerodynamics. In addition to the integrated forces and moments obtained from the test, flow visualization data was obtained from this test in the form of Schlieren photographs, as shown in figure 15, which show the shock structure and interaction effects after the two stages separate during flight.
