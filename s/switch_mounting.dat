50|$|In this article, when {{comparing}} different wiring methods or systems {{the focus is}} on the number of wires connecting the switches to each other. Sometimes an additional wire is present in each cable to carry an unswitched neutral or hot wire which passes through the <b>switch</b> <b>mounting</b> box, but is not normally connected to the switch. If the switch has a pilot light or a receptacle, additional hot or neutral connections to the device may be required. Grounding (earthing) wires are not counted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract only availableFor {{people without}} both {{mobility}} and speech capability, communication can be difficult. The Assistive Technology Evaluation Center at the University of Missouri—Columbia strives {{to help people}} find {{an effective way to}} communicate regardless of their disability. Michelle Wheeler and Shauna Dunnaway of ATEC presented the design team with a challenge: to develop an improved electronic communication device. Switches, activated by the slightest facial twitch, can be used in conjunction with an on-screen computer keyboard to input messages which a synthetic computer voice then generates. Limitations occur with the technology currently on the market. <b>Switch</b> <b>mounting</b> devices currently attach to a user's bed, table, or wheelchair, and either lack flexibility for precise adjustment or are too flexible and drift away from the user. The person's body may also shift throughout the course of the day, leaving the user unable to reach his or her sensor and therefore unable to communicate. The design team proposed a device which mounts the sensor directly to the user through a modified pair of eyeglasses. Firm but flexible wires extend from the temples of the glasses to the preferred facial muscles of the user. Department of Biological Engineerin...|$|E

5000|$|For trucks needing more gears, the {{standard}} [...] "H" [...] pattern can get very complicated, so additional controls {{are used to}} select additional gears. The [...] "H" [...] pattern is retained, then an additional control selects among alternatives. In older trucks, the control is often a separate lever mounted on the floor or more recently a pneumatic <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the [...] "H" [...] lever; in newer trucks the control is often an electrical <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the [...] "H" [...] lever. Multi-control transmissions are built in much higher power ratings, but rarely use synchromesh.|$|R
50|$|Like OEM alarms, {{aftermarket}} {{systems are}} usually armed and disarmed via remote. Usually {{they do not}} have provisions for external disarming from the key cylinder, but will typically have an override <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> in a hidden location.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{selectable}} 4WD {{system is}} {{not to be confused with}} all road conditions [...] "all-wheel-drive" [...] systems; the MPV can be switched into locked 4WD with a <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the column gear selector. A dash <b>mounted</b> <b>switch</b> controlled the center differential, creating a locked power distributions on the front and rear axles. The 4WD is not for use on dry roads, but can be engaged and disengaged while moving.|$|R
50|$|Another type of {{crank sensor}} {{is used on}} {{bicycles}} to monitor {{the position of the}} crankset, usually for the cadence readout of a cyclocomputer. These are usually reed <b>switches</b> <b>mounted</b> on the bicycle frame with a corresponding magnet attached to one of the pedal crankset arms.|$|R
50|$|Other changes {{included}} a new console-mounted shifter for automatic transmissions {{similar to the}} shifter used in Pontiac Firebirds replacing the Buick-like horseshoe shifter of previous Camaros, and the reintroduction of power windows to the option list {{for the first time}} since 1969, with the <b>switches</b> <b>mounted</b> in the console.|$|R
50|$|The {{stepping}} switch transmitted the traction current to the motors which were connected in series circuit. The flat track stepping <b>switch</b> was <b>mounted</b> to the transformer. It consisted of 18 steps with voltages between 230 V and 1300 V. For both motor groups a reverse <b>switch</b> was <b>mounted.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{function}} of the controller board was then to carry the support circuits for this serial or, on later boards, USB interface.

50|$|Several {{modifications}} were made. A toggle <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on {{the back}} of the amplifier chassis allows switching between tube (the original) and solid-state rectification; in the latter mode, output is boosted to 50 watts. A second toggle switch allows the player to disable the Normal channel and the Vibrato effect; the preamp gain is increased, and more distortion and sustain is available. This version of the amplifier has a fifteen-inch Eminence speaker and point-to-point wiring.|$|R
50|$|The {{starter motor}} is a series, compound, or {{permanent}} magnet type electric motor with a solenoid and solenoid operated <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on it. When low-current {{power from the}} starting battery {{is applied to the}} starter solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch, the solenoid closes high-current contacts for the starter motor and it starts to run. Once the engine starts, the key-operated switch is opened and the solenoid opens the contacts to the starter motor.|$|R
50|$|The PCB {{had five}} {{membrane}} <b>switches</b> <b>mounted</b> on top. Four of the switches were {{arranged in a}} cross pattern around {{the hole in the}} middle of the PCB, the fifth was offset near one of the corners. The PCB connected the switches to pins in the 9-pin D-connector that led to the console via a cutout in the upper right corner of the base. The cutout was shaped to grip a moulded strain relief on the cable.|$|R

Shut Out, under jockey Wayne D. Wright, won the race. Arcaro <b>switched</b> <b>mounts</b> for the Belmont Stakes, riding Shut Out to victory.|$|R
50|$|Switches are {{available}} in many form factors, including: desktop units not mounted in an enclosure which are typically intended {{to be used in}} a home or office environment outside a wiring closet; rack-mounted switches for use in an equipment rack; large chassis units with swappable module cards; DIN rail mounted for use in industrial environments; and small installation <b>switches,</b> <b>mounted</b> into a cable duct, floor box or communications tower, as found, for example, in FTTO Infrastructures.|$|R
5000|$|One type of {{float switch}} uses a mercury switch inside a hinged float. Another common type is a float that raises a rod to actuates a microswitch. One pattern uses a reed <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> in a tube; a float, {{containing}} a magnet, surrounds {{the tube and}} is guided by it. When the float raises the magnet to the reed switch, it closes. Several reeds can be mounted in the tube for different level indications by one assembly.|$|R

5000|$|In {{building}} wiring, a {{light switch}} is a switch, {{most commonly used}} to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets. Portable lamps such as table lamps will have a light <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> on the socket, base, or in-line with the cord. Manually operated on/off switches may be substituted by remote control switches, or light dimmers that allow controlling the brightness of lamps as well as turning them on or off. Light switches are also found in flashlights and automobiles and other vehicles.|$|R

50|$|A {{pressure}} switch for sensing fluid pressure contains a capsule, bellows, Bourdon tube, diaphragm or piston element that deforms or displaces proportionally to the applied pressure. The resulting motion is applied, {{either directly or}} through amplifying levers, {{to a set of}} switch contacts. Since pressure may be changing slowly and contacts should operate quickly, some kind of over-center mechanism such as a miniature snap-action switch is used to ensure quick operation of the contacts. One sensitive type of {{pressure switch}} uses mercury <b>switches</b> <b>mounted</b> on a Bourdon tube; the shifting weight of the mercury provides a useful over-center characteristic.|$|R
50|$|In late 2002, Game Park {{introduced}} the frontlight unit (FLU) as a factory modified (by Hahotech) {{version of the}} NLU. It provides its own illumination via a transparent panel between the LCD display and the plastic screen cover. The extra hardware resulted in a slightly raised display frame {{when compared to the}} NLU and BLU variants. The frontlight could be turned off with a <b>switch</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the back of the}} GP32 case (to save battery).The GP32 FLU's name was derived from a sticker added to the front of the GP32 packaging differentiating it from the standard non-light versions.|$|R
