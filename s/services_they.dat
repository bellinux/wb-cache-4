The remainder, to which the police and fire authorities (and parish council where this exists) set a precept, is raised from council tax and business rates. Following the 2010 Spending Review, the council announced that 11.1% could be cut from departmental budgets to save £65m {{over a five-year period}} and up to 181 posts could be lost.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1979, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} who worked at the Argonne National Laboratory wrote to Senator John Glenn, the Chairman of the United States Senate Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and Federal <b>Services.</b> <b>They</b> were concerned about information being leaked, in particular by the government's tacit acknowledgement that Morland's bomb design was substantially correct, something that could not otherwise have been deduced from unclassified information. These included the affidavits by the United States Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and government expert witness Jack Rosengren. Copies of the letter were sent to major newspapers, but with a cover note explaining that it was for background information and not publication. After about four weeks, the Glenn subcommittee forwarded it to the DOE, which classified it.|$|E

5|$|Once the contractors' {{locomotives}} ceased {{working on}} the line, locomotives were supplied from Goole shed, and were usually Barton Wright 0-6-2 side tanks or Barton Wright 0-6-0 goods engines with tenders. The locomotives took their name from William Barton Wright, who was the chief mechanical engineer for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway {{at the time they}} were introduced. They were designed and built by Kitson and Company in Leeds. Although classified as goods engines, the 0-6-0 locomotives were employed on both goods and passenger <b>services.</b> <b>They</b> continued to work on the line until the early 1960s. Most of the 0-6-2s had been withdrawn by 1914, and their duties were performed by Aspinall 2-4-2 side tanks.|$|E

5|$|The Act was unusual, {{as it was}} {{obtained}} without Pyott's consent, and created {{a new group of}} commissioners from local justices and dignitaries. They were empowered to set the rates for tolls, and the owner was obliged to transport all goods at the established rates. If there were not sufficient boats and the owner did not provide more, they could license others to provide carriage <b>services.</b> <b>They</b> could also order that locks, wharves and warehouses should be erected. The size of boats was specified, and were to be capable of carrying between 20 and 30 tons of cargo. The tolls set were quite moderate, and a group of merchants appear to have leased the river from Pyott for a period after 1767, but he eventually took control again.|$|E

5|$|The Associated Students of Michigan State University (ASMSU) is the all-university {{undergraduate}} {{student government}} of Michigan State University. It is unusual amongst university student governments for its decentralized bicameral structure, {{and the relatively}} non-existent influence of the Greek system. The structure has since changed to a single General Assembly as part of reorganization in the late 2000s. ASMSU representatives are nonpartisan and many are elected in noncompetitive races. Their mission is to enhance the individual and collective student experience through education, empowerment, and advocacy by education {{to the needs and}} interest of students.

5|$|Under the {{direction}} of Mariano Datahan, the group converted en masse to the nascent Philippine Independent Church in about 1902. Community members revere the entity Suno which is conflated with the Santo Niño, {{and in addition to}} weekly church <b>services</b> <b>they</b> are served by appointed spiritual leaders known as biki and beriki. The biki, or bishop, is responsible for performing harvest ceremonies and other rituals such as house blessing. Before a house can be constructed, a ritual is performed in which a spiritual leader asks the permission of the spirits. If permission is not granted, the builder must select a new site. The Eskaya also retain spiritual traditions once widespread in lowland Boholano rural communities.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, on {{receiving}} her diploma, de Bourgoing {{joined the}} Société de Secours aux Blessés Militaires (SSBM), forerunner of the French Red Cross, {{as a volunteer}} and began working at the Beaujon Hospital in Paris. As {{a result of her}} competence and the understanding she showed both patients and doctors, she was appointed president of the SSBM. In 1907, she sailed for Morocco with the French expeditionary force under General Antoine Marius Benoît Drude. As head of a team of SSBM volunteers, she established an infirmary in Casablanca, treating the wounded in the conflicts between the French and Moroccans. As conditions were difficult in Morocco, it was decided the wounded and seriously ill should be transported to Oran in Algeria where {{it would be easier to}} provide proper treatment. It was in October 1907 while she and two of her nurses were accompanying the wounded on a French naval crossing to Oran, that she first met General Hubert Lyautey, who was division commander there. After spending fifteen months in North Africa, she returned to France, only to leave shortly afterwards for the Italian port Messina in December where she and her nursing team helped care for the 80,000 victims of the 1908 earthquake. As a result of their exemplary <b>services,</b> <b>they</b> were decorated by Princess Hélène of Orléans.|$|E

5|$|Some historians, such as Chandler and Weller, {{assert that}} the British heavy cavalry were {{destroyed}} as a viable force following their first, epic charge. Barbero states that the Scots Grey were practically wiped out and that the other two regiments of the Union Brigade suffered comparable losses. Other historians, such as Clark-Kennedy and Wood, citing British eyewitness accounts, describe the continuing role of the heavy cavalry after their charge. The heavy brigades, far from being ineffective, continued to provide valuable <b>services.</b> <b>They</b> countercharged French cavalry numerous times (both brigades), halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack (Household Brigade only), were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis, and filled gaps in the Anglo-allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations (both brigades). This service was rendered {{at a very high}} cost, as close combat with French cavalry, carbine fire, infantry musketry and—more deadly than all of these—artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives in the two brigades. At 6 o'clock in the afternoon the whole Union Brigade could field only 3 squadrons, though these countercharged French cavalry, losing half their number in the process. At the end of the fighting the two brigades, by this time combined, could muster one squadron.|$|E

30|$|When {{immigrant}} customers {{undertake a}} dental treatment {{in their native}} country (e.g. less-developed one), they may initially be uncertain and not confident that the <b>service</b> <b>they</b> receive is of good quality [52]. This is especially the case of dental tourism in less-developed countries, where low price {{is one of the}} main reasons for customers to use this service. In this circumstance, a high-quality interaction between a dentist and a customer would facilitate the social exchange and mutual understanding, leading to the development of trust in customers [53]. In turn, when customers trust in the dentist and his <b>service,</b> <b>they</b> are more confident that the <b>service</b> <b>they</b> receive is worth the money, leading to better price value.|$|R
