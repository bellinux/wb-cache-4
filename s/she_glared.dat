2500|$|But {{the ladies}} of Winchester had brought some of this harsh {{treatment}} on themselves. From the very first Union occupation, they had treated Federal soldiers despicably. Going to church one Sunday, one woman accidentally dropped her Bible or prayer brook. A passing soldier immediately {{picked it up and}} offered it to her. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> at him hatefully and refused it. When the Union army was retreating through town during the First Battle of Winchester, the civilians, but most particularly the women, uttered the vilest language, hurling at them anything that came to hand. Then they began shooting from their windows or yards. Any of a number of soldiers were killed by women firing at them. One cavalryman, wounded in the foot, sat on a doorstep. The woman of the house opened the door and asked him if he could walk. [...] "No," [...] he told her. Could she see his pistol she asked. Innocently, he gave it to her. She put it to his head and told him to get off her doorstep. As he tried to limp away, she shot him in the back. That night, several young soldiers took a vow to punish the women of Winchester for murdering their comrades when they returned. This is the context within which Milroy was operating.|$|E

60|$|Unquailingly <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> {{back into}} the angry eyes against which so few people could hold their own.|$|E
60|$|LADY CAROLINE (with itching {{fingers as}} <b>she</b> <b>glares</b> at Lob). It {{is all that}} wretch's doing.|$|R
5000|$|Beka is {{slender and}} tall at five feet and eight inches. She has dark-blond hair and light blue-gray eyes that unsettle people when she's mad. Someone once {{told her that}} it's like being touched by ice when <b>she</b> <b>glares</b> at people, though Beka herself can neither prove nor {{disprove}} this, seeing as she's never seen her face while angry ...|$|R
6000|$|The gods, {{to curse}} Pamela with her prayers, Gave the gilt coach and dappled Flanders mares, [...] 50 The shining robes, rich jewels, beds of state, And, to {{complete}} her bliss, a fool for mate. <b>She</b> <b>glares</b> in balls, front boxes, and the Ring, A vain, unquiet, glittering, wretched thing! Pride, pomp, and state but reach her outward part: She sighs, {{and is no}} duchess at her heart.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glared</b> at Neale an instant, white-faced and hard, and then, rejoining her companions, she {{led them}} away.|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} bag {{down to the}} office. The landlady was winding the clock, while her husband yawned. <b>She</b> <b>glared.</b>|$|E
6000|$|He had paused {{once more}} with his point--but <b>she</b> <b>glared,</b> poor Cornelia, with her wonder. [...] "Surely {{if you know}} for yourself----!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mary Isabel," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>glaring</b> at {{her sister}} and {{ignoring}} the doctor entirely, [...] "did you mean what you said in that letter?" ...|$|R
50|$|One day, {{she goes}} horse riding. She goes skinny dipping, leaving her {{clothes on the}} horse, only to have it wander off, {{attracted}} by another locked in a corral. She chases after {{it all over the}} countryside. The horse is finally caught by Adam (Aribert Mog), the virile young foreman or engineer of a road construction gang. Seeing this, she hides in the bushes, where he finds her. At first, she is ashamed of her nudity, but then <b>she</b> <b>glares</b> at him in defiance. He gives her back her clothes. When she tries to leave, she hurts her foot. At first, she resists his efforts to help, then accedes.|$|R
6000|$|And the woman, with a woman's eyes [...] Of pity at {{once and}} ire, [...] Said, when that <b>she</b> had <b>glared</b> a span, [...] "There is a cake for any man [...] If he will watch the fire." ...|$|R
60|$|Willy had {{not a word}} to say. She {{sprang to}} her feet, <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> at the triumphant woman in the bed, and, turning, went downstairs.|$|E
6000|$|He coloured; {{there was}} {{something}} in her passionate piety that scorched him. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> at him with tragic eyes--he might have profaned an altar. [...] "Oh I mean that nothing will come of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Aunt Em turned {{upon the}} Lion a {{determined}} countenance and a wild dilated eye. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> at the immense beast steadily, and the Lion, {{who had been}} quietly blinking at them, began to appear uneasy and disturbed.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> was <b>glaring</b> {{with a frown}} at her sister, and {{detached}} {{her eyes}} from her with an effort. [...] "What did you say?" [...] she demanded, with an absent bluntness. [...] "Oh yes. Yes! We went once. Father took a box at the Metropolitan." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{first he}} was shocked {{to find that it}} only succeeded in convincing him that Elizabeth was quite the most {{attractive}} girl he ever had met. The photographer had given Claire rather a severe look. He had told her to moisten the lips with the tip of the tongue and assume a pleasant smile, with the result that <b>she</b> seemed to <b>glare.</b> <b>She</b> had a rather markedly aggressive look, queenly perhaps, but not very comfortable.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile {{his wife}} had craned her long lithe body forward over the bar till her head was almost level with the hither edge of the table. There <b>she</b> stood <b>glaring</b> at him, her wicked face alive with fury and malice, for the brandy she had drunk had caused her to forget her fears.|$|R
6000|$|She {{answered}} {{as well as}} {{she could}} with the brush held horizontally in her mouth while <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> inhospitably at him. [...] "Well, not much," [...] and then she let him in, and went and lighted her spirit-lamp.|$|E
60|$|The Vrouw Prinsloo {{reached the}} body that lay upon the ground dressed in what resembled my clothes, and bending down her stout shape with an effort, turned it over. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> into its face {{and then began to}} shriek.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go 'long an' {{bring that}} stuff up here. I never {{see such a}} man in my life. It's a wonder he didn't do it f'r two bottles." [...] <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> out at the sign, which faced {{directly}} upon the kitchen window.|$|E
5000|$|... "While some fighters strike an impassive pose â€¦ Rousey {{is nothing}} if not expressive. She smiles often, squinting so tightly that her eyes disappear. She cries easily, a girlhood habit she never outgrew. And before each fight <b>she</b> <b>glares</b> at her {{opponent}} as if she were getting ready to put a permanent end to a lifelong feud. After the fight, she is all smiles again, and usually unblemished." [...] - The New Yorker, 2014 In a 2012 interview before her first match with Miesha Tate, Ronda Rousey said [...] "When I was doing judo my main advantage was my conditioning and my pace; I used to wear people out." [...] She had taken to heart a quote from Ryoko Tani to fight every five seconds as if it was the last five seconds of the match.|$|R
60|$|The {{whole idea}} {{of the story is}} {{sufficiently}} difficult to require the most exact truth and the greatest knowledge and skill in the colouring throughout. In this respect I have no doubt of its being extremely defective. The people do not talk as such people would; and the little subtle touches of description which, by making the country house and the general scene real, would give an air of reality to the people (much to be desired) are altogether wanting. The more you set yourself to the illustration of your heroine's passionate nature, the more indispensable this attendant atmosphere of truth becomes. It would, in a manner, oblige the reader to believe in her. Whereas, for ever exploding like a great firework without any background, <b>she</b> <b>glares</b> and wheels and hisses, and goes out, and has lighted nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. With a <b>glare!</b> <b>She</b> {{looks like}} Dunsany's Bird of the Difficult Eye. Count ten and turn {{carelessly}} round, There, at that table. Almost behind you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come along upstairs wid yo' Mammy, honey. Dis ain't {{no place}} for us, I reckon." [...] Her words were the essence of endearment. And yet, while she {{pronounced}} them, <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> unceasingly at the intruders. [...] "Oh, de good Lawd'll burn de wicked!" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Panney sat up {{tall and}} straight. Her eyes grew bigger and blacker as with her mental vision <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> upon the situation. Presently she spoke, {{and her voice}} sounded {{as if she were}} in a great empty cask, with her mouth at the bunghole.|$|E
6000|$|Nehushta ceased also, gasping: [...] "The Lord help you, Miriam, for I cannot. Oh! {{after all}} these years to lose you thus, and because of that man!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> through the {{darkness}} towards the fallen Marcus, thinking in her heart that she would kill him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I just brushed my {{lips with}} it, {{and gave it}} back to him," [...] moaned Fern. <b>She</b> sat up, <b>glared</b> at Carol. [...] "Did you ever take a drink?" ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{literally}} {{translates as}} [...] "the hussy has thrown the bloke {{flat on his}} back, with her foot on his chest/ wordless <b>she</b> stands <b>glaring</b> in anger". The answer to this puzzle will be the goddess Kali and the legend connected to her. The answerer to this will also sing out his/her answer in a poem made at that instant of time.|$|R
60|$|He {{went out}} at once. Mrs. Kearney wrapped the cloak round her {{daughter}} and followed him. As she passed through the doorway <b>she</b> stopped and <b>glared</b> into Mr. Holohan's face.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>glared</b> malevolently {{at him and}} hobbled on. Several minutes afterward, {{coming back}} {{from a trip to}} where a squad of groaning {{patients}} was gathering spruce-boughs, Smoke saw the seeress entering Amos Wentworth's cabin and followed after her. At the door he could hear her voice, whimpering and pleading.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} two miles the racing motor had used up so much water {{that she had to}} make four trips to the creek before she had filled the radiator. When she had climbed back on the running-board <b>she</b> <b>glared</b> down at spats and shoes turned into gray lumps. She was not tearful. She was angry.|$|E
60|$|Twinkle was too terrified to move. <b>She</b> <b>glared</b> {{upon the}} {{approaching}} monster helplessly, {{and it had}} almost reached her when a black object fell from the skies with the swiftness of a lightning streak and struck the dog's back, tearing the flesh with its powerful talons and driving a stout, merciless beak straight through the skull of the savage brute.|$|E
6000|$|Leonard looked round. It was Soa who spoke, Soa who {{had been}} {{listening}} to their talk, and <b>she</b> was <b>glaring</b> at him {{with an expression of}} intense hate in her sullen eyes. A thought came into his mind. [...] "Was it not possible that this woman {{had something to do with}} their misfortunes? How came it about that the others were taken while she was left?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Wix, at this, pounced upon it; she {{had grabbed}} it too soon even for Maisie {{to become aware}} of being rather afraid of it. Thrusting it {{instantly}} behind her <b>she</b> positively <b>glared</b> at Sir Claude. [...] "See it, wretched man?--the innocent child SEE such a thing? I think you must be mad, and she shall not have a glimpse of it while I'm here to prevent!" ...|$|R
60|$|The fiskman, {{who wears}} a red nightcap, with a tall hat {{on the top of}} it, takes off his head-gear, exposes his bald pate to view, and wipes it with a fishy cotton handkerchief; but he takes no notice {{whatever}} of the girl, who now becomes mad--that is to say, <b>she</b> stamps, <b>glares,</b> shakes her pretty little fist at the hard-hearted man, and gasps.|$|R
