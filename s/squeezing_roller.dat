40|$|The {{mechanical}} and physical properties of tapioca based starch {{are known to}} vary in relation to physical parameters including the particle size of the starch granules. In this study, ultra sonication was used to reduce the particle size of starch solution from 100 μm to 8 μm and the modified starch was applied on poly cotton warp yarns. The strength, extension, moisture regain and size add-on% was tested and compared with the properties of conventionally sized yarns. The results showed that better strength and extension properties {{can be obtained by}} the application of ultra sonicated size solution at lower drying temperatures and lower <b>squeeze</b> <b>roller</b> pressures with minimum size add-on%.

30|$|Water {{repellent}} and antibacterial finishes {{were applied}} on the fabric samples {{in a single}} bath after checking their compatibility. Three concentration levels of fluoropolymer finish (i.e. 1 %, 4 % and 7 % on weight of fibre) were co-applied with 1 %, 1.5 % and 3 % (on weight of fibre) of antibacterial finish. The pad dry cure process {{was used for the}} application of finishes. The fabric samples were immersed in the stock solution prepared according to the required concentration levels, followed by padding through <b>squeezed</b> <b>rollers</b> to get 70 % wet pick-up. After padding, the fabrics were dried at 90 °C and then cured at 140 - 150 °C for two minutes. The treated and untreated fabric samples were tested for water repellence, antibacterial activity, air permeability and stiffness.|$|R
30|$|For the {{application}} of synthesized Titanium nano dispersion, {{the most widely used}} method of application pad-dry-cure process was used. The plasma treated polypropylene nonwoven fabric was coated with 1 % nano dispersion with material to liquor ratio of 1 : 20 and 0.5 % anionic binder. The fabric samples were immersed in the bath followed by padding through <b>squeezed</b> <b>rollers</b> at a pressure of 147  N/cm 2 to remove the excess liquid. Each fabric sample was padded with the solution twice to ensure even distribution of solution. After padding, the fabric was dried naturally and then cured at 150 °C for 2  min. The wet pick up was 89 %. The add-on of the titanium nanoparticles was 87 %. Pore size of the plasma enhanced nano finished outer nonwoven fabric was characterized using tri-nocular microscope.|$|R
50|$|There {{are a few}} plaster {{sprayers}} {{that have}} a peristaltic pump (a tube <b>squeezed</b> by <b>rollers)</b> which also requires compressed air to produce a spray. These types of plaster sprayer can also spray textured coatings with particle sizes up to about 3mm diameter, providing {{that they are not}} solvent based.|$|R
5000|$|Fiberglass direct rovings are {{immersed}} in a resin bath where they are coated with resin system. Each strand in the fiberglass roving is coated with sizing chemistry that provides secondary bonding between the fiberglass strand and the resin. Sizing can be singular resin system compatible (like polyester compatible or epoxy compatible) or multi-system compatible (polyester+epoxy+polyurethane compatible). Compatibility of the sizing is critical in ensuring a bond between the resin and fiber except {{in the case of}} polyurethane resin systems where the resin bonds directly to the glass as well as the sizing equally well. Conventional Resin impregnation systems are the [...] "W Dip Bath" [...] or the [...] "Doctoring Roll" [...] design, however recently there have been major advances in the impregnation bath using a <b>squeezed</b> <b>roller</b> design patented and built by TSE Industries Inc. This results in far superior impregnation and resin to glass ratio control as compared to the conventional baths.|$|R

At the time it was written, a copy was added to the NPS Library collection for reasons not now known.  It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS.  Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. Historically, peristalsis, the rhythmic, traveling wave like pumping of bodily organs such as the ureter, has been mechanically simulated by the extended longitudinal motion of <b>rollers</b> <b>squeezing</b> fluid along a flow channel. Blood pumps are an example. The experimental work associated with this thesis has developed a peristaltic pump wherein pumping is produced by the limited transverse motion of electromechanical transducers. The transducers are arranged in a line and excitation is time phased so that their sequential transverse motions produce a traveling deflection wave along the pump flow tube.

40|$|To make paper, {{machines}} spray {{wet pulp}} on a moving screen and extract {{the water from}} it by <b>squeezing</b> it between <b>rollers,</b> before drying it using heat and rolling it on reels as finished product. The water extracted in the squeezing process is removed by a continuous roll of fabric called a felt. There are typically three felts on a paper machine. Felts wear out over time, and therefore must be replaced, either at a planned machine shutdown or at some other time when the machine fails randomly. All machine stoppages incur a downtime cost. This paper presents a stochastic dynamic programming model for determining a felt replacement policy that minimises the expected felt cost and cost of downtime. 1 Introduction This paper examines a problem that arises in running the paper machines at the Tasman pulp and paper mill in Kawerau, Bay of Plenty. The problem is that of scheduling the replacement of felts within the press section of the paper machine. This part of the machine is responsible [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The instant {{invention}} {{is directed}} to a peristaltic pump for critical laboratory or hospital applications requiring precise flow rates {{over an extended period}} of time. Within the cylindrical barrel pump housing is a single-piece, molded, elastometric, cylindrical liner with a multiplicity of flattened helical channels created therein from one end of the liner to the other. Three cylindrical rollers rotate about the center axis of the pump around the inside surface of the liner selectively compressing the liner, and hence the helical channels between the rollers and the barrel housing, creating a pumping action by forcing trapped fluid in the helical channels axially from one end of the liner to the opposite end. The novelty of the invention appears to lie in the provision of the special liner with multiple helical channels as the pumping chamber, rather than the standard single elastomeric tubing which is <b>squeezed</b> repeatedly by <b>rollers</b> to move the liquid through a typical peristaltic pump. Large, repeated deflections on the standard tubing causes a permanent set in the tubing, thus either changing the flow rate, or requiring a new section of tubing to be positioned in the pump head. Further, this configuration minimizes the amount of outflow pulsation which is characteristic of a typical single tubing peristaltic pump...|$|R
40|$|A simple technic {{to adapt}} the {{advantages}} of continuous flow analysis to the kinetic assay of multiple enzyme samples is described. It will permit adequate standardization by primary or secondary standards run through the entire analysis of those procedures that do not exhibit spontaneous changes in light absorption or fluorescence with time. The adaptation of the Kind-King method for alkaline phosphatase (1) to this technic is given to demonstrate the superiority of such a system over single-point enzyme assays. THE ASSAY of enzymatic activity by a sin. qie determination of a prod-uct formed or substrate consumed at a fixed time after mixing the sub-strate and sample is inherently poor methodology. The application of such methodology to continuous flow analysis, when the flow is main-tained by the <b>squeezing</b> action of <b>rollers</b> on flexible tubing, vaniegates the single fixed time and makes standardization a problem. The increasing use of commercially available enzyme preparations (which are not standards in the chemical sense, regardless of the desig-nations applied {{to them by the}} manufacturers) as the only solution to this standardization problem commits an even more serious breach of chemically acceptable methodology. The use of the AutoAnalyzer to study the kinetics of enzyme-substrate complexes and the effects of such parameters as pH and substrate concentration has already been described (2 - 4). We have developed a simple means of utilizing the advantages of continuous flow analysis for measuring by reaction rates the enzymatic activity of a series of samples. We were particularly concerned with those reactions that cannot be incubated in a cuvet and followed spectro-photometrically or fluorometnically. Our primary goal, however, was to achieve a system that could be adequately standardized. To illustrate tile simplicity of this system we present as an exampl...|$|R
40|$|In the Australian sugar industry, {{sugar cane}} is smashed into a straw like {{material}} by hammers before being <b>squeezed</b> between large <b>rollers</b> {{to extract the}} sugar juice. The straw like material is initially called prepared cane and then bagasse as it passes through successive roller milling units. The sugar cane materials are highly compressible, have high moisture content, are fibrous, and they resemble some peat soils in both appearance and mechanical behaviour. A promising avenue to improve the performance of milling units for increased throughput and juice extraction, and to reduce costs is by modelling of the crushing process. To achieve this, it is believed necessary that milling models {{should be able to}} reproduce measured bagasse behaviour. This investigation sought to measure the mechanical (compression, shear, and volume) behaviour of prepared cane and bagasse, to identify limitations in currently used material models, and to progress towards a material model that can predict bagasse behaviour adequately. Tests were carried out using a modified direct shear test equipment and procedure at most of the large range of pressures occurring in the crushing process. The investigation included an assessment of the performance of the direct shear test for measuring bagasse behaviour. The assessment was carried out using finite element modelling. It was shown that prepared cane and bagasse exhibited critical state behavior similar to that of soils and the magnitudes of material parameters were determined. The measurements were used to identify desirable features for a bagasse material model. It was shown that currently used material models had major limitations for reproducing bagasse behaviour. A model from the soil mechanics literature was modified and shown to achieve improved reproduction while using magnitudes of material parameters that better reflected the measured values. Finally, a typical three roller mill pressure feeder configuration was modelled. The predictions and limitations were assessed by comparison to measured data from a sugar factory...|$|R
