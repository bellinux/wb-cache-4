5|$|Among other {{personal}} interests, Orr has {{a passion for}} fishing which he has had since childhood. He has a talent for solving jigsaw puzzles quickly. Orr is also known for his taste in clothes and style of dress. When living as a bachelor with Forristall during his years with the Bruins, Orr was also known for keeping a clean apartment and not drinking or <b>smoking</b> <b>or</b> going night-clubbing. Orr projected a clean image.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are {{followed closely by}} the patient. Immediate loading implants may have {{a higher rate of}} failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including <b>smoking</b> <b>or</b> drug use.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving {{are associated with}} certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, <b>smoking,</b> <b>or</b> body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with higher risk for decompression {{sickness and}} arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.|$|E
5|$|Jacob Loucks Devers {{was born}} on 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, a small {{industrial}} town in the southeastern corner of the state. His parents were Philip Devers, a watchmaker and partner in a jewelry store, and Ella Kate Loucks Devers, a homemaker. He {{was the first of}} the couple's four children. He had two younger brothers, Frank and Phillip, and a younger sister, Catherine, known as Kitts. The Devers, of Irish and German-Alsatian ancestry, were strict, hardworking and religious. The family belonged to the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which did not believe in <b>smoking</b> <b>or</b> drinking. While providing a comfortable middle-class life for their children, the couple taught them to value dependability, integrity and industriousness.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. <b>Smoking</b> <b>or</b> salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, verjuice or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E

40|$|Aims of {{the review}} To {{determine}} the effectiveness of long-term harm reduction approaches without the prior intention of quitting (ie reducing consumption without the aim of quitting), with and without assistance. Research questions  How effective are pharmacotherapies in helping people cut down <b>or</b> abstain from <b>smoking,</b> temporarily <b>or</b> indefinitely without the aim of quitting?  How effective are different combinations of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products in helping people cut down <b>or</b> abstain from <b>smoking,</b> temporarily <b>or</b> indefinitely without the aim of quitting?  How effective are ‘nicotine-containing products’ in helping people cut down <b>or</b> abstain from <b>smoking,</b> temporarily <b>or</b> indefinitely without the aim of quitting?  How effective are behavioural support, counselling, advice or self-help (with or without pharmacotherapy) in helping people to cut down <b>or</b> abstain from <b>smoking,</b> temporarily <b>or</b> indefinitely, without the aim of quitting?  Is there an optimal period to help people cut down or abstain (temporarily <b>or</b> indefinitely) from <b>smoking</b> without the aim of quitting?  Is it more or less effective {{to draw up a}} schedule to help people cut down <b>or</b> abstain from <b>smoking,</b> temporarily <b>or</b> indefinitely, without the aim of quitting?  Do some tobacco harm-reduction approaches have a differential impact on different groups (for example, people of different ages, gender, socio-economic status (SES) or ethnicity) ?  Are there any unintended consequences from adopting a tobacco harm-reduction approach; for example, does it deter people from trying to cut down <b>or</b> abstain from <b>smoking,</b> temporarily <b>or</b> indefinitely...|$|R

Aspergillus mold species can infect the lungs via <b>smoking</b> <b>or</b> {{handling}} of infected cannabis and cause opportunistic and sometimes deadly aspergillosis.
