40|$|The monthly evening {{meeting of}} the Society was held on Monday, the 12 th August, T. Stephens, Esq., M. A., in the chair. In noticing the presentations to the Library the Secretary called special {{attention}} to the very large number of valuable publications received from various learned bodies and institutions, in England and America. A letter from Professor Haast, of the Canterbury Museum, New Zealand, was read, from which the following extract is given in the hope it may attract the attention of some member of the Society who may {{be in a position to}} obtain specimens of the Native Tiger and Devil —the former especially being very much wanted for Museums in New Zealand and elsewhere. Mr. F. Abbott, junr., read "Notes on Carduus arvensis (Cnicus arvensis of some authors), or common creeping thistle; with a short reference to Cnicus lanceolatus, the <b>Spear</b> or Plume <b>Thistle.</b> " Mr. Stephens called attention to the somewhat singular circumstance that although the thistle was in the first instance carried from place to place by seed, yet when it became established in any particular locality, its extension took place principally by root growth, and only to a slight extent by seed. In relation to {{meeting of the}} Society for September, 1878, due to the death of Mr. Morton Allport, no meeting was held this month...|$|R

50|$|Most {{species are}} {{considered}} weeds. Cirsium vulgare (bull thistle, common thistle, or <b>spear</b> <b>thistle)</b> {{is listed as}} a noxious weed in nine US states. Some species are cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic value and to attract butterflies. Some other common species are: Cirsium lanceolatum, Cirsium palustre, Cirsium oleraceum.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on {{coltsfoot}} (Tussilago farfara), winter heliotrope (Petasites fragrans), greater burdock (Arctium lappa), {{marsh thistle}} (Cirsium palustre), musk thistle (Carduus nutans) and <b>spear</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare). They initially feed in the roots, but {{later in the}} flower lower stems. Adults are on wing from May to June.|$|E
5000|$|Cirsium vulgare (<b>spear</b> <b>thistle,</b> bull thistle, or common thistle) is {{a species}} of the daisy genus Cirsium, native {{throughout}} most of Europe (north to 66°N, locally 68°N), Western Asia (east to the Yenisei Valley), and northwestern Africa (Atlas Mountains). It is also naturalised in North America, Africa, and Australia and is an invasive weed in some areas. [...] It is the national flower of Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spear</b> <b>thistle</b> is {{designated}} an [...] "injurious weed" [...] {{under the}} UK Weeds Act 1959, and a noxious weed in Australia and in nine US states. Spread is only by seed, not by root fragments {{as in the}} related creeping thistle C. arvense. It is best cleared from land by hoeing and deep cutting of the taproot before seeds mature; regular cultivation also prevents its establishment.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Spear</b> <b>Thistle</b> is {{an annual}} or {{biennial}} plant which forms dark purple or reddish flowers above dark green spiked leaves. A plant found in pastoral land and along roads, it is easily spread by vehicles {{as they pass}} by. A severely competitive plant, it can eliminate pastoral crop and open crops to infestation by insects; the spikes can dislodge from the plant and attach to wool, presenting a problem for shearers.|$|E
5000|$|Conservation issues {{include the}} danger of fire, some erosion prone areas near the coast, {{overgrazing}} {{and the presence of}} feral cats, mice, rats and rabbits. Clearance of these introduced species is unlikely in the near future because {{of the size of the}} island and the varied geography. <b>Spear</b> <b>thistle,</b> accidentally introduced to the island, is a problem; volunteers helped to control the infestation in the autumn of 2003 and there are hopes that the plant can eventually be eradicated. [...] There is a small breeding colony of southern elephant seals at Elephant Point, while a few southern right whales come into bays to rest or feed.|$|E
50|$|The {{protected}} area is covered mainly by beech (Fagus orientalis). Other flora {{of the park}} are the trees silver linden (Tilia argentea), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), common hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) and Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), {{as well as the}} flowering plants greater snowdrop (Galanthus elwesii), toothpickweed (Ammi visnaga), Italian arum (Arum italicum), bellflower (Campanula lyrata), peach-leaved bellflower (Campanula persicifolia), bladder campion (Silene vulgaris), eafy goosefoot (Chenopodium foliosum), nettle-leaved goosefoot (Chenopodium murale), charlock mustard (Sinapis arvensis), whitetop (Lepidium draba), stinkwort (Inula graveolens), coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara), golden marguerite (Anthemis tinctoria), common wormwood (Artemisia vulgaris), <b>spear</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare), musk thistle (Carduus nutans), yellow star-thistle (Centaurea solstitialis) and many others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spear</b> <b>thistle</b> {{is often}} a ruderal species, colonising bare {{disturbed}} ground, but also persists well on heavily grazed land as it is unpalatable to most grazing animals. Nitrogen-rich soils help increase its proliferation. The flowers are a rich nectar source used by numerous pollinating insects, including honey bees, wool-carder bees, and many butterflies. The seeds are eaten by goldfinches, linnets and greenfinches. The seeds are dispersed by wind, mud, water, and possibly also by ants; they do not show significant long-term dormancy, most germinating soon after dispersal {{and only a few}} lasting up to four years in the soil seed bank. Seed is also often spread by human activity such as hay bales.|$|E
5000|$|The Weeds Act 1959 (7 & 8 Eliz. II c. 54) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{regarding}} {{the control of}} several injurious weed species throughout the UK. It received Royal Assent on 16 July 1959, and aims {{to prevent the spread}} of the Broad Leaved Dock, Common Ragwort, Creeping Thistle, Curled Dock and the <b>Spear</b> <b>Thistle.</b> It allows the Secretary of State, or any person acting on their behalf or the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to use measures of enforcement {{to prevent the spread of}} weeds on private land, which, if not adhered to by the owner of said land, can lead to a fine up to £1000 and further punishment.|$|E
50|$|According to a legend, an invading Norse {{army was}} {{attempting}} to sneak up at night upon a Scottish army's encampment. During this operation one barefoot Norseman had the misfortune to step upon a thistle, causing him to cry out in pain, thus alerting Scots {{to the presence of}} the Norse invaders. Some sources suggest the specific occasion was the Battle of Largs, which {{marked the beginning of the}} departure of King Haakon IV (Haakon the Elder) of Norway who, having control of the Northern Isles and Hebrides, had harried the coast of the Kingdom of Scotland for some years. Which species of thistle is referred to in the original legend is disputed. Popular modern usage favours cotton thistle (Onopordum acanthium), perhaps because of its more imposing appearance, though it is unlikely to have occurred in Scotland in mediaeval times; the <b>spear</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare), an abundant native species in Scotland, is a more likely candidate. Other species, including dwarf thistle (Cirsium acaule), musk thistle (Carduus nutans), and melancholy thistle (Cirsium heterophyllum) have also been suggested.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} major {{environmental}} threats against the Yarra Ranges National Park is invasive weeds. The park is rich with native plants that are being overcome by competition by the 200 species of weeds that are spreading into the park from private gardens. In the park there are three significant types of weeds;- Weeds of National Significance (WONS) are plants that have the most significant impacts across Australia both environmentally and economically, and are a priority for control. In the Yarra Ranges National Park some WONS are Willows (Salix app.), Blackberry (Rubus fruticosus spp.aggregate), Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monlifera) and Bridal Creeper (Asparagus asparagoides).- Native species as weeds. There are some Australian native species that can have weed characteristics when they grow outside of their normal range and can cause harm to the parks environment. Some native weeds in the park are Bluebell Creeper (Billiarderia heterophylia), Cedar Wattle (Acacia elata) and Cootamundra Wattle (Acacia baileyana).- Declared Noxious Weeds. These plants have been declared noxious under the Catchment and Land Protection Act 1994. These plants {{have the potential to}} cause serious environmental harm and therefore must be managed. Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), <b>Spear</b> <b>Thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare) and Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) are all declared noxious weeds.|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{a century}} ago when mixed arable/{{pastoral}} farms prevailed, the current Welsh pastoral landscape lacks arable crops for arable weed seeds as a winter food resource for granivorous birds. Biomass crops such as short rotation willow coppice (SRC) where Salix cultivars are grown at high density (10 000 – 40 000 per ha) and each plot harvested on a usually three year rotation may help redress this loss. SRC, certainly in its establishment phase, and, if suitably managed, in early post-harvest rotation, offers significant winter seed resource which within one resource, such as <b>spear</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare), may change its bird availability depending whether it is upright when used by finches or fallen when utilised by ground feeding thrushes. If this crop becomes widespread in the landscape and it is managed in an environmentally friendly way, it will provide a food resource and possibly habitat “stepping stones” in countryside currently barren of such features...|$|E
40|$|Both {{competition}} and herbivory {{have been shown}} to reduce plant survival, growth, and reproduction. Much less is known about whether {{competition and}} herbivory interact in determining plant performance, especially for introduced, weedy plant species in the invaded habitat. We simultaneously evaluated both the main and interactive effects of plant neighbors and insect herbivory on rosette growth and seed reproduction in the year of flowering for Cirsium vulgare (bull thistle, <b>spear</b> <b>thistle),</b> an introduced Eurasian species, in tallgrass prairie in 2 years. Effects of insect herbivory were strong and consistent in both years, causing reduced plant growth and seed production, whereas the effects of competition with established vegetation were weak. The amount of herbivore damage inflicted on rosettes did not depend on the presence of neighbor plants. We also found no interaction between competition and herbivory on key parameters of plant growth and fitness. The results of this study contradict the hypothesis that competitive context interacts with insect herbivory in limiting the invasiveness of this introduced thistle. Further, the results provide additional, experimental evidence that high levels of herbivory on established rosettes by native insects exert significant biotic resistance to the invasiveness of C. vulgare in western tallgrass prairie...|$|E
40|$|Summary – Root-infectingnematodes {{are common}} on white clover (Trifoliumrepens) in dairy pastureson {{the north coast}} of New South Wales and southeastern Queensland, Australia, where they are thought to {{contribute}} to poor growth and persistence. The nematode responsible for causing root-knot symptoms on white clover was identi ed as Meloidogyne trifoliophila, a species not previously recorded fromAustralia. M. trifoliophilafailed to reproduceon any of the standardNorth Carolina hosts used to identifyM. javanica,M. hapla, M. arenaria and M. incognita, but caused severe galling and exhibited {{a high rate of}} reproduction on white clover. PCR primers for theseMeloidogyne species also failed to amplify DNA ofM. trifoliophila. Identity was con rmed by morphologicalmeasurements and plant symptoms. In a glasshouse test, increasing initial nematode density within the range 0 to 10 000 per 500 ml pot led to reduced shoot and root growth, fewer nodules and more severe root-knot symptoms. A second pot test screened weed species as potential alternative hosts of M. trifoliophila. None of the eight grass species was galled but M. trifoliophila reproduced on two of the eight dicotyledonweeds, <b>spear</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare) and pigweed (Portulaca oleraceae) ...|$|E
40|$|Parasitoids of herbivorous insects have {{frequently}} evolved specialized lineages exploiting hosts occurring on different plants. This study investigated whether host specialization is also observed when closely related parasitoids exploit herbivorous hosts {{sharing the same}} host plant. The question was addressed in economically relevant aphid parasitoids of the Lysiphlebus fabarum group. They exploit two aphid species (Aphis fabae cirsiiacanthoides and Brachycaudus cardui), co-occurring in mixed colonies (syntopy) on the <b>spear</b> <b>thistle</b> (Cirsium vulgare). Two morphologically distinguishable parasitoid lineages of the genus Lysiphlebus were observed and each showed virtually perfect host specialization {{on one of the}} two aphid species in this system. From A. f. cirsiiacanthoides, only females emerged that morphologically belonged to Lysiphlebus cardui, while males and females belonging to L. fabarum hatched from B. cardui. Microsatellite analyses indicated clear genetic differentiation of L. fabarum and L. cardui. L. cardui comprised only two distinct asexual lineages, one of which predominated throughout the area investigated. Population genetic analysis of sexual L. fabarum showed evidence for relatively strong spatial structuring and limited dispersal ability. Hyperparasitoids emerged from a large proportion of aphid mummies. One species, Pachyneuron aphidis, was significantly associated with B. cardui/L. fabarum mummies, indicating that host specialization may even extend to the trophic level above parasitoid...|$|E

40|$|The current {{mechanisms}} of herbicide selectivity in poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) {{were examined in}} glasshouse and field experiments. Through measurements of contact angles of diquat solutions it was established that poppy, and the weeds fumitory, fat hen and field poppy are 'hard' to wet, whilst shepherds purse, wild radish, <b>spear</b> <b>thistle</b> and curled dock are relatively 'easy' to wet. It was revealed that diclofop-methyl has properties characteristic of a weak surfactant, compared with Agral®, a finding supported through measurements of dynamic surface tension. The structure of the surface wax on the adaxial surface of poppy, field poppy, fumitory and fat hen leaves are described as seen under the scanning electron microscope. Chemical analysis of these waxes are also given. It appears the wax of fumitory and fat hen are influenced by application of ethofumesate. Chemical analysis shows that ethofumesate can inhibit the deposition of primary alcohols, long chain aldehydes and alkanes on the developing leaves of fumitory and fat hen, making these plants more susceptible than poppy plants to future applications of diquat + diclofop-methyl. Field trials conducted on the east and north-west of Tasmania, highlighted the difficulties that exist in extrapolating results from glasshouse experiments to field conditions. Measurements of spray retention and efficacy, revealed that plant responses to applications of diquat treatments were influenced, in addition to ethofumesate, by environmental conditions. Plant responses at both sites demonstrated that the inert ingredients of the commercial formulation of diclofop-methyl, would, in admixture with diquat produce the same result compared with the current diquat/diclofop-methyl treatmen...|$|E
40|$|A {{coupling}} of above-ground plant {{diversity and}} below-ground microbial diversity has been implied in studies dedicated to assessing {{the role of}} macrophyte diversity on the stability, resilience, and functioning of ecosystems. Indeed, above-ground plant communities have long been assumed to drive below-ground microbial diversity, but to date very little is known as to how plant species composition and diversity influence the community composition of micro-organisms in the soil. We examined this relationship in fields subjected to different above-ground biodiversity treatments and in field experiments designed to examine the influence of plant species on soil-borne microbial communities. Culture-independent strategies were applied to examine the role of wild or native plant species composition on bacterial diversity and community structure in bulk soil and in the rhizosphere. In comparing the influence of Cynoglossum officinale (hound's tongue) and Cirsium vulgare (<b>spear</b> <b>thistle)</b> on soil-borne bacterial communities, detectable differences in microbial community structure were confined to the rhizosphere. The colonisation of the rhizosphere of both plants was highly reproducible, and maintained throughout the growing season. In a separate experiment, effects of plant diversity on bacterial community profiles were also only observed for the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere soil from experimental plots with lower macrophyte diversity showed lower diversity, and bacterial diversity was generally lower in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil. These results demonstrate {{that the level of}} coupling between above-ground macrophyte communities and below-ground microbial communities is related to the tightness of the interactions involved. Although plant species composition and community structure appear to have little discernible effect on microbial communities inhabiting bulk soil, clear and reproducible changes in microbial community structure and diversity are observed in the rhizosphere.

40|$|The aphid {{transmitted}} Polerovirus Turnip yellows virus (TuYV) {{was found}} to be widespread with high incidences in oilseed rape (OSR) across Europe. UK, France, Germany and Poland all having > 90 % TuYV incidence in some OSR crops. From the 179 whole TuYV genomes sequenced in this study the phylogenetic analyses indicated three distinct genetic groups in the UK, two of which were also detected in Europe. These three genotypes were also distinct from the original sequenced TuYV-FL. These groups are proposed to be distinct species due to their genetic distance based on the most variable gene ORF 5 and phylogenetic analyses of ORF 1, ORF 3, ORF 4 and ORF 5. Mixed TuYV infection was uncommon and only two plant samples had genetically distinct isolates. Whole genome analysis also provided valuable information on two recombination hotspots located within TuYV genes ORF 3 and ORF 5. Investigation into the epidemiology of TuYV revealed many weed and crop species as hosts, including sugar beet, which it was previously thought not to infect. TuYV isolates detected infecting weed plants in the UK were successfully transmitted to OSR. Previously undescribed hosts, verbascum, geranium, teasel, <b>spear</b> <b>thistle,</b> dock and previously described hosts in the Brassicaceae, Compositae and Lepidium families were found in the UK. A full-length infectious clone of a UK isolate of TuYV has been produced, this will allow further assessment of TuYV in the future. The infectious clone was able to cause systemic infection of TuYV and was aphid transmissible. The Arabidopsis thaliana gene knock-out study did not reveal a single eIF gene or gene linked to virus movement or silencing that could provide extreme broad-spectrum resistance. The gene eIF(iso) 4 G. 1 was able to give a broad-spectrum quantitative resistance, and the potential of eIF 3 D. 2 as well as sucrose symporters SUC 1 and SUC 2 as candidates for extreme TuYV resistance were discovered. This understanding of the epidemiology and diversity of TuYV is being used to develop strategies for control...|$|E
