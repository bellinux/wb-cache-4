5|$|At {{the end of}} chapter 51 of Gylfaginning, High {{describes}} how the gods caught and bound Loki. Skaði is described as having taken a venomous snake and fastening it above the bound Loki, so that the venom may drip on to Loki's face. Loki's wife Sigyn <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> his side and held a bowl out. The bowl catches the venom, but when the bowl becomes full Loki writhes in extreme pain, causing the earth to shake and resulting in what we know as an earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{noticing that}} his bar was empty, the present-day Moe {{arrives at the}} Simpsons' home and begins to recall {{the events of that}} day. He remembers that while they <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, they go to the old quarry for a swim, and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was no water but only mud. However, Homer recalls that there was no water in the quarry because {{something}} was blocking the inlet pipe. When Homer unblocks it, he finds a rotting corpse in it, causing him to scream.|$|E
5|$|The Department for Education is the {{government}} department responsible for issues affecting people in England up {{to the age of}} 19, including education. State-run and state-funded schools are attended by approximately 93% of English schoolchildren. Of these, a minority are faith schools (primarily Church of England or Roman Catholic schools). Children who are between the ages of 3 and 5 attend nursery or an Early Years Foundation Stage reception unit within a primary school. Children between the ages of 5 and 11 attend primary school, and secondary school is attended by those aged between 11 and 16. After finishing compulsory education, students take GCSE examinations. Students may then opt to continue into further education for two years. Further education colleges (particularly sixth form colleges) often form part of a secondary school site. A-level examinations are <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> a large number of further education students, and often form the basis of an application to university.|$|E

5|$|The {{last half}} of the century's first decade was a time of sorrow, {{loneliness}} and constant work for Pankhurst. In 1907 she sold her home in Manchester and began an itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place as she spoke and marched for women's suffrage. She stayed with friends and in hotels, carrying her few possessions in suitcases. Although she was energised by the struggle–and found joy in giving energy to others– her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU. In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, Harry was paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed. She hesitated to leave the country while he was ill, but she needed money to pay for his treatment and the tour promised to be lucrative. On her return from a successful tour, she <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910. Five days later she buried her son, then spoke before 5,000 people in Manchester. Liberal Party supporters who had come to heckle her remained quiet as she addressed the crowd.|$|E

25|$|The {{school leaving}} age in Jersey was {{increased}} to 15 {{to try to}} stop youngsters getting into trouble on the streets, despite this, two girls aged 14 and 15 spent three days in jail for spitting cherry stones at Germans. The classrooms still in use were unheated and lighting was limited, even so examinations were set and <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> the older pupils.

Two other bodies were later discovered dumped in a shallow grave. As the paramilitaries left, they set fire to the village.|$|E

25|$|During his {{childhood}} Caine was occasionally sent {{to stay with}} his grandmother, Isabella, and uncle, William, a butcher-farmer, in their thatched cottage at Ballaugh on the Isle of Man. His grandmother nicknamed him 'Hommy-Beg', Manx for 'Little Tommy'. The island {{has a long history}} of folklore and superstition, passed from generation to generation. Continuing this tradition Grandmother Caine passed on her knowledge of local myths and legends to her grandson, telling him countless stories of fairies, witches, witch-doctors and the evil eye while they were <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> the fire.|$|E
25|$|Ralph's Wife's Lane is {{the main}} road {{connecting}} Banks with Crossens to the south. Its name has two origins: one that Ralph was a fisherman lost at sea or Ralph was a smuggler, again lost at sea. His wife's ghost {{is supposed to be}} looking for him. It has been reported that people have seen the ghost on dark winter nights walking from by St Stephens Church to Fiddler's Ferry holding a lamp waiting for her loved one to return home. The story states that she lit a lamp in her window every night and <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> it so he knew that she was waiting for him to return home. The site of the house is occupied by two bungalows.|$|E
25|$|Preston, however, {{could not}} draw the puritans {{to the side}} of Buckingham, whom they profoundly distrusted. Preston's friends urged the {{necessity}} of a conference on Montagu's books, and nominated on the one side John Buckeridge, Bishop of Rochester, and Francis White, then dean of Carlisle; on the other, Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and Preston. Buckingham played a double part, begging Preston as his friend to decline the conference, and letting others know that he had done with Preston. The conference was held in February 1626 at York House. Preston refused to take part, but came in after it was begun and <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> as a hearer. A second conference followed in the same month, at which Preston took the lead against Montagu and White.|$|E

Moreover, the completion of proof search is reduced to Boolean unsatisfiability and hence can be checked <b>by</b> <b>SAT</b> solvers. <b>By</b> encoding the local model checking algorithm in [13], SAT solvers are able to verify properties in the universal fragment of alternation-free µ-calculus formula on context-free processes...|$|R

25|$|Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was {{declared}} {{guilty of the}} three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against {{the internal and external}} security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities {{in the interest of the}} enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death. At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She put on a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash. Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution, (the present-day Place de la Concorde). She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> her in the cart, but she ignored him all the way to the scaffold.|$|E
500|$|During World War I, Singh {{initially}} {{supported the}} Indian soldiers and Lascars {{working in the}} British fleets and joined a 10,000-woman protest march against the prohibition of a volunteer female force.

500|$|Burke and Hare murdered two lodgers in June, [...] "an {{old woman}} and a dumb boy, her grandson", as Burke later {{recalled}} in his confession. While the boy <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> {{the fire in the}} kitchen, his grandmother was murdered in the bedroom by the usual method. Burke and Hare then picked up the boy and carried him to the same room where he was also killed. Burke later said that this was the murder that disturbed him the most, as he was haunted by his recollection of the boy's expression. The tea-chest that was usually used by the couple to transport the bodies was found to be too small, so the bodies were forced into a herring barrel and taken to Surgeons' Square, where they fetched £8 each. According to Burke's confession, the barrel was loaded onto a cart which Hare's horse refused to pull further than the Grassmarket. Hare called a porter with a handcart to help him transport the container. Once back in Tanner's Close, Hare took his anger out on the horse by shooting it dead in the yard.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} for [...] "Lemme See" [...] {{was released on}} June 14, 2012, and was directed by Philip Andelman. The video opens with a close-up of Usher's estate, and a woman bound by ropes. Usher is stood by a swimming pool singing the first verse, with the pool reflecting on him. During the pre-chorus, Usher is leaning against a wall while pulling up his top to reveal his chest. Entering the chorus, the video intercuts to Usher preparing drinks for himself and the tied up woman– his love interest. With the second verse, Usher is admiring his still tied up love interest. In the second pre-chorus, leaned against a wall Usher removes his shirt, while the video intercuts to him approaching his love interest to make love. Entering Rick Ross' verse, Ross is sat down shirtless, accompanied by two women <b>sat</b> <b>by</b> him left and right. Touching Ross' back, their tattoos transfer on to Ross and bloom. Him and Usher are both by a pool with Ross performing his rap, while in an intercut scene Usher's love interest is being released from her tied up predicament. In the final chorus, Usher and his love interest make love in a risqué scene, with both their tattoos moving and blooming on {{to each other in}} a similar way to Ross' scene. This alternates with the latter scene, Usher leaned against the wall and him and Ross by the pool, with Usher singing the verse. The video ends with Ross and Usher echoing the song's title.|$|E
