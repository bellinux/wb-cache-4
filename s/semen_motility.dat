Heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) is considered as an important gene affecting semen quality traits. The objectives {{of this study are}} to find single nucleotide polymorphisms in HSP 70 coding region and their association with semen quality traits on Boer and Boer cross bucks. DNA isolated from 53 goats (36 pure South African Boer and 17 Boer crosses) was subjected to PCR amplification of the exon 1 region of the caprine HSP 70 gene. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was used to detect polymorphisms and the variant DNA fragments were sequenced. Two synonymous SNPs (74 A>C (ss 836187517) and 191 C>G (ss 836187518)) were detected. Qualities of fresh and post-thaw semen were evaluated for sperm concentration, <b>semen</b> volume, sperm <b>motility</b> and velocity traits, live sperm percentage, and abnormal sperm rate. The C allele of ss 836187517 and G allele of ss 836187518 were at higher frequencies in both the breeds.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade long {{distance}} marathon running has become an important recreational activity. There is evidence that males {{with high levels of}} physical activity have some impairment of fertility. In order to investigate this further, 24 male marathon runners were studied over a period of a year. Each runner was assessed at regular intervals using hormonal profiles, anthropomorphic indices and semen evaluation. The training time and distance run increased progressively over the first five months of the study as the runners prepared for the Two Oceans marathon. Analysis of the serum hormonal profiles in this longitudinal study showed that the prolactin level increased when comparing the initial study month {{with the rest of the}} year and the progesterone level decreased. However the luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone and estradiol (E 2) levels remained unchanged. When the runners were divided into a high and low training group according to the distance run in the preceding week, the only significant difference was the lower mean serum FSH level in the high training group. A decrease in semen volume was demonstrated as the training time increased. This trend was reversed as the runners' training decreased after the Two Oceans marathon. The percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa showed an initial significant decrease in the first month of training. However, no significant difference was observed throughout the rest of year. An overall downward trend in <b>semen</b> <b>motility</b> in the first 5 months of the study was shown but this was only significant if the first and fifth study months were compared. The decrease in <b>semen</b> <b>motility</b> coincided with the period of maximum training. Since patients with an adequate sperm count but decreased motility have impaired fertility this finding is of considerable importance. In addition to the decrease in motility, there was a decrease in the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa when the initial month of low physical activity (December) was compared to all of the subsequent months analysed. This, too, is an important finding as the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa correlates directly with fertilisation and pregnancy rates. When the results were analysed in the high and low training months there was a significant difference in mean semen count and semen morphology. The mean count was higher in the high training group and this group also had a significantly higher normal morphology. However, there was no significant difference in semen volume and motility in the high and low training groups...|$|E

40|$|Life {{starts with}} fertilisation. Variation in {{fertility}} {{is caused by}} both farm and sow related parameters and boar and semen related parameters. Therefore, achieving high fertility is not obvious. Predominantly, artificial insemination (AI) is used for breeding pigs. The advantage of AI {{is that you can}} dilute semen from high fertile breeding boars and in this way inseminate many sows. The last years, the pig industry is increased in scale and evaluated in specialisation. Unfortunately there is no golden standard concerning the requirements for qualitative good semen. This thesis handles different semen quality characteristics in relation to fertility, showing that the effect of semen quality characteristics on the variation in fertility is relatively small. These effects seems small, but the economic value in a high producing pig industry is large, with the objective to minimise the variation between farms. Assessing semen quality characteristics objectively and relate them to field fertility leads to an efficient production of insemination doses, which results in an efficient spreading of the genetic genes. <b>Semen</b> <b>motility</b> assessed with CASA (Computer Assisted Semen Analysis) and analysing DNA damage are semen quality parameters which show a relation with fertility, in high fertile breeding boars.

40|$|Perfluorinated {{compounds}} (PFCs) {{have been}} suspected to adversely affect human reproductive health. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the associations between PFC exposure and male semen quality. PFCs were measured in serum from 588 partners of pregnant women from Greenland, Poland and Ukraine who provided a semen sample, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) could be detected in 97 of the samples. The associations between levels of these compounds and semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility and morphology were assessed. Across countries, sperm concentration, total sperm count and semen volume were not consistently associated with PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS or PFNA levels. The proportion of morphologically normal cells was 35 lower [95 confidence interval (CI) : 466) for the third tertile of PFOS exposure as compared with the first. A similar reduction was found in relation to increasing PFHxS levels. At the third PFOA exposure tertile, the percentage of motile spermatozoa was 19 (95 CI: 1 to 39) higher than in the first. The most robust finding in the present study was the negative associations between PFOS exposure and sperm morphology suggesting adverse effects of PFOS on semen quality, possibly due to interference with the endocrine activity or sperm membrane function.

Parameters assessed were (i) raw semen quality; volume, sperm concentration, total motility and morphology (ii) liquid <b>semen</b> quality; progressive <b>motility,</b> viability, hypotonic resistance and acrosomal integrity (iii) frozen-thawed <b>semen</b> quality; <b>motility,</b> thermal stress, viability, membrane fluidity and mitochondrial activity (iv) sperm and seminal plasma (SP) fatty acid composition (FAC) (v) total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of SP and (vi) farrowing rates and litter sizes of sows (n = 1158) inseminated with liquid semen. Boars consuming 75 g All-G-Rich had a larger semen volume (P 0. 05). There was no effect of dietary treatment on the FAC and TAC of SP or on farrowing rate and litter size (P > 0. 05). There was an effect of dietary treatment on the FAC of sperm, represented by an 1. 72 and 1. 60 fold increase in the DHA content for 75 and 150 g treatments, respectively, compared to the Ctl treatment.

Conclusions: The production of sperm with normal rates in the Guzerat breed is achieved when males reach the age of 28 months and a scrotal circumference close to 30 cm...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of {{ethylene}} glycol versus glycerol for dog semen freezing, on post-thaw longevity, motility and motility parameters, and on plasma membrane functional integrity. Semen was diluted in two steps with an egg yolk TRIS extender containing a final concentration of either 5 % glycerol or 5 % ethylene glycol, and frozen in 0. 5 ml straws, with 100 106 spermatozoa/ml, over nitrogen vapours. <b>Semen</b> <b>motility</b> was evaluated both under a light microscope and with a Computer Assisted Motility Analyser System, immediately after thawing and then hourly till 4 h of incubation. Sperm membrane functional integrity was assessed with the hypoosmotic swelling test (60 mOsm fructose solution) applied at thawing and then hourly, for 4 h, on incubated samples. Motility (light microscope) and total and progressive motility (analyser) were significantly higher in ethylene glycol frozen samples at thawing (P < 0. 01); from hour 1 onwards the effect of the cryoprotectant became not significant. Semen frozen with ethylene glycol showed higher path velocity and higher straight line velocity till 3 h after thawing; however, ethylene glycol semen samples also showed higher curvilinear velocity and higher lateral head displacement, which may indicate a capacitation-like condition affecting sperm membranes and possibly reducing post-thaw longevity. Functional integrity of plasma membrane was similar in glycerol and ethylene glycol samples till 3 h after thawing, then ethylene glycol samples showed a higher decline. The strong though short-lived positive effect of ethylene glycol is worth being evaluated further...|$|E
40|$|Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a pro-oxidant enzyme {{associated}} with decreased motility in thawed equine semen. This study aimed to describe MPO concentration, activity and subunits in raw and thawed semen and to correlate these data with motilities in raw and thawed semen. Semen samples from five stallions were collected four times. Motilities were assessed in raw and thawed semen. MPO assays were performed in raw seminal plasma, raw sperm-rich pellet and thawed semen. Total and active MPO concentrations were, respectively, assayed by {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} and specific immunological extraction followed by enzymatic detection. MPO subunits present in semen were characterized by Western 3 blot. Purified active MPO was added in PBS and freezing extender to control its activity during freezing procedure. Differences between medians were determined using Kruskal– Wallis test, and correlations were determined using Spearman’s test for nonparametric data. Active MPO concentration was low in seminal plasma and thawed semen, but high in pellet (p = 0. 0058), as the opposite relation was observed for total MPO concentration (p < 0. 0001). In seminal plasma and post- thaw semen, inactive 86 -kDa MPO precursor was mainly observed. Purified MPO activity was decreased in the extender (p = 0. 0286). MPO activity in pellet was highly correlated with thawed progressive motility (r = - 0. 5576, p = 0. 0086). Inac- tive MPO precursor and unknown low molecular weight inactive MPO precursor subunits explain low MPO activity in semen. Major MPO activity was observed in pellet, and post- thaw loss of activity is partially explained by MPO inactiva- tion in extender. Thawed <b>semen</b> <b>motility</b> was negatively correlated with MPO activity in pellet, becoming a potential freezability predictor. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Perfluorinated {{compounds}} (PFCs) {{have been}} suspected to adversely affect human reproductive health. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the associations between PFC exposure and male semen quality. METHODS PFCs were measured in serum from 588 partners of pregnant women from Greenland, Poland and Ukraine who provided a semen sample, using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) could be detected in > 97 % of the samples. The associations between levels of these compounds and semen volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility and morphology were assessed. RESULTS Across countries, sperm concentration, total sperm count and semen volume were not consistently associated with PFOS, PFOA, PFHxS or PFNA levels. The proportion of morphologically normal cells was 35 % lower [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 4 - 66 %) for the third tertile of PFOS exposure as compared with the first. A similar reduction was found in relation to increasing PFHxS levels. At the third PFOA exposure tertile, the percentage of motile spermatozoa was 19 % (95 % CI: 1 to 39 %) higher than in the first. CONCLUSIONS The most robust finding in the present study was the negative associations between PFOS exposure and sperm morphology suggesting adverse effects of PFOS on semen quality, possibly due to interference with the endocrine activity or sperm membrane function. It cannot be excluded that this association and the positive association between PFOA and <b>semen</b> <b>motility,</b> which was not consistent across countries, might represent a chance finding due to the multiple statistical tests being performed...|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} Cd on some male reproductive parameters; and explored the therapeutic potentials of methanolic extract of Phoenix dactylifera (MEPD) fruit in averting such reproductive damages. 45 rabbit bucks aged 24 - 28 weeks and weighing 1. 41 - 1. 43 kg was used. The rabbits were assigned to 5 treatment groups (control, Cd-only, Cd + 300 mg MEPD, Cd + 600 mg MEPD and Cd + 900 mg MEPD) in a completely randomized design. The rabbits were dosed with 3 mg CdCl 2 kg- 1 feed for 7 days followed by MEPD for 56 days after every 72 hours. Result of semen evaluation indicates that <b>semen</b> volume, <b>motility,</b> libido, concentration, total ejaculate, viability and morphology were significantly reduced by Cd compared to the normal control group. Testis density and epididymis length of the control rabbits were {{significantly different from the}} Cd-only exposed rabbits. Histopathological examination revealed severe testicular damage due to Cd. Indeed, treatment with MEPD significantly reversed the deleterious reproductive effects caused by Cd. In conclusion, cadmium drastically affected the testis of rabbits and treatment with MEPD alleviated some deleterious effects. ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the effect of breed, season and age on quantity and quality parameters of fresh bull's semen. A total of 168 samples of bull's ejaculate were analysed for this study consisting of Bali, Brahman, Charolais, Jersey, Limousin, Mafriwal and Piedmontese breeds. The age of bulls ranged from 46 to 112 months. By utilizing artificial vagina, the collection of semen was carried out in both dry and rainy season. Volume of semen samples, sperm concentration, percentage of motile spermatozoa and percentage of progressive motility spermatozoa were evaluated immediately after collection. By performing Duncan's Multiple Range Test, the difference between any two mean was evaluated. The result of the study indicated that breed affected the volume of semen very significantly (P 0. 05). Meanwhile, season indicated that there was highly significant effect (P 0. 05) effect on volume of <b>semen,</b> sperm <b>motility</b> and progressive motility of spermatozoa. Meanwhile, effect of age of bulls was found to be significant (P< 0. 05) on total sperm concentration. It is recommended that breed, season and age chosen to conduct semen collection is given particular attention to obtain the best possible semen quantity and quality...|$|R
