She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black brassiere, spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building. Azalea, dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, who drive the man's convertible out into the desert. Azalea is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a custom-made dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E

25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> {{with a cup}} of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of the stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off to her right, with some reflected light {{on the left side of}} her face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E

He breaks into Valestra's home and discovers a photograph of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table.</b> When he visits Andrea to try to get more answers she rebuffs him, intimating that she knows his identity. Meanwhile, Valestra believes Batman killed the others and will come for him, so he turns to the Joker for help.|$|E
500|$|James Fox, {{journalist}} {{and author of the}} non-fiction book White Mischief: The Murder of Lord Erroll, was credited, along with Keith Richards, as co-author. He had previously interviewed Richards in 1973 and the pair had been friends since then. Reportedly, $7.3 million was paid for the work in 2007, [...] "on the basis of a 10-page excerpt". Fox spent [...] "hundreds of hours" [...] with Richards at his Caribbean home, and also in the United Kingdom, to gather material for the book. He interviewed Richards at length and also talked to many associates. Fox said of Richards, [...] "I'd have to catch him like a salmon." [...] The interviews were conducted <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table,</b> but the two were not opposite each other. Richards always played music, so Fox provided him with a lapel microphone. [...] The subject matter was not handled chronologically; Fox allowed his subject to mentally [...] "dart about". [...] "Some sessions lasted hours and some, dealing with the more painful parts of Richards' life, lasted just minutes." [...] The project took five years to complete.|$|E

500|$|The {{customers}} who arrived on La Caravelle‍s {{last night of}} business were a mixture of regulars who had come for one last meal and bid farwell, {{as well as those}} who had never visited it before and wanted to see a piece of New York history before it was no more. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Cronkite dined with colleague Andy Rooney and his daughter; the Cronkites said they had been patrons of La Caravelle for 43 years. A couple came with their teenage daughter, who was so fussy about food, the La Caravelle chef would cook a packaged macaroni and cheese dinner for her. [...] Another family of three made reservations for four; one for the husband's mother who had been a La Caravelle regular and had died in 2000. People with no reservations managed to gain entrance to the restaurant's bar and were able to be <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table.</b> [...] A young couple who had come to have a drink on La Caravelles last night was graciously seated at the table which was formerly reserved for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who continued to patronize the restaurant after her marriage to Aristotle Onassis. Upon entering the restaurant's main room, a woman exclaimed that it was her best New York moment and she could now move to the suburbs. Though the restaurant never offered music or entertainment, the Jammets had arranged for Robert White, a tenor and teacher at the Juilliard School to perform [...] "Danny Boy". White was a patron of La Caravelle on the restaurant's first night of business in 1960. It was awarded the James Beard Foundation's Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the year of its closing. [...] The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its house brand in 1997.|$|E

While in Salt Lake City, the two argued, {{and for a time}} separated. [...] However, by the summer of 1867 the two were working together again, by this time in Helena, Montana. On the night of July 22, 1867, Peel and Bull were <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> in the [...] "Greer Brothers Exchange Saloon", and for some reason the argument they had previously had was rekindled. Both men jumped to their feet and became arguing loudly.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} {{that can be done to}} strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one can sit on the floor with the hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of isometric exercise for the gastrocnemius would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> with their feet flat on the ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised off the floor and the gastrocnemius flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being propped on an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the gastrocnemius muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E
2500|$|Harlan Ellison's {{original}} {{version of the}} teleplay won the annual Writers Guild of America Award for [...] Justman later said that the submission of the original unfilmed version was out of spite, and Roddenberry said {{in response to the}} victory [...] "many people would get prizes if they wrote scripts that budgeted out to three times the show's cost." [...] The WGA rules allow only the credited writers to submit scripts for consideration, who may submit whichever draft of theirs that they may choose. It was up against another Star Trek episode, nominated by the production team; [...] "The Return of the Archons". Coon reportedly said at the time: [...] "If Harlan wins, I'm going to die", and that [...] "there are two scripts up tonight for the Writers' Guild Award, and I wrote them both." [...] On the night, Roddenberry and several of the crew were <b>seated</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>table</b> which Desilu had purchased, while Ellison was at another. When he won, the Star Trek party rose to their feet and applauded, since they believed it would bring credibility to the series. Herbert Franklin Solow later recalled that this elation turned to horror when Ellison began talking about the interference of studio executives in the writing process, before holding aloft a copy of the original script and yelling [...] "Remember, never let them rewrite you!" [...] Ellison walked past the Desilu table as he left the podium, and shook the copy of the script at Roddenberry and his party.|$|E
