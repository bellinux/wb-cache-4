5|$|Impaired {{muscle power}} – With {{impairments}} in this category, the force generated by muscles, {{such as the}} muscles of one limb, {{one side of the}} body or {{the lower half of the}} body is reduced, (e.g. spinal cord injury, <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> post-polio syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Katie Hill {{was born}} in Kogarah, New South Wales, on 17 February 1984, the {{youngest}} of three children. She has <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> a condition she has had since birth. , she lives in Panania, New South Wales, and works as a receptionist at Salesforce.com.|$|E
5|$|Hannah Dodd {{was born}} on 27 April 1992, and is from Arcadia, New South Wales. She has sacral {{agenesis}} and <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> with upper limb dystonia, and is missing four vertebrae in her back. When she was about a year old, her kidneys started failing. Her entire renal system needed to be reconstructed. She has two older brothers. She can walk with the aide of a caliper, and also uses a wheelchair. , she is a horse riding teacher and student at the University of Western Sydney where she is majoring in sports and exercise science.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 1944, Williams married Audrey Sheppard. It was {{her second}} {{marriage}} and his first. Their son, Randall Hank Williams, who would achieve fame {{in his own}} right as Hank Williams Jr., was born on May 26, 1949. The marriage, always turbulent, rapidly disintegrated, and Williams developed a serious problem with alcohol, morphine, and other painkillers prescribed for him to ease the severe back pain caused by his <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> The couple divorced on May 29, 1952.|$|E
5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> is a {{congenital}} {{disorder in}} which there is a defective closure of the vertebral arch. Sometimes the spinal meninges and also the spinal cord can protrude through this, and this is called <b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> cystica. Where the condition does not involve this protrusion it is known as <b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> occulta. Sometimes all of the vertebral arches may remain incomplete.|$|E
25|$|Other {{skeletal}} abnormalities, such as scoliosis (sometimes {{caused by}} <b>spina</b> <b>bifida)</b> {{might be possible}} contributors as well.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> is a {{birth defect}} {{where there is}} {{incomplete}} closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. There are three main types: <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases {{it may be the}} middle back or neck. Occulta has no or only mild signs. Signs of occulta may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot, or swelling on the back {{at the site of the}} gap in the spine. Meningocele typically causes mild problems with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine. Myelomeningocele, also known as open <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> is the most severe form. Associated problems include poor ability to walk, problems with bladder or bowel control, hydrocephalus, a tethered spinal cord, and latex allergy. Learning problems are relatively uncommon.|$|E
25|$|Most {{cases of}} <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> can be {{prevented}} if the mother gets enough folate before and during pregnancy. Adding folic acid to flour {{has been found to}} be effective for most women. Open <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> can be surgically closed before or after birth. A shunt may be needed in those with hydrocephalus, and a tethered spinal cord may be surgically repaired. Devices to help with movement such as crutches or wheelchairs may be useful. Urinary catheterization may also be needed.|$|E
25|$|Occasional problems: ptosis of the eyelid, microophthalmia, {{cleft lip}} {{with or without}} a cleft palate, webbed neck, short neck, tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> and hydrocephalus.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} causes of scoliosis, {{including}} congenital spine deformities (those present at birth like cerebral palsy, <b>spina</b> <b>bifida)</b> and neuromuscular problems, inherited diseases or conditions {{caused by the}} environment, limb length inequality and tumors.|$|E
25|$|Ramsay {{has been}} {{involved}} in a series of charitable events and organisations. He fulfilled his aim of finishing 10marathons in ten years by running his 10th consecutive London Marathon on 26 April 2009, sponsoring the Scottish <b>Spina</b> <b>Bifida</b> Association.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the nervous}} system include neural tube defects such as <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> meningocele, meningomyelocele, encephalocele and anencephaly. Other congenital anomalies {{of the nervous}} system include the Arnold-Chiari malformation, the Dandy-Walker malformation, hydrocephalus, microencephaly, megalencephaly, lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, holoprosencephaly, and agenesis of the corpus callosum.|$|E
25|$|Impaired {{muscle power}} - With {{impairments}} in this category, the force generated by muscles, {{such as the}} muscles of one limb, {{one side of the}} body or {{the lower half of the}} body is reduced, e.g. due to spinal-cord injury, <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> or polio.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies show}} a {{correlation}} between the consumption of potatoes suffering from late blight (which increases solanine and other glycoalkaloid levels) and the incidence of congenital <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> in humans. However, other studies have shown no correlation between potato consumption and the incidence of birth defects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. After having one child with the condition or if one of the parents has the condition, there is a 4% chance that the next child will also be affected. Not having enough folate in the diet before and during pregnancy also plays a significant role. Other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications, obesity, and poorly controlled diabetes. Diagnosis may occur either before or after a child is born. Before birth if a blood test or amniocentesis finds a high level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), there is a higher risk of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> Ultrasound examination may also detect the problem. Medical imaging can confirm the diagnosis after birth. It is a type of neural tube defect with other types including anencephaly and encephalocele.|$|E
25|$|Surgery {{is usually}} {{recommended}} by orthopedists for curves {{with a high}} likelihood of progression (i.e., greater than 45 to 50° of magnitude), curves that would be cosmetically unacceptable as an adult, curves in patients with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and cerebral palsy that interfere with sitting and care, and curves that affect physiological functions such as breathing.|$|E
25|$|Uganda: Specializing in {{treating}} neurosurgical needs, the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda opened in 2000 {{and has been}} recognized as a global leader in treatment of hydrocephalus. The hospital, located in Mbale, also treats children with neural tube defects, <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> epilepsy, and brain tumors. The training program brings in surgeons from many countries, including Bangladesh, the U.S., and Ghana.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{abnormal}} muscle physiology in Freeman–Sheldon syndrome, {{therapeutic measures}} may have unfavourable outcomes. Difficult endotracheal intubations and vein access complicate operative decisions in many DA2A patients, and malignant hyperthermia (MH) may affect individuals with FSS, as well. Cruickshanks et al. (1999) reports uneventful use of non-MH-triggering agents. Reports {{have been published}} about <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> occulta in anaesthesia management and cervical kyphoscoliosis in intubations.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{a lack of}} folic acid, a vitamin B, in {{the diet}} of a mother can cause {{cellular}} neural tube deformities that result in <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> Congenital disorders such as a neural tube deformity (NTD) can be prevented by 72% if the mother consumes 4 milligrams of folic acid before the conception and after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Folic acid, or vitamin B9, aids {{the development of the}} foetal nervous system.|$|E
25|$|EastEnders {{has been}} praised for its {{portrayal}} of characters with disabilities, including Adam Best (<b>spina</b> <b>bifida),</b> Noah Chambers (deaf), Jean Slater {{and her daughter}} Stacey (bipolar disorder), Janet Mitchell (Down syndrome) and Jim Branning (stroke). The show also features {{a large number of}} gay, lesbian and bisexual characters, including Colin Russell, Barry Clark, Simon Raymond, Tony Hills, Sonia Fowler, Naomi Julien, Tina Carter, Tosh Mackintosh, Ben Mitchell and Paul Coker. Kyle Slater, a transgender character, was introduced in 2015.|$|E
25|$|A study {{examining}} 806 {{women who}} had babies with birth defects between 1997 and 2006, and 849 {{women who had}} healthy babies, found that smog in the San Joaquin Valley area of California was linked to two types of neural tube defects: <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> (a condition involving, among other manifestations, certain malformations of the spinal column), and anencephaly (the underdevelopment or absence of part {{or all of the}} brain, which if not fatal usually results in profound impairment).|$|E
25|$|Kennedy Krieger {{scientists}} {{research to}} prevent and cure pediatric neurological disorders, spinal cord injuries and developmental disabilities. The Institute’s work has yielded answers that are improving the treatment and care of children with conditions such as autism, cerebral palsy and <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> A team of international scientists and investigators at Kennedy Krieger is working to isolate culprit genes and develop new treatment models and therapies. The institute has a swift transfer of research to patient care.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Cordero, {{whose work}} has been {{published}} in many national and international journals, has promoted the eradication of Rubella (German measles), {{a major cause of}} birth defects that can be prevented through vaccination. He has also promoted research to determine the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities, and has promoted efforts to prevent serious birth defects (such as use of folic acid to prevent <b>Spina</b> <b>Bifida).</b> He is a strong supporter of programs that promote wellness of persons with disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Valproic acid, one of {{the most}} {{commonly}} prescribed anticonvulsants that is also used to treat certain psychological conditions, is a known inhibitor of folic acid, and as such, has been shown to cause neural tube defects and cases of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and cognitive impairment in the newborn. Because of this considerable risk, those mothers who must continue to use valproic acid or its derivatives during pregnancy to control their condition (as opposed to stopping the drug or switching to another drug or to a lesser dose) should take folic acid supplements under the direction and guidance of their health care providers.|$|E
25|$|Another health {{implication}} is {{the depletion of}} folate within the body, where the overexposure to UV light can lead to megaloblastic anemia. Folate deficiency in pregnant women can be detrimental {{to the health of}} their newborn babies in the form of neural tube defects, miscarriages, and <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> a birth defect in which the backbone and spinal canal do not close before birth. The peak of neural tube defect occurrences is the highest in the May–June period in the Northern Hemisphere. Folate is needed for DNA replication in dividing cells and deficiency can lead to failures of normal embryogenesis and spermatogenesis.|$|E
25|$|Rubella (German measles), is a {{major cause}} of birth defects that can be {{prevented}} through vaccination. Cordero, whose work has been published in many national and international journals, has promoted the eradication of the disease. He has also promoted research to determine the causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities, and has promoted efforts to prevent serious birth defects (such as use of folic acid to prevent <b>Spina</b> <b>Bifida).</b> He is a strong supporter of programs that promote wellness of persons with disabilities. Cordero served as President of the Teratology Society, a professional research society devoted to the prevention of birth defects.|$|E
25|$|Several {{anticonvulsants}} {{are known}} to be highly teratogenic. Phenytoin, also known as diphenylhydantoin, along with carbamazepine is responsible for the fetal hydantoin syndrome, which may typically include broad nose base, cleft lip and/or palate, microcephalia, nails and fingers hypoplasia, intrauterine growth restriction and mental retardation. Trimethadione taken during pregnancy is responsible for the fetal trimethadione syndrome, characterized by craniofacial, cardiovascular, renal and spine malformations, along with a delay in mental and physical development. Valproate has anti-folate effects, leading to neural tube closure-related defects such as <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> Lower IQ and autism have recently also been reported as a result of intrauterine valproate exposure.|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine is {{associated}} with the highest placental exposure of any atypical antipsychotic. Despite this, the available evidence suggests it is safe during pregnancy, although the evidence is insufficiently strong to say anything {{with a high degree of}} confidence. Olanzapine {{is associated}} with weight gain which according to recent studies may put olanzapine-treated patients' offspring at a heightened risk for neural tube defects (e.g. <b>spina</b> <b>bifida).</b> Breastfeeding in women taking olanzapine is advised against due to the fact that olanzapine is secreted in breast milk with one study finding that the exposure to the infant (in mg per kg of body weight, that is) is about 1.8% that to the mother.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{folic acid}} during {{pregnancy}} {{is vital to}} normal development {{of the nervous system}} in the fetus. A deficiency in folate levels of a pregnant woman could potentially result in neural tube disorder, a debilitating condition in which the tubes of the central nervous system do not fuse entirely. NTDs are {{not to be confused with}} <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> which does not involve neural elements. Neural tube defects can present in a number of ways as a result of the improper closure at various points of the neural tube. The clinical spectrum of the disorder includes encephalocele, craniorachischisis, and anencephaly. In addition, these defects can also be classified as open, if neural tissue is exposed or covered only by membrane, or can be classified as closed, if the tissue is covered by normal skin.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that adult human females are consistently lighter in skin pigmentation than males in the same population. This form of sexual dimorphism {{is due to the}} requirement in human females for high amounts of calcium during pregnancy and lactation. Breastfeeding newborns, whose skeletons are growing, require high amounts of calcium intake from the mother's milk (about 4 times more than during prenatal development), part of which comes from reserves in the mother's skeleton. Adequate vitamin D resources are needed to absorb calcium from the diet, and {{it has been shown that}} deficiencies of vitamin D and calcium increase the likelihood of various birth defects such as <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and rickets. Natural selection has led to females with lighter skin than males in all indigenous populations because women must get enough vitamin D and calcium to support the development of fetus and nursing infant and to maintain their own health.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{one-night stand}} with Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) in January 1994, Ricky does not enter into another serious {{relationship}} until August, when he begins dating Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). They move in together, but when Bianca begins to treat Ricky badly, he begins an affair with her best friend Natalie Price (Lucy Speed), in 1995. Natalie {{falls in love with}} Ricky and sets it up so that Bianca catches them kissing. Furious, Bianca finishes with Ricky, cutting up all his clothes and, after Ricky rejects Natalie, she flees Walford. Bianca eventually forgives Ricky and they reunite. Bianca strays with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), but immediately realises her mistake and marries Ricky on 17 April 1997. Later that year Bianca falls pregnant, but a prenatal scan reveals her unborn baby has both <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and hydrocephalus; the Butchers decide to terminate the pregnancy. The trauma devastates them both, but it does bring them closer and in September 1998 Bianca discovers she has fallen pregnant again, resulting in her prematurely giving birth to their son Liam on Christmas Day 1998. The following year, however, Bianca begins an affair with her mother Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) boyfriend, Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). When the affair is uncovered, the Butchers' marriage ends and Bianca departs with Liam for Manchester. Taunted by Dan and unhappy with his life and work, Ricky leaves Walford in April 2000.|$|E
25|$|FI {{is a sign}} or a symptom, not a diagnosis, and {{represents}} an extensive list of causes. Usually, it {{is the result of}} a complex interplay of several coexisting factors, many of which may be simple to correct. Up to 80% of people may have more than one abnormality that is contributing. Deficits of individual functional components of the continence mechanism can be partially compensated for a certain period of time, until the compensating components themselves fail. For example, obstetric injury may precede onset by decades, but postmenopausal changes in the tissue strength reduce in turn the competence of the compensatory mechanisms. The most common factors in the development are thought to be obstetric injury and after effects of anorectal surgery, especially those involving the anal sphincters and hemorrhoidal vascular cushions. The majority of incontinent persons over the age of 18 fall into one of several groups: those with structural anorectal abnormalities (sphincter trauma, sphincter degeneration, perianal fistula, rectal prolapse), neurological disorders (multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, <b>spina</b> <b>bifida,</b> stroke, etc.), constipation/fecal loading (presence of a large amount of feces in the rectum with stool of any consistency), cognitive and/or behavioral dysfunction (dementia, learning disabilities), diarrhea, inflammatory bowel diseases (e.g. ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease), irritable bowel syndrome, disability related (people who are frail, acutely unwell, or have chronic/acute disabilities), and those cases which are idiopathic (of unknown cause). Diabetes mellitus is also known to be a cause, but the mechanism of this relationship is not well understood.|$|E
25|$|Ricky and Bianca reunite and get engaged {{but she has}} {{sex with}} Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), but soon regrets it when she fears she is {{pregnant}} by him. It's a false alarm, but she realises how much Ricky means to her, so she marries him. She becomes pregnant, but a prenatal scan shows her unborn child has <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and hydrocephalus. Distraught, Bianca has an abortion, which strains her marriage. Ricky learns of her infidelity with Lenny after a STD scare. Ricky considers ending their marriage, but Bianca convinces him to give her another chance and she becomes pregnant again. She gives birth to baby Liam on Christmas Day in The Queen Vic, helped by her enemy Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp)--her best friend Tiffany's volatile husband. Bianca's mother Carol returns to Albert Square with her new fiancé Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), unaware that Bianca had a past relationship with him when she was underage (though {{he was unaware of}} this fact). Bianca and Dan rekindle their affair behind their partners' backs until Carol discovers she is pregnant by Dan. Bianca and Ricky plan to move to Manchester so Bianca can attend fashion college there. After finding an old photo of Bianca and Dan together, Carol demands to know their history. Dan tells Carol they had a romance years ago and swears on his unborn child's life that it's all over, but Bianca confesses when questioned and is disowned by Carol. Bianca leaves for Manchester after confessing to Ricky that she no longer loves him.|$|E
