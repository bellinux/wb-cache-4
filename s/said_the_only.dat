5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason he had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, {{and that they had}} left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E
25|$|Berlusconi {{remained}} as caretaker prime minister {{for a little}} over a month, until his replacement by a technocratic government headed by Lamberto Dini. Dini had been a key minister in the Berlusconi cabinet, and Berlusconi <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> way he would support a technocratic government would be if Dini headed it. In the end, however, Dini was supported by most of the opposition parties, but not by Forza Italia and Lega Nord. In 1996, Berlusconi and his coalition lost the elections and were replaced by a centre-left government led by Romano Prodi.|$|E
25|$|In May 1984 the New-Ireland Forum Report was published. Haughey was {{involved}} in the drafting of this {{at the time he was}} in office and had agreed to potential scenarios for improving the political situation of Northern Ireland. However, on publication, Haughey rejected it and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> possible solution was a United Ireland. This statement was criticised by the other leaders who forged the New-Ireland Forum, John Hume, Garret FitzGerald and Dick Spring. Desmond O'Malley supported the Forum report and criticised Haughey's ambiguous position, accusing him of stifling debate. At a Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party meeting to discuss the report, the whip was removed from O'Malley, which meant he was no longer a Fianna Fáil TD. Ironically when Haughey returned to power he embraced the Anglo-Irish Agreement that had developed from the New Ireland Forum Report.|$|E

DVD Talk described The Land of Gorch as the most serious mistake from the first season of Saturday Night Live, adding that the characters lacked humor and that {{the length of the}} sketches brought each episode to a dead stop. Author Wesley Hyatt <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> redeeming scene from the sketches was a duet between Lily Tomlin and Scred, singing [...] "I Got You Babe".|$|E

Kotowski said Ishiwatari is the mainstream in the soundtrack, while Ohuchi and Kusano [...] "somewhat disappoint", qualifying it as [...] "a great album" [...] in overall. Harry <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing bad about this album is its [...] "too short" [...] length. Writing {{for the same}} site, a reviewer dubbed GoldfishX rated it 7 out of 10, citing [...] "it lacks the depth of previous entries in the series." ...|$|E
500|$|The cast of {{both the}} British and American {{versions}} criticised the casting of Red Dwarf USA, particularly the part of Lister who is portrayed in the British version as a likable slob but in the US version as somewhat clean cut. In the 2004 documentary Dwarfing USA, Danny John-Jules <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> actor who could have successfully portrayed an American Lister was John Belushi. In a 2009 interview on Kevin Pollak's Chat Show, Bierko said that casting him as Lister was a [...] "huge mistake" [...] and also said a [...] "John Belushi type" [...] {{would have been better}} suited to the role.|$|E

She graded it [...] "C−", after [...] "deductions", and <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason {{it started with a}} [...] "C" [...] was due to it being interspersed with shots of the cast in their underwear. Patrick Burns of The Atlantic was also unimpressed, and questioned Lauren's spot in the glee club, commenting [...] "her brazen character never ceases to please, but it's just not believable that she would join the glee club if she cannot sing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Park Safety" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with several}} reviewers particularly praising {{the scene in}} which Jerry gives an embarrassing presentation to his co-workers. Andy Samberg's performance, however, received mostly negative reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Sandra Gonzalez called [...] "Park Safety" [...] a great episode, and complimented the scenes involving Jerry and the growing romance between Andy and April. Gonzalez <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> negative aspect was Samberg, of whom she said, [...] "the scream-talking gag got old fast". Alan Sepinwall, television columnist with The Star-Ledger, also enjoyed the scene with Jerry's presentation, and praised the show for fleshing out its minor characters, comparing it to The Office and its similar treatment of supporting characters during its second season. Sepinwall said Samberg's character was [...] "a little too broad for the show's buttoned-down style" [...] but led to some funny moments.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger {{called it a}} [...] "balls to the wall, gut-busting, amazing Office episode", and called the fire opening scene [...] "not only the best Office pre-credits sequence ever, but an all-time sitcom classic". Sepinwall said [...] "Stress Relief" [...] was accessible to newcomers and regular viewers, and displayed both the comedic and human sides of the characters. He <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> drawback of the episode was the Mrs. Albert Hannaday subplot, which he felt was an unnecessary gimmick added solely to accommodate the guest stars. TV Guide writer Shahzad Abbas wrote, [...] "This {{was one of my}} favorite episodes ever. It had me laughing the whole way through." [...] Abbas particularly praised the fire opening scene and the final scene in which Michael insults everybody, which he called [...] "a very satisfying ending to the roast saga". He called the Black/Leachman romance [...] "creepy and hilarious", but described the Jim and Pam romance subplot as the weak link of the episode.|$|E

Sarah Rodman of the Boston Globe called [...] "Hot Tottie" [...] the essential track on the EP, {{and said that}} Jay-Z [...] "bumps up the fun factor" [...] on the [...] "burbling" [...] track. Mark Edward Nero of About.com gave the song a positive review, {{saying that it was}} [...] "a rock-solid tour de force featuring Usher vocalizing how smooth he is." [...] Nero also commended Jay-Z's verse but <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> negative to the song was Ester Dean's vocals which were similar to those of Rihanna. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly stated that the song is [...] "nasty in all the right ways", Jeff Weiss of the Los Angeles Times says that Usher remains on the [...] "R's A-list" [...] with tracks like the song, calling it [...] "as intoxicating as its namesake".|$|E
500|$|Licciardello {{stated that}} they did not know they had entered the red zone, and [...] "we had the advice of our lawyers ring in our ears; 'Do NOT go into the red zone. You can go into the green zone if they let you, but DO NOT go into the red zone.'" [...] He said that they [...] "were {{absolutely}} sure we would never get past the first checkpoint. It was panic stations when we realised", adding that it was a [...] "stupid gag that backfired". Morrow said that the purpose of the stunt was [...] "an attempt to satirise in a silly way the very heavy security and the spin surrounding that security, it was a test of the old adage that if you want to get in somewhere the best way is right through the front door. I didn't want the stunt to happen in a way that resulted in people getting arrested. If we've made a mistake and crossed into the green zone, I'm very regretful about that." [...] He <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason they impersonated bin Laden was because they needed a joke to get out of the stunt that they always assumed would never have passed security.|$|E

According to a police affidavit, [...] "Johnson <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason for such killing would be because Obama is black." [...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, they were here to do that, to assassinate him ... it's about as hard for me to swallow as it is for you to understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. He ought to be shot." ...|$|E

Brown detailed his reasons, saying he hadn't made [...] "Yellow Ticket," [...] because he had been ashamed to ask Lionel Barrymore to play the lead, that he handed back the script for [...] "Raffles," [...] because Samuel Goldwyn wouldn't let him update it and had told Brown that he'd been hired to direct, not to write.

2500|$|Donegal's defence {{of their}} All-Ireland title began against Tyrone on 26 May 2013.
