5|$|Numerous {{claims of}} diamond {{synthesis}} were documented between 1879 and 1928; {{most of those}} attempts were carefully analyzed but none were confirmed. In the 1940s, <b>systematic</b> <b>research</b> began in the United States, Sweden and the Soviet Union to grow diamonds using CVD and HPHT processes. The first reproducible synthesis was reported around 1953. Those two processes still dominate the production of synthetic diamond. A third method, known as detonation synthesis, entered the diamond market in the late 1990s. In this process, nanometer-sized diamond grains are created in a detonation of carbon-containing explosives. A fourth method, treating graphite with high-power ultrasound, has been demonstrated in the laboratory, but currently has no commercial application.|$|E

A department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University in 1938. Estonian oil shale industries conducted tests of oil shale samples from Australia, Bulgaria, Germany and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|All named {{species of}} Plateosaurus except the type species and P.gracilis {{have turned out}} to be junior {{synonyms}} of the type species or invalid names. Von Huene practically erected a new species and sometimes a new genus for each relatively complete find from Trossingen (three species of Pachysaurus and seven of Plateosaurus) and Halberstadt (one species of Gresslyosaurus and eight of Plateosaurus). Later, he merged several of these species, but remained convinced that more than one genus and more than one species of Plateosaurus was present in both localities. Jaekel also believed that the Halberstadt material included several plateosaurid dinosaurs, as well as non-plateosaurid prosauropods. <b>Systematic</b> <b>research</b> by Galton drastically reduced the number of genera and species. Galton synonymised all cranial material, and described differences between the syntypes of P.engelhardti and the Trossingen material, which he referred to P.longiceps. Galton recognized P.trossingensis, P.fraasianus and P.integer to be identical to P.longiceps. Markus Moser, however, showed that P.longiceps is itself a junior synonym of P.engelhardti. Furthermore, a variety of species in other genera were created for material belonging to P.engelhardti, including Dimodosaurus poligniensis, Gresslyosaurus robustus, Gresslyosaurus torgeri, Pachysaurus ajax, Pachysaurus giganteus, Pachysaurus magnus and Pachysaurus wetzelianus.|$|E

5|$|In Poland, the {{earliest}} archeological sites considered Slavic include {{a limited number}} of 6th-century settlements and a few isolated burial sites. The material obtained there consists mostly of simple, manually formed ceramics, typical of the entire early Slavic area.

The largest of {{the earliest}} Slavic (Prague culture) settlement sites in Poland that have been subjected to <b>systematic</b> <b>research</b> is located in Bachórz, Rzeszów County, and dates to the second half of 5th through 7th centuries.

A stone furnace was usually placed in a corner, which is typical for Slavic homesteads of that period, but clay ovens and centrally located hearths are also found. 45 newer dwellings of a different type from the 7th/8th to 9th/10th centuries have also been discovered in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, Estonian {{oil shale}} was {{described}} by several scientists and used as a low-grade fuel. Its use in industry commenced in 1916. Production of shale oil began in 1921 and oil shale was first used to generate electrical power in 1924. Shortly thereafter, <b>systematic</b> <b>research</b> into oil shale and its products began, and in 1938 a department of mining was established at Tallinn Technical University. After World War II, Estonian oil shale gas was used in Saint Petersburg (then called Leningrad) and in northern cities in Estonia {{as a substitute for}} natural gas. Increased need for electricity in the north-west of the Soviet Union led to the construction of large oil shale-fired power stations. Oil shale extraction peaked in 1980. Subsequently, the launch of nuclear reactors in Russia, particularly the Leningrad Nuclear Power Station, reduced demand for electricity produced from oil shale, and, along with a post-Soviet restructuring of the industry in the 1990s, led to a decrease in oil shale mining. After decreasing for two decades, oil shale mining started to increase again {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century.|$|E

However, the earliest written documentation comes from the arrival of European explorers on the American continent, and the earliest academic research comes from the late 19th century.

25|$|Taking into {{consideration}} the presence of folk music, the aspirations of the Illyrians went far beyond the results achieved, something that is also continued {{in the work of}} Ivan Zajc (1832–1914) {{in the second half of}} the century. His masterpiece, the opera Nikola Šubić Zrinjski, ever since its opening night in Zagreb in 1876, had not lost in popularity, partly because its heroic patriotism functions as a symbol of Croatia's victory. Finally, owing to the founder of Croatian ethno-musicology and musical historiography, Franjo Kuhač (1834–1911), the <b>systematic</b> <b>research</b> of folklore evolved simultaneously with Zajc's endeavours. Finally it should be added that in Zajc's and Kuhač's era, major halls for musical performances and concerts were built: in Zagreb the building of the Croatian Music Institute (1876, 1895) with a concert hall, and the building of the Croatian National Theatre (1895), including the theatre buildings in Rijeka (1885), Split (1893) and Osijek (1907) where, along with the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb, drama, opera and ballet performances are still played today.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} {{researchers}} from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine led by Griffiths {{conducted a study}} to assess the immediate and long-term psychological effects of the psilocybin experience, using {{a modified version of}} the mystical experience questionnaire and a rigorous double-blind procedure. When asked in an interview about the similarity of his work with Leary's, Griffiths explained the difference: [...] "We are conducting rigorous, <b>systematic</b> <b>research</b> with psilocybin under carefully monitored conditions, a route which Dr. Leary abandoned in the early 1960s." [...] The National Institute of Drug Abuse-funded study, published in 2006, has been praised by experts for the soundness of its experimental design. In the experiment, 36 volunteers without prior experience with hallucinogens were given psilocybin and methylphenidate (Ritalin) in separate sessions; the methylphenidate sessions served as a control and psychoactive placebo. The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W. Hood; 61% of subjects reported a [...] "complete mystical experience" [...] after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased life satisfaction and sense of well-being. About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme [...] "experience of fear" [...] or dysphoria (i.e., a [...] "bad trip") at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session); about one-third of these (13% of the total) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject's sense of well-being.|$|E

[...] Recent analysis in Texas has provided evidence about the effectiveness of leaders by looking at how the gains in student achievement for a school change after the principal changes. [...] This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the value-added modeling that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers. [...] The early research in Texas finds that principals have a very large impact on student achievement. [...] Conservative estimates indicate that an effective school leader improves the performance of all students in a school, with the magnitude equal on average to two months additional learning gains for the students in each school year. [...] These gains come at least in part through the principal's impact on selecting and retaining good teachers. [...] Ineffective principals, however, have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important with respect to school leadership as they are for teachers.|$|E
