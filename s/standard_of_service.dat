25|$|This {{resulted}} in the remaining three Southerner cars, cars from the Picton/Greymouth pool and two former Picton/Greymouth cars that were heavily refurbished and overhauled for the new TranzAlpine Express keeping the services running, and also saw the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> drop considerably. The three full buffet cars were still utilised. The two TranzAlpine cars had their Addington seat numbers reduced from 52 to 50. The seats were reupholstered and modified before being reinstalled, and were re-arranged into bays of four, alcove-style, around tables. These two cars, still retaining their small windows, were permanently allocated to the Southerner when the TranzAlpine was made an all-panorama train.|$|E
25|$|Some {{observers}} {{have suggested that}} the company should be given credit for increasing the <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled Golden Arches East looked at the impact McDonald's had on East Asia and Hong Kong, in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald's was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. McDonald's has taken to partnering up with Sinopec, the second largest oil company in the People's Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country's growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants. McDonald's has opened a McDonald's restaurant and McCafé on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, The Louvre.|$|E

Monmouth, for example, was based in the Shire Hall until it was closed in 2002 because of the poor standard of the court accommodation, the lack of access for people with disabilities and the high cost to run the court compared with the use it received. The Government estimated in March 2000 that the closure of 55 county courts in England and Wales (including 9 courts in Wales) in the previous 6 years had saved a minimum of £6million, through reductions in rent and accommodation charges, running costs and judicial expense.|$|E

These guidelines represented a philosophy whose concept was very close to that of the 1950s, spread amongst industry in general under the names [...] "Design for maintenance" [...] and [...] "Reliable system design".|$|E
