This change came {{in unison}} with an overarching organizational name change from Student Publications, Inc., to Collegian Media Group. The Collegian's logo was {{changed from a}} graphic design of the text Kansas State Collegian to the collegian in lower case text with [...] "independent voice for Kansas State University" [...] as a <b>sub-header</b> in the logo. The logo also has a new insignia that is two apostrophes in a circle to form a [...] "C".|$|E

Due to the high quality requirements soldered connections and the specific design of the nozzle, it became necessary in the development and testing of a new non-conventional non-destructive testing method – laser-ultrasound diagnosis. In accordance with regulatory guidelines, quality control soldered connections is allowed to use an acoustic kind of control methods of the reflected light, transmitted light, resonant, free vibration and acoustic emission. Attempts to use traditional methods of non-destructive testing did not lead to positive results. This is due primarily to the size of typical solder joint defects, as well as the structural features of the rocket engine, the data structure is not controllable. In connection with this, a new method that provides quality control soldered connections cameras LRE based on the thermo generation of ultrasound. Methods of ultrasonic flaw detection of photoacoustic effect, in most cases, have a number of advantages over methods that use standard (traditional) piezo transducers. In the course of studies have found that the sensitivity of the laser-ultrasonic method and flaw detector UDL- 2 M can detect lack of adhesion in the solder joints on the upper edges of the nozzle in the <b>sub-header</b> area of the site...|$|E

30|$|The Superframe {{structure}} of IEEE 802.15. 6 MAC comprises of three main modules that are MAC header, MAC variable length and frame check sequences (FCS). The MAC header reserves 7 bytes, the variable length reserves 0 – 255 bytes and FCS reserves 2 bytes {{as depicted in}} Fig.  4. The MAC frame body is further categorized into three <b>sub-headers</b> that are (a) Data Freshness which occupies 1 byte to protect data from the reply attack, (b) Message Integrity Code (MIC) occupies 4 bytes to authenticate the frame and maintains the integrity check of a frame, and (c) Data Payload contains data with MIC headers in the frame. Moreover, IEEE 802.15. 6 MAC header is categorized into 4 <b>sub-headers.</b> First, the Frame Control occupies 4 bytes and uses to distinguish between control frame and data frame along with an acknowledgment. The second and third headers are the addresses of the receiver and sender sensors, respectively. Each sensor uses 1 byte to store the address. The BANC header is the final header which occupies 1 byte to store the address. The slot allocation {{to the nature of}} a patient’s data in both IEEE 802.15. 4 and IEEE 802.15. 6 MACs is the responsibility of a BANC. Therefore, the draft version of IEEE 802.15. 6 MAC defines three ways for transmitting the patient’s data [4, 15] which are discussed in the following subsections.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Relational data {{is often}} encoded in tables. Tables {{are easy to}} read by humans, but {{difficult}} to interpret automatically. In cases where table layout cues are not obtainable (missing HTML tags) or where columns are distorted (by copying from a spreadsheet to text) previous table extraction approaches run into problems. This paper introduces a novel table parsing approach. Our approach {{is based on a}} set of simple assumptions: (a) every table can be split up in data cells and headers, and (b) every table can be parsed beginning from a data cell utilizing the overall table structure. The table parsing is defined as “table flattening ” in this paper. That is, the parsing starts with a data cell and pulls out all token (i. e., headers and <b>sub-headers)</b> associated with a respective data cell. We propose a parsing technique that uses two simple parsing heuristics: table headers are to the left of and above a data cell. We experimented with trader emails that contained instrument information with bid-ask prices as data cells. We developed a clustering and classifying method for finding prices reliably in the data set we used. This method is transferable to other data cell types and can be applied to other table content.

40|$|Your Open Poster {{abstract}} {{is expected}} to have one page in total length. Note that this sample is a representative of the expected handout length if your Open Poster abstract is accepted. Do not use footnotes. Rather write your text to include all essential ideas and to be free from material of low importance. If you have no other option and must use a footnote, number the footnotes separately in superscripts 1. Place the actual footnote {{at the bottom of the}} column in which it is cited. Do not put footnotes in the reference list or exceed the margins limits. As the Open Poster handout will be published in US letter format, it seems advisable to set up the layout on your PC/Mac/workstation in this format 8. 5 ” x 11 ” (21. 59 cm × 27. 94 cm, 1 ” = 2. 54 cm). In this format, define 1. 905 cm (. 75 inch) wide left and right margins and high top and bottom low margins. Define a two-column layout, with a space of. 25 ” (0. 635 cm) between columns. The title/author/affiliation section should be centered above both columns. NO blank lines between, title, authors and institutions. Text Formatting Please use Times New Roman throughout the entire OPEN POSTER abstract, from title, authors, affiliation, headers, and <b>sub-header,</b> to figure and table captions, and references. To achieve a unified look across the proceedings, the following formats should be used for the main paragraph types, as illustrated also by this sample manuscript: • TITLE: • Authors...|$|E
