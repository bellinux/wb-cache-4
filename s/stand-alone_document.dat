50|$|While at Fullerton College, {{and through}} her biology students, Dickersin {{learned about the}} field of epidemiology, which she liked because it merges science with {{societal}} concerns and involves experimental research (clinical trials). In addition, in the late 1970s Dickersin believed the opportunities for women in laboratory research were limited. These two factors led her to switch research areas to public health, a field that she believed is more friendly to women. Dickersin matriculated at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1979, focusing on clinical trials, and Curtis L. Meinert became her advisor. Her graduate education was interrupted when {{the family moved to}} Boston for 4 years in 1981 so that her husband could attend medical school. During this interlude she worked with two influential mentors, Thomas C. Chalmers and Sir Iain Chalmers, and became interested in research synthesis and related biases. When she returned to Baltimore to complete her PhD, she worked on clinical trials as well as research directly linked to publication bias. Her PhD dissertation, “Publication and the Meta-analysis of Clinical Trials,” was the first in her Department to use the model where a group of related research papers is bound together with linking text, rather than the traditional model of <b>stand-alone</b> <b>document</b> with related chapters.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} the aim {{to take stock}} of the {{scientific}} field concerning the Structural Approach of Social Representations developed in more than 50 years by conducting a meta-theoretical analysis (de Rosa, 1994) of the literature on Social Representations, mapping its development, the related research methods, the thematic areas and their impact on the various applied fields within the multi-generational community of scientists and across different geo-cultural contexts. We analysed journal articles, book chapters, conference presentations, theses, manuscripts or <b>stand-alone</b> <b>documents</b> that used this approach. These papers were retrieved from different sources such as online journals, papers published online by the authors, paper format of the publications that we scanned and analyzed, along with the already gathered publications during the 20 years of work of prof. de Rosa. The analysis of the 1025 publications using Structural Approach of SR was conducted using the Grid for Meta-theoretical Analysis developed by de Rosa (1994) in order to gather the data, followed by the analyses done with Iramuteq Software (for the abstracts and key-words), with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (for descriptive statistics), with Tableau Software (for visualizing the data) and with R Software (for Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components). The results proved a great spreading of the work concerning Structural Approach of SR all over the world, being “a multicultural, multi-language and multi-generational enterprise” (de Rosa, 2009) that has continuously developed since Abric`s thesis (1976) and present, both theoretically, as well as methodologically...|$|R

40|$|Not {{submitted}} as official thesis?Chapter 1 of {{this report}} examines {{the current state of}} aquaculture and identifies two major environmental concerns associated with it, namely nutrient pollution by effluent and use of fishmeal-based feed. Together, these concerns cast doubts on the sustainability of aquaculture with current techniques. The studies outlined herein address these issues through 1) aquaponic filtration of the aquaculture effluents and 2) the use of the Black Soldier Fly, Hermetia illucens, as an alternative to fishmeal in aquaculture feedstuffs. The introductory chapter examines the current state of aquaculture and makes the case that aquaponics is a viable option to manage aquaculture effluent in recirculating systems. Furthermore, Black Soldier Flies offer a locally sourced feed that is more sustainable, both economically and environmentally, than fish-meal based fish feed. Chapter 2 provides a detailed discussion of the logistics of aquaponics and Black Soldier Fly culture used in these studies. Separated as two <b>stand-alone</b> <b>documents,</b> Chapter 2 is developed as: i) Considerations of Aquaponics and ii) Techniques for Black Soldier Fly Culture with the intention of publication of each through the Agricultural Extension purview of the College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources of the University of Hawai’i Mānoa. These documents were written as a combination of literature review and case analysis of different systems built in support of these studies, and are intended for an audience of farmers, aquaculturalists, homeowners, researchers, investors, and others that are interested in sustainable aquaculture. Once the reader is convinced of both the importance and feasibility of both aquaponics and Black Soldier Fly Culture, the ultimate question is presented, “Are Black Soldier Flies a legitimate food for catfish?” Chapter 3 is the culminating research project, presented as a journal article, to answer this project’s central question...|$|R

This RmAWP describes excavation, verification/confirmatory sampling, and reporting requirements for the project. Lower tier plans associated with the RmAWP, which are submitted as separate <b>stand-alone</b> <b>documents,</b> include a field sampling and analysis plan, a health and safety plan, a quality assurance project plan, a waste management plan, a data management implementation plan, and a best management practices plan.

40|$|In today's {{data-centric}} world {{many applications}} rely on data {{that comes from}} multitude of different sources. To integrate that data two major operations are performed: finding semantic mapping between data sources, and transforming structure of the data sources. One of the well-established standards for storing and sharing structured and semantically described data is XML. This paper describes system called XMapper, {{which is used to}} generate semantic mapping between two XML sources that describe instances from the same domain. The described system is novel in two ways. It uses only <b>stand-alone</b> XML <b>documents</b> (without DTD or XML schema documents) to generate the mappings. It also utilizes machine learning to improve accuracy of such mappings for difficult domains. Several experiments that use artificial and real-life domains described by XML documents are used to test the proposed system. The results show that mappings generated by the XMapper are highly accurate for both types of XML sources. The generated mappings can be used by a data integration system to automatically merge content of XML data sources to provide unified information for a data processing application...|$|R
