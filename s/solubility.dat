Hydrogen <b>solubility</b> in metals {{is influenced by}} local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice. These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks, but the gas's high <b>solubility</b> is a metallurgical problem, contributing to the embrittlement of many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|In pharmacology, {{ionization}} of {{a compound}} alters its physical behaviour and macro properties such as <b>solubility</b> and lipophilicity, logp). For example, ionization of any compound {{will increase the}} <b>solubility</b> in water, but decrease the lipophilicity. This is exploited in drug development to increase the concentration of a compound in the blood by adjusting the pKa of an ionizable group.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the {{mechanism}} of ethanol's effect, the increase of gas dissolved in nerve cell membranes may cause altered ion permeability properties of the neural cells' lipid bilayers. The partial pressure of a gas required to cause a measured degree of impairment correlates well with the lipid <b>solubility</b> of the gas: the greater the <b>solubility,</b> the less partial pressure is needed.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} <b>solubilities</b> of {{the mixture}} of nitrophenol (m- and p-) isomers were determined at 308, 318 and 328 K over a pressure range of 10 - 17. 55 MPa. Compared to the binary <b>solubilities,</b> the ternary <b>solubilities</b> of m-nitrophenol increased at 308, 318 and 328 K. The ternary <b>solubilities</b> of p-nitrophenol increased at 308 K, while the ternary <b>solubilities</b> decreased at lower pressures and increased at higher pressure at 318 and 328 K. The <b>solubilities</b> of the solid mixtures in supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO 2) were correlated with solution models by incorporating the non-idealities using activity coefficient based models. The Wilson and NRTL activity coefficient models were applied to determine the nature of the interactions between the molecules. The equation developed by using the NRTL model has three parameters and correlates mixture <b>solubilities</b> of solid solutes in terms of temperature and cosolute composition. The equation derived from the Wilson model contains five parameters and correlates <b>solubilities</b> in terms of temperature, density and cosolute composition. These two new equations developed in this work were used to correlate the <b>solubilities</b> of 25 binary solid mixtures including the current data. The average AARDs of the model equations derived using the NRTL and Wilson models for the solid mixtures were found to be 7 % and 4 %, respectively. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the <b>solubilities</b> of gases in liquids and liquids in liquids were modeled using both {{physical}} properties and topological descriptors of the solutes. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methods {{were employed to}} create single-linear regression (SLR) and multiple-linear regression (MLR) models of the <b>solubilities.</b> Factor analysis was employed {{to determine the number}} of significant factors present in the <b>solubilities.</b> The <b>solubilities</b> of monoalcohols in water, halogenated alkanes in water, gases in water, gases in alkanes, and gases in alcohols were examined and modeled...|$|R
40|$|The <b>solubilities</b> {{in water}} of four main ginger {{bioactive}} compounds, 6 -gingerol, 6 -shogaol, 8 -gingerol and 10 -gingerol, were predicted using a conductorlike screening model for real solvent (COSMO-RS) calculations. This {{study was conducted}} since no experimental data are available for ginger bioactive compounds <b>solubilities</b> in liquid phase of water. The s-profiles of these selected molecules were calculated using Gaussian software and the <b>solubilities</b> were calculated using the COSMO-RS method. The <b>solubilities</b> of these ginger bioactive compounds were calculated at 50 – 200 °C. In order to validate {{the accuracy of the}} COSMO-RS method, the <b>solubilities</b> of five hydrocarbon molecules were calculated using the COSMO-RS method and compared with the experimental data in the literature. The selected hydrocarbon molecules were 3 -pentanone, 1 -hexanol, benzene, 3 -methylphenol and 2 -hydroxy- 5 -methylbenzaldehyde. The calculated results of the hydrocarbon molecules are in good agreement with the data in the literature. These results confirm that the <b>solubilities</b> of ginger bioactive compounds can be predicted using the COSMORS method. The <b>solubilities</b> of the ginger bioactive compounds are lower than 1. 0 × 10 - 4 at temperatures lower than 130 °C. At 130 – 200 °C, the <b>solubilities</b> increase dramatically with the highest being 6 -shogaol, which is 3. 7 × 10 - 4 mole fraction, and the lowest is 10 -gingerol, which is 0. 39 × 10 - 4 mole fraction at 200 °C...|$|R
5|$|The <b>solubility</b> of cerium is {{much higher}} in methanesulfonic acid. Cerium(III) and terbium(III) have {{ultraviolet}} absorption bands of relatively high intensity compared with the other lanthanides, as their configurations (one electron more than an empty or half-filled f-subshell respectively) {{make it easier for}} the extra f electron to undergo f→d transitions instead of the forbidden f→f transitions of the other lanthanides. Cerium(III) sulfate is one of the few salts whose <b>solubility</b> in water decreases with rising temperature.|$|E
5|$|Argon has {{approximately}} the same <b>solubility</b> in water as oxygen and is 2.5 times more soluble in water than nitrogen. Argon is colorless, odorless, nonflammable and nontoxic as a solid, liquid or gas. Argon is chemically inert under most conditions and forms no confirmed stable compounds at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine is {{slightly}} soluble in water, with one gram dissolving in 3450ml at 20°C and 1280ml at 50°C; potassium iodide may {{be added to}} increase <b>solubility</b> via formation of triiodide ions, among other polyiodides. Nonpolar solvents such as hexane and carbon tetrachloride provide a higher <b>solubility.</b> Polar solutions, such as aqueous solutions, are brown, reflecting the role of these solvents as Lewis bases; on the other hand, nonpolar solutions are violet, the color of iodine vapour. Charge-transfer complexes form when iodine is dissolved in polar solvents, hence changing the colour. Iodine is violet when dissolved in carbon tetrachloride and saturated hydrocarbons but deep brown in alcohols and amines, solvents that form charge-transfer adducts.|$|E
40|$|The densities and {{equilibrium}} <b>solubilities</b> {{of oxygen}} were determined in aqueous sulphuric acid containing different amounts of dissolved zinc and ferric sulphate at conditions that simulated the conditions used for pressure leaching of zinc sulphide ores. A two-stage absorption-desorption process {{was used in}} the determination of the oxygen <b>solubilities.</b> The solutions were saturated with oxygen at high temperatures and pressures and then, the volume of gas desorbed at 101. 3 kPa and 323 K, was measured. The <b>solubilities</b> of oxygen in these solutions are closely expressed by Henry's law. The oxygen <b>solubilities</b> were found to be very low, in the order of 10 - 5 mole fraction at an oxygen partial pressure of 101. 3 kPa. The addition of the sulphuric acid and the metal salts was found to significantly decrease the oxygen <b>solubilities.</b> However, the oxygen <b>solubilities</b> increase with an increase in the partial pressure of oxygen and an increase in temperature. At all temperatures, the densities of these solutions were higher than those of water. The densities of the solutions decreased with an increase in temperature. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
50|$|Dissolution rates vary by {{orders of}} {{magnitude}} between different systems. Typically, very low dissolution rates parallel low <b>solubilities,</b> and substances with high <b>solubilities</b> exhibit high dissolution rates, {{as suggested by the}} Noyes-Whitney equation. However, this is not a rule.|$|R
40|$|The <b>solubilities</b> of Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe gases were {{measured}} in natural samples of anorthite, diopside, forsterite, spinel, and synthetic basaltic melts, the samples which represent equilibrium pairs in the Fo-An-Di-SiO 2 system. Results show that, in natural minerals, the <b>solubilities</b> of these gases increase with increasing atomic number. In contrast, the <b>solubilities</b> of noble {{gases in the}} synthetic basaltic melts decreased with increasing atomic number. The partition coefficients increased with increasing atomic number for all mineral/melt pairs...|$|R
5|$|Group 3 {{elements}} are generally hard metals with low aqueous <b>solubility,</b> and have low availability to the biosphere. No group 3 element has any documented biological role in living organisms. The radioactivity of the actinides generally makes them highly toxic to living cells, causing radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|H. aurantiaca secretes {{large amounts}} of oxalic acid, a {{reducing}} agent and relatively strong acid. This stimulates weathering of the humus layer of forest soil, and influences the <b>solubility</b> and turnover of nutrients (particularly phosphorus and nitrogen), which in turn affects their availability for use by forest trees.|$|E
5|$|Helium {{is used as}} a {{component}} of breathing gases to replace nitrogen, due its low <b>solubility</b> in fluids, especially in lipids. Gases are absorbed by the blood and body tissues when under pressure like in scuba diving, which causes an anesthetic effect known as nitrogen narcosis. Due to its reduced <b>solubility,</b> little helium is taken into cell membranes, and when helium is used to replace part of the breathing mixtures, such as in trimix or heliox, a decrease in the narcotic effect of the gas at depth is obtained. Helium's reduced <b>solubility</b> offers further advantages for the condition known as decompression sickness, or the bends. The reduced amount of dissolved gas in the body means that fewer gas bubbles form during the decrease in pressure of the ascent. Another noble gas, argon, is considered the best option for use as a drysuit inflation gas for scuba diving. Helium is also used as filling gas in nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors.|$|E
40|$|Modeling the <b>solubilities</b> of {{fatty acids}} is {{important}} because these compounds are used in various industries. In this work, a thermodynamic model based on Redlich-Kwong equation of state with Kwak-Mansoori mixing rules was used to model the <b>solubilities</b> of fatty acids in supercritical carbon dioxide. The model uses only one adjustable parameter and this parameter varies linearly with the chain length of the fatty acid. Therefore, this model can be potentially used to predict the <b>solubilities</b> of various fatty acids in supercritical carbon dioxide...|$|R
40|$|A flow type {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} and constructed to measure the <b>solubilities</b> of salts in water vapor at high temperature and pressure. The apparatus was equipped with an additional pure water line to prevent the clogging by precipitated solid salts at the outlet of an equilibrium cell. The <b>solubilities</b> of sodium chloride and potassium chloride in water vapor were measured at 623 - 673 K and 9. 0 - 12. 0 MPa. In order to verify the soundness of this method {{and the performance of}} the apparatus, the experimental results for the <b>solubilities</b> of sodium chloride at 673 K were compared with the literature data. The present data are in good agreement with the literature data. The <b>solubilities</b> of sodium chloride {{are similar to those of}} potassium chloride at the same temperatures and pressures. The isobaric <b>solubilities</b> decrease with increasing temperature at the experimental pressure range. The experimental results of <b>solubilities</b> were correlated by a solution model. The molar volumes and the energy parameters of salts were treated as adjustable parameters and were optimized with the present and literature data. The adjusted energy parameters for salts can be related to a linear function of the temperature. The correlated results show good agreement with the experimental data. © 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A new {{thermodynamic}} model {{was developed for}} modeling the <b>solubilities</b> of solid solutes in supercritical carbon dioxide. The model combines the cubic Patel–Teja equation of state (EOS) with the Wong–Sandler (WS) mixing rules (MR).

5|$|Midazolam {{is among}} about 35 benzodiazepines {{currently}} used medically, and was synthesised in 1975 by Walser and Fryer at Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc in the United States. Owing to its water <b>solubility,</b> {{it was found}} to be less likely to cause thrombophlebitis than similar drugs. The anticonvulsant properties of midazolam were studied in the late 1970s, but not until the 1990s did it emerge as an effective treatment for convulsive status epilepticus. , it is the most commonly used benzodiazepine in anesthetic medicine. In acute medicine, midazolam has become more popular than other benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam and diazepam, because it is shorter lasting, is more potent, and causes less pain at the injection site. Midazolam is also becoming increasingly popular in veterinary medicine due to its water <b>solubility.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{industrial}} applications of potassium exploit the high <b>solubility</b> in water of potassium compounds, such as potassium soaps.

40|$|The SPARC {{software}} program was benchmarked for calculating the <b>solubilities</b> of two representative polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), naphthalene and anthracene, {{in a range}} of organic solvents at various temperatures. Although SPARC was able to reasonably approximate the <b>solubilities</b> of naphthalene in some organic solvents, gross errors were obtained for other solvents. For anthracene, poor prediction performance was observed in all solvents considered. Overall, the results suggest that SPARC is currently not suitable for accurately predicting the <b>solubilities</b> of representative PAHs relevant for the petroleum sector in various organic solvents...|$|R

These chemicals have relatively high <b>solubilities</b> with values ranging from 4 10 - 6 to 15 10 - 4 mole fraction.

5|$|The <b>solubility</b> {{is highest}} in polar {{solvents}} (such as water) or ionic liquids, but {{tends to be}} low in nonpolar solvents (such as petrol/gasoline). This is principally because the resulting ion–dipole interactions are significantly stronger than ion-induced dipole interactions, so the heat of solution is higher. When the oppositely charged ions in the solid ionic lattice are surrounded by the opposite pole of a polar molecule, the solid ions are {{pulled out of the}} lattice and into the liquid. If the solvation energy exceeds the lattice energy, the negative net enthalpy change of solution provides a thermodynamic drive to remove ions from their positions in the crystal and dissolve in the liquid. In addition, the entropy change of solution is usually positive for most solid solutes like ionic compounds, which means that their <b>solubility</b> increases when the temperature increases. There are some unusual ionic compounds such as cerium(III) sulfate, where this entropy change is negative, due to extra order induced in the water upon solution, and the <b>solubility</b> decreases with temperature.|$|E
