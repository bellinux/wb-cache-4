25|$|The Holy <b>See</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only European {{subject of}} {{international}} law to have diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan), {{although there have been}} reports of informal talks between the Holy See and the government of the People's Republic of China on establishing diplomatic relations, restoring the situation that existed when the papal representative was part of the diplomatic corps that accepted the Communist government military victory instead of withdrawing with the Nationalist authorities to Taiwan. He was later expelled, after which the Holy See sent its representative to Taipei instead.|$|E

25|$|When {{we hear a}} car honk, {{we would}} {{determine}} which car triggers the honk by which car we <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> spatially closest to the honk. It's a spatial congruent example by combining visual and auditory stimuli. On the other hand, {{the sound and the}} pictures of a TV program would be integrated as structural congruent by combining visual and auditory stimuli. However, if the sound and the pictures were not meaningfully fit, we would segregate the two stimuli. Therefore, whether spatial or structural congruent should not only combine the stimuli but also be determined by understanding.|$|E
500|$|On July 23, {{the last}} night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a {{television}} broadcast in which Collins commented: ...The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly...

500|$|SpongeBob and Patrick find a {{piece of}} a {{medallion}} to the lost city of Atlantis, but {{have no idea what it}} is. They take it to the Bikini Bottom Museum to see if the staff there know what it is. SpongeBob and Patrick run into Squidward, who thinks they stole the missing half of the medallion. He soon matches it to the displayed other half of the medallion and tells them it was the key to Atlantis. After hearing the story of Atlantis, the only thing SpongeBob and Patrick want to <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> [...] "World's Oldest Bubble." [...] Squidward then proceeds to reconnect the two halves of the medallion, opening the [...] "path to Atlantis", which is a bus that runs on [...] "song fuel". When the characters run out of [...] "song fuel", the bus then crash-lands into the city of Atlantis. The group is unknowingly followed by Plankton.|$|E

500|$|Many of The Search for Spocks {{dialogue}} sequences feature tight close-up shots. During Kirk and Sarek's mind meld, Nimoy chose {{cuts that}} focused on accentuating the dialogue; [...] "Instead of watching people's faces, all you <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> mouth or the eyes {{and you have the}} tendency to hear better," [...] Correll explained. Correll was unhappy that every scene save one was filmed on a soundstage. Feeling that recreating everything on set resulted in a fake look, the cinematographer suggested that Genesis be filmed on Kauai in Hawaii, and that Red Rock Canyon stand in for Vulcan. The production did not have the money to shoot on location, meaning that Nimoy was preoccupied with making sure the various outdoor settings felt believable. While the various vessel exteriors were handled by ILM, Correll was responsible for the look of the interior sets. He preferred to treat these as actual locations inside the ships; although the sets' ceilings were designed to be removed so that lights could be rigged in the rafters, Correll used other lighting methods. In the Bird of Prey, he used fluorescent tubes to pick up the walls' metallic paints, and kept the set smoky to convey a dirty atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|Atlantis and Space Station {{crew members}} said their goodbyes and closed hatches {{between the two}} {{spacecraft}} at 14:28 UTC, ending seven days, 21 hours, 41 minutes of joined docked operations. At the farewell ceremony, Commander Ferguson presented to the station a small U.S. flag that had flown on STS-1. He also presented a shuttle model signed by program officials and the mission's lead shuttle and station flight directors. [...] "What you don't <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> signatures of {{the tens of thousands}} who rose to orbit with us over the past 30 years, if only in spirit," [...] Ferguson said.|$|E
2500|$|Duncan Smith said in February 2011 {{that it was}} [...] "absurd and damaging" [...] for ministers not to extol the {{benefits}} of marriage for fear of stigmatising those who choose not to marry. Duncan Smith said: [...] "We do a disservice to society if we ignore the evidence which shows that stable families tend {{to be associated with}} better outcomes for children." [...] He added: [...] "There are few more powerful tools for promoting stability than the institution of marriage." [...] He added that [...] "The financial costs of family breakdown are incredibly high. But what is most painful to <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> human cost – the wasted potential, the anti-social behaviour, and the low self-esteem." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s." [...] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, [...] "I {{can go out and}} catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. The last thing I want to <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> end of the resource we've all depended on for a long time. I'm not against regulating the industry, but we {{want to go out and}} harvest and still make a living at it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{episode was}} part of the {{official}} torch relay, and Fenwick ran with the real torch protection team dressed as an official torch bearer. The torch made a special detour from London to the EastEnders set in BBC Elstree, Borehamwood. Fenwick's route saw him carry the torch from the fictional location of Bridge Street, past The Queen Victoria public house and around Albert Square. His part of the relay was 300 metres long, but he had to run across the set for the next scene. He explained that at one point, there are only 12 or 13 seconds between two of his scenes, so would have to run quickly between sets, saying that producers had been timing him. He said: [...] "What the viewers won't <b>see</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> running around that I'm doing off screen. I've got to do sprints all the way through, they're actually timing me, and every day I'm beating my personal best. Because it's all about me getting from one set to another and getting all the words out in the right order and not falling over and not putting the torch out." ...|$|E
