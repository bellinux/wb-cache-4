25|$|Explicit {{expressions}} for the <b>skewness</b> and kurtosis are lengthy.|$|E
25|$|It is {{positive}} for right skewed distributions and negative for left skewed distributions. Absolute values≥0.2 indicate marked <b>skewness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pearson {{distribution}} — a four-parameter {{family of}} probability distributions that extend the normal law to include different <b>skewness</b> and kurtosis values.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 van Zwet {{proposed}} {{a series of}} axioms for ordering measures of <b>skewness.</b> The nonparametric skew does not satisfy these axioms.|$|E
25|$|D'Agostino's K-squared test is a goodness-of-fit {{normality}} test {{based on}} a combination of the sample <b>skewness</b> and sample kurtosis, as is the Jarque–Bera test for normality.|$|E
25|$|The <b>skewness</b> {{is equal}} to , it depends only on the shape {{parameter}} (k) and approaches a normal distribution when k is large (approximately when k > 10).|$|E
25|$|Values of ν = α + β {{such that}} ν ranges {{from zero to}} infinity, 0 < ν < ∞, span the whole region of the beta {{distribution}} in the plane of excess kurtosis versus squared <b>skewness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The nonparametric skew is {{one third}} of the Pearson 2 <b>skewness</b> {{coefficient}} and lies between 1 and +1 for any distribution. This range is implied {{by the fact that the}} mean lies within one standard deviation of any median.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{measures}} of kurtosis are: the L-kurtosis, {{which is a}} scaled version of the fourth L-moment; measures based on four population or sample quantiles. These are analogous to the alternative {{measures of}} <b>skewness</b> that are not based on ordinary moments.|$|E
25|$|L-estimators {{can also}} measure {{the shape of}} a distribution, beyond {{location}} and scale. For example, the midhinge minus the median is a 3-term L-estimator that measures the <b>skewness,</b> and other differences of midsummaries give measures of asymmetry at different points in the tail.|$|E
25|$|Letting α = β in {{the above}} {{expression}} one obtains γ1 = 0, showing once again that for α = β the distribution is symmetric and hence the <b>skewness</b> is zero. Positive skew (right-tailed) for α < β, negative skew (left-tailed) for α > β.|$|E
25|$|In statistics, D’Agostino’s K2 test, {{named for}} Ralph D'Agostino, is a goodness-of-fit measure of {{departure}} from normality, {{that is the}} test aims to establish {{whether or not the}} given sample comes from a normally distributed population. The test is based on transformations of the sample kurtosis and <b>skewness,</b> and has power only against the alternatives that the distribution is skewed and/or kurtic.|$|E
25|$|For example, when {{estimating}} {{a location}} parameter, for a symmetric distribution a symmetric L-estimator (such as the median or midhinge) will be unbiased. However, if the distribution has skew, symmetric L-estimators will generally be biased and require adjustment. For example, in a skewed distribution, the nonparametric skew (and Pearson's <b>skewness</b> coefficients) measure the bias of the median as an estimator of the mean.|$|E
25|$|One also usefully can {{approximate}} the {{particle size distribution}} using a mathematical function. The normal distribution usually does not suitably describe particle size distributions in aerosols because of the <b>skewness</b> associated a long tail of larger particles. Also for a quantity that varies over a large range, as many aerosol sizes do, {{the width of the}} distribution implies negative particles sizes, clearly not physically realistic. However, the normal distribution can be suitable for some aerosols, such as test aerosols, certain pollen grains and spores.|$|E
25|$|Using {{a normal}} {{distribution}} one can estimate the return period of 1950-level annual rainfall for the Dubbo region as around 375 years, or {{about three times}} the length of instrumental rainfall data. For areas even a little further west, however, the <b>skewness</b> is too high to use this method, but {{there can be little}} doubt that the return periods are similar. Excluding records post-1968, when enhanced greenhouse gases has undoubtedly impacted Australian rainfall beyond (admittedly generally high) natural variability, there are no other totals over a substantial area that compare for improbability of being repeated.|$|E
25|$|Outliers {{can occur}} by chance in any distribution, {{but they often}} {{indicate}} either measurement error or that the population has a heavy-tailed distribution. In the former case one wishes to discard them or use statistics that are robust to outliers, while {{in the latter case}} they indicate that the distribution has high <b>skewness</b> and that one should be very cautious in using tools or intuitions that assume a normal distribution. A frequent cause of outliers is a mixture of two distributions, which may be two distinct sub-populations, or may indicate 'correct trial' versus 'measurement error'; this is modeled by a mixture model.|$|E
25|$|An {{explanation}} for this log-normal distribution for biological parameters is: The event where a sample has half {{the value of the}} mean or median tends to have almost equal probability to occur as the event where a sample has twice the value of the mean or median. Also, only a log-normal distribution can compensate for the inability of almost all biological parameters to be of negative numbers (at least when measured on absolute scales), with the consequence that there is no definite limit to the size of outliers (extreme values) on the high side, but, on the other hand, they can never be less than zero, resulting in a positive <b>skewness.</b>|$|E
25|$|As in the 2005 {{election}}s, the Red-Green Coalition won {{the election}} with less votes (this time 47.9%) than the opposition parties (49.5%). Peter N. Myhre of the Progress Party complained that this meant eight years with a government that had not truly won an election, and called for an overhaul of an electoral system that, he claimed, disproportionately favours the Norwegian periphery. Hanne Marthe Narud, {{a political scientist at}} the University of Oslo, identified the result as a consequence of deliberate political planning, and in particular of a 2001 compromise in the Storting that balanced proportionality against an intent to over-represent rural areas. She explained to Dagbladet that this trend could be dated as far back as 1917, when it was argued that Oslo's status as the national capital inherently gave it greater influence, so that it should have less representation in parliament compared with rural areas. Electoral researcher Bernt Aardal stated that he had calculated the results of the election without the rural <b>skewness.</b> His results showed that the Labour Party and Progress Party would both lose a representative, while Red and the Liberal Party would each gain one, still giving a majority to the Red-Green Coalition.|$|E
25|$|During {{exocytosis}} at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the membrane and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most exocytosis, Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to exocytosis. However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the <b>skewness</b> of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E
2500|$|For non-zero sample <b>skewness</b> {{one needs}} to solve a system of two coupled equations. Since the <b>skewness</b> and the excess {{kurtosis}} are independent of the parameters , the parameters [...] can be uniquely determined from the sample <b>skewness</b> and the sample excess kurtosis, by solving the coupled equations with two known variables (sample <b>skewness</b> and sample excess kurtosis) and two unknowns (the shape parameters): ...|$|E
2500|$|Where {{one should}} take the {{solutions}} as follows: [...] for (negative) sample <b>skewness</b> < 0, and [...] for (positive) sample <b>skewness</b> > 0.|$|E
2500|$|... μ ∈ R [...] is a shift parameter, β ∈ , {{called the}} <b>skewness</b> parameter, {{is a measure}} of asymmetry. Notice that in this context the usual <b>skewness</b> is not well defined, as for α < 2 the {{distribution}} does not admit 2nd or higher moments, and the usual <b>skewness</b> definition is the 3rd central moment.|$|E
2500|$|The case of zero <b>skewness,</b> can be {{immediately}} solved because for zero <b>skewness,</b> α = β and hence ν = 2α = 2β, therefore α = β = ν/2 ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{accompanying}} plot of <b>skewness</b> as {{a function}} of variance and mean shows that maximum variance (1/4) is coupled with zero <b>skewness</b> and the symmetry condition (μ = 1/2), and that maximum <b>skewness</b> (positive or negative infinity) occurs when the mean is located at one end or the other, so that the [...] "mass" [...] of the probability distribution is concentrated at the ends (minimum variance).|$|E
2500|$|The estimators G1 for sample <b>skewness</b> and G2 for sample {{kurtosis}} {{are used}} by DAP/SAS, PSPP/SPSS, and Excel. [...] However, they are not used by BMDP and (according to [...] ) they were not used by MINITAB in 1998. Actually, Joanes [...] and Gill in their 1998 study [...] concluded that the <b>skewness</b> and kurtosis estimators used in BMDP and in MINITAB (at that time) had smaller variance and mean-squared error in normal samples, but the <b>skewness</b> and kurtosis estimators used in [...] DAP/SAS, PSPP/SPSS, namely G1 and G2, had smaller mean-squared error in samples from a very skewed distribution. [...] It {{is for this reason}} that we have spelled out [...] "sample skewness", etc., in the above formulas, to make it explicit that the user should choose the best estimator according to the problem at hand, as the best estimator for <b>skewness</b> and kurtosis depends on the amount of <b>skewness</b> (as shown by Joanes and Gill).|$|E

2500|$|Another {{alternative}} is to calculate the support interval range [...] based on the sample variance and the sample <b>skewness.</b> [...] For this purpose one can solve, {{in terms of the}} range , the equation expressing the squared <b>skewness</b> in terms of the sample variance, and the sample size ν (see section titled [...] "Skewness" [...] and [...] "Alternative parametrizations, four parameters"): ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{quantities}} consistently {{estimate the}} theoretical <b>skewness</b> and kurtosis of the distribution, respectively. Moreover, if the sample indeed {{comes from a}} normal population, then the exact finite sample distributions of the <b>skewness</b> and kurtosis can themselves be analysed {{in terms of their}} means μ1, variances μ2, skewnesses γ1, and kurtoses γ2. This has been done by , who derived the following expressions: ...|$|E
