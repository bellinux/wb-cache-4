40|$|Surfaces of {{polyacrylamide}} hydrogels synthesized in {{the presence}} of surfactants were imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the surface morphology was studied by numerical scaling analysis. The <b>gels</b> were <b>formed</b> by polymerizing acrylamide plus a cross-linker {{in the presence}} of surfactants, which were then removed by soaking in distilled water. <b>Gels</b> <b>formed</b> {{in the presence of}} over 20 % surfactant (by weight) formed clear, but became opaque upon removal of the <b>surfactants.</b> Other <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> and remained clear. The surface morphology of the gels was studied by several one- and two-dimensional numerical scaling methods. The surfaces were found to be self-affine on short length scales, with a roughness (Hurst) exponent in the range from 0. 85 to 1, crossing over to a constant root-mean-square surface width at long scales. Both the crossover length between these two regimes and the saturation value of the surface width increased significantly with increasing surfactant concentration, coincident with the increase in opacity. We propose that the changes in the surface morphology are due to a percolation transition in the system of voids formed upon removal of the surfactants from the bulk.

40|$|Viscoelastic {{surfactant}} {{have found}} numerous application {{in the oil}} fields as fracturing and matrix acidizing fluid additives in the recent years. They {{have the ability to}} form long worm-like micelles with the increase in pH and calcium concentration, which results in increasing the viscosity and elasticity of partially spent acids. On one hand, concentration of surfactant in the fluids has profound effects on their performance downhole. Additionally, there is continuous debate in the industry on whether the gel generated by these surfactants causes formation damage, especially in dry gas wells. Therefore, being able to analyze the concentration of these surfactants in both live and spent acids is of great importance for production engineers who apply surfactant-based fluids in the oil fields. In the present work, a two-phase titration method was optimized for quantitative analysis of a carboxybetaine viscoelastic surfactant, and surfactant retention in calcite cores was quantitatively determined by two phase titration method and the benefits of using mutual solvents to break the <b>surfactant</b> <b>gel</b> <b>formed</b> inside the cores was assessed. On the other hand, high temperatures and low pH are usually involved in surfactant applications. Surfactants are subjected to hydrolysis under such conditions due to the existence of a peptide bond (-CO-NH-) in their molecules, leading to alteration in the rheological properties of the acid. The impact of hydrolysis at high temperatures on the apparent viscosity of carboxybetaine viscoelastic surfactant-based acids was evaluated in the present study, and the mechanism of viscosity changes was determine by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results indicate that, first, significant amount of surfactant has been retained in the carbonate matrix after acidizing treatment and {{there is a need to}} use internal breakers when surfactant-based acids are used in dry gas wells or water injectors. Second, hydrolysis at high temperatures has great impact on surfactant-acid rheological properties. Short time viscosity build-up and effective gel break-down can be achieved if surfactant-acid treatments are carefully designed; otherwise, unexpected viscosity reduction and phase separation may occur, which will affect the outcome of acid treatments...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{gelation}} temperature (20, 30 or 40 °C), assay temperature, concentration of glucono-δ-lactone (GDL) added, and NaCl concentration on the rheological properties of acid casein gels were studied at {{small and large}} deformations. Gels prepared at a high incubation temperature had very low storage moduli (G′), whereas those made at a low incubation temperature had extremely high G′ values. A higher concentration of GDL resulted in faster gelation but slightly lower G′ values of aged gels. Addition of NaCl resulted in longer gelation times and a slower rate of increase of G′. Cooling of gels prepared at 30 or 40 °C resulted {{in an increase in}} G′. However, for <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at 20 °C, G′ decreased initially on cooling but returned to its original value on holding at 5 °C. The loss tangent (tan δ) of <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at 20 or 30 °C was independent of frequency; however, for <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at 40 °C, tan δ was lower at low frequencies. As gels were cooled to 5 °C, tan δ increased. Fracture stress (σfr) of <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at 20 °C was much greater than that of the <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> at higher temperatures.

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examines}} the microstructure, gelation tempera-tures, and flow properties of novel amphiphilogels consisting solely of non-ionic <b>surfactants.</b> Methods. <b>Gels</b> were prepared by mixing the solid gelator (sorbitan monostearate or sorbitan monopalmitate) and the liquid phase (liq-uid sorbitan esters or polysorbates) and heating them at 60 °C {{to form a}} clear isotropic sol phase, and cooling the sol phase to form an opaque semisolid at room temperature. Gel microstructure was ex-amined by light and electron microscopy and by small angle neutron scattering (SANS); gelation temperatures were measured by hot-stage microscopy, a melting point apparatus, and high sensitivity dif-ferential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC). Flow rheograms were per-formed to establish the zero-rate viscosity of the gels and their per-formance under shear. Results. Gel microstructures consisted mainly of clusters of tubules of gelator molecules that had aggregated upon cooling of the sol phase, forming a 3 D network throughout the continuous phase. The gels demonstrated thermoreversibility. Gelation temperature and viscos-ity increased with increasing gelator concentration, indicating a more robust gel network. At temperatures near the skin surface tempera-ture, the gels softened considerably; this would allow topical appli-cation. Conclusions. This study has demonstrated the formation/preparation of stable, thermoreversible, thixtropic <b>surfactant</b> <b>gels</b> (amphiphilo-gels) with suitable physical properties for topical use.

40|$|As {{one class}} of the most {{important}} supramolecular functional materials, <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> by low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs) have many important applications. The key important parameters affecting the in-use performance of a gel are determined by the hierarchical fiber network structures. Fiber networks consisting of weakly interacting multiple domains are commonly observed in <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> by LMWGs. The rheological properties, particularly the elasticity, of a gel with such a fiber network are weak due to the weak interactions between the individual domains. As achieving desirable rheological properties of such a gel is practically relevant, in this work, we demonstrate the engineering of gels with such a type of fiber network by controlling crystallization of the gelator. Two example <b>gels</b> <b>formed</b> by a glutamic acid derivative in a non-ionic surfactant Tween 80 and in propylene glycol were engineered by controlling the thermodynamic driving force for crystallization. For a fixed gelator concentration, the thermodynamic driving force was manipulated by controlling the temperature for fiber crystallization. It was observed that there exists an optimal temperature at which a gel with maximal elasticity can be fabricated. This will hopefully provide guidelines for producing high performance soft materials by engineering their fiber network structures...|$|R
