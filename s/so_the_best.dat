25|$|The {{particular}} synthetic CDO {{that the}} SEC's 2010 fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1. Unlike {{many of the}} Abacus securities, 2007-AC1 did not have Goldman Sachs as a short seller, in fact, Goldman Sachs lost money on the deal. That position {{was taken by the}} customer (John Paulson) who hired Goldman to issue the security (according to the SEC's complaint). Paulson and his employees selected 90 BBB-rated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bet to buy insurance for. Paulson and the manager of the CDO, ACA Management, worked on the portfolio of 90 bonds to be insured (ACA allegedly unaware of Paulson's short position), coming to an agreement in late February 2007. Paulson paid Goldman approximately US$15 million for its work in the deal. Paulson ultimately made a US$1 billion profit from the short investments, the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers. These were primarily IKB Deutsche Industriebank (US$150 million loss), and the investors and insurers of another US$900 million—ACA Financial Guaranty Corp, ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.|$|E

He appointed as his assistant Maurice Setters, who had experience managing at that level but had effectively ruled himself out of another management job after taking Doncaster Rovers to court for unfair dismissal.

According to the developers, [...] "We already had the main character (although he was eventually remodeled) and a good deal of code already written, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> option seemed to be to change the game's direction. Mature humor was a key element." [...] Several aspects of the game were designed to attract an adult audience. Unlike in Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, item collecting was mostly discarded and character abilities were simplified with [...] "context sensitive" [...] pads. The game also relies heavily on cutscenes and features a large number of film parodies. Some offensive content was censored under the supervision of Nintendo, including cutscenes with Pokémon and a joke {{at the expense of the}} Ku Klux Klan.

500|$|Sturdee was {{concerned}} by this order's ambiguity and sought clarification from Blamey. The Commander in Chief responded {{by stating that}} [...] "my conception is that action must be of a gradual nature" [...] involving the use of patrols to determine Japanese strengths and positions before large offensives were undertaken. The situation on New Britain was straightforward enough; the enemy {{was known to be}} stronger than the Australian forces there—although it was not realised just how much stronger—and <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> that could be done was to eliminate small numbers of Japanese troops by aggressive patrolling. At Aitape, Stevens was tasked on the one hand with pushing the Japanese back far enough to protect the airfields; but on the other, with not allowing the 6th Division to become heavily engaged since it might be required for use elsewhere. On Bougainville, Savige had the strength and ability to conduct a major campaign, but Blamey counselled caution.|$|E

2500|$|Liepāja {{enjoys a}} semi-continental climate noted as [...] "Dfb" [...] in the Köppen classification. The major factor {{influencing}} {{the weather in}} the region is the Baltic Sea, providing a relatively mild winter for its high latitude (although snowy) and a relatively cool summer. During the winter the sea around Liepāja is virtually ice-free. Although occasionally some land-fast ice may develop, it seldom reaches a hundred meters from the shore and does not last long before melting. The sea warms up fully only in the beginning of August, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bathing season in Liepāja is from August to September. Summers are more affected by the martime climate than east-facing cities on similar latitudes in opposite Sweden, but winters are milder than inland areas to the east. Regular meteorological observations in the city have been conducted from 1857.|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} that genetic influences have on personality characteristics can change across a five-year period. Age differences create more variables even within a family, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> comparisons are found using twins. Twins typically share a family environment called a shared environment {{because they may}} share other aspects like teachers, school, and friends. A non-shared environment means completely different environment for both subjects. [...] "Biologically related children who are separated after birth and raised in different families live in non-shared environments." [...] Identical twins separated at birth and raised in different families constitute the best cases for heredity and personality because similarities between the two are due only to genetic influences. Vulnerability {{was a factor in}} this study that was taken into consideration regarding the issue of genetic influences on vulnerability. The study concluded that the monozygotic co-twins would be more similar than dizygotic co-twins in change over time. The data concluded that {{there were no significant differences}} for either variances between the monozygotic and dizygotic co-twins.|$|E
2500|$|During {{and after}} World War I the German navy had {{divided into two}} factions. One faction, led by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz (1849-1930), {{consisted}} of avid followers of {{the teachings of the}} American historian Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840-1914) and believed in building a [...] "balanced fleet" [...] centred around the battleship that would, if war came, seek out and win a decisive battle of annihilation (Entscheidungsschlacht) against the Royal Navy. Another faction, led by Commander Wolfgang Wegener (1875-1956), argued that because of superior British shipbuilding capacity Germany could never hope to build a [...] "balanced fleet" [...] capable of winning an Entscheidungsschlacht, and <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> use of German naval strength was to build a fleet of cruisers and submarines that would wage a guerre de course. After reading all three of Wegener's papers setting out his ideas, Admiral Hipper decided to submit them to the Admiralty in Berlin, but changed his mind after reading a paper by Raeder attacking the [...] "Wegener thesis" [...] as flawed. This marked the beginning of a long feud between Raeder and Wegener, with Wegener claiming that his former friend Raeder was jealous of what Wegener insisted were his superior ideas.|$|E

2500|$|Noise is also {{generated}} by external sources, most importantly the natural thermal radiation {{of the background}} surrounding the target of interest. In modern radar systems, the internal noise is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise. An exception is if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky, where the scene is so [...] "cold" [...] that it generates very little thermal noise. The thermal noise is given by kB T B, where T is temperature, B is bandwidth (post matched filter) and kB is Boltzmann's constant. There is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar. Matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin (be it a range, Doppler, elevation, or azimuth bin). On the surface {{it would appear that}} then within a fixed interval of time one could obtain perfect, error free, detection. To do this one simply compresses all energy into an infinitesimal time slice. What limits this approach in the real world is that, while time is arbitrarily divisible, current is not. The quantum of electrical energy is an electron, and <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> one can do is match filter all energy into a single electron. Since the electron is moving at a certain temperature (Plank spectrum) this noise source cannot be further eroded. We see then that radar, like all macro-scale entities, is profoundly impacted by quantum theory.|$|E
