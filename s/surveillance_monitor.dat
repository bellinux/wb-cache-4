The remaining guests lock Price in the [...] "Saturation Chamber", an archaic device that Vannacut used to treat schizophrenics.

The first step to identify this behaviour was used a Generalized Sequential Patterns that detects sequential micro-patterns in the input loitering video sequences. The test phase determines the appropriate percentage of inclusion of this set of micro-patterns in a new input sequence, namely those that are considered to form part of the profile, and then be identified as loitering.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} a two-person zero-sum game between an intruder and {{a defender of}} a military installation. The intruder attempts to penetrate the military installation by choosing one of its many entry points, {{each of which is}} monitored by a surveillance camera and may require a different amount of time to transit. Although the real-time video of each surveillance camera is fed to a surveillance room simultaneously, the defender has only one <b>surveillance</b> <b>monitor</b> and can monitor only one entry point at a time. We consider a discrete-time model such that the intruder will be detected if, during his travel time, the defender spends one time unit monitoring the entry point chosen by the intruder. The problem facing the defender is how to switch among entry points to monitor from one time unit to the next, in order to maximize the detection probability of the intruder. The intruder's goal is, of course, to infiltrate without being detected, and so he wishes to minimize this probability. We formulate the problem as a two-person zero-sum game, and develop a linear program to solve it. Numerical experiments provide insights into the design of such surveillance systems.

40|$|Emerging {{information}} technologies, such as {{data management}} system software packages, can help disease control programs to better manage and analyze their data, and thus {{make it easier}} to carry out continuous <b>surveillance,</b> <b>monitor</b> interventions and evaluate control program performance. This will lead to better informed decisions and actions. We have developed a multi-disease data management system platform with current capacity for dengue and malaria that supports data entry, storage and query. It also allows for production of maps and both standardized and customized reports. The system includes only software components that can be distributed without the user having to pay licensing costs. It was designed so that the user can adapt many aspects of the system to suit local conditions (for example roles and permissions, user interfaces and display labels and which functionality is included under a given disease) without having to involve software developers. In conclusion, we have developed a system capable of aiding disease control programs in their task to reduce the burden of dengue and malaria, including the implementation of integrated vector management programs. The next steps include operational implementations and evaluations of the current system with capacity for dengue and malaria, and the inclusion in the system platform of other important vector-borne diseases...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the {{multimedia}} augmented transition network (MATN) model {{that is the}} underlying semantic model for the snapshot browsing in a distributed surveillance services (DSS) system. The MATN model provides the visualization of control structure and a good programming data structure for implementation of the proposed snapshot browsing system. MATNs are left to right models {{that are used to}} model browsing sequences. In order to simplify the network structure, one subnetwork is constructed for each time duration. The MATN and its subnetworks depict the structural hierarchy of the snapshot browsing graph. By using the subnetwork structure, searching time will be heavily reduced by traversing and searching the corresponding subnetworks selected by the user without traversing the whole network. The DSS system is a distributed object-based system that integrates the next generation Internet-based applications in the architecture level and in the system design level. The DSS system establishes a firm basis for supporting a variety of potential cost-effective applications in a plug-and-play manner. By incorporating the MATN model and utilizing the MATN control structures, complicated browsing operations involving user interactions can be easily implemented for the DSS. A detailed example that illustrates how to use the MATN model to model the snapshot browsing in <b>surveillance</b> <b>monitor</b> of the DSS system is also included. ∗ To whom all correspondences should be addressed. ...|$|E

Ecological monitoring practitioners have long recognized that different species are differentially informative of a system’s dynamics, as codified in the well-known concepts of indicator or keystone species. Using a novel combination of analysis techniques from nonlinear dynamics, we describe marked variation among spatial sites in information content with respect to system dynamics in the entire region. We first observed these phenomena in a spatially extended predator–prey model, but we observed strikingly similar features in verified water-level data from a NOAA/NOS Great Lakes monitoring program. We suggest that these features may be widespread and the design of <b>surveillance</b> <b>monitoring</b> programs should reflect knowledge of their existence...|$|R
