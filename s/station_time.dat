25|$|In 1994, the new 24-hour radio <b>station</b> <b>Time</b> Highway Radio {{proved to}} be {{competition}} to RTM's existing radio stations. Hence RTM decided to re-brand Radio 4, and brought in new DJs such as Patrick and Yasmin Yusoff. Patrick's talk show slot was from 9 a.m. until 12 noon Mondays to Wednesdays. When Radio 4 went for 24-hour broadcast, Patrick also hosted a show in the 12 a.m. until 3 a.m. slot called 'Midnight Magic'. In Midnight Magic Patrick invited listeners to call in and tell ghost stories, a move that {{proved to be}} a hit among his listeners.|$|E

40|$|Consider a {{polling system}} with K 1 queues {{and a single}} server that visits the queues in a cyclic order. The polling {{discipline}} in each queue is of general gated-type or exhaustive-type. We assume that in each queue the arrival times form a Poisson process, and that the service times, the walking times {{as well as the}} set-up times form sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables. For such a system, we provide sufficient conditions under which the vector of queue lengths is stable. We treat several criterions for stability: the ergodicity of the process, the geometric ergodicity, and the geometric rate of convergence of the first moment. The ergodicity implies the weak convergence of <b>station</b> <b>times,</b> intervisit times and cycle times.

40|$|In the {{automotive}} market, geometrical quality {{can often be}} just that competitive edge that attracts the customer. <b>Station</b> cycle <b>time</b> influences plant throughput and required plant investment costs. During product and process development, these two important characteristics are addressed by tolerance analysis and off-line programming. In {{the automotive}} industry, tolerance analysis and off-line programming are basically sequentially applied with only limited interaction. We argue that this partial separation can lead to suboptimal geometrical quality or <b>station</b> cycle <b>time.</b> Targeting the process layout design of a sheet metal assembly station, we argue that geometrical quality and <b>station</b> cycle <b>time</b> often {{are influenced by the}} same set of parameters. In addition, we argue that geometrical quality and <b>station</b> cycle <b>time</b> often are subject to trade-off, i. e. that a certain parameter change influences one characteristic favourably and the other unfavourably. For instance, fixture geometries that are effective in terms of geometrical quality, do often constitute bulky obstacles that have a significant negative influence on <b>station</b> cycle <b>time.</b> Furthermore, welding concepts that favor geometrical quality usually entail longer robotic travel and require lower robot operating speeds...|$|R

The stability conditions and the stochastic monotonicity results are extended to the polling systems with additional customer routing between the queues, as well as bulk and correlated arrivals. For polling systems with mixed limited, gated and exhaustive service disciplines and without set-up times, we prove that the weighted sum of mean waiting times increases in the arrival rate, in the first and second moments of the service times and in the variances of the walking times. This monotonicity also holds with respect to the mean walking times if they are deterministic or if there are "many queues" or the system is heavily loaded. Finally, we prove that the mean cycle time, the mean intervisit time and the mean <b>station</b> <b>times</b> are invariant under general service disciplines and general stationary arrival and service processes...|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "self-organized" [...] {{describes}} {{the manner in}} which time slots are assigned to users. Time-division multiple access (TDMA) divides a channel into frames, which furthermore are subdivided into a vast number of time slots.
