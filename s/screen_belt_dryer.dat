The wet product is continuously and evenly applied through an infeed chamber onto a perforated belt. The belt, predominantly in horizontal position, carries the product through the drying area which is divided into several sections. In these cells drying gas flows through or over the wet product and dries it. Each cell can be equipped with a ventilating fan and a heat exchanger. This modular design allows the drying and cooling temperatures to be controlled separately in the different sections.

40|$|AbstractThe {{pros and}} cons of various types of biomass dryers have been {{documented}} in this paper. Using dry biomass significantly reduces the cost of handling, transportation and pyrolysis. The main choices for drying biomass are rotary dryers, flash dryers, stationery bed dryers and fluidised bed dryers. The drying medium can be hot air, hot air mixed with steam, and/or superheated steam. A typical example for wood chip drying using a financial model is described, including the environmental performance. The energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions have been estimated for drying biomass. From this study, it is evident that increasing temperature will decrease drying time and increase throughput but not necessarily decrease the drying cost. This is due to higher energy use and higher cost of capital inputs such as loading/unloading and heat plant. Thus, low drying temperature can be used if throughput is not a key issue for an operation. The global warming potential of the biomass drying process 9. 2 kg CO 2 -e/t of oven-dry biomass.

40|$|The major {{phenomena}} {{involved in}} the drying of calcium lactate in a spray dryer are discussed: evaporation, crystallization and agglomeration. Tests have been done on the following types of spray dryers: a conventional dryer at high temperature (HTD), a conventional dryer at low temperature (LTD), a fluid bed dryer (SDA) and a <b>belt</b> <b>dryer</b> (FILTERMAT). The influence of process conditions on the above phenomena is studied as well the interactions between those phenomena. Completely crystallized calcium lactate contains 27 % moisture as a part ofthe crystal lattice. Water {{that is not a}} part of the crystal lattice is called "free moisture content" and contributes highly to the stickiness of a particle and hence to agglomeration. If the evaporation is too fast, crystallization will be hindered and an amorphous calcium lactate with a lot of free moisture will cause the particles to stick to the wall, to agglomerate and hence to block the dryer. The dryers diSFer in residence time. A combmation of slow evaporation and a long residence time give the best crystallization results and hence httle stickiaess. In all dryers product or off-gas particles are retumed by blowing them around the feed inlet. These particles serve as nuclei for crystallization. A drying curve of calcium lactate has been determined and gives evidence of the fact that the drying of calcium lactate ia a spray dryer is a heat limited process. A simple mathematical model is presented which describes the drying of calcium lactate in a FILTERMAT dryer chamber, only with respect to evaporation. Numerical simulations with this model in PSI/e give reasonable results and support the experimental finding that heat transport is a limiting factor id the drying of calcium lactate.

40|$|Annual {{production}} {{of sewage sludge}} in Europe is estimated at more than eleven million tons of dry matter content [1]. Use in agriculture and incineration are the main ways of valorization. In this context, drying of residual sludge appears as an essential step after mechanical dewatering. It reduces the costs of storage, transport and allows the sludge stabilization. However, this process is highly energy consuming and {{still needs to be}} optimized as it constitutes an important economic and environmental issue [2]. Polymers are usually employed in the conditioning step in order to promote particle aggregation, making the dewatering easier. The past decades, the application of pre-hydrolized polyaluminium chlorides (PACls) as coagulant has increased, particularly in China, Japan, Russia and Western Europe [3]. As a consequence, PACls are extensively investigated for their coagulation performance, characterization and speciation [3]. In this work, the influence of Polyaluminium chloride (PAX- 14) co-conditioning with linear polyelectrolytes on sludge dewatering and drying performances was investigated. Experiments were conducted on activated sludge samples collected after thickening from the wastewater treatment plant of the Grosses- Battes (Belgium). Two cationic polymers were tested, each of them in combination with PAX for sludge flocculation prior to mechanical dewatering and their effects on sludge convective drying. The one referenced as 640 LH was a linear polymer with a low molecular weight, whereas the 640 CT was a linear one with a high molecular weight. After conditioning, the dewatering step was realized by using a normalized filtration-expression cell (AFNOR 1979) under 5 bar of pressure. Then, the specific resistance to filtration was determined from the follow-up of filtrate mass with time, using the Carman-Kozeny equation [4]. Figure 1 shows the experimental design. For convective drying experiments, the cake recovered after filtration was extruded through a circular die of 14 mm diameter and cut at a height of 14 mm, yielding cylindrical samples with mass of approximately 2. 5 g, as used in several industrial <b>belt</b> <b>dryers.</b> Individual extrudates have been dried in a specially designed convective micro-dryer. Results reported in this paper were obtained with the following operating conditions: air temperature of 130 °C, at ambient humidity (absolute humidity ~ 0. 005 kgwater/ kgdry air) and a superficial velocity of 1 m/ s. Results show that, the dry solids content of the dewatering cake increases with increasing Polyaluminium chloride dosage for both series of experiments. It supposes that PAX contributed to improve solids capture, depicted on Fig. 2. Concerning drying, it appeared that the samples treated by the dual PAX/ polymers combination showed higher drying rates than samples conditioned by polymer without PAX addition, allowing a reduction of the drying time (see Fig. 3). Table 1 shows the drying characteristics of the samples. The drying time decreases and the average drying rate increases with the dual conditioners addition, while the initial water content decreases as well as the total amount water to be removed.

However, problems and regulations on environmental issues, mandatory stocking of 100 % native North American salmon, and disease have impacted economic viability of the U. S. salmon industry. In response to these problems, the USDA ARS developed the National Cold Water Marine Aquaculture Center (NCWMAC) in Franklin, Maine. The NCWMAC is adjacent to the University of Maine Center for Cooperative Aquaculture Research on the shore of Taunton Bay and shares essential infrastructure to maximize efficiency. Facilities are used to conduct research on Atlantic salmon and other cold water marine finfish species. The initial research focus for the Franklin location is to develop a comprehensive Atlantic salmon breeding program from native North American fish stocks leading to the development and release of genetically improved salmon to commercial producers. The Franklin location has unique ground water resources to supply freshwater, brackish water, salt water or filtered seawater to fish culture tanks. Research facilities include office space, primary and secondary hygiene rooms, and research tank bays for culturing 200 + Atlantic salmon families with incubation, parr, smolt, on-grow, and broodstock tanks. Tank sizes are 0. 14 m 3 for parr, 9 m 3 for smolts, and 36, 46 and 90 m 3 for subadults and broodfish. Culture tanks are equipped with recirculating systems utilizing biological (fluidized sand) filtration, carbon dioxide stripping, supplemental oxygenation and ozonation, and ultraviolet sterilization.

Wear resistant materials {{are designed to}} prolong the life of equipment used to transport the slurry such as pumps, hoses, grinders, conveyor <b>belts,</b> <b>screens,</b> etc. In this study, the erosive wear mechanisms of rubber pump lining materials used in slurry pumps were explored at a structural level. The erosive wear mechanisms for rubber pump lining materials have not be extensively investigated in the literature. Arnold and Hutchings [1] were the pioneers in this field of tribology, however, {{a number of key}} areas for study remain. Although the wear mechanisms of rubber wear in slurry erosion are well documented in the literature, the chemical degradation of the rubber during this erosive wear has not been investigated. Furthermore, the viscoelastic properties of the rubber and their correlation with erosive wear have not been well documented. The approach to {{this study was to investigate}} four different rubber compounds used in slurry transport pumps and determine the wear mechanisms and their correlation with physical, viscoelastic and chemical properties of the rubbers. A slurry jet erosion test was used to investigate the wear rate of each compound under different variables. The samples were then chemically analysed using a Fourier Transfer Infra Red (FT-IR) Spectrometer to determine the extent of chemical change to the surface of the rubber during erosive wear testing. The physical properties of the rubber were tested using conventional test methods, whereas a Rubber Process Analyser 2000 (RPA 2000) was used to determine the key viscoelastic properties. It was important to investigate these properties of the rubber compounds to determine which properties could be correlated with erosive wear. Through FT-IR analysis of heat aged samples of the rubber compounds, it was established that erosive slurry wear does not correlate with aging, however, heat aging influences the hardness, resilience and viscoelastic properties which increases the wear rate of the rubber compounds. The key findings from this study were that heat aging would increase the tan &# 948; and hardness, and lower the resilience, hence, causing lower erosive wear resistance in all the rubbers. Tan &# 948;, hardness and resilience could be correlated with erosive wear loss, the heat aging effect and the chemistry of the rubber compounds. The influence of the type of reinforcing filler and cure systems could also be correlated with erosive wear resistance. Rubbers with a high loading of reinforcing carbon black resulted in a low wear resistance in comparison to a high wear resistance for silica and silane filled rubber compounds. Tan &# 948; was also correlated with the type of reinforcing filler used in the rubber chemistry. The significance of these findings is important for the future design of rubber compounds used in slurry erosion wear resistant pump liners.

50|$|On 31 October 2007, the Administrative Board of the Port Authority {{nevertheless}} {{granted the}} internal {{approval for the}} 5 projects for the installation of cement dust plants and mega-silos on the city’s coast, without answering any {{of the thousands of}} oppositions filed and without any changes to the plans. The PSOE members on the Board voted against the projects, while the PP Mayor and his City Council representative on the Board abstained after calling on the PortAuthority to modify all the projects to lower the height of the buildings to within the 12 m maximum set out by the Special Plan for the Port. The Mayor also called on the Port Authority to seek an immediate solution to the clouds of dust occasioned by the open air unloading of cement in the port. The Administrative Board, however, passed by a majority the motion to pass the projects without modification to the City Councils Planning Department to decide whether construction licences should be granted for such projects so close to the city centre and to be built right in the centre of the city’s coastal strip. The vote of the Administration Board of the Port Authority, taken without responding first to any of the thousands of citizens’ objections, has increased and European environmentalists’ indignation.On 4 November 2007, the President of the Port Authority, Sergio Campos, gave an interview in the national press about the various problems and the local opposition encountered in relation to the new plans for Alicante port. He indicated that the biodiesel chemical plant may have to be located elsewhere (given that the City Council rejected the application for its construction licence because its 20-metre planned height exceeds the 12 m general limit for the port and {{due to the lack of}} studies and licences for the distribution by road of the end product). Campos also admitted that “the port’s concern for the environment is grows stronger day by day” in light of the pressure from the residents, the city, and local and national government, and recognised that “Alicante is a commercial port not an industrial port” but he insisted again that the mega-silos are necessary since they are a “relocation” of the 3 silos 8 m high in Quay 14. He also recognised publicly, for the first time, that at present “clinker cement dust and carbon are moved by grain and bulldozer, and that if there is a strong wind it is true that clouds of dust are produced”. He admitted that the measures set out in the 2003 environmental permission for the port (use of chutes, <b>screens,</b> closed conveyor <b>belts,</b> watering systems, taking measures to prohibit unloading on days of high wind, measuring dust particles in the air during unloading) had not been taken but he stated his “desire” to implement them in the future. He made it clear that these open-air activities are planned not only to continue but to grow in future, and that they are not being substituted by the plans for the mega-silos and cement dust plants.On 6 November 2007, the editorial of a local newspaper summed up the situation by stating that “What is clear is that once built, these silos for the storage of cement will substantially change the appearance of the city of Alicante, above all when viewed from the sea or from the coastal roads, and the projects will eclipse the Castle of Santa Barbara and the “Cara del Moro”, the historical symbols of Alicante city, relegating them to a secondary position”.|$|R
