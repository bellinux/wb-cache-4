In order {{to evaluate their}} behaviour, fire doors must undergo a <b>standardized</b> <b>fire</b> test. A realistic simulation of the heating process can be useful during the design phase {{in order to reduce}} the number of prototypes to be constructed and tested. In this work, a finite element model is developed with the aim of capturing the qualitative behaviour of the fire door and its supporting frame. Two different types of thermal analysis are considered: (1) transient analysis and (2) steady-state analysis. A non-linear mechanical analysis predicts the displacement field that occurs at the end of the heating phase. The adopted model is validated through a comparison with experimental measurements obtained during standard fire tests, confirming that the proposed approach can be a valid tool for the prediction of the thermo-mechanical performance of a naval fire door. © The Author(s) 2015...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{fire alarms}} {{are based on}} smoke detection. Nevertheless, in some fire {{scenarios}} volatiles are released before smoke. Fire detectors based only on chemical sensors have already been proposed as they may provide faster response, {{but they are still}} prone to false alarms in the presence of nuisances. These systems rely heavily on pattern recognition techniques to discriminate fires from nuisances. In this context, it is important to test the systems according to international standards for fires and testing the system against a diversity of nuisances. In this work, we investigate the behavior of a gas sensor array coupled to sensor fusion algorithms forfire detection when exposed to <b>standardized</b> <b>fires</b> and several nuisances. Results confirmed the ability to detect fires (97 % Sensitivity), although the system still produces a significant rate of false alarms (35 %) for nuisances not presented in the training set.

One of this system is the structural Light Steel Framing (LSF), which consists in cold formed steel frames juxtaposed with drywall enclosure of different materials, such as cement boards, wood boards and plasterboards. Despite of the advantages of this system, there is still a concern about their fire safety. Therefore, this paper aimed to verify the fire resistance of LSF systems with two types of plasterboard, one composed of standard plasterboard (common) and the other one by fire-resistant plasterboards. The samples were tested according to the ISO 834 - 1 <b>standardized</b> <b>fire</b> curve (ISO, 2014). During the tests, it was evaluated integrity, thermal insulation and structural stability of each solution.

30|$|All {{these efforts}} were {{foundational}} {{with respect to}} fire research, quantitative fire protection engineering, and <b>standardized</b> <b>fire</b> test methods. Oxygen consumption calorimeters became widespread in the fire research and testing world. The cone calorimeter design by Babrauskas et al. (1982) and the product fire collector design by Heskestad (1981) became models {{for the design of}} calorimeters from bench scale to full scale. The fact that the apparatus required was only an exhaust hood and fan that was required to remove smoke from the lab anyway and instrumentation required included only a flow measurement and oxygen concentration measurement made the OCC approach readily adaptable to a range of measurements and test methods. All this equipment could be installed appropriately in the exhaust system and remain in place for use in all testing using the hood. Smoke obscuration, CO, CO 2 measurements were also typically added. Because the instrumentation {{was not part of the}} test setup, but rather was integral to the facility, little test specific work was required. Modern computer-based data acquisition equipment resulted in real time output of heat release rate as the test proceeded.|$|E

40|$|Fires in {{buildings}} {{are characterized by}} a heating phase followed by a cooling phase, yet {{the effects of the}} latter on structures are not well covered in the current approaches to structural fire engineering. Indeed the actual requirement of non-occurrence of structural failure at peak temperature does not guarantee against a delayed failure during or after the cooling phase of a fire, which puts at risk the fire brigades and people proceeding to a building inspection after a fire. Therefore there is an urgent need to better comprehend and characterize the materials and structures behavior under decreasing temperatures. Sensitivity to delayed failure of a structural component depends on its typology and constituting materials. In particular, two structural components with the same Fire Resistance rating (R) under <b>standardized</b> <b>fire</b> may exhibit very distinct behavior under natural fire, one of them being more prone to delayed failure than the other. With the aim of quantifying this effect, a new indicator is proposed that characterizes the performance of structures under natural fire conditions. The paper presents the methodology to derive this new indicator as well as results for different typologies of structural components. Parametric analyses highlight the prime influence of constitutive material and thermal inertia of the element on the post-peak behavior. Used in conjunction with the Fire Resistance rating, it is shown how the new indicator carries additional and significant information for classifying structural systems in terms of their fire performance and propensity to delayed failure.

40|$|Today’s {{modern society}} strives to build higher {{and more complex}} {{buildings}} due to the constant increase of urban population. Several high and complex buildings have been constructed during the last decades {{in various parts of}} the world. However, this trend is relatively new and unexplored in Sweden. Another architectural trend in the construction industry is to create large window areas. The latest development of glass façade systems has made this request possible. The two most famous examples regarding these trends in Sweden are Kista Science Tower in Stockholm and Turning Torso in Malmö. The trend and technique to build high-rise buildings with alternative façade material, like glass, is rapidly implemented in Sweden. The lack of regulations, requirements and testing regarding the combination of these trends are consequences that follow the fast development. The requirements of today regarding fire safety design, only demand performance based design for buildings higher than sixteen floors. The Eurocode is another legislation, which contributes to more detailed guidelines regarding performance based design, and will shortly be implemented in all the affiliated countries in the European Union. Therefore a mix of current legislation and the Eurocode will be used in this thesis. This report theoretically examines how the fire develops when the exterior walls consisting of glass in an enclosed room breaks, when the room is located in the higher parts of a high rise building. The intensity of the fire tends to depend on the size of the opening. To illustrate the development of the temperature in the room, a comparison will be made with the curve for the <b>standardized</b> <b>fire,</b> ISO 834. Some of the temperature-time curves will be investigated further, to see how the increase in temperature affects the concrete and its strength. Furthermore, the radiation to the opposite façade wall is considered by using the calculated flame temperature and FireWind. To conclude the results, the temperature time-curves are highly affected by the size of the opening. In comparison with the ISO 834 -curve, all of the scenarios with openings larger than 2, 6 x 2, 5 m 2 resulted in more rapid and higher temperature developments. SAFIR showed that the curves, which exceeded the ISO 834 curve, had a large impact on the strength of the concrete at 20 - 30 millimetres depth. It is therefore necessary to have this in mind when deciding the thickness of the coating for the reinforced concrete. To ensure the resistance of the building’s framework, the time limit should be greater than 90 minutes, since most of the fire scenarios lasted up to 100 - 160 minutes. The likelihood of fire spread due to radiation is very high according to the results from FireWind. All cases, except one, exceed the recommended radiation level. It is therefore important that the entire glass façade system meets the required integrity and isolation to decrease the likelihood of fire spread, both within and between the compartments in the building.

50|$|After this fire, the Fire Chief's Association {{realized}} {{there had to}} be a way in which to <b>standardize</b> all <b>fire</b> apparatus identifiers throughout the county.

For example, Dania Beach built the first fire station in the county in the early 1900s, so they are given the rights to station number 1. Fort Lauderdale Fire-Rescue built the second station in Broward County, so they have the rights to the number station 2. This pattern continues for all stations throughout the county. If a station should close, the department to which the station belonged will keep the rights to that station number, should the department re-open that station, or build another one.|$|R

The study is based on life safety and protection of property priorities taking into account reaction to fire classes related to different types of fire loads and fire compartmentation requirements of the adjacent spaces of concern. The proposals include the following main principles in relation to fire-separation requirements: In case of internal fire exposure the protective structure for combustible building parts needs to meet {{at least half of the}} fire-separating requirement for the compartment of concern. In case of external fire exposure the protection time requirement can be 15 minutes less than for the internal protection. The proposals are applicable for residential buildings and offices.

However, there might be problems arise to practice fire drill especially in high-rise building. This research intends to study on fire drill procedure and identify any possible common problems arises when practicing fire drill in high-rise building in Kuala Lumpur.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{movement toward}} performance-based building codes is prompting {{the need for}} new computational methods to predict fire endurance of wood assemblies. Progress in the past twenty years in understanding fire endurance of individual solid wood components has been achieved in many different countries. The greatest opportunity for major advance in fire research is the development of computational fire endurance models that incorporate heat transfer, thermal degrade, and structural analysis algorithms for not only single components but multiple-component assemblies subject to <b>standardized</b> and natural <b>fire</b> scenarios. Full-scale test programs will also be needed to verify computational techniques and further deve!op thermal degradation theories. Why Fire Research is Needed Fire is a special design consideration addressed to minimize the risk of failure modes including structural collapse. Fire is not a loading condition in the traditional structural sense of applied forces, but instead an environmental condition that can have a dramatic impact on load carrying capacity and structure safety. The primary objective of fire resistant structural design is to maintain structural integrity during a fire for a sufficient period so that occupants may safely evacuate, fire fighters may safely extinguish the fire and to minimize property loss. This design process includes confining any potential fire with strategically-placed barriers and fire stops. Research on fire resistant design and construction in the United States appears to have diminished in recent years, although internationally it continues to be actively researched. In the U. S. fire resistant design receives much less research attention than similar efforts related to earthquake resistant design or the response of structures to wind events such as hurricanes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this educational module is to familiarize undergraduate engineering students with basic principles related to fire protection. This instructional module can be studied separately or {{as a component of}} an upper-level engineering course. The information in this module is appropriate for courses on occupational safety and health, and applied engineering chemistry. In addition, the module could serve as a complement to courses on fluid mechanics and heat transfer; strength of materials and structures; and design courses. The module introduces basic fire protection issues related to the safeguarding of life and property against fire loss. It describes the fundamental principles of fire science and of the dynamics of fire growth in buildings and demonstrates how a sound understanding of these is necessary before viable fire protection measures can be implemented. The module develops an engineering appreciation of standard practices and regulations related to the prevention, detection and suppression of fires. The primary thrust of the module is to describe current fire safety practices and regulations; however, a brief account is given of the emerging discipline of fire protection engineering. This new field is expected to foster engineered design solutions to fire safety problems which may be more cost-effective and flexible than <b>standardized</b> solutions.

40|$|Designers of structures, as {{any other}} designers, are under {{constant}} pressure to optimise structures. Complex methodologies {{have been developed to}} iterate structural designs until an optimized solution is obtained. The desired output being: maximization of strength while minimizing weight, cost and any other parameter that negatively affects the sustainability of the structure. Once this process is achieved, prescriptive fire resistance requirements are met by introducing homogeneous fire proofing through the entire structure as demanded by codes, independent of the function of any particular structural element. The procedure follows the use of a <b>standardized</b> worst case <b>fire</b> (as per ISO 834) as the thermal load on the structure and the verification that individual structural elements do not reach a predefined critical temperature. Given that the temperature increase is directly associated to the thermal mass of the structural element, slim optimized structural elements generally will require thicker fire proofing. Furthermore, single element testing does not take on account optimised load redistribution or the thermo-mechanical behaviour of structural systems, therefore the same level of thermal protection will be provided for critical and non-critical structural elements (or sectors). The result is most likely a structural system that, when it comes to fire behaviour, is most likely over dimensioned where it is not necessary and under dimensioned when it is critical. Both outcomes are inconsistent with the objectives of optimization. This paper presents a framework that enables the introduction of structural fire behaviour into a unique optimization process that delivers a comprehensively optimized structure. This framework addresses the development of realistic fires within specific structures, proper assessment of material property evolution with temperature, adequate utilization of thermo-mechanical models to assess structural performance and the proper definition of failure criteria...|$|R
