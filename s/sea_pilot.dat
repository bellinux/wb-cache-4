25|$|On 29 January 1940 Flight Lieutenant Caesar Hull led {{a section}} of 43 Squadron to {{intercept}} an unidentified aircraft caught on radar. Ten miles south-west of Hartlepool at 90:45 GMT, they engaged a Heinkel He 111. It was one of nine He 111s that had separated form its formation upon reaching the English coast. Hull, Carey and Pilot Officer H. L North fired at it as they chased it out over the sea. They observed no results and returned to base. Hull found a bullet hole in his Hurricane upon landing. The He 111 was from 6. Staffel (Squadron), Kampfgeschwader 26 (4./KG 26). On 30 January Frank and Hull were on patrol near Coquet Island. They intercepted 26 He 111s from KG 26 that were targeting merchant shipping and fishing boats. The German bombers were flying at low altitude just below the cloud line at approximately 1,000ft. This tactic enabled the German bomber pilot to easily escape into the cloud if spotted. The two pilots dropped to sea-level and engaged an enemy unseen. The He 111, from, 4./KG 26, crashed into the <b>sea.</b> <b>Pilot</b> Feldwebel Helmut Höfner were posted missing in action. The observer was confirmed to {{have been killed in}} action when his body was recovered. Carey attempted to use his gun camera to record the Heinkel as it sank nose-first on the water but it failed to work.|$|E

40|$|A {{cohort of}} 1455 <b>sea</b> <b>pilots</b> and boatmen {{employed}} after 1921 was established. Those identified and alive in 1951 (n = 1323) {{were linked to}} the Swedish cause of death register 1951 - 84. In 21 352 person-years 383 deaths were observed among <b>sea</b> <b>pilots</b> compared with 379. 3 expected (SMR = 101; 95 % CI between 99 and 112) and in 12, 127 person-years the observed number of deaths among boatmen was 136, expected 135. 9 (SMR = 100) when Swedish men were used as a reference population. For ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (ICD- 8 : 410 - 414) the SMR was equal to 96 (obs = 131, exp = 137. 2) for <b>sea</b> <b>pilots</b> and 91 (obs = 44, exp = 48. 4) for boatmen. No trend over time or geographical differences could be observed. A healthy worker effect could not explain why there was no excess mortality from IHD...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{worked out}} of the Thames under canvas, with a North <b>Sea</b> <b>pilot</b> on board. His name was Jermyn, and he dodged all day long about the galley drying his {{handkerchief}} before the stove. Apparently he never slept. He was a dismal man, with a perpetual tear sparkling {{at the end of}} his nose, who either had been in trouble, or was in trouble, or expected to be in trouble--couldn't be happy unless something went wrong. He mistrusted my youth, my common-sense, and my seamanship, and made a point of showing it in a hundred little ways. I dare say he was right. It seems to me I knew very little then, and I know not much more now; but I cherish a hate for that Jermyn to this day.|$|E
60|$|The view seawards was indescribably {{magnificent}} {{from the}} elevated ridge along which they hastened. The Downs {{was crowded with}} hundreds of vessels of every form and size, {{as well as of}} every country, all waiting for a favourable breeze to enable them to quit the roadstead and put to <b>sea.</b> <b>Pilot</b> luggers and other shore-boats of various kinds were moving about among these; some on the look-out for employment, others intent on doing a stroke of business in the smuggling way, if convenient. Far away along the beach men of the coastguard might be seen, like little black specks, with telescopes actively employed, ready to pounce on and overhaul (more or less stringently according to circumstances) every boat that touched the shingle. Everything in nature seemed silent and motionless, {{with the exception of the}} sea-mews that wheeled round the summits of the cliffs or dived into the glassy sea.|$|E
60|$|In {{the way of}} {{compliment}} {{there is}} nothing to beat this from a ship's captain to his second mate {{at the end of a}} voyage, when the work is over and the subordinate is done with. And there is a pathos in that memory, for the poor fellow never went to sea again after all. He was already ailing when we passed St. Helena; was laid up for a time when we were off the Western Islands, but got out of bed to make his Landfall. He managed to keep up on deck as far as the Downs, where, giving his orders in an exhausted voice, he anchored for a few hours to send a wire to his wife and take aboard a North <b>Sea</b> <b>pilot</b> to help him sail the ship up the east coast. He had not felt equal to the task by himself, for it is the sort of thing that keeps a deep-water man on his feet pretty well night and day.|$|E

2500|$|Gladstone {{paid off}} from {{military}} service on 16 July 1956, having sailed [...] since commissioning. The ship {{was sold to}} the Port Phillip <b>Sea</b> <b>Pilots</b> Association {{for use as a}} relief and accommodation ship. In this role, she was renamed Akuna (sometimes referred to as Akuna II, as the association had previously operated the former [...] under this name from 1925 to 1957) and registered with Melbourne as her home port. Each of the over 40 maritime pilots in the association owned shares in the vessel, and they took weekly turns as Master and Pilot in Charge. A raised poop deck was installed to add accommodation space. Akuna began operations in mid-1958. By the 1970s, the Port Phillip <b>Sea</b> <b>Pilots</b> Association had made the decision to use high-powered launches and Akuna was no longer needed.|$|R

Some people thought that the novelty would wear off and then business would fail. However, the various tourism boards in Victoria were excited {{about the prospect of}} having a vehicular ferry, linking the two peninsulas and would also create tourism jobs.|$|R

50|$|Soon {{after she}} had been built, SS Turku was {{transferred}} to military service. The ship served during the Winter War (1939-1940). Despite the extreme conditions of that very harsh winter, the ship was in active service almost without a break. During the Continuation War (1941-1944), the vessel served as a convoy ship in the Åland Sea.After the war, the vessel returned to her original task, serving the National Board of Navigation (pilotage service) as a maintenance and inspection vessel on the Archipelago <b>Sea.</b> <b>Pilot</b> training {{was part of the}} daily routine on board, and so was sea mark maintenance.|$|E

The Duhnen was refitted and renamed Yankee at the Brixham yards. The new Yankee was 96 ft overall, with a waterline of 81 ft, a maximum draft of 11 ft.
