Moreover, these all plastic products would be cheaper than the current products based on conventional <b>semi</b> <b>conductors.</b> Apart from these advantaged, {{there is also a}} disadvantage to plastic electronics. The main factor that determines the efficiency of electronic devices is the mobility of charges in the material. Experiments with plastic electronic components show that the mobility of charges in plastic is at least a thousand times lower than in conventional <b>semi</b> <b>conductors.</b> We determined the mobility of charges along isolated polymer chains and along polymers chains as they are used in electronic components. Our (experimental and calculated) results show that the motion of charges is not only strongly hindered by the chain ends and by breaks in the chains, but also by disorder along the polymer chains and in the direct environment. Our results indicate that mobility along polymers with a relatively rigid, ladder-type structure (in a ordered environment) can be as high as the mobilities for charges in conventional <b>semi</b> <b>conductors</b> and about a factor of thousand higher than the mobilities determined experimentally for polymers so far.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of synthetic conjugated materials has enabled organic electronic {{devices such as}} solar cells, field-effect transistors and sensors to rival their inorganic counterparts in performance at significantly lower cost. Conducting polymers such as polyaniline constitute an important class of such materials, but their properties are difficult to study due to polydispersity, complex chain conformations and lack of solubility. In particular, assembling conducting polymers into highly crystalline domains {{similar to that of}} small molecule (<b>semi)</b> <b>conductors</b> has proven to be challenging, which has limited their integration into electronic devices that require high carrier mobility and stability such as organic field-effect transistors and solar cells. On the other hand, oligomers represent a unique middle ground between conducting polymers and molecular (<b>semi)</b> <b>conductors</b> because oligomers (e. g. oligoanilines) retain the chemical properties of the parent polymer, while also possessing properties typically associated with molecular (<b>semi)</b> <b>conductors</b> especially in regard to monodispersity and self-assembly. In this thesis, an oligomer approach for advancing the field of conducting polymers is presented. A myriad of conjugated oligomers are examined as the more structurally rigid, pure, and soluble model systems to tackle important challenges in this field. This approach has opened new opportunities for (1) understanding the fundamental packing, transport, and self-assembly properties for polymers; (2) the rational design of high performance conducting polymers by analyzing the oligomer building blocks; (3) realizing the long-sought solution-based bottom-up growth for vertically oriented arrays of organic single crystals; and (4) deciphering the role of oligomers in improving the crystallinity of the parent polymers. The advancement of knowledge in these fields has also allowed us to create high performance hybrid solar cells, complex core/shell nanostructures, and microcontact printing methods with nanoscale resolution...|$|R

50|$|The {{properties}} of these hybrid materials range between the {{properties of}} the constituent atoms and between individual hybrid structures. Graphene is considered a zero band semi-conductor and boron nitride is considered a wide gap <b>semi</b> <b>conductor.</b> Combining the two in various arrangements leads to a variable band gap which can be tuned by structure specifics to have various properties. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes when coated with boron nitride exhibit enhanced thermal activity compared to the substituents, but act as an electrical insulator. Graphene layers combined by boron nitride nanotubes exhibit similar band gap changes, but the strain of the ring position in the junction also induces a pseudomagnetic force on the ring structure due to the electron delocalization.|$|E

40|$|To {{describe}} the thermal behaviour of nanostructured materials and nanoelectronic devices, new properties and models {{have to be}} determined at the atomic scale. Recent experimental techniques such as near field microscopy 1 - 2 allow to investigate heat transfer at small scales, but, the spatial resolution is still greater than 50 to 100 nm. This remains too large when the typical length of interest is a few nm. Moreover, at this scale, the sensor may have a significant influence on the temperature or the property to be measured. Numerical simulation is then the solution to study the matter at the atomic scale and to predict the thermophysical properties of solids. Molecular dynamics allows to simulate the material behaviour at the atomic scale 3 - 4. It requires the knowledge of potentials that {{describe the}} interaction between atoms.

In conclusion, after dwelling on these topics, it was found out that Nigeria has the capacity to start to produce advanced engineering materials for national development. 1. 0 Introduction Nigeria as a nation is blessed with abundant of human and mineral resources. With our population over 140 million (1), and about 100 universities and many other tertiary institutions in the country, our ability to develop Advanced Engineering materials should not arise at all. The question that should come to mind is, whether the country is ready to venture into the world of advanced engineering material? This is the answer this paper will try to address in the modest way by outline our capacity as a nation to develop Advanced Engineering materials. Then what is advanced Engineering Materials? They are either traditional materials whose properties have been enhanced or they are newly developed, high-performance materials and may cut across wide spectrum; metal, ceramics, glass, and polymers. These advanced engineering materials are used in high technology. Such materials can stand up to the high-temperature, highly radioactive environment of a nuclear reactor, the appropriate wear and equipment for the astronauts, heat-resistant ceramic tiles to enable the space shuttle to re-enter the earth’s atmosphere without burning up, and <b>semi</b> <b>conductors</b> and multi-million chips for sophisticated computer circuits and telecommunications equipment are examples of such materials.
