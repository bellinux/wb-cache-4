40|$|Abstract Background Potato virus X {{has been}} {{developed}} into an expression vector for plants. It is widely used to express foreign genes. In molecular manipulation, the foreign genes need to be <b>sub-cloned</b> into the vector. The constructed plasmid needs to be amplified. Usually, during amplification stage, the foreign genes are not expressed. However, if the foreign gene is expressed, the construction work could be interrupted. Two different viral genes were <b>sub-cloned</b> into the vector, but only one foreign gene was successfully <b>sub-cloned.</b> The other foreign gene, canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV- 2) VP 1 could not be <b>sub-cloned</b> into the vector and amplified without mutation (frame shift mutation). Results A cryptic promoter in the PVX vector was discovered with RT-PCR. The promoter activity was studied with Northern blots and Real-time RT-PCR. Conclusion It {{is important to recognize}} the homologous promoter sequences in the vector when a virus is developed as an expression vector. During the plasmid amplification stage, an unexpected expression of the CPV- 2 VP 1 gene (not in the target plants, but in E. coli) can interrupt the downstream work. </p...|$|R

Actual refactorings associated with the detected clones were obtained from changes identified between consecutive versions of open source software artifacts. Based on two separate studies, observations reveal instances of <b>sub-clone</b> refactoring where only part of the clone ranges are actually refactored. We conclude that <b>sub-clone</b> refactoring should be considered to augment refactoring performed on the entire clone...|$|E

Seven BLM-resistant cell lines were established {{by exposure to}} escalating BLM concentrations {{over a period of}} 16 - 24 months. IC 50 values and cell doubling times were quantified using a real time cytotoxicity assay. COMET and γ-H 2 AX assays, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis assessment further investigated the mechanisms of BLM resistance in these cell lines. Results: Compared with parental cell lines, real time cytotoxicity assays revealed 7 to 49 fold increases in IC 50 and a mean doubling time increase of 147 % (range 64 %- 352 %) in BLM-resistant <b>sub-clones</b> (p< 0. 05 for both). Higher maintenance BLM concentrations were associated with higher IC 50 and increased doubling times (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Contractions {{elicited}} by CaCl 2 on isolated rat stomach strip preparations {{have been}} reported to be potentiated by interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta). We have investigated whether this effect can be reduced by the putative IL- 1 beta antagonist, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha MSH). Additionally, the effects of alpha MSH on the specific binding of IL- 1 beta to B- and T-cells have been investigated to further clarify its inhibitory activities. Both alpha MSH and its carboxyl terminal tripeptide concentration dependently reduced the potentiation of CaCl 2 -induced contractions caused by IL- 1 beta but not those caused by leukotriene D 4, the parent molecule being approximately 250 times more active. Additionally, both peptides potently and selectively reduced 125 I-IL- 1 beta binding to the T-cell <b>sub-clone</b> EL 4 - 6. 1 but not to the B-cell <b>sub-clone</b> 1 H 7.

40|$|Children with Down {{syndrome}} (DS) {{and acute}} lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) have poorer survival and more relapses than non-DS children with ALL, highlighting an urgent need for deeper mechanistic understanding of DS-ALL. Here, using full-exome or cancer genes-targeted sequencing of 42 ALL samples from 39 DS patients, we uncover driver mutations in RAS, (KRAS and NRAS) recurring to a similar extent (15 / 42) as JAK 2 (12 / 42) mutations or P 2 RY 8 -CRLF 2 fusions (14 / 42). RAS mutations are almost completely mutually exclusive with JAK 2 mutations (P = 0. 016), driving a combined total of two-thirds of analysed cases. Clonal architecture analysis reveals that both RAS and JAK 2 drove sub-clonal expansions primarily initiated by CRLF 2 rearrangements, and/or mutations in chromatin remodellers and lymphocyte differentiation factors.

40|$|A pool of selectedlacticacidbacteria {{was used}} to ferment {{suspensions}} of ryeflour. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed that 109 of the 129 ethanol-soluble rye polypeptides were hydrolysed almost totally by lacticacidbacteria. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization—time of flight mass spectrometry and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis confirmed the hydrolysis of prolamins. After 48 h fermentation, no prolamin polypeptides were recognized by R 5 -Western analysis. HPLC analysis of glutelin polymers showed a very low bacterial proteolysis but a pH dependent hydrolysis probably due to activation of rye enzymes. Prolamins were extracted from ryeflour and used to produce a peptic–tryptic (PT) -digest for in vitro tests with K 562 (S) <b>sub-clone</b> and Caco- 2 /TC 7 cells of human origin. The PT-digest was also treated with lacticacidbacteria before assay. The Minimal Agglutinating Capacity increased ca. 8 -times when K 562 (S) <b>sub-clone</b> cells were exposed to rye PT-digest treated with lacticacidbacteria. Hydrolysis of rye PT-digest by lacticacidbacteria decreased the toxicity of PT-digest itself towards Caco- 2 /TC 7 cells as estimated by cell viability, caspase- 3 activity and release of nitric oxide. Rye prolamins and glutelins were extracted from doughs and subjected to PT digestion. Compared to PT-digests from chemically acidified dough, coeliac jejunal biopsies exposed to the PT-digest from the dough fermented by lacticacidbacteria did not show an increase of the infiltration of CD 3 + intraepithelial lymphocytes.

40|$|Abstract Background Lewy bodies (LB) are a neuropathological {{hallmark}} of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. The role their formation plays in disease pathogenesis {{is not well}} understood, in part because studies of LB have been limited to examination of post-mortem tissue. LB formation may be detrimental to neuronal survival or merely an adaptive response to other ongoing pathological processes. In a human cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) neural cell model that expresses mitochondrial DNA from PD patients, we observed spontaneous formation of intracellular protein aggregates (“cybrid LB” or CLB) that replicate morphological and biochemical properties of native, cortical LB. We studied mitochondrial morphology, bioenergetics and biogenesis signaling by creating stable <b>sub-clones</b> of three PD cybrid cell lines derived from cells expressing CLB. Results Cloning based on CLB expression had a differential effect on mitochondrial morphology, movement and oxygen utilization in each of three <b>sub-cloned</b> lines, but no long-term change in CLB expression. In one line (PD 63 CLB), mitochondrial function declined compared to the original PD cybrid line (PD 63 Orig) due to low levels of mtDNA in nucleoids. In another cell line (PD 61 Orig), the reverse was true, and cellular and mitochondrial function improved after <b>sub-cloning</b> for CLB expression (PD 61 CLB). In the third cell line (PD 67 Orig), there was no change in function after selection for CLB expression (PD 67 CLB). Conclusions Expression of mitochondrial DNA derived from PD patients in cybrid cell lines induced the spontaneous formation of CLB. The creation of three <b>sub-cloned</b> cybrid lines from cells expressing CLB resulted in differential phenotypic changes in mitochondrial and cellular function. These changes were driven by the expression of patient derived mitochondrial DNA in nucleoids, {{rather than by the}} presence of CLB. Our studies suggest that mitochondrial DNA {{plays an important role in}} cellular and mitochondrial dysfunction in PD. Additional studies will be needed to assess the direct effect of CLB expression on cellular and mitochondrial function. </p...|$|R

The original goal {{of this study was to}} locate and characterize the gene that is responsible for the first dehydrogenation step of the cyclohexanol (chn) degradation pathway in the Grampositive bacterium Rhodococcus maris strain HI- 31 in order to obtain the full gene complement for cyclohexanol degradation. Instead, three new open reading frames (ORFs) or genes were obtained as the result of cloning and sequencing of a 5 -kb SacI fragment upstream of the known chn gene cluster in strain HI- 31. Two of the ORFs, designated chnB 2 and chnC 2, were found to be homologs of the chnB and chnC encoding a cyclohexanone monooxygenase (CHMO) and hydrolase, respectively. This implies possible gene duplication of this portion of the pathway. A third ORF is a potential long-chain fatty acid Co-A ligase. Characteristics of the three ORFs are described. In addition, attempts were made to <b>sub-clone</b> the 5 -kb SacI fragment into pT 7 - 6 expression vector for activity assays, etc...|$|E
30|$|Efficiency of <b>sub-cloning</b> was {{verified}} by performing double digestions with BamHI and SacI on the recombinant plasmid extracted from colonies of L. lactis growing on selective medium. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs and ligases were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsband, CA). Nucleotide sequencing of all PCR fragments cloned {{was carried out}} at BMR Genomics (Padova, Italy) to check whether any mutation was introduced.|$|R

Briefly, the gene encoding pineapple stem bromelain was initially cloned into pENTR/TEV/D-TOPO before being <b>sub-cloned</b> into the expression vector pDEST 17 (Invitrogen, USA). The expression vector containing recombinant bromelain gene was then transformed in E. coli BL 21 -AI competent cells.|$|R

The {{research}} concerns <b>sub-cloning</b> {{the gene}} for HGXPRT from Plasmodium falciparum from a vector with a His-tag facility to one without, expression of the protein in E. coli, and purification. On an analytical scale (40 ml culture), a purification procedure was developed that involves extraction of contaminating proteins by anion exchange chromatography (HGXPRT does not bind under the conditions used), followed by Reactive Red 120 agarose affinity chromatography...|$|R
