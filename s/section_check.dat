RoxygenReady helps in creating the function annotations needed to compile a proper package by Roxygen 2. More precisely, RoxygenReady creates Roxygen skeletons, a certain format for inline function annotation (see below). By so, it spares {{you a lot of}} time documenting your functions easily and precisely. The annotation skeleton it creates, can be automatically compiled into a package with a few lines of code. Packages are the standard way of distribution R code, as they integrate with other services, code sharing becomes much easier. See the installation section for an example. You can pass a whole file to RoxygenReady, and it will create Roxygen skeletons for all functions defined in the file! Installation and Usage 	 	Install directly from GitHub via devtools with one R command: 	devtools::install_github(repo = "vertesy/RoxygenReady/RoxygenReady") 	 	 	 [...] . then simply load the package: 	require("RoxygenReady") 	 	 	and create Roxygen skeletons for your functions 	RoxygenReady("Path/to/your/script. r") 	 Workflow Explained: a streamlined package creation 1. You start out with your. R file containing your favorite functions. print 11 more <- function(n= 1, m= 1) { # a function with real added value print (n+(11 *m)) } - RoxygenReady expects a short description in the first line, after the `{` character, which will be parsed into the description field of the function annotation. 2. Construct Roxygen skeletons RoxygenReady from all functions in your script. #' print 11 more #' #' # a function with real added value #' @param n #' @param m #' @examples print 11 more(n= 1, m= 1) #' @export print 11 more <- function(n= 1, m= 1) { print (n+(11 *m)) } 3. Compile your package by roxygen. - See section: **How to create an R package?** 4. Installing your package and share via GitHub! install. packages(YourPackage) require(YourPackage) Browse for help on your functions help(print 11 more) : You can share your package on GitHub, and everyone can super easily install it, like this package: read on! Package content A couple of functions to generate inline description from your functions, using their names and arguments as default input.

Several faults were mapped out from the two studied horizons. This was used in generating the time structure maps.

40|$|Hybrid frames {{composed}} of steel, concrete and composite members {{are widely used}} to-date due to their structural efficiency and economy as alternatives to traditional bare steel system, especially in high-rise buildings. However, the present design of this structural form is both inconvenient and inconsistent as it needs several separated design codes for bare steel (BS), reinforced concrete (RC) and steel-concrete composite (SCC) elements. This paper proposes a second-order design method which requires only <b>section</b> capacity <b>check</b> without the need of using prescriptive formulae in different codes for various structural forms. The member-based design using linear analysis and the effective length assumption is replaced by the iterative second-order analysis. Using the Pointwise-Equilibrium-Polynomial (PEP) element, which allows for member P-δ effects and initial imperfections {{in conjunction with a}} robust nonlinear incremental-iterative procedure, the nonlinear response of individual members and the structural system is captured directly and used for structure resistance checks. The sectional failure surface method is introduced for member strength checking. In the generation of failure surfaces of the arbitrarily shaped cross sections, the stress distribution along the concrete component is considered by an equivalent stress block or a number of segments and the entire structural steel section will be meshed into fibres for determination of section capacity. Verifications of the proposed integrated analysis and design method based on <b>section</b> capacity <b>check</b> are conducted using several examples with accuracy of the method demonstrated.
