40|$|To {{investigate}} the potential application of graphene oxide (GO) in bone repair, {{this study is}} focused on the preparation, characterization and cell behavior of graphene oxide coatings on quartz <b>substrata.</b> GO coatings were prepared on the <b>substrata</b> using a modified dip-coating procedure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy results demonstrated that the as-prepared coatings in this study were homogeneous and had an average thickness of similar to 67 nm. The rapid formation of a hydroxyapatite (HA) layer in the simulated body fluid (SBF) on GO coated <b>substrata</b> at day 14, as proved by SEM and x-ray diffraction (XRD), strongly indicated the bioactivity of coated <b>substrata.</b> In addition, MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells were cultured on the coated <b>substrata</b> to evaluate cellular activities. Compared with the non-coated <b>substrata</b> and tissue culture plates, no significant difference was observed on the coated <b>substrata</b> in terms of cytotoxicity, viability, proliferation and apoptosis. However, interestingly, higher levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin (OC) secretion were observed on the coated <b>substrata,</b> indicating that GO coatings enhanced cell differentiation compared with non-coated <b>substrata</b> and tissue culture plates. This study suggests that GO coatings had excellent biocompatibility and more importantly promoted MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cell differentiation and might be a good candidate as a coating material for orthopedic implants...|$|R

In order to study the specificity of activation in culture, two series of experiments were carried out. First, freshly isolated human keratinocytes were tested in short-term assays to determine their adhesion to several different ligand-coated <b>substrata</b> including fibronectin, collagen, basement membrane, concanavalin A, and wheat germ agglutinin. Second, human keratinocytes were cultured on the above <b>substrata,</b> and after various times, the cultured cells were harvested and retested for adhesion. We found that, compared with freshly isolated cells, cultured keratinocytes were activated more than 30 -fold in their attachment to fibronectin-coated <b>substrata</b> but unchanged in their attachment to other ligand-coated <b>substrata.</b> In addition, cultured keratinocytes were activated in their capacity to spread on all ligand-coated <b>substrata.</b> The cells that expressed enhanced adhesiveness were found to be mostly basal keratinocytes, based on immunofluorescence staining studies. Also, basal keratinocytes attached selectively on <b>substrata</b> coated with fibronectin, collagen, or HR- 9 basement membrane, but not on <b>substrata</b> coated with lectins.

This pattern is very variable (depending on environmental factors), sometimes partly presenting bands, and even occasionally being evenly dark. The shell is very variable in color and color patterns, showing great polymorphism. Shell coloration and patterns are very plastic in all species of the genus Theodoxus and these qualities {{may be influenced by}} factors like ionic composition of water, type of <b>substratum</b> and nutrition of individuals in various habitats. Zettler and colleagues (2004) showed that in the outer coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, the nearly black and often corroded shell form of Theodoxus fluviatilis is predominant, whereas in the inner (sheltered) parts of coastal waters, yellowish-green forms prevail. Glöer and Pešić (2015) observed that specimens from a darker stony substrate were black or dark brown. Shells of specimens of Theodoxus fluviatilis from Northern Europe are ornamented with a pattern of white, drop-like spots on a dark or red background. Specimens from South France and Spain are ornamented with a pattern of zigzag stripes, while specimens from the Balkans show all possible combinations of white drop-like spots and zigzag stripes. Animals from lacustrine habitats show dark or light bands on the shell.|$|E

40|$|Many {{views of}} stream {{invertebrate}} populations centre on drift {{as the major}} route of larval dispersal, but few studies have presented unambiguous information {{about the role of}} drift. We present the results from an experiment designed to determine whether the major route of colonisation of <b>substrata</b> by hydropsychid larvae (commonly found in the drift) is by drifting directly onto <b>substrata</b> or by walking along the stream bottom. The experimental design contained four treatments: <b>substrata</b> open to drifters and walkers; fenced <b>substrata</b> open to drifters only; and two treatments open to drifters and walkers that provided forms of fence controls. Fifteen replicates of each treatment were set out at random locations within a riffle at each of three sites, with each site on a different river (the Little River, the Steavenson River and the Acheron River) in the Acheron River catchment. The experiment was run twice, once during autumn (April 1999) and once during early summer (January 2000). Both experiments were colonised by three species of hydropsychids, Asmicridea sp. AV 1, and Smicrophylax sp. AV 1 and AV 2. We found that 2 nd/ 3 rd instars of Asmicridea sp. AV 1 walked as well as drifted, whereas all others primarily drifted. No relation between numbers of recruits and water speed was found when <b>substrata</b> were open only to drifters, whereas <b>substrata</b> open also to walkers gained more recruits in faster flows. Additionally, larvae more frequently abandoned nets in slow than fast flows, indicating that drifting into unfavourable flow environments may result in mortality or redispersal of larvae. These findings demonstrate that, although drift is important, it is not necessarily the only method used by hydropsychids to colonise <b>substrata.</b> Larvae may have more capacity to choose <b>substrata</b> in fast flows when they colonise <b>substrata</b> by walking. Spot measures of hydropsychid distribution cannot distinguish between these explanations. The finding that walkers can sometimes comprise significant numbers of recruits raises the prospect that hydropsychids can be sourced locally and have not inevitably drifted in from upstream locations. <br /...|$|R

Among examined material (5026 items) bryozoans were present on one type of abiotic (stones) and 40 types of biotic <b>substrata.</b> The biotic <b>substrata</b> we investigated included algae (12 taxa) and invertebrates (28 taxa: Hydrozoa, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Polychaeta, Crustacea, Ascidiacea, other Bryozoa). Both a priori ANOSIM (Global R = 0. 512, P = 0. 001) and cluster analyses reveal differences between the assemblages on different types of <b>substrata.</b> Cluster analyses distinguish two distinct groups of <b>substrata.</b> The first (stable) included stones, molluscs and Balanus balanus whilst the second (flexible) consisted of algae, hydrozoans and bryozoans.

40|$|Nutrient {{enrichment}} and {{its effect}} on benthic algal growth, community composition, and average cell size was assessed across two sites of differing pH within a single habitat. Nutrients were added using in situ <b>substrata,</b> which released either N, P, or no additional nutrients (controls) at each site for 21 days. Upon collection, chlorophyll and biovolume standing stocks of the attached algal microflora were measured. Chlorophyll concentration was different among all treatments, accumulating greatest on P, followed by N, and the least on C <b>substrata</b> (P < 0. 001) and was highest at site- 2 (P < 0. 001), while total algal biovolume was highest on P compared to both N and C <b>substrata</b> (P < 0. 05) and did not vary between sites. Increased growth on P <b>substrata</b> was due to the enhanced biovolume of filamentous green algae, although the affected taxa varied between sites. Biovolume to cell density ratios (as a measure of average cell size) were highest on P <b>substrata</b> over both N-enriched and control <b>substrata</b> (P < 0. 05) and this pattern was similar between sites.

We examined the influence of chemokines and fibronectin on the infiltration properties of non-infiltrative (do not migrate into 3 D <b>substrata)</b> and spontaneously infiltrative (migrate into 3 D <b>substrata)</b> T-cell lines. Infiltrative and non-infiltrative T-acute lymphocytic leukaemic cell lines exhibited no consistent differences {{with respect to the}} expression of various chemokine receptors or β 1 -integrins. Chemokines presented inside the collagen increased the depth of migration of infiltrative T-cell lines, but did not render non-infiltrative T-cell lines infiltrative, although they augmented the attachment of non-infiltrative T-cell lines to the upper surface of the collagen. The presence of fibronectin inside the collagen did not render non-infiltrative T-cell lines infiltrative, but markedly augmented the migration of ‘infiltrative’ T-cell lines into collagen. Both infiltrative and non-infiltrative T-cell lines showed migratory responses to chemokines in Boyden assays (migration detected on 2 D <b>substrata).</b> These results indicate that the process of T-cell infiltration/migration into 3 D <b>substrata</b> depends on a tissue penetration mechanism distinguishable from migration on 2 D <b>substrata</b> and that the basic capacity of T cells to infiltrate is independent of chemokines and ECM components applied as attractants...|$|R
40|$|Most of the {{seafloor}} is soft sediment, so hard <b>substrata</b> are isolated and island-like. In this dissertation, I explore how species distribution patterns on isolated marine hard <b>substrata</b> resemble terrestrial island communities, drawing on classical island biogeography theory and assembly rules, and describe how benthic invertebrate communities assemble in these island-like habitats. Higher species richness occurred on larger <b>substrata</b> (dropstones and shipwrecks), paralleling terrestrial island communities. However, while larger islands have greater habitat diversity and primary productivity, marine hard <b>substrata</b> are simpler habitats. Greater elevation in the benthic boundary layer may expose fauna to faster current, higher food supply and larval flux. <b>Substrata</b> located closer together had more similar communities, another pattern that resembles terrestrial islands. Dropstone fauna had a clumped distribution, indicating that larvae may disperse among <b>substrata</b> located close together, resulting in similar communities. In Svalbard fjords, benthic megafaunal communities {{were significantly different}} between Arctic- and Atlantic-influenced fjords. Depth and temperature had the greatest influence, with the highest diversity occurring in cold Rijpfjorden and on the north Svalbard shelf. Recruitment in Svalbard fjords was spatially and temporally variable, with lower recruitment in Rijpfjorden than in Atlantic-influenced fjords and lower recruitment at greater depth. Most of the recruits in Svalbard fjords were fast-growing, poor-competitive opportunists. On shipwrecks, communities showed two mechanisms of colonization: mobile fauna with long-dispersing planktotrophic larvae, and encrusting fauna with lecithotrophic larvae. Encrusting species reproduce asexually to cover the wreck surface, and philopatry may build up dense populations, leading to uneven communities. On terrestrial islands, non-random co-occurrence is attributed to interspecific competition, but for marine <b>substrata,</b> {{there may not be}} a relationship. Fauna were distributed randomly on settlement plates in Svalbard fjords, even when interspecific competition was observed. On dropstones, some morphotypes co-occurred non-randomly in the absence of overgrowth competition. Non-random co-occurrence on isolated marine hard <b>substrata</b> may be a result of restricted larval dispersal (for pairs co-occurring less than by chance) or epibiontism (for pairs co-occurring more often than by chance). While species distribution patterns on island-like marine hard <b>substrata</b> resemble terrestrial islands, the mechanisms are not necessarily the same...|$|R
