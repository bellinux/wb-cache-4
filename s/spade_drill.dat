5000|$|A {{hole saw}} (also styled holesaw), {{also known as}} a hole cutter, is a saw blade of [...] (ring) shape, whose annular [...] creates a hole in the {{workpiece}} without having to cut up the core material. It is used in a drill. Hole saws typically have a pilot drill bit at their center to keep the saw teeth from walking. The fact that a hole saw creates the hole without needing to cut up the core often makes it preferable to twist <b>drills</b> or <b>spade</b> <b>drills</b> for relatively large holes (especially those larger than 25 mm). The same hole can be made faster and using less power.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{continued}} its investigation of chemical additive drilling fluids that produce a zero surface charge (ZSC) {{on a rock}} to better define the boundary conditions of the phenomenon. Laboratory drilling tests were performed on Minnesota taconite, Tennessee marble, and Sioux Quartzite using diamond-impregnated coring bits or tungsten carbide <b>spade</b> bits. <b>Drilling</b> fluids were made from chemical additives such as inorganic salts, cationic surfactants, cationic polymers, acids, or nonionic polymers in either distilled, deionized water (DDIW), mine pond water, mine well water, or tap water. These additives were tested below, at, and above their respective ZSC concentrations. Penetration and bit life improvements obtained with ZSC concentration solutions ranged from 88 and 56 pct, respectively, to over 650 pct and over 400 pct, respectively, for the additives tested. Polyethylene oxide (PEO) {{was found to be}} the best additive for ZSC-controlled drilling because a continuous range of PEO solution concentrations produced the enhanced ZSC-controlled drilling performance...|$|R
2500|$|Spade bits {{are used}} for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause {{splintering}} when they emerge from the workpiece. [...] Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from {{the opposite side of}} the work. [...] Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill chucks. Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand <b>drills.</b> <b>Spade</b> bits are also sometimes referred to as [...] "paddle bits".|$|R
50|$|In {{deciding}} which drill(s) {{to use it}} is important to consider the task at hand and evaluate which drill would best accomplish the task. There are a variety of drill styles that each serve a different purpose. The subland drill is capable of drilling more than one diameter. The <b>spade</b> <b>drill</b> is used to drill larger hole sizes. The indexable drill is useful in managing chips.|$|E
50|$|A <b>spade</b> <b>drill</b> bit for metal is a two part {{bit with}} a tool holder and an {{insertable}} tip, called an insert. The inserts come in various sizes {{that range from}} 7/16 to 2.5 in. The tool holder usually has a coolant passage running through it. They are capable of cutting {{to a depth of}} about 10 times the bit diameter. This type of drill bit {{can also be used to}} make stepped holes.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} over conventional drill bits is the hole saw's efficiency, because {{very little of}} the total material being removed is actually cut, which ultimately reduces the overall power requirement. Another {{advantage over}} drill bits is the wider size capability. For example, a 100 mm hole would require a huge twist drill or <b>spade</b> <b>drill,</b> unable to be properly driven by a pistol-grip drill or benchtop drill press; but it can be cut with a hole saw with relative ease.|$|E
