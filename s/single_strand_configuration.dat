50|$|During mitosis, tiny {{fragments}} of “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> DNA naturally occur inside the cell. Enzymes find {{and destroy the}} “scrap” DNA. The TREX1 gene provides the information necessary to create the enzyme that destroys this <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> “scrap” DNA. A mutation in the TREX1 gene causes the enzyme that would destroy the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> DNA {{to be less than}} completely effective. The less than completely effective nature of the enzyme allows “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> DNA to build up in the cell. The buildup of “scrap” <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> DNA alerts the immune system that the cell is abnormal.|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} in {{integrating}} the T-DNA into a host genome is {{the formation of a}} nick at the right border of the Ti plasmid. This nick creates a region of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA from the left border of the T-DNA gene over to the right border which was cut. <b>Single</b> <b>stranded</b> binding proteins then attach to the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA. DNA synthesis will displace the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> region and then a second nick at the left border region will release the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> T-DNA fragment. This fragment can then be incorporated into a host genome.|$|R
50|$|This method generates {{libraries}} {{of hybrid}} genes by template switching of uni-directionally growing polynucleotides {{in the presence}} of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA fragments as templates for chimeras. This method begins with the preparation of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA fragments by reverse transcription from target mRNA. Gene specific primers are then annealed to the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA. These genes are then extended during a PCR cycle. This cycle is followed by template switching and annealing of the short fragments obtained from the earlier primer extension to other <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA fragments. This process is repeated until full length <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA is obtained.|$|R

40|$|Sequence {{specific}} regulators of eukaryotic gene expression, axiomatically, act through double stranded DNA targets. Proteins that recognize DNA cis-elements as <b>single</b> <b>strands</b> but {{for which}} compelling {{evidence has been}} lacking to indicate in vivo involvement in transcription are orphaned in this scheme. We sought to determine whether sequence specific <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> binding proteins can find their cognate elements and modify transcription in vivo by studying heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), which binds the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> sequence (CCCTCCCCA; CT-element) of the human c-myc gene in vitro. To monitor its DNA binding in vivo, the ability of hnRNP K to activate a reporter gene was amplified by fusion with the VP 16 transactivation domain. This chimeric protein was found to transactivate circular but not linear CT-element driven reporters, suggesting that hnRNP K recognizes a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> region generated by negative supercoiling in circular plasmid. When CT-elements were engineered to overlap with lexA operators, addition of lexA protein, either in vivo or in vitro, abrogated hnRNP K binding most likely by preventing <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> formation. These results not only reveal hnRNP K to be a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> DNA binding protein in vivo, but demonstrate how a segment of DNA may modify the transcriptional activity of an adjacent gene through the interconversion of duplex and <b>single</b> <b>strands...</b>|$|R

Measurements reported in paper I of this series indicate an inhibition {{in the rate of}} reassociation of <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> tails on partially reassociated molecules by a factor of at least two. Equations are derived that describe the observed form of reassociation kinetics as measured with hydroxyapatite and with <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> specific nuclease.

50|$|The {{combination}} of a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> and its binding proteins serves as a better substrate for replicative polymerases than a naked <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> (binding proteins provide extra thermodynamic driving force for the polymerisation reaction).

Nucleosomes assemble on the sssDNA, if the three components are incubated as a highly concentrated solution {{in the presence of}} the four deoxyribonucleotidetriphosphates and of ATP.

40|$|A {{system based}} on {{electrical}} impedance measurements using chemically modified Silicon/Silicon dioxide electrodes with covalently bound <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> homo-oligonucleotides was developed for DNA detection. Silanating agents (3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 3 -glycodoxyethylpropylamine) were used to modify the electrodes and immobilize <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA. A method based on the electrochemical modification of Si substrates with bromobenzene diazonium was also used to immobilized <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA. The DNA detection system is able to recognize any electrical changes occurring at the electrode through in-phase and out-of-phase impedance measurements. Hybridization of the complementary strands causes {{a shift in the}} flat band potential due to variations in charge accumulating at the modified oxide/electrolyte interface. With these measurements, we were able to make reliable comparisons between the electrical measurements and the quantification of immobilized and hybridized <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA through radiolabeling...|$|R

To identify proteins binding to the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> DNA element as potential regulators for Oprm 1, affinity column chromatography with the <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> DNA element was performed using neuroblastoma NS 20 Y cells followed by two-dimensional gel electrophore-sis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.

40|$|Many {{applications}} in textile require color measurement of <b>single</b> <b>strands</b> of yarns due to unavailability {{of a mass}} of consecutive yarns. While multispectral imaging systems can capture images of <b>single</b> <b>strands</b> of yarns, an unavoidable problem accompanied is how to specify their colors from images, in which pixel values vary with positions owing to three-dimensional shape of yarn. Based on the response of multispectral imaging systems to <b>single</b> <b>strands</b> of yarns, this article formulates the color specification problem as an optimization question and four methods are proposed: average of all pixels (AA), average of pixels in central area (AC), maxima of all pixels (MA), and lightness weighting method (LW). The first experiment analyzed color distribution of pixels on a <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> of yarn. Experimental results show pixels in central area have smallest color variation and largest intensity. The second experiment compared the proposed methods. Results show that CIEXYZ, L*, and C* values specified by the AA and MA methods are lowest and highest. Finally, colors of <b>single</b> <b>strands</b> of yarns specified by the proposed methods were compared with spectrophotometric colors of yarn windings using 12 pairs of <b>single</b> <b>strands</b> of yarns and yarn windings. Experimental results show the MA method yields the smallest lightness and chroma difference compared with spectrophotometric colors of yarn windings. The average color difference between spectrophotometric colors of yarn windings and multispectral imaging colors of <b>single</b> <b>strands</b> of yarns specified by the AA, AC, MA, and LW methods is 3. 45, 2. 72, 2. 37, and 3. 33 CMC(2 : 1) units.

40|$|Jovin and {{co-workers}} {{have demonstrated that}} DNA strands containing guanine-adenine repeats generate a parallel-stranded homoduplex. Here we propose that the homoduplex is a dimer of the ordered <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> discovered by Fresco {{and co-workers}} at acid pH. The Fresco <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> is shown here to be stabilized in aqueous ethanol where adenine is not protonated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strands dimerize at higher salt concentrations without significantly changing their conformation, so that the dimerization is non-cooperative. Hence, the Jovin homoduplex can form through a non-cooperative dimerization of two cooperatively melting <b>single</b> <b>strands.</b> The available data indicate that the guanines stabilize the Fresco <b>single</b> <b>strand</b> whereas the adenines cause dimerization owing to their known intercalation or clustering tendency.

The monomeric {{protein is}} elongated {{in shape and}} has a molecular mass of 110 kDa. Since immunocytochemistry revealed that the protein is predominantly located in the nucleolus we {{refer to it as}} the 110 kDa nucleolar protein. The protein binds not only to <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA but also to <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> RNA, including homopolymeric synthetic RNA. We have used the <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA binding properties of the 110 kDa protein in model studies to investigate its effects on the configuration of nucleic acid. Our results are: only 50 - 55 protein molecules are sufficient to saturate all binding sites on the 6408 nucleotides of phage fd DNA; protein binding cause a compaction of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> DNA; large nucleoprotein aggregates are formed in the presence of divalent cations; this is due to protein-protein interactions which occur at moderately high concentrations of magnesium-, calcium or manganese ions; the protein induces the reassociation of complementary nucleic acid sequences.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of berberine with <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) structure was investigated {{using a combination}} of spectrophotometric, spectrofluorimetric, circular dichroic, viscometric, and thermodynamic studies. The interaction process was characterized by typical hypochromic and bathochromic effects in the absorption spectrum of berberine, enhancement of fluorescence intensity of berberine, increase of viscosity, and perturbation of circular dichroic spectrum of <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA). Scatchard plot obtained from spectrophotometric analysis showed that berberine bound strongly to <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) in a non-cooperative manner. In contrast, berberine does not show any significant effect (i) in its absorbance and fluorescence spectra on binding to double stranded poly(rA), (ii) alter the circular dichroic spectrum of double stranded poly(rA), or (iii) increase of viscosity of double stranded poly(rA) indicating that it does not bind at all to double stranded poly(rA) structure. Thermodynamic parameters indicated that the binding of the alkaloid to <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) is an endothermic process and entropy driven. All these findings, taken together clearly support that berberine binds strongly to <b>single</b> <b>stranded</b> poly(rA) structure by a mechanism of partial intercalation leading to its use in gene regulation in eukaryotic cells...|$|R
