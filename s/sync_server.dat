It is also possible for the user to host their own Firefox <b>Sync</b> <b>servers,</b> or indeed, for any entity to do so.|$|R

5000|$|... 1Password {{can be set}} up to only store {{password}} files locally, and not <b>sync</b> with remote <b>servers.</b> It {{can also}} be set up so that files are synchronized through Dropbox (all platforms), local Wi-Fi, and iCloud, and more recently, through 1Password.com, a subscription based <b>server</b> <b>sync</b> service maintained by the developers. Local Wi-Fi and iCloud sync are only available on the Mac and iOS.|$|R
50|$|Each client's data is {{synchronised}} {{against a}} distributed clock. This clocking is {{then used to}} distribute the data out {{to all the other}} clients so that they can play all the remote streams in <b>sync.</b> The <b>server</b> does little apart from manage connections, chat and data streaming.|$|R
50|$|Bots are {{not always}} welcome. Some IRC {{networks}} forbid the usage of bots. One {{of the reasons for}} doing so is that each nickname connected to the network increases the size of the network database which is being kept in <b>sync</b> across all <b>servers.</b> Allowing for bots in large networks can cause a relevant amount of network traffic overhead which needs to be financed and may even lead to netsplits.|$|R
40|$|NOTE: These {{patterns}} {{will appear}} in a heavily reworked and updated version in the Remoting Pattern book [VKZ 04], {{to be published by}} Wiley in 2004. The patterns in this paper introduce the four most commonly used techniques for providing client-side asynchrony in dis-tributed object frameworks. FIRE AND FORGET describes best-effort delivery semantics for asynchronous operations that have void return types. <b>SYNC</b> WITH <b>SERVER</b> notifies the client only in case the delivery of the invocation to the server application fails. POLL OBJECTS provide clients with means to query the distributed object framework whether an asyn-chronous response for the request has arrived yet, and if so, to obtain the return value. RESULT CALLBACK actively notifies the requesting client of the returning result. Markus Voelter voelter, Ingenieurbüro für Softwaretechnologie...|$|R
50|$|ItsNat simulates {{a virtual}} browser within a Java {{application}} {{running on the}} server. This virtual browser represents documents using the W3C's DOM Level 2 node tree, and documents can be changed at any time by external Java code running on the server. By means of AJAX, the real user's browser is kept in <b>sync</b> with the <b>server's</b> virtual browser, and can pass W3C DOM events to it. This can for example be used for automatic testing of the real browser {{under the control of}} the server.|$|R
40|$|OO-RPC {{middleware}} typically provides synchronous remote method invocations from {{clients to}} server objects. In some scenarios, asynchronous behaviour is necessary, though. This collection of patterns introduces the four {{most commonly used}} techniques in this context. FIRE AND FORGET describes best-effort delivery semantics for asynchronous operations that have void return types. <b>SYNC</b> WITH <b>SERVER</b> looks the same from the client’s point of view, however {{it is able to}} notify the client (by throwing an exception) in case the delivery of the invocation to the SERVER APPLICATION fails. POLL OBJECTS provide clients with means to query the distributed object framework whether an asynchronous reply for the request has arrived yet, and if so, to obtain the return value. Last but not least, RESULT CALLBACK will actively notify the requesting client of the returning result. Note that these patterns are part of a larger pattern language on remoting middleware. This is why some of the PATTERN REFERENCES point to patterns not found in this paper. Result to clien...|$|R

50|$|Microsoft Search Server {{has been}} made {{available}} as Search Server 2008, which was released {{in the first half}} of 2008. In 2010, Search Server 2010 http://www.microsoft.com/enterprisesearch/searchserverexpress/en/us/technical-resources.aspx became available, including a free version, named Search Server 2010 Express. The express edition will feature the same feature-set as the commercial edition, including no limitation on the number of files indexed; however, it is limited to a stand-alone installation and cannot be scaled out to a cluster. A release candidate of Search Server Express 2008 was made available on November 7, 2007; it is scheduled to Release to Manufacturing (RTM) in <b>sync</b> with Search <b>Server</b> 2008.|$|R
5000|$|J-PAKE {{has been}} {{implemented}} in OpenSSL and OpenSSH as an experimental authentication protocol. It {{was removed from}} the OpenSSH source code at the end of January 2014. It has also been implemented in NSS and was used by Firefox Sync version 1.1 but discontinued in 1.5 which uses a different key exchange and storage method. Mozilla's J-PAKE server was shut down along with the <b>Sync</b> 1.1 storage <b>servers</b> on 30 September 2015. Pale Moon continues to use J-PAKE as part of its Sync service. Since February 2013, J-PAKE has been added to the lightweight API in Bouncycastle (1.48 and onwards). J-PAKE is also used in the Thread (network protocol) ...|$|R
25|$|Nier: Automata {{opens with}} 2B and 9S opening {{the way for}} a future {{incursion}} into machine territory, working to clear out machine threats for the local Resistance. With help from Anemone and later Pascal, 2B and 9S defeat multiple machine threats. During their missions, they witness the birth of and later fight Adam and Eve, physical manifestations of the machine network who reveal that their creators were destroyed centuries ago. 2B and 9S also encounter A2, who is on the run from YoRHa. It is revealed that the machines are beginning to feel emotions and gather in groups, and some like Pascal's group have grown tired of fighting. 9S is eventually captured by Adam, who is killed by 2B. Deprived of his brother, Eve goes mad with grief and drives the machines under his command into a frenzy. 2B and 9S kill Eve, but 9S is infected with the machine's logic virus, forcing 2B to kill him. Despite his body dying, 9S's personality is saved in the local machine network, allowing his transfer into a new body. The second playthrough follows the opening narrative from the perspective of 9S, offering new insight into the machines and Adam and Eve. 9S also learns that humanity has been extinct since the events of Nier aside from a server on the moon holding humanity's DNA and history. YoRHa and its mission were created to keep the androids from losing morale. He also encounters a glitch when performing a standard <b>server</b> <b>sync,</b> and halts the procedure for both himself and 2B.|$|R
