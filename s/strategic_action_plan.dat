25|$|Renewable {{energy in}} Tuvalu {{is a growing}} sector of the country's energy supply. Tuvalu has {{committed}} to becoming the first country to get 100% of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020. This is considered possible {{because of the small}} size of the population of Tuvalu and its abundant solar energy resources due to its tropical location. It is somewhat complicated because Tuvalu consists of nine inhabited islands. The Tuvalu National Energy Policy (TNEP) was formulated in 2009, and the Energy <b>Strategic</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Plan</b> defines and directs current and future energy developments so that Tuvalu can achieve the ambitious target of 100% renewable energy for power generation by 2020. The program is expected to cost 20 million US dollars and is supported by the e8, a group of 10 electric companies from G8 countries. The Government of Tuvalu worked with the e8 group to develop the Tuvalu Solar Power Project, which is a 40kW grid-connected solar system that is intended to provide about 5% of Funafuti’s peak demand, and 3% of the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation's annual household consumption.|$|E
