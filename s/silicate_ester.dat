40|$|In {{the last}} few years NASA has set new {{priorities}} for research and development of technologies necessary to enable long-term presence on the Moon and Mars. Among these key technologies is what is known as in situ resource utilization, which defines all conceivable usage of mineral, liquid, gaseous, or biological resources on a visited planet. In response to this challenge, we have been focusing on developing and demonstrating the manufacturing of a specific product using Lunar and Martian soil simulants (i. e., a mold for the casting of metal and alloy parts) which will be an indispensable tool for the survival of outposts on the Moon and Mars. In addition, our purpose is to demonstrate the feasibility of using mesoporous materials such as aerogels to serve as efficient casting molds for high quality components in propulsion and other aerospace applications. The first part of the project consists of producing aerogels from the in situ resources available in Martian and Lunar soil. The approach we are investigating is to use chemical processes to solubilize silicates using organic reagents at low temperatures and then use these as precursors in the formation of aerogels for the fabrication of metal casting molds. One set of experiments consists of dissolving silica sources in basic ethylene glycol solution to form silicon glycolates. When ground silica aerogel was used as source material, a clear solution of silicon glycolate was obtained and reacted to form a gel thus proving the feasibility of this approach. The application of this process to Lunar and Martian simulants did not result in the formation of a gel; further study is in progress. In the second method acidified alcohol is reacted with the simulants to form <b>silicate</b> <b>esters.</b> Preliminary results indicate the presence of silicon alkoxide in the product distillation. However, no gel has been obtained so further characterization is ongoing. In {{the second part of the}} project, the focus has been on developing a series of aerogel plates suitable for thin plate metal casting and ingot metal castings. The influence of aerogels on thin wall metal castings was studied by placing aerogel plates into the cavities of thin sections of resin bonded sand molds. An 1 based commercial alloy (356) containing 7 percent Si was poured into these molds. Post-solidification studies provide evidence that aerogel inserts significantly reduce the cooling rate during solidification. The advantage of a lower rate using aerogel inserts was reflected in the reduction of casting defects such as shrinkage porosity. Quantitative results support the hypothesis that using aerogels as a mold material can offer definite advantages when used as casting thin sections. As a separate effort, silica aerogel with cylindrical cavities have been prepared and will be evaluated for casting commercial alloys...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on the {{magnetization}} technological parameters optimized {{of sodium}} silicate, {{the properties of}} modified sodium <b>silicate</b> sand with <b>ester</b> hardening have been systematically investigated. The {{results indicated that the}} bonded strength of sodium silicate treated in the magnetic field may be increased by 30 %~ 40 %, the minimum addition content of sodium silicate in mold sand may reduce to 2. 5 %, and thus it improves markedly the collapsibility of the sodium silicate bonded sand. The used time of modified sodium silicate sand increases to 25 %, but the effect of magnetization of sodium silicate will be disappeared after 24 hours, and the magnetization decaying speed enhanced with increasing the modulus of sodium silicate. The magnetization modification has a good effect on the high modulus sodium silicate than the low modulus sodium silicate...|$|R

The research {{presented in this}} thesis comprises two main projects: model studies for the synthesis, characterization and hydrolysis of <b>silicate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrugs, including a fluorescent model (Part 1), and amide bond formation kinetics to analyze the selective uptake of amines into polymer nanoparticles (Part 2).

Advisor: Thomas Hoye. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxix, 372 pages. <b>Silicate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrugs are a novel family of labile prodrugs by which both physical (i. e., solubility) and chemical (i. e., rates of hydrolysis {{back to the}} parent drug) characteristics may be easily tuned. Block co-polymers of well-defined composition, namely poly(ethylene glycol) -b-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG-b- PLGA), were synthesized {{to serve as the}} drug carrier. These innovative drugs and FDA approved polymers have been effectively coupled with a formulation technique known as flash nanoprecipitation (FNP). FNP of a selected <b>silicate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrug of paclitaxel and PEG-b-PLGA yields nanoparticles of ca. 120 nm diameter and consisting of ca. 50 wt% of the paclitaxel silicate prodrug. An MDA- MB- 231 (breast cancer) cell culture assay was used to demonstrate in vitro efficacy of both taxane silicate prodrugs themselves as well as the loaded nanoparticles from FNP. Upon administration to tumor-bearing mice the silicate prodrugs hydrolyze in the tumor microenvironment, thereby releasing the cytotoxic parent drug. Tumor size was monitored via bioluminescence, and the silicate prodrug-containing nanoparticles showed statistically equivalent efficacy (and minimal associated side effects) when compared to equivalent dosings of the commercially used Taxol® and Abraxane®. The silicate chemistry is not specific to the taxane family of drugs. In the second part of thesis I will present recent findings on this front. The scope of the functional groups selected was based upon the availability of the drugs and the novelty of the subsequent silicate functionalization. The general background of each drug and utility will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We report {{here the}} {{synthesis}} and selected properties of various <b>silicate</b> <b>ester</b> derivatives (tetraalkoxysilanes) of the taxanes paclitaxel (PTX) and docetaxel (DTX) [i. e., PTX-OSi(OR) 3 and DTX-OSi(OR) 3]. Both the hydrophobicity and hydrolytic lability of these silicates can be (independently) controlled by {{choice of the}} alkyl group (R). The synthesis, structural characterization, hydro-lytic reactivity, and in vitro cytotoxicity against the MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cell line of most of these derivatives are described. We envision that the greater hydrophobicity of these silicates (vis-a-̀vis PTX or DTX itself) should be advantageous {{from the perspective of}} preparation of stable aqueous dispersions of amphiphilic block-copolymer-based nanoparticle formulations.

50|$|Photoionization Detectors (PIDs) use a high-photon-energy UV lamp {{to ionize}} {{chemicals}} in the sampled gas. If the compound has an ionization energy below that of the lamp photons, an electron will be ejected, and the resulting current {{is proportional to the}} concentration of the compound. Common lamp photon energies include 10.0 eV, 10.6 eV and 11.7 eV; the standard 10.6 eV lamp lasts for years, while the 11.7 eV lamp typically last only a few months and is used only when no other option is available. A broad range of compounds can be detected at levels ranging from a few ppb to several thousand ppm. Detectable compound classes in order of decreasing sensitivity include: aromatics and alkyl iodides; olefins, sulfur compounds, amines, ketones, ethers, alkyl bromides and <b>silicate</b> esters; organic <b>esters,</b> alcohols, aldehydes and alkanes; H2S, NH3, PH3 and organic acids. There is no response to standard components of air or to mineral acids. Major advantages of PIDs are their excellent sensitivity and simplicity of use; the main limitation is that measurements are not compound-specific. Recently PIDs with pre-filter tubes have been introduced that enhance the specificity for such compounds as benzene or butadiene. Fixed, hand-held and miniature clothing-clipped PIDs are widely used for industrial hygiene, hazmat, and environmental monitoring.|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2014. Major: Material Science and Engineering. Advisor: Christopher W. Macosko. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxiii, 211 pages, appendices A-E. Cancer {{is one of}} the most challenge diseases to treat around the world. Drug delivery system, as one of the chemotherapeutic treatments has received enorrmous attention from researchers. This thesis is to develop amphiphilic diblock copolymer protected nanoparticles loaded with anti-cancer drug, with small size and high drug loading, to achieve selective drug delivery using EPR effect. Chapter 1 briefly describes the motivation and novelties of this research pursuit. Chapter 2 introduces a modified confined impingement jets mixer with dilution (CIJ-D mixer), using flash nanoprecipitation to produce nanoparticles made of hydrophobic drugs. The CIJ-D mixer was evaluated by the sizes of &# 946;-carotene nanoparticles at varied flow conditions compared to these made by multi-inlet vortex mixer. The CIJ-D mixer provides higher efficiency and easiness of handling for nanoparticle preparation. That is why CIJ-D mixer was used for all the work presented in the following chapters. In Chapter 3, we made the first attempt to produce PEG-b-PLGA protected paclitaxel loaded nanoparticles but failed, because paclitaxel is too hydrophilic to be captured in particles. Thus, a series of <b>silicate</b> <b>ester</b> derivatized paclitaxel were synthesized by Hoye research group and successfully encapsulated into nanoparticles. Several nanoparticle post-treatments, such as filtration, hollow fiber diafiltration, and ultracentrifugation were used and assessed, in order to purify nanoparticles. Lyophilization was found to induce nanoparticle aggregation due to the freezing process. The addition of sucrose as cryoprotectant was studied to prevent aggregation and recover nanoparticle. Chapter 4 focuses on developing in vitro drug release protocols, for more accurate quantification of highly hydrophobic paclitaxel prodrugs. Different dialysis devices were used such as dialysis tubes, dialysis cassettes, and dialysis mini capsules. Infinite sink and limited sink conditions were compared as well to provide sufficient concentration gradient across dialysis semi-permeable membrane. At last, a reverse drug release experimental protocol was customized to determine the remaining drug left in dialysis mini capsules while the sink condition was maintained by frequently refreshing buffer solution during in vitro drug release study. Chapter 5 mainly presents the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel prodrug nanoparticles loaded with different <b>silicate</b> <b>ester</b> derivatives, at different pH, both inside nanoparticles and in buffer solution. Chapter 6 includes a series of Cryo-TEM images of nanoparticles collected at different time, such as fresh nanoparticles immediately after being prepared by CIJ-D mixer, nanoparticles after ultracentrifugation, after lyophilization, 0 hr, and 24 hr during drug release study. These images not only showed a reverse liner relation of average particle size and hydrophobicity of the loaded drug, but also displayed a core-shell internal structure of nanoparticles prepared via flash nanoprecipitation and potential particle disassembly after 24 hr drug release. Finally, Chapter 7 summarizes the key results and conclusions obtained from previous chapters, lessons learned from mistakes and failures, and future directions for this project, in order to prepare nanoparticles with better controlled size and drug release kinetics and to understand deeply on nanoparticle formation and release mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|High {{operating}} temperatures {{of new and}} projetted turbine engines require that syuthetic fluids be used as lubricants, because these fluids have better thermal stability and viscosity-temperaturecharacteristics than petroleum oils have. An experimental {{study was conducted to}} learn the effect of high lubricant bulk temperatures on the boundary lubrica-ting effectiveness of various types of synthetic fluid. In general, under the conditions of the experiments described herein, the upper limit of temperature for effective lubrication was greater for synthetic lubricants (other than the sfiicone types studied) than for a petroleum lubricant of similar viscosityat 100 ° F. The experimental. results tend to substantiate the hypothesis that lubrication with esters (and possibly other fluids) results from formation of a chem-isorbed metal soap filmby free acids in the lubricant. Since oxide films are important to both soap formation and to lubrication} the lubrication-failure mechanisms may be (1) failure of the soap film (by melting or decomposition), or (2) failure of the lubricant to maintain the metal soa~ or oxide films, or both, on the surface. It appears that bulk-fluid failure temperature is limited by either of these lubrication-failure mechanisms through the effect of temperature on khermsl stability of the bulk fluid. Thermal stability can be associated with viscosity grade within a given Ckssj however} no correlation could be made between tem-perature at which lubrication failure occurred and the viscosity at the failure temperature for the various fluids. At temperatures up to its decomposition point, a <b>silicate</b> <b>ester</b> showed more promise than the other lubricants studied.

Fine {{control of the}} {{physical and chemical properties}} of customized materials is a field that is rapidly advancing. This is especially critical in pursuits to develop and optimize novel nanoparticle drug delivery. Specifically, I aim to apply chemistry concepts to test the hypothesis "Silicate ester prodrugs of paclitaxel, customized to have the proper hydrophobicity and hydrolytic lability, can be formulated with well-defined, biocompatible, amphiphilic block copolymers into nanoparticles that are effective drugs. " Chapter 1 briefly describes the context and motivation of the scientific pursuits described in this thesis. In Chapter 2, a family of model silicate esters is synthesized, the hydrolysis rate of each compound is benchmarked, and trends are established based upon the steric bulk and leaving group ability of the silicate substituents. These trends are then applied to the synthesis of labile <b>silicate</b> <b>ester</b> prodrugs in Chapter 3. The bulk of this chapter focuses on the synthesis, hydrolysis, and cytotoxicity of prodrugs based on paclitaxel, a widely used chemotherapeutic agent. In Chapter 4, a new methodology for the synthesis of narrowly dispersed, "random" poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymers by a constant infusion of the glycolide monomer is detailed. Using poly(ethylene glycol) as a macroinitiator, amphiphilic block copolymers were synthesized. Co-formulating a paclitaxel silicate and an amphiphilic block copolymer via flash nanoprecipitation led to highly prodrug-loaded, kinetically trapped nanoparticles. Studies to determine the structure, morphology, behavior, and efficacy of these nanoparticles are described in Chapter 5. Efforts to develop a general strategy for the selective end-functionalization of the polyether block of these amphiphilic block copolymers are discussed in Chapter 6. Examples of this strategy include functionalization of the polyether with an azide or a maleimide. Finally, Chapter 7 provides an outlook for future development of the strategies described in this thesis and summarizes the results and conclusions of the experimental results that {{led to the development of}} the therapeutic, paclitaxel silicate-loaded, polymeric nanoparticles...|$|E
