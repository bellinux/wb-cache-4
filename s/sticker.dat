The synthesis resulting products were used to make <b>stickers</b> and they were compared to corn and cassava starch based <b>stickers</b> without any modification, as well as commercial <b>stickers</b> based on polyvinyl acetate (PVA). Two different methodologies were tested using acid hydrolysis to modify corn and cassava starch, both using phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4) {{in order to obtain}} dextrin and subsequently use it in the production of <b>stickers</b> and also comparing them to petrochemical-based commercial <b>stickers.</b> Considering the different starch modifications methods (oxidation and acid hydrolysis), <b>stickers</b> based on renewable raw material were obtained, which combine biodegradability, low costs and availability...|$|R

5|$|On November 30, 2011, Gumby Comics/Wildcard Ink {{published}} a single volume collecting Adams' previous two specials featuring Gumby.

According to Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool, this was done on Adams' request, who {{wanted nothing to do}} with the publisher, and took action to keep his name off the book's cover. The book is nonetheless sold by merchants such as Mile High Comics under its originally intended name.|$|E

50|$|Supervisors {{often are}} not {{familiar}} with all workers on a construction site. Often, <b>stickers,</b> labels and markers are used to mark hard hats so that important information can be shared. Paint or permanent markers can degrade the plastic in hard hats; instead, labels or masking tape are often applied to a hard hat with the worker's name written on it. <b>Stickers</b> with company logos are very common. <b>Stickers</b> that indicate a worker's training or qualifications are also very common; many companies provide ready-made <b>stickers</b> to indicate that a worker has been trained in electrical safety, confined space safety, excavation trench safety, or operation of specialized equipment. Environmental monitors often make <b>stickers</b> to indicate that the worker has been educated on the risk of unexploded ordnance or the archaeological/biological sensitivity of a given area. <b>Stickers</b> may indicate who is authorized to be present on site. Unions may offer free <b>stickers</b> for hard hats and other objects.|$|R
