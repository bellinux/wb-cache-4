500|$|Lajoie led the AL in {{batting average}} {{five times in}} his career and four times {{recorded}} {{the highest number of}} hits. During several of those years with the Naps he and Ty Cobb dominated AL hitting categories and traded batting titles with each other, most notably coming in 1910, when the league's batting champion was not decided until well after the last game of the season and after an investigation by American League President Ban Johnson. Lajoie in 1914 joined Cap Anson and Honus Wagner as the only major league players to record 3,000 career hits. He led the NL or AL in putouts five times in his career and assists three times. He has been called [...] "the best second baseman in the history of baseball" [...] and [...] "the most outstanding player to wear a Cleveland uniform." [...] Cy Young said, [...] "Lajoie {{was one of the most}} rugged players I ever faced. He'd take your leg off with a line drive, turn the third baseman around like a <b>swinging</b> <b>door</b> and powder the hand of the left fielder." [...] He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1937.|$|E

There are simple devices available to attach to the hinge side, ensuring {{that this type of}} injury does not occur. As the door closes, the hand is pushed out of the opening, away from harm. In addition, young children are vulnerable to injury when they fall against the other (hinged) side of doors and gates, striking projected hinges. Piano hinges are not recommended to alleviate this problem as they tend to sag over time with heavy use. Instead, an inexpensive device fitting over hinges is available on the market and should be used to ensure safety..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{learned to}} dance {{from his father}} and his [...] "uncle" [...] Will Mastin. Davis joined the act as a child and they became the Will Mastin Trio. Throughout his career, Davis {{included}} the Will Mastin Trio in his billing. Mastin and his father shielded him from racism, such as by explaining race-based snubs as jealousy. However, when Davis served in the United States Army during World War II, he was confronted by strong prejudice. He later said: [...] "Overnight the world looked different. It wasn't one color any more. I could see the protection I'd gotten all my life from my father and Will. I appreciated their loving hope that I'd never need to know about prejudice and hate, but they were wrong. It was as if I'd walked through a <b>swinging</b> <b>door</b> for 18 years, a door which they had always secretly held open." [...] At age 7 Davis played the title role in the film Rufus Jones for President, in which he sang and danced with Ethel Waters. He lived for several years in Boston's South End, and reminisced years later about [...] "hoofing and singing" [...] at Izzy Ort's Bar & Grille.|$|E

Clutching in his hand the suit case and a pint bottle of whisky, George started in pursuit. The conductor, his hand on the bell cord, waited to see if it would be necessary to stop. It was not.

6000|$|It {{was in one}} {{of these}} rushes that he had been crushed against a <b>swinging</b> <b>door,</b> which, giving way to his pressure, {{disclosed}} to his wondering eyes a long, glitteringly adorned, and brightly lit room, densely filled with a silent, attentive throng in attitudes of decorous abstraction and preoccupation, that even the shouts and tumult at its very doors could not disturb. Men of all ranks and conditions, plainly or elaborately clad, were grouped together under this magic spell of silence and attention. The tables before them were covered with cards and loose heaps of gold and silver. A clicking, the rattling of an ivory ball, and the frequent, formal, lazy reiteration of some unintelligible sentence was all that he heard. But by a sudden instinct he UNDERSTOOD it all. It was a gambling saloon! ...|$|E

60|$|On {{a certain}} night, {{about an hour}} before the dawn, Miriam woke Nehushta, telling her that she was {{stifling}} there in those vaults and must ascend the tower. Nehushta said that it was folly, whereon Miriam answered that she would go alone. This she would not suffer her to do, so together they passed up the stairs according to custom, and, having gained the base of the tower through the <b>swinging</b> <b>door</b> of stone, climbed the steps that ran in the thickness of the wall till they reached the topmost gallery. Here they sat, fanned by the faint night wind, and watched the fires of the Romans stretched far and wide around the walls and even among the ruins of the houses almost beneath them, since that part of the city was taken.|$|E

Such a night as this.|$|E
6000|$|SCENE--"Johnny-The-Priest's" [...] saloon near South Street, New York City. The {{stage is}} divided into two sections, showing a small back room on the right. On the left, forward, of the barroom, a large window looking out on the street. Beyond it, the main entrance--a double <b>swinging</b> <b>door.</b> Farther back, another window. The bar runs from left to right nearly the whole length of the rear wall. In back of the bar, a small {{showcase}} displaying a few bottles of case goods, for which there is evidently little call. The remainder of the rear space in front of the large mirrors is occupied by half-barrels of cheap whiskey of the [...] "nickel-a-shot" [...] variety, from which the liquor is drawn by means of spigots. On the right is an open doorway leading to the back room. In the back room are four round wooden tables with five chairs grouped about each. In the rear, a family entrance opening on a side street.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was nothing}} either meretricious or {{sinister}} in {{the aspect of}} that favored resort, the Cockpit, as the Decade Club was familiarly called by its friends--and enemies. Two young Merton men and the freshman from New, who were enjoying their Christmas vacation in town, and had been dining with Maitland, were a little disappointed in {{the appearance of the}} place. They had hoped to knock mysteriously at a back door in a lane, and to be shown, after investigating through a loopholed wicket, into a narrow staircase, which, again, should open on halls of light, full of blazing wax candles and magnificent lacqueys, while a small mysterious man would point out the secret hiding-room, and the passages leading on to the roof or into the next house, in case of a raid by the police. Such was the old idea of a [...] "Hell;" [...] but the advance of Thought has altered all these early notions. The Decade Club was like any other small club. A current of warm air, charged with tobacco-smoke, rushed forth into the frosty night when the <b>swinging</b> <b>door</b> was opened; a sleepy porter looked out of his little nest, and Cranley wrote the names of the companions he introduced in a book which was kept for that purpose.|$|E
60|$|And then of {{a sudden}} he stopped his {{chanting}} and drew closer to the window-pane. The door of the shed still stood ajar as it had been left, and the minutes were slipping by. They were long minutes, but they slipped by nevertheless. He watched the starlings running and flying in little parties across the lawn; he counted them over and over again, with one eye always on that <b>swinging</b> <b>door.</b> A sour-faced maid came in to lay the table for tea, and still Conradin stood and waited and watched. Hope had crept by inches into his heart, and now a look of triumph began to blaze in his eyes that had only known the wistful patience of defeat. Under his breath, with a furtive exultation, he began once again the paean of victory and devastation. And presently his eyes were rewarded: out through that doorway came a long, low, yellow-and-brown beast, with eyes a-blink at the waning daylight, and dark wet stains around the fur of jaws and throat. Conradin dropped on his knees. The great polecat-ferret made its way down to a small brook {{at the foot of the}} garden, drank for a moment, then crossed a little plank bridge and was lost to sight in the bushes. Such was the passing of Sredni Vashtar.|$|E
