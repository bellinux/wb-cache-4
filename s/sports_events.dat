40|$|M. Tech. Sport {{has become}} the {{broadest}} common cultural denominator in almost all societies (Lapchick, cited in Gouws, 1997). As a result, <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> have become an increasingly popular means for achieving political, cultural and economic benefits for the host nation (Parent, 2008). Consequently, {{this has led to}} an increased demand in the value of diverse skills in the <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management field. This is to cope with the increased complexities surrounding <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management and thus requires a distinct body of knowledge and skills to be developed (Quatman, 2008). However, concern over the lack of a relevant base of common knowledge (NASPE-NASSM, 1993) as well as pertinent training programmes to prepare sport managers for the contemporary <b>sport</b> <b>events</b> industry has resulted in current graduates not necessarily meeting the needs or expectations of the industry. As a result, {{there appears to be a}} gap between the current event management curricula outcomes at higher education institutions (HEIs) in South Africa and the expected competencies of <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> managers in practice. The aim is therefore to develop guidelines for <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management training in higher education institutions on various HEQF levels (DoL, 2008) to address the competencies required by managers for the South African context. This translates into objectives, namely: i) to identify, conceptualise and unpack <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management competencies required by <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> managers, ii) to investigate the curricula of <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management at higher education institutions in South Africa, iii) to investigate the importance of different competencies required by <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> managers in South Africa, iv) to investigate the current level of competencies of practitioners regarding <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management in South Africa, v) to provide a background on the current education system in South Africa and vi) provide guidelines for <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management training in higher education institutions at various HEQF levels (DoL, 2008) to address the competencies required by managers for the South African context. The research design is descriptive in nature, with quantitative methods in the form of questionnaires utilised to collect the data. The sample includes trainers¹ from HEIs in South Africa offering <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management, and subsequently <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> management, as well as practitioners² from HEIs in South Africa and <b>sport</b> <b>event</b> managers from selected sport companies in Gauteng...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{research}} {{regarding the}} relationship between consumer loyalty, satisfaction,and novelty seeking, including an analysis of these constructs {{as reflected in the}} published literature. A telephone survey was conducted of 500 city residents, focusing on their visitation of special <b>events,</b> including <b>sporting</b> <b>events.</b> It was found that satisfaction was somewhat positively related to interest in attending the same <b>sporting</b> <b>event,</b> and the intention to actually visit the <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> again. However, novelty seeking was virtually unrelated to both interest in attending the same <b>sporting</b> <b>event,</b> and the intention to actually visit the <b>sporting</b> <b>event,</b> and unrelated to satisfaction. Novelty seeking in general, or in relation to special events particularly,performed similarly as a predictor.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The global growth of sport and major <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> as tourism and mass entertainment in both single and multi sport formats has prompted the desire for {{a greater understanding of}} event attendees and the implications of their motivations and decisions to travel and attend major <b>sporting</b> <b>events.</b> However, research into major <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> has generally focused on the Olympic Games and/or attendance of a single major <b>sporting</b> <b>event.</b> Currently, the major <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> community sees the value of measuring the economic impact of major <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> but do not understand the decisions taken by individuals that travel to and attend major <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> {{due to the lack of}} research in the area. Thus, more robust and comprehensive research needs to be carried out to improve the understanding of individuals that travel to and attend a range of major <b>sporting</b> <b>events.</b> The purpose of this research was to develop a better understanding of the total spend and trip duration decisions of individuals that travel to and attend major <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> with commercial companies. The research used a positivist quantitative strategy to empirically assess research questions surrounding repeat major <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> attendance, motivations for major <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> attendance, variables affecting total spending and trip duration decisions and relationships the between motivations, trip duration and total spending, and to econometrically model findings. Independent variables for analysis were identified through a review of literature, which informed the construction of both a conceptual model and online survey focusing on demographics, event related motivations, major <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> profile and <b>sporting</b> involvement. Variable-based data collected from individual respondents on nine different major <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> then underwent a two stage descriptive and statistical analysis. The descriptive analysis consisted of a quantitative breakdown of survey results and the statistical analysis allowed the data to be econometrically modeled and assessed through regression analysis. The research provided significant findings towards understanding the decisions taken by individuals that travel to and attend major <b>sporting</b> <b>events</b> and in doing so led to a greater understanding of total spend and trip duration decisions. Findings indicated that the demographic variables and event related motivations determined total spend decisions whilst demographic variables, event related motivations and major <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> profile variables determined trip duration decisions. Directly implicated in these findings were relevant key variables for commercial companies to consider in the packaging and sale of major <b>event</b> <b>sport</b> travel to an existing and committed customer base.

In March 2009, the retailing property was sold from Scandinavian Property Development to KLP Eiendom. The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, four to eight concerts, three to four large <b>sports</b> <b>events</b> and two other large events and conventions per year. Because of larger seating capacity, an all-seating arrangement, higher attendance and VIP facilities, Stabæk is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud. The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays, with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds.

Several cruise ships expected to remain on the island departed early to avoid the hurricane. Local insurance companies on Bermuda experienced a great increase in business, as residents renewed lapsed policies or signed up for new policies for homes or businesses, though marine policies were stopped several days before the hurricane struck.
