40|$|Can a <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubic {{be defined}} by the {{determinant}} of a square matrix with entries in linear forms in three variables? If we can, we say that it admits a linear determinantal representation. In this paper, we investigate linear determinantal representations of <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubics over various fields, and prove that any <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubic over a large field (or an ample field) admits a linear determinantal representation. Since local fields are large, any <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubic over a local field always admits a linear determinantal representation. As an application, we prove that a positive proportion of <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubics over Q, ordered by height, admit linear determinantal representations. We also prove that, if the conjecture of Bhargava-Kane-Lenstra-Poonen-Rains {{on the distribution of}} Selmer groups is true, a positive proportion of <b>smooth</b> <b>plane</b> cubics over Q fail the local-global principle for the existence of linear determinantal representations.

5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G clamps or spring clamps. A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel spring clamps is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 <b>smoothing</b> <b>plane</b> is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|E
