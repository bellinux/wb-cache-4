2500|$|Milk with {{a higher}} {{concentration}} of solids than normal milk may be used; the higher solids content produces a firmer yogurt. Solids can be increased by adding dried milk. The yogurt-making process provides two significant barriers to pathogen growth, heat and acidity (low pH). Both are necessary to ensure a <b>safe</b> <b>product.</b> Acidity alone has been questioned by recent outbreaks of food poisoning by [...] that is acid-tolerant. E. coli O157:H7 is easily destroyed by pasteurization (heating); the initial heating of the milk kills pathogens as well as denaturing proteins. The microorganisms that turn milk into yogurt can tolerate higher temperatures than most pathogens, so that a suitable temperature not only encourages the formation of yogurt, but inhibits pathogenic microorganisms. Once the yogurt has formed it can, if desired, be strained to reduce the whey content and thicken it.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} various factors on the green purchase intention of customers in Australia. A conceptual model has been proposed and was subjected to empirical verification {{with the use of}} a survey of metropolitan and regional households in Victoria. The results indicate that corporate perception with respect of companies not placing higher priority on reducing pollution than increasing profitability was the significant predictor of customers’ negative overall perception toward environmentally <b>safe</b> <b>products.</b> The only positive contribution to customers’ perceptions was their past experience with the product. Other factors including the perception of environmentally <b>safe</b> <b>products,</b> product labels, and regulatory protection did not appear to influence customers’ perceptions. The results also suggest that customers are not tolerant of lower quality and higher prices of environmentally <b>safe</b> <b>products.</b> The present findings provide an understanding of the antecedents of green purchasing and highlight that green customers rely more on personal experience with the product rather than the information provided by the marketer. <br /...|$|R
