We {{focus on}} systems that {{naturally}} incorporate a degrading quality, such as electronic devices with degrading electric charge or broadcasting networks with decreasing power or {{quality of a}} transmitted signal. For such systems, we introduce an extension of linear temporal logic (Linear Temporal Logic with Degradation Constraints, or DLTL for short) that provides a user-friendly formalism for <b>specifying</b> <b>properties</b> involving quantitative <b>requirements</b> {{on the level of}} degradation. We investigate possibility of translating DLTL verification problem for systems with degradation into previously solved MITL verification problem for timed automata, and we show that through the translation, DLTL model checking problem can be solved with limited, yet arbitrary, precision. For a specific subclass of DLTL formulas, we present a full precision verification technique based on translation of DLTL formulas into a specification formalism called Büchi Automata with Degradation Constraints (BADCs) developed earlier...|$|R

Current Web services composition proposals, such as BPML, WSBPEL, WSCI, and OWL-S, provide solutions for describing the control and data flows in Web service composition. However, such proposals remain at the descriptive level, without providing any kind of mechanisms or tool support for analysis and verification. Therefore, {{there is a growing}} interest for the verification techniques which enable designers to test and repair design errors even before actual running of the service, or allow designers to detect erroneous properties and formally verify whether the service process design does have certain desired properties. In this paper, we propose to verify Web services composition using an event driven approach.

We show, that through the mentioned translation, the DLTL model checking problem can be solved with limited, yet arbitrary, precision. Further, we show that probability in Markov Decision Processes {{can be viewed as a}} degrading quality and DLTL as a probabilistic linear temporal logic with quantitative operators.

40|$|Metrological {{traceability}} {{of measurement}} results {{is a key}} requirement for the comparability of such data {{in time and space}} and with legal or product specifications. Similarly, traceability of the certified values of a certified reference material is a prerequisite for its usefulness. Consequently, the statement on metrological traceability of the certified value of the <b>specified</b> <b>property</b> is a <b>requirement</b> of the ISO Guide series on Reference Materials. The establishment of the traceability of a value assigned to a property of a reference material to a stated reference is pivotal to the use of this material. Metrological traceability is related to a combination of four attributes which are assigned to a clearly identified matrix: description of the property, description of the quantity/kind-of-quantity, a number with its corresponding uncertainty and the measurement unit. The first two items define the identity of the measurand, whereas the latter two describe value that is assigned to this measurand. Therefore, the concept of traceability rests on two anchor points, namely identity and quantity value. The identity of a measurand van be defined by its structure alone or by an operational/procedural definition, the quantity value of the measurand can refer to the SI, or to an artefact, if standards of arbitrary values have been used for the calibration of equipment (e. g. WHO standards; international units etc.). The presented approach splits traceability statements of certified reference materials into a description of the identity of the measurand an the quantity value and provided a solution to overcome the conflict whether a measurement result should be declared as traceable to the SI or traceable to a method.

40|$|Many {{next-generation}} e-science applications require {{fast and}} reliable transfer of {{large volumes of}} data, now frequently termed as "big data 2 ̆ 2, with guaranteed performance, which is typically enabled by the bandwidth reservation service in high-performance networks (HPNs). Users normally <b>specify</b> the <b>properties</b> and <b>requirements</b> of their data transfers in the bandwidth reservation requests (BRRs), and want to make bandwidth reservations on the HPNs {{to satisfy the requirements}} of their data transfers. The challenges of the bandwidth reservation arise from the requirements desired by both the users and the bandwidth reservation service providers of the HPNs. We focus on two important bandwidth reservation problems formulated from the combinations of the requirements from both users and the bandwidth reservation service providers of the HPNs: (i) Problem of scheduling all BRRs in one batch while achieving their best average data transfer earliest completion time and shortest duration, and (ii) Problem of scheduling two generic types of BRRs concerning data transfer reliability with different objectives and constraints in unreliable HPNs that are subject to node and link failures. We prove the two subproblems of the first problem are NP-complete problems, and fast and efficient heuristic algorithms are proposed. While the two subproblems of the second problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time. The corresponding optimal algorithms and proofs are given. We conduct extensive simulations to compare the performance of the proposed heuristic and optimal algorithms with naive scheduling algorithms and the algorithms currently used in production network in various performance metrics. The performance superiority of the proposed heuristic and optimal algorithms is verified...|$|R
