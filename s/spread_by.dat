5|$|Strep throat is <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> {{respiratory}} droplets from {{an infected}} person. It may be spread directly or by touching {{something that has}} droplets on it and then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also be <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E
50|$|A {{virus is}} a {{self-replicating}} program that <b>spreads</b> <b>by</b> inserting copies of itself into other executable code or documents. By doing this, it behaves similarly to a biological virus, which <b>spreads</b> <b>by</b> inserting itself into living cells. While some viruses are harmless or mere hoaxes, most are considered malicious.|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{spread in}} many ways. Just as many viruses are very {{specific}} {{as to which}} host species or tissue they attack, each species of virus relies on a particular method for propagation. Plant viruses are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other organisms, known as vectors. Some viruses of animals, including humans, are <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as influenza are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as norovirus are transmitted by the faecal–oral route, which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. Rotavirus is often <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the Dengue virus, are <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> blood-sucking insects.|$|E

5|$|As Romania faced indecision {{about its}} future, the Corps {{was still the}} subject of unionist propaganda, <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> Romanian intellectuals in the capitals of Entente nations. From his {{temporary}} home in France, Bocu reestablished România Mare as the tribune of Romanian diaspora politics and unionist aspirations. He was joined there by Octavian Goga, who had crossed over Bolshevik territory and Finland with false papers, claiming to be a Volunteer Corps veteran.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa {{as it is in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Dengue is <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> {{several species}} of {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E

5|$|HCV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion {{is less than}} one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> superficial contact. It {{is one of five}} known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, redback spiders {{were found}} in Fukuoka, Japan. Over 700 have been found near the {{container}} terminal in Hakata Bay, Fukuoka City. Dispersal mechanisms within Japan are unclear, but redbacks {{are thought to have}} <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> walking or by being carried on vehicles. In September 2012, after being bitten a woman was hospitalised in the Higashi Ward of Fukuoka City. As Japan previously had no dangerous spiders, signs warning about redback spiders have been posted in parks around the city.|$|E

5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread {{from person to}} person through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It may also be <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease for up to six weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|Reverse transcribing viruses {{replicate}} their genomes by reverse transcribing DNA copies {{from their}} RNA; these DNA copies are then transcribed to new RNA. Retrotransposons also <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> copying DNA and RNA from one another, and telomerase contains an RNA {{that is used}} as template for building the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{archaeologist}} Leslie Grinsell {{reported that}} in the mid-1970s, he learned of a folk tale that the stones had once been children who were turned to stones as punishment for playing Five-Stones on a Sunday. This folk motif of humans turned to stone for revelling on a Sunday had been attached {{to a range of}} prehistoric monuments across south-western Britain by the early eighteenth century, although it had been first recorded in Cornwall in 1602. It is likely connected to Sabbatarianism, and may have been <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> Protestant preachers.|$|E

5|$|The mud snail {{was first}} {{detected}} in the U.S. in Idaho's Snake River in 1987. Since then, the snail has spread to the Madison River, Firehole River, and other watercourses around Yellowstone National Park, and has been discovered throughout the western U.S. The exact means of transmission is unknown, but {{it is likely that}} it was introduced in water transferred with live game fish and has been <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> ship ballast or contaminated recreational equipment such as wading gear.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} disease was {{significantly}} more rampant {{in areas of}} poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than {{the children of the}} wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Though {{she never}} wed, rumours spread that Sophia became {{pregnant}} by Thomas Garth, an equerry of her father's, and {{gave birth to}} an illegitimate son {{in the summer of}} 1800. Other gossip declared the child was the product of rape by her elder brother the Duke of Cumberland, who was deeply unpopular. Historians are divided on the validity of these stories, as some believe she gave birth to Garth's child while others call them tales <b>spread</b> <b>by</b> the Royal Family's political enemies.|$|E
