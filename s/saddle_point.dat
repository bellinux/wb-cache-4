This paper primarily focusses on computing <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> on potential energy surfaces. A stability boundary based approach that explores the dy-namic and geometric characteristics of stability boundaries of a nonlinear dynamical system has been used to compute <b>saddle</b> <b>points.</b> A novel ray-adjustment procedure is used to trace the stability boundary.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} Lagrange-multiplier {{formulation}} of discrete constrained optimization problems, the associated discrete-space first-order necessary and sufficient conditions for <b>saddle</b> <b>points,</b> and an efficient first-order search procedure that looks for <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> in discrete space. Our new theory provides a strong mathematical foundation for solving general nonlinear discrete optimization problems. Specifically, we propose a new vector-based definition of descent directions in discrete space and show that the new definition does not obey the rules of calculus in continuous space. Starting from the concept of <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> and using only vector calculus, we then prove the discrete-space first-order necessary and sufficient conditions for <b>saddle</b> <b>points.</b> Using well-defined transformations on the constraint functions, we further prove that the set of discrete-space <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> {{is the same as}} the set of constrained local minima, leading to the first-order necessary and suf [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{computational}} {{theory and}} methods for finding multiple unstable solutions (corresponding to <b>saddle</b> <b>points)</b> to {{three types of}} nonlinear variational elliptic systems: cooperative, noncooperative, and Hamiltonian. We first propose a new Lorthogonal selection in a product Hilbert space so that a solution manifold can be defined. Then, we establish, respectively, a local characterization for <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> of finite Morse index and of infinite Morse index. Based on these characterizations, two methods, called the local min-orthogonal method and the local min-max-orthogonal method, are developed and applied to solve those three types of elliptic systems for multiple solutions. Under suitable assumptions, a subsequence convergence result is established for each method. Numerical experiments for different types of model problems are carried out, showing that both methods are very reliable and efficient in computing coexisting <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> or <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> of infinite Morse index. We also analyze the instability of <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> in both single and product Hilbert spaces. In particular, we establish several estimates of the Morse index of both coexisting and non-coexisting <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> via the local min-orthogonal method developed and propose a local instability index to measure the local instability of both degenerate and nondegenerate <b>saddle</b> <b>points.</b> Finally, we suggest two extensions of an L-orthogonal selection for future research so that multiple solutions to more general elliptic systems such as nonvariational elliptic systems may {{also be found in}} a stable way...|$|R

25|$|Typically, but not always, {{the process}} seeks {{to find the}} {{geometry}} of a particular arrangement of the atoms that represents a local or global energy minimum.

40|$|Critical {{points of}} a scalar quantitiy are either extremal <b>points</b> or <b>saddle</b> <b>points.</b> The {{character}} of the critical points {{is determined by the}} sign distribution of the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix.

25|$|If the {{principal}} curvatures have different signs: , then the Gaussian curvature is negative {{and the surface}} {{is said to have}} a hyperbolic or <b>saddle</b> <b>point.</b> At such points, the surface will be saddle shaped. Because one principal curvature is negative, one is positive, and the normal curvature varies continuously if you rotate a plane orthogonal to the surface around the normal to the surface in two directions, the normal curvatures will be zero giving the Asymptotic curves for that point.|$|E
25|$|In {{differential}} geometry, the {{two principal}} curvatures {{at a given}} point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the point. They measure how the surface bends by different amounts in different directions at that point. We represent the surface by the implicit function theorem as the graph of a function, f, of two variables, {{in such a way}} that the point p is a critical point, i.e., the gradient of f vanishes (this can always be attained by a suitable rigid motion). Then the Gaussian curvature of the surface at p is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of f (being the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian). (Recall that the Hessian is the 2-by-2 matrix of second derivatives.) This definition allows one immediately to grasp the distinction between cup/cap versus <b>saddle</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{the system}} is rescaled, the change in {{conductivity}} depends only on the distance between a fixed <b>saddle</b> <b>point</b> and the conductivity. The scaling behavior near the quantum Hall transitions is then universal and different quantum Hall samples will give the same scaling results. But, by studying the quantum Hall transitions theoretically, many different systems that are all in different universality classes {{have been found to}} share a super-universal fixed point structure. This means that many different systems that are all in different universality classes still share the same fixed point structure. They all have stable topological sectors and also share other super-universal features. That these features are super-universal is due to the fundamental nature of the vacuum angle that governs the scaling behavior of the systems. The topological vacuum angle can be constructed in any quantum field theory but only under the right circumstances can its features be observed. The vacuum angle also appears in quantum chromodynamics and might have been important {{in the formation of the}} early universe.|$|E
40|$|The task {{of finding}} <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> on {{potential}} energy surfaces plays {{a crucial role}} in under-standing the dynamics of a micromolecule as well as in studying the folding pathways of macromolecules like proteins. The problem of finding the <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> on a high dimen-sional potential energy surface is transformed into the problem of finding decomposition points of its corresponding nonlinear dynamical system. This paper introduces a new method based on TRUST-TECH (TRansformation Under STability reTained Equilibria CHaracter-ization) to compute <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> on potential energy surfaces using stability boundaries. Our method explores the dynamic and geometric characteristics of stability boundaries of a nonlinear dynamical system. A novel trajectory adjustment procedure is used to trace the stability boundary. Our method was successful in finding the <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> on different potential energy surfaces of various dimensions. A simplified version of the algorithm has also been used to find the <b>saddle</b> <b>points</b> of symmetric systems with the help of some analyt-ical knowledge.
