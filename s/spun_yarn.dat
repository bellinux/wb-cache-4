5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women <b>spun</b> <b>yarn,</b> knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E

25|$|Any yarn can {{be either}} knitted or crocheted, {{provided}} needles or hooks of the correct size are used, but the cord's properties {{should be taken into}} account. For example, lofty, thick woolen yarns tend to function better when knitted, which does not crush their airy structure, while thin and tightly <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> helps to achieve the firm texture required for Amigurumi crochet.|$|E
50|$|DREF yarns {{have been}} seen to be {{inferior}} in terms of unevenness, imperfections, strength variability and hairiness. DREF yarns occupy an intermediate position between ring-spun and rotor <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> as far as short hairs and total hairiness s concerned. For hairs longer than 3mm, the friction <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> are more hairy than the ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns.</b> Rotor <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> show the least value in both the values. DREF yarns are most irregular in terms of twist and linear density while ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> are most even.|$|R
50|$|Friction <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> DREF yarns have bulky {{appearance}} (100-140% bulkier {{than the}} ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns).</b> The twist is not uniform and found with loopy <b>yarn</b> surface. Friction <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> {{with a high}} %age of core have a high stiffness. Friction <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> are usually weak as compared to other yarns. The yarns possess only 60% of the tenacity of ring-spun yarns and about 90% of rotor spun-yarns. The increased twist and wrapping of the sheath over the core improve the cohesion between the core and sheath and within the sheath.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to explore whether the {{properties}} of worsted yarns, especially hairiness, can be improved by combining the Solospun and Sirospun processes into a single Solo-Siro spun process. Wool fibres of 19 and 21 μm in average diameter were spun into 40 tex yarns at different twist levels, using the conventional ring, Sirospun and Solo-Siro spun systems, respectively. These yarns were then tested for a range of properties, including hairiness, tenacity, elongation and evenness, for comparison purposes. The statistical analysis results indicate that the hairiness (S 3 value) of Solo-Siro <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> was significantly less than that of both Sirospun and normal ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns.</b> In addition, the tenacity of the Solo-Siro <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> was higher than that of the normal ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns,</b> while changes in yarn breaking elongation were not statistically significant. For the 21 μm wool, {{it was found that the}} evenness of Solo-Siro <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> deteriorated slightly in comparison with that of Sirospun and conventional ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns.</b> <br /...|$|R
25|$|Mule {{spindles}} rest on {{a carriage}} that travels on a track a distance of , while drawing out and spinning the yarn. On the return trip, known as putting up, as the carriage moves back to its original position, the newly <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> is wound onto the spindle {{in the form of}} a cone-shaped cop. As the mule spindle travels on its carriage, the roving which it spins is fed to it through rollers geared to revolve at different speeds to draw out the yarn.|$|E
25|$|When skeining from wheel <b>spun</b> <b>yarn,</b> the bobbin {{can either}} {{be removed from the}} wheel and placed on a kate, or skeined {{directly}} from the wheel. If the bobbin is left on the wheel the tension on the drive band must be lessened in order to allow the bobbin to turn freely. Yarn spun on spindles {{can either be}} left on the spindle, or slipped onto a dowel for plying. The spindle or dowel is either placed in a lazy kate, or even a bowl to keep the spindle in one place while winding off the yarn.|$|E
25|$|The flyer is the {{original}} type of mechanical spinning frame and {{is believed to be}} a direct development of the Saxony wheel used in hand spinning. It is suitable for producing thick smooth yarns from coarse quality wools and hairs, but is falling into disuse because of the low speed at which the spindles have to run. As the yarn leaves the front rollers it is guided through a porcelain ring {{to the top of a}} revolving spindle, around and down one of the arms of the flyer and onto the bobbin. The bobbin is carried on a lifter plate and moves up and down the spindle. As the flyer revolves, imparting twist to the yarn, the bobbin which is free to rotate on the spindle is pulled round by the <b>spun</b> <b>yarn.</b> A felt or cloth washer is placed between the lifter plate and bobbin to retard the revolving bobbin and create adequate yarn tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly on the bobbin. When the bobbins are full they are removed and replaced by empty ones. This action is termed doffing and is done manually on this machine.|$|E
40|$|In compact spinning, fibers {{in drawing}} stage are {{condensed}} using air suction, {{which results in}} the produced yarns which significantly differ from ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> in their physical and mechanical properties. This study compares between physical properties of compact and ring yarn fabrics woven from coarser and medium yarn counts. The experimental results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA. The {{findings of this study}} revealed that woven fabrics produced from compact <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> are superior to those produced from ring <b>spun</b> <b>yarns</b> with respect to breaking strength, breaking elongation, abrasion resistance, tearing strength, and air permeability...|$|R

500|$|Textiles may be dyed as raw fibre (dyed in the fleece or dyed in the wool), as <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> (dyed in the hank or yarn-dyed), {{or after}} weaving (piece-dyed). [...] Mordants often leave residue in wool fibre {{that makes it}} {{difficult}} to spin, so wool was generally dyed after spinning, as yarn or woven cloth. Indigo, however, requires no mordant, and cloth manufacturers in medieval England often dyed wool in the fleece with the indigo-bearing plant woad and then dyed the cloth again after weaving to produce deep blues, browns, reds, purples, blacks, and tawnies.|$|E
500|$|After {{migrating}} from Scotland in the 1780s, the Murrays established {{themselves as}} manufacturers of textile machinery before moving into spinning fine yarn. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries the main market for Murrays' fine <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> was the muslin-weaving industry in Scotland; along with McConnel & Kennedy, A & G Murray dominated the Scottish market. In 1790, Adam Murray leased land in Ancoats; {{in partnership with}} his brother George, began construction of his first mill – which was complete by about 1798. The mill was probably designed to house equipment produced by the Murray brothers themselves. First known as Union Mill, from its position on Union Street, the Old Mill was a purpose-built steam-powered spinning mill. Construction took approximately a year and millwright Thomas Lowe – who had worked on Richard Arkwright's first two factories – planned the building. It is eight storeys high and probably the first cotton-spinning factory to have been built that high. The {{first phase of the}} mill, an area of [...] by , was built of 400,000 locally made bricks. The machinery was powered by a 12horse power (hp), £620 Boulton and Watt steam engine.|$|E

2500|$|A single <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> may be crochet as is, or braided or plied with another. [...] In plying, {{two or more}} yarns are spun together, {{almost always}} in the {{opposite}} sense from which they were spun individually; for example, two Z-twist yarns are usually plied with an S-twist. [...] The opposing twist relieves some of the yarns' tendency to curl up and produces a thicker, balanced yarn. [...] Plied yarns may themselves be plied together, producing cabled yarns or multi-stranded yarns. [...] Sometimes, the yarns being plied are fed at different rates, so that one yarn loops around the other, as in bouclé. [...] The single yarns may be dyed separately before plying, or afterwords to give the yarn a uniform look.|$|E
2500|$|While Samuel Slater had {{established}} {{the first successful}} textile mill at Pawtucket, Rhode Island in 1793, there remained no way to efficiently mass-produce cloth from the <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> produced by the early mills. The yarn was still outsourced to small weaving shops where it was woven into cloth on hand looms. The first woolen mill, and the second textile mill in the Blackstone Valley, was a [...] "wool carding mill", established in 1810 by Daniel Day, near the West River and Blackstone River at Uxbridge, Massachusetts. Then, in 1813, a group of wealthy Boston merchants led by Francis Cabot Lowell, known as the Boston Associates, established the first successful integrated textile mill in North America at Waltham. Lowell had visited England in 1810 and studied the Lancashire textile industry. Because the British government prohibited the export of this new technology, Lowell memorized plans for the power looms on his return trip to Boston. With the skill of master mechanic Paul Moody, the first successful power looms were produced, harnessing {{the power of the}} Charles River. For the first time, all phases of textile production could now be performed under one roof, greatly increasing production, and profits. This was the real beginning of the Industrial Revolution in America.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{knitting}} may be {{done with}} ribbons, metal wire or more exotic filaments, most yarns are made by spinning fibers. [...] In spinning, the fibers are twisted so that the yarn resists breaking under tension; the twisting may be done in either direction, resulting in a Z-twist or S-twist yarn. [...] If the fibers are first aligned by combing them, the yarn is smoother and called a worsted; by contrast, if the fibers are carded but not combed, the yarn is fuzzier and called woolen-spun. [...] The fibers making up a yarn may be continuous filament fibers such as silk and many synthetics, {{or they may be}} staples (fibers of an average length, typically a few inches); naturally filament fibers are sometimes cut up into staples before spinning. [...] The strength of the <b>spun</b> <b>yarn</b> against breaking is determined by the amount of twist, the length of the fibers and the thickness of the yarn. [...] In general, yarns become stronger with more twist (also called worst), longer fibers and thicker yarns (more fibers); for example, thinner yarns require more twist than do thicker yarns to resist breaking under tension. [...] The thickness of the yarn may vary along its length; a slub is a much thicker section in which a mass of fibers is incorporated into the yarn.|$|E
