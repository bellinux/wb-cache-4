This method was especially useful in the case of segmental ischemia where the diagnosis is difficult by means of other tests. 3) The approximate s ize of intrinsic renal mass, detectable with the <b>scintigram,</b> located in the peripheral and central parts of the kidney was found experimentally to be as small defect as 2 cm and 3 cm diameters respectively, even though these figures vary with the local relation to the renal parenchym. 4) A diagnostic s i gnificance of renal <b>scintigram</b> was clarified in the cases of congenital abnormalities of the shape and localization of the kidney. 5) In renal tuberculosis, where partial defects are not infreqUently seen, the functional surviving areas were more clearly demonstrated by means of renal scintigraphy than IVP or RP. This will give a useful reference for the surgical procedure of partial resection. 6) In patients with pyelonephritis, a normal pattern of renal <b>scintigram</b> was seen in acute period while more or less decreased uptake was shown in chronic period. In generally, the decrease was not localized but diffuse in the most instances. In cases of hydronephrosis, lower uptake was demonstrated in renal <b>scintigram.</b> Severe cases, in addition, showed no depiction at all.

METHODS [...] After isolation of the lymphocytes, the cells were radiolabelled in vitro with 250 MBq 99 mTc-HMPAO. The scans were performed 30 minutes, three hours and 20 hours after injection. RESULTS [...] An increase of the <b>scintigram</b> signal obtained at 20 hours {{was associated with a}} high joint swelling and joint pain score (F test = 3. 07, p < 0. 002), but not with the radiological score.

Injection of calcitonin reduced plasma levels of ionized calcium from 1. 47 +/- 0. 10 mmol/l to 1. 41 +/- 0. 09 mmol/l (p less than 0. 01). Concomitantly, serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone increased from 6. 4 +/- 2. 5 pmol/l to 7. 9 +/- 2. 6 pmol/l (p less than 0. 001).

In 16 of 18 cases, negative myocardial <b>scintigrams</b> correlated with the absence of acute myocardial infarction determined by clinicopathological evidence. In two cases small subendocardial in-farcts (< 3 g) were not detected by "mTc-PYP myocardial scintigraphy.

Materials and methods: DCM patients (n= 29 : mean age, 51. 9 years; seven women) were evaluated by both DE cardiac MR imaging and 123 I-MIBG <b>scintigram.</b> In all patients biopsy specimen showed disarray of the myocardium that was consistent with DCM. DE cardiac MR images were acquired using a two-dimensional segmented inversion-recovery prepared gradient-echo sequence (TI= 250 msec) 15 minutes after intravenous administration of 0. 1 mmol/kg gadolinium. The average CNR per slice (aCNR) for the LV myocardium was calculated. 123 I-MIBG <b>scintigram</b> was acquired at 15 minutes and 3 hours (delayed imaging) after intravenous administration of 123 I-MIBG (111 MBq). The heart-to-mediastinum radioactivity ratio (H/M ratio) and washout rate (WR) was calculated. We evaluated the relationships between aCNR, WR, delayed H/M ratio, and the contraction function of the LV. Results: In MR imaging, mean aCNR was significantly higher in the low LV ejection fraction (LVEF< 25 %) group (n= 11, 6. 6 ± 3. 6) than in the high LVEF (? 25 %) group (n= 18, 2. 4 ± 2. 9).

Forty-three of 218 (20 %) <b>scintigrams</b> had increased uptake associated with the distal aspect of the third metacarpal and metatarsal bones. Abnormal scintigraphic uptake was bilateral in 91 of 139 (65 %) forelimb locations and 99 of 134 (74 %) hind limb locations with increased radiopharmaceutical uptake. The primary scintigraphically identified classifications of disease were exercise-induced bone remodeling, synovitis or arthritis, and soft-tissue avulsion from bone (66, 17, and 6 % of areas with increased radiopharmaceutical uptake, respectively). Of 274 areas with increased radiopharmaceutical uptake, 244 (89 %) were believed to be clinically important. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Distinctive patterns of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake were identified that suggested Standardbred horses used for racing may have a predilection to develop orthopedic disease at specific sites that are distinct from those in Thoroughbreds used for racing and horses used for jumping activities...|$|R

No metastasis was found on abdominal CT, chest tomography and bone <b>scintigram</b> at that time. Radical thyroidectomy was performed on June, 23, 1986. Histological examination by hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed metastasis of renal cell carcinoma, and immunohistochemical technique ruled out primary thyroid carcinoma.

40|$|The fundermental {{problems}} in the renal <b>scintigram</b> by m eans of 20 Hg-Neohydrin were investigated. Conclusions were drawn as follows. 1) Concerning the factors of definition of th e apparatus, noteworthy remarks, proper conditions and their effects for the renal <b>scintigram</b> were briefly described. a) A sufficient elimination of the back scatters {{was able to be}} accom plished by using more than 200 Key of the detection energy. b) The proper scan speed and line space were 40 - 60 cm/min. and 2 - 3 mm respectively. c) Determination of the rate down ratio is profitable to be achieved on t he basis of the uptake rate. d) T he effects of back ground erase of the limitor were experimentally demonstrated under inferiorer condition than the actual isotope distribution of the body on renal <b>scintigram.</b> e) By a collimator with 7 cm of the focal distance, scanning must be mad e at the closest distance from the skin surface of the back. f) The proper direction of scan mus t be towarded to the right angle to the long axis of the body in the respect for comparison of the both kidneys. g) For scanning of wide areas as kidney, an app aratus having a recording system, with a dot of wide vertical range is suitable, even though various apparatuses have more or less advantages. 2) The results of studies on renal uptake rate of 2, 3 Hg and the course of body back-ground suggested that the most proper conditions for renal <b>scintigram</b> in normal kidney is obtained between 2 and a half hours and 3 hours following the intravenous administration of 203 HgNeohydrin. 3) An estimation of the internal radiation dose to the whole body and the kidney was made in cases of 100 pc intravenons administration of zolig-Neohydrin. The radiation dose to the kidney was calculated on the basis of 203 Hg-renal uptake-rate curve, which is supposed to be more accurlate method than calculations so far used. It was found that the doses on the central axis of the body and on the central axis of the kidncy were 55. 8 mRad and 21. 7 Rad respectively. It is noted that the administration of 203 Hg should be minified as little as possible since the radiation dose to the kidney is considered to be rather massive. 4) For the renal <b>scintigram,</b> a use of highly sensitive collimalor is pref e rable because of its specificity of internal radiation. A comparative study was performed on the adaptability of several different collimators for the renal <b>scintigram.</b> It was found that the 7. hole honey cone type is qualified for our purpose, so that the standards and iso-responce curve of the type were illustrated. 5) Using a body phantom, the size of detectable intrarenal focus was estimated. A glass bead of 2. 0 cm diameter was the smallest one detected in the kidney phantom. Scinti-scanning was performed on experimental ischemic kidney. A sufficient diagnostic value was recognized not only in stenosis of main renal artery but also in stenosis of branch artery. 7) On experimental stenosis of branch renal artery, the <b>scintigram</b> was made according to the section method which was found to be advantageous than ordinal methods...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} anatomic {{patterns and}} clinical importance of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake in bones of horses used for show jumping, hunting, and eventing. DESIGN: Retrospective study. ANIMALS: 141 horses evaluated because of lameness. PROCEDURE: Medical records were reviewed, {{and information on}} results of physical examination, radiography, and scintigraphy were obtained. <b>Scintigrams</b> were evaluated to identify areas of increased radio-pharmaceutical uptake. RESULTS: 834 areas of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake were identified. Scintigraphy of the vertebral column was performed in 78 horses, and 50 had areas of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake involving the spinous processes. Scintigraphy of the proximal phalanx of the forelimb was performed in 88 horses. Similarly, scintigraphy of the proximal phalanx of the hind limb was performed in 99 horses, and <b>scintigrams</b> of 374 proximal phalanges were available for review. One hundred fifty-five <b>scintigrams</b> had areas of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake. Scintigraphy of the tarsal joint was performed in 99 horses, and <b>scintigrams</b> of 198 joints were available for review. Eighty-five had areas of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake. Overall, 214 of 834 areas of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake were definitively associated with lameness. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Results {{of this study suggest}} that jumping creates unique stresses on the bones of horses. The distinctive patterns of increased radiopharmaceutical uptake identified in this study suggest that horses used for jumping may have a predilection to develop orthopedic disease at specific sites distinct from those in racehorses.

40|$|Exercise thallium- 201 {{myocardial}} scintigraphy {{was performed in}} 23 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Eighteen patients presented with chest pain which was a persistent symptom in 11. Selective coronary arteriography was performed in 16 patients and showed normal coronary arteries in 15 and insignificant luminal irregularities in one patient. Eighteen patients had abnormal <b>scintigrams.</b> Three had an abnormal distribution of tracer entirely attributable to asymmetric septal hypertrophy, whereas 15 had discrete tracer uptake defects {{which could not be}} explained solely by myocardial hypertrophy. In this latter group of patients three scintigraphic patterns were identified: (1) in 10 patients defects were seen in <b>scintigrams</b> immediately after exercise but not in delayed images obtained four to six hours later. Eight of these patients had chest pain. (2) Four patients had uptake defects seen in both initial and delayed images. One patient had chest pain. (3) In three patients, one of whom had chest pain, tracer defects were seen only in delayed images and were not apparent in the initial <b>scintigrams.</b> Chest pain occurred in eight out of 10 patients with scintigraphic evidence of myocardial ischaemia but was present in only three out of 13 patients with non-ischaemic <b>scintigrams.</b> The value of exercise thallium- 201 myocardial imaging as a diagnostic technique in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy appears limited.
