Justice is not achieved, however, if persons are convicted on anything less than the requisite standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

25|$|Total BC {{petroleum}} {{and natural}} gas emissions in 2014 were 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The city of Vancouver in 2015 issued a report stating that for buildings, natural gas supplied 59% of all energy use, while electricity made up the remainder. BC has committed to reducing greenhouse gases to 33 per cent below 2007 levels by 2020, however the province is far <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> goal, only achieving a 6.5% reduction as of 2015. Although the Site C dam {{is expected to have}} a large initial electricity surplus, the province has proposed to sell this power rather than using it to cut natural gas consumption.|$|E

25|$|Inchmore {{played a}} {{significant}} part in each Worcestershire season from then on, taking between 30 and 63 first-class wickets every summer from 1975 to 1985. His highest aggregate of 63 came in 1975, although he fell only one <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> mark in 1979. In one-day cricket, his most successful season was 1981, when he had 33 victims. He was capped by his county in 1976, and in 1976–77 he played twice for Northern Transvaal in South Africa's Castle Currie Cup. Back in England, in 1977 he produced a career-best innings return of 8/58 against Yorkshire, two wickets in the second innings bringing him his only ten-wicket match haul.|$|E
25|$|The Reims Campaign, {{following}} which {{peace was}} finally achieved with the Treaty of Brétigny. But, {{on the same}} terms, England was left with {{about a third of}} France rather than a little under half which they would have received through the Treaty of London. This is due to the failure to take Reims which led to the need for a safe passage out of France. As a result, a lesser treaty was agreed to and Edward III was obliged to drop his claims to the French throne. France was still forced to pay a huge ransom of around four times France's gross annual domestic product for John the Good. The ransom paid was, however, a little <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> demanded by the English, and John the Good was not returned to the French. Thus, this campaign yielded mixed results, but was mostly positive for Edward. One must also remember Edward III never actually dropped his claim to the throne, and that about half of France was controlled by the English anyway through many vassals.|$|E

This did not happen. The [...] "Trial of the CPSU" [...] fell far <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> goal. The Soviet Communist Party {{was found to be}} an unconstitutional organisation, but former communists were allowed to play a leading part in the government of post-Soviet Russia and, as the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, to act as the country's main political opposition. Former CPSU, even Politburo, members such as Alexander Yakovlev (Russian politician) had a prominent place in the presidential commission for the post-October 1917 victims of political repression. Bukovsky expressed his deep disappointment with this failure in his writings and interviews.|$|E
500|$|When the Stork Club {{initially}} {{closed its}} doors, news stories indicated {{it was being}} shut because the building it occupied had been sold and a new location was being sought. The years of labor disputes had taken their toll on Billingsley financially. Trying to keep the Stork Club going took all of his assets and about $10 million from his three daughters' trust funds. While in the hospital recuperating from a serious illness in October 1965, Billingsley sold the building to Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), who later turned the site into a park named after its founder's father. In a 1937 interview, Billingsley said, [...] "I hope I'll be running a night club the last day I live." [...] He fell just <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> mark. [...] One year after the Stork Club closed, Sherman Billingsley {{died of a heart}} attack at his Manhattan apartment, leaving a wife, Hazel, and three daughters, Jacqueline, Barbara, and Shermane. He was planning on re-opening the Stork Club in another location and was working on writing a book at the time of his death.|$|E
500|$|Following a refit in Portsmouth, Tiptoe {{went to the}} Firth of Clyde {{for working}} up, {{arriving}} on 10 January 1964, when she was ordered not to enter Gareloch due to dense fog. The boat was duly turned around and ran aground on a muddy bank. As the fog cleared it was realised the boat had run aground only [...] opposite that {{of the house of}} the Royal Navy's Captain in Charge for the Clyde area, Captain G. D. Pound. Divers were sent out to assess damage, and after finding none, Tiptoe was refloated on the evening tide and pulled off the shore by two tugboats. The commanding officer at the time was LieutenantCommander David Brazier, who was in his first command. He was later ordered to be severely reprimanded for negligence at a court-martial where he pleaded guilty to the charge. His defence statement read, [...] "The ship was not worked up {{and it was a very}} green company. Unfortunately he ran into fog. He took all the precautions he considered necessary.

500|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} following its publication, the novel received fourteen professional reviews – a number {{much larger than}} most of her other works. Critics gave largely negative reviews, and Mary Fahnestock-Thomas writes that [...] "many fans [...] virtually unreadable." [...] The year of its release in 1975, Library Journal contributor Eleanore Singer praised it for being [...] "well-documented historical writing," [...] though she felt that [...] "as a novel, it doesn't have enough dramatic or narrative flow {{to keep it from}} being often boring." [...] Singer added that My Lord John [...] "falls far <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> superb blending of history and compelling storytelling that characterizes successful examples of the genre." [...] Jane Aiken Hodge of History Today, while praising Heyer's Regency novels as [...] "triumphs of a language that never was on sea or land," [...] thought that My Lord John was [...] "less successful." [...] The language of the novel, Aiken Hodge said, was grating and [...] "scattered with too lavish a hand," [...] with words like lordings and bel sire. Aiken Hodge also felt that while it contained [...] "some happy moments of unmistakable Heyer humour," [...] it failed to contain enough to [...] "hold a young reader for long." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Nolan {{directed}} his {{third and final}} Batman film, The Dark Knight Rises. Although he was initially hesitant about returning to the series, he agreed to come back after developing a story with his brother and David S. Goyer which he felt would end the series on a high note. The Dark Knight Rises was released on 20 July 2012 to positive reviews; Andrew O'Hehir of Salon called it [...] "arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen", further describing the work as [...] "auteurist spectacle on a scale never before possible and never before attempted". Christy Lemire of The Associated Press wrote in her review that Nolan concluded his trilogy in a [...] "typically spectacular, ambitious fashion", but disliked the [...] "overloaded" [...] story and excessive grimness; [...] "This is the problem when you're an exceptional, visionary filmmaker. When you give people something extraordinary, they expect it every time. Anything <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> feels like a letdown." [...] Like its predecessor it performed well at the box office, becoming the thirteenth film {{in the world to}} gross over $1-billion. During a midnight showing of the film at the Century 16 cinema in Aurora, Colorado, a gunman opened fire inside the theater, killing 12 people and injuring 58 others. Nolan released a statement to the press expressing his condolences for the victims of what he described as a senseless tragedy.|$|E
500|$|On the Foundation's motion, Judge Alison J. Nathan severed and {{dismissed}} from the lawsuit the partnership's copyright claim. According to Judge Nathan, the Constitution allows federal courts to decide only [...] "Cases" [...] or [...] "Controversies", which means ongoing or imminent disputes over legal rights, involving concrete facts and specific acts, that require court intervention {{in order to}} shield the plaintiff from harm or interference with its rights. The judge held that the partnership's complaint fell <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> standard because even if the Foundation continued to claim ownership of the design's copyright—and even if its claim was invalid—that claim would not legally harm the partnership or prevent it from making its own lawful uses of the design. The partnership did not claim that it owned the design's copyright, only that the Foundation did not. Since, according to the court, the Foundation promised not to sue the partnership for any [...] "potentially copyright-infringing uses of the Banana Design", the partnership could continue using the design {{and there would be}} no legal action that the Foundation could take (under copyright law) to stop it. And if, the court concluded, the partnership could continue with business as usual (as far as copyright was concerned) regardless of whether the Foundation actually owned the design's copyright, a court decision would have no practical consequences for the partnership; it would be a purely academic (or [...] "advisory") opinion, which federal courts may not issue. The court therefore [...] "dismissed without prejudice" [...] the partnership's request that it resolve whether the Foundation owned the design's copyright.|$|E
