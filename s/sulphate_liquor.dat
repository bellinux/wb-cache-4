By the process of chemical destruction method using Sulphuric Acid, Chrome Sulphate or Chromosal powder that can be used as an alternative tanning agent can be obtained. It can be concluded from the research that destruction process of Chrome Hydroxide Sludge of Lime Process requires speed of stirring 100 rpm.

40|$|Internationally about 400000 tons of Chrome {{tanning agents}} are used annually. The {{efficiency}} of {{the present state of}} the art tanning technology would suggest that about 60000 tons of chrome tanning agents remain unutilised during the chrome tanning and might be discharged into the environment. Apart from environmental problems, this costs the industry ninety million dollars worth of valuable chrome tanning agents annually. The research was aimed at minimising the environmental impact of chrome tanning by the improvement of the {{efficiency of the}} classical system through the addition of auxiliary chemicals during chrome tanning, changing the present technology and by modifying the chrome tanning agent itself. Two different chemicals were synthesised. These were included in a detail study with six other commercial auxiliary chemicals to improve the classical system. Here the possibilities of improving the availability of carboxylic groups for better efficiency of chrome tanning were explored. A considerable improvement, about 90 - 93 % for hides and 95 - 96 % for lamb skins was obtained with these two synthesised chemicals. A novel chrome terming technique for tanning of lamb skins was developed where conventional acid-salt pickling was completely eliminated and tanning conducted after deliming at pH 7 to 8. 5. This novel technique also did not require basification and masking agents for the completion of chrome tanning and saved considerable amount of money for the tanner. This new approach of tanning gave higher exhaustion of chrome to the extent of 96 - 97 % with improved physical properties and yield of leather. The mechanism of the new tanning system was also postulated. Seventy percent of sodium sulphate, one of the pollutants of chrome tanning, was removed from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate by crystallisation technique. Attempts were made to separate various species of chrome complexes with HPLC, Gel filtration (Saphadex G 25) and Ion exchange chromatography (SP Saphadex C 25) and finally six species of chrome complexes were separated from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome <b>sulphate</b> <b>liquor</b> with ion exchange columns (Dowex 50 W x 8 and Dowex IX 8 - 50). It was interesting to find that about 20 % of the commercial basic chrome sulphate were anionic and nonionic complexes. In an attempt to understand their reactivity, separated species of complexes were studied for their ageing and tanning characteristics. This showed {{that as long as the}} pH of the liquor was kept constant, there was no significant change in these complexes due to ageing. Tanning affinity of each of these complexes was studied on pickled lamb skins at three different temperatures, namely 20, 30 and 40 °C. In general, anionic complex had no reactivity and the noniontc species was less reactive at normal tanning pH between 3. 0 and 4. 2. Similar tanning trials with cationic complexes showed that the affinity of these complexes with skin collagen increased progressively with the cationic charge of the complexes up to (Cr) 4 +, and then remained constant for complexes with higher charges than (Cr) 4 +. The reactivity of the combined cationic complexes was studied against standard commercial chrome control on similar pickled and degreased lamb skins. It was found that this combined cationic fraction tanned leather rapidly and more efficiently. The exhaustion of chrome, established through the analysis of chrome in the exhaust chrome liquor with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer, was 95. 11 % against 72. 25 % for the control. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines. A polyamide resin was synlhcsised. Initially 0. 75 g to 1. 25 g resin/mole of Cr 2 O 3 was used to modify the 33 % basic chrome <b>sulphate</b> <b>liquor.</b> The ageing characteristics of these complexes were also studied over a six month period. It was clear that the polyamide formed a stable complex with basic chrome sulphate and the ageing did not alter their characteristics significantly. Ion exchange separation (Dowex 50 W x 8) of the chrome-polyamide complex showed that this complex had an ionic distribution closer to phthalate masked basic chrome sulphate. Tanning trials with chrome-polyamide complex on pickled lamb skins and cow hides at low pH like the conventional chrome tanning showed slightly better chrome exhaustion for lamb skin but no significant improvement for side leather. But when lamb skins were tanned according to the newly developed chrome tanning process, a significant improvement in chrome tanning was obtained. The exhaustion of chrome was more than 99 % and leather stood boil within two hours, shortening the chrome tanning process considerably. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines The novel process without pickling was tried successfully in the industry. The principle of this no-pickle novel chrome tanning system was extended to the pretanned lamb skins where chrome tanning was successfully carried out at high pH after degreasing without readjusting the pH of the tanning bath with acid to 3. 0 - 3. 5 and tanning completed without basification...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{shortage}} of fossil fuels the use of lignin as a renewable resource is of great global importance. In this work two representative spent liquors from the two dominant processes in the paper and pulp industry were examined. First sum parameters (e. g. content of lignin and carbohydrates) and inorganic components of the liquors were analyzed. Because of large amounts of inorganic compounds in sulfate spent liquor and high sugar content in sulfite spent liquor lignin degradation products were isolated by well-known methods. The development of analytical methods was performed by lignin model compounds. In addition to commercially available monomeric substances several dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric compounds with lignin typical linkages were synthesized. Due to {{the large number of}} lignin degradation products in spent liquors a GCxGC-(TOF) MS method was developed. With this method monomeric and dimeric lignin model compounds can be analyzed. Even after derivatization trimeric and tetrameric substance cannot be recognized. The optimized method was applied to the examination of the isolated lignin degradation products. It was confirmed that spent liquors are complex mixtures of many compounds which even cannot be separated by comprehensive gas chromatography. So a fractionation of the degradation products via a successive soxhlet-extraction method using different solvents became necessary. After the fractionation some monomers were identified by GCxGC-(TOF) -MS. Afterwards a liquid chromatography method for the identification of high molecular compounds was developed. The developed and optimized HPLC-method shows signals in the DAD-chromatogram. With a mass spectrometric detection no signals were available. Therefore a mass spectrometric analysis method with direct injection using model substances was developed and transferred to the real samples. The mass spectrometric method enables a qualification of many substances. Using a high-resolution mass spectrometer it is possible to determine the molecular formula by detecting masses with a precision of ± 0. 02 Da. According to the molecular formula double-bound-equivalents were calculated. In particular MS/MS experiments could obtain information about the number of methoxygroups and the presence of ß-O- 4 ´-linkages and sulfonic acid groups. According to this method several proposals for the structures of 35 monomers in isolated lignosulphonates were evaluated. Eleven monomeric structures include sulfonic acid groups. Additionally eight C-C-linked dimers were identified. Furthermore masses of trimers, tetramers and pentamers were detected. In kraft lignin, isolated from the <b>sulphate</b> <b>liquor,</b> 27 monomers and 21 dimers were identified. In addition, high molecular weight substances with masses up to 680 Da were determined in this liquor. MS/MS experiments have shown that there are no ß-O- 4 '- linkages in the identified compounds. Up to now the masses of detected trimers, tetramers and pentamers were only postulated in literature. So these exact masses were discovered for the first time. Various determined substances, for example long-chain aromatic structures or condensation products, do not originate from wood and can only be formed during the pulping process. All identified substances have a uniform basic structure. Therefore the use of the uniform lignin degradation products seems reasonable. For example unification could be performed by hydrogenation. The received substances could serve as renewable raw materials for other chemical products...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} paper is focused on the development of a purification process of red mud <b>sulphate</b> leach <b>liquor</b> for the recovery of titanium oxide (TiO 2) nano-powders in the form of anatase. Initially, titanium was extracted over iron and aluminium from the leach liquor by solvent extraction using Cyanex 272 in toluene, at pH: 0. 3 and T: 25 degrees C, with 40 % extractant concentration. Stripping of the loaded, with titanium, organic phase was carried out by diluted HCl (3 mol/L) at ambient temperature. Finally, the recovery of titanium nano-powder, in the form of anatase, was performed by chemical precipitation at pH: 6 and T: 95 degrees C, using 10 wt% MgO pulp as neutralizing agent. The produced precipitates were characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and thermogravimetric/differential thermal analysis (TGA/DTA). Their morphological characteristics and microstructure were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). High grade titanium white precipitate, in the form of anatase, was obtained. Iron concentration in the precipitate did not exceed 0. 3 %, whereas no aluminium was detected. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} paper focused on the recovery of cobalt from mixed Co-Mn hydroxide precipitates (obtained from <b>sulphate</b> leach <b>liquors</b> of nickel oxide ore), using ammonia-ammonium carbonate leaching. The characterization of the initial mixed hydroxide precipitates, as well as the corresponding leached residue was carried out by X-ray Diffraction, TG-DTA and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Cobalt and manganese precipitation was based on the statistical design and analysis of experiments, {{in order to determine the}} main effects and interactions of the precipitation factors, which were the equilibrium pH and the temperature. Co and Mn were precipitated as hydroxides at pH = 10. 5 and T = 25 degrees C. using 5 M NaOH as a neutralizing agent, by 99. 9 % and 99. 5 %, respectively. The main mineralogical phases were, Mn 3 O 4 (Hausmannite), gamma-Mn 3 O 4 and CoMn 2 O 4, while Co(OH) (2) and Mn(OH) (2) (Pyrochroite) were also present as minor constituents. Cobalt and manganese separation was based on selective cobalt recovery by ammonia-ammonium carbonate leaching of the produced mixed hydroxide precipitate. The factors studied were the ammonia-ammonium carbonate concentration and the solid to liquid ratio. The cobalt recovery efficiency reached 93 %. Mn 3 O 4 (Hausmannite) was the main mineralogical phase of the leached residue, while MnCO 3 (Rhodochrosite) and Mn 2 O 3 were also present.

40|$|Purpose: Purpose of {{this paper}} is to present the {{possibilities}} of copper(II) recovery from the synthetic <b>sulphate</b> leach <b>liquor</b> containing cobalt(II), nickel(II) and manganese(II). Design/methodology/approach: The investigations have been undertaken in order to determine the influence of major parameters on the extraction process of copper(II) from the leach liquor of polymetallic manganese nodules. Copper(II) ions were extracted with Kelex 100 and LIX 70 in kerosene. The effect of different parameters such as pH of aqueous phase, extractants concentration in the organic phase, concentration of sulphuric acid as the stripping reagent were investigated. Findings: The optimal conditions of metal ions selectivity extraction have been determined. Over 99 % of Cu(II) can be effectively extracted with 5 % Kelex 100 and 10 % LIX 70 at pH of 2. 0 from model leach liquor in the presence of Co(II), Ni(II) and Mn(II), while less than 10 % of the other metals is transported to the organic phase. The selectivity of Cu(II) extraction over Co(II), Ni(II) and Mn(II) with Kelex 100 depended upon the acidity of aqueous solution and the selectivity increased with decreasing of pH in the feed solution. Separation of Cu(II) from these metal ions is very effective. Cu(II) can be recovered successfully from the loaded organic phase with Kelex 100 through stripping with 2. 0 M H 2 SO 4. Practical implications: The results can be used during the hydrometallurgical recovery of metals from nodules on the industrial scale. Originality/value: The study on the solvent extraction of Cu(II) using LIX 70 and Kelex 100 from leach liquor of polymetallic manganese nodules has not been reported yet.

40|$|Black liquor {{evaporation}} is {{an essential}} unit operation in the chemical recovery cycle of a pulp mill. The high concentrations of sodium carbonate and sodium <b>sulphate</b> in black <b>liquor</b> cause crystallization fouling, or scaling, in the concentrator effect, which affects the operation negatively. The focus of this work was to evaluate the effect the content {{and size of the}} bulk crystals had on the scaling rate of the sodium salts. This was done experimentally by evaporating both pure sodium carbonate solution (to crystallize anhydrous sodium carbonate) and black liquor. It was found that bulk crystals were required to suppress rapid scaling during primary nucleation (when passing the metastable limit), which was tenfold higher than scaling during continuous crystallization under steady-state operation. The amount of bulk crystals did not, however, affect the scaling rate during continuous crystallization. It was also found that the scaling rate increased when the largest crystals were removed, in this case by a hydrocyclone. The results were similar for both sodium carbonate solutions and black liquor, although the latter had a finer crystal size and scale structure...|$|R
40|$|The Laboratory of Metallurgy of the National Technical University of Athens has {{developed}} and patented a novel integrated hydrometallurgical method, suitable to treat low-grade nickel oxide ores efficiently and economically. It involves heap leaching of the ore by dilute sulphuric acid at ambient temperature, purification of the leach liquor and recovery of nickel and cobalt by electrowinning. A typical {{composition of the}} pregnant solution produced from heap leaching is the following: Ni 2 + = 5 g/L, Co 2 + = 0. 3 g/L, Fe 3 + = 23. 0 g/L, Al 3 + = 6. 0 g/L, Cr 3 + = 1. 0 g/L, Mn 2 + = 1 g/L and Mg 2 + = 8 g/L. The proposed hydrometallurgical process for nickel recovery from real <b>sulphate</b> heap leach <b>liquors</b> consists of the following six (6) unit operations: (1) Removal of iron, aluminium and chromium, as easily filterable crystalline basic sulphate salts of the jarosite-alunite type, at atmospheric pressure, by chemical precipitation at pH: 3. 5 and 95 degrees C. (2) Cobalt, manganese and magnesium extraction over nickel by Cyanex 272 at pH: 5. 5, T: 40 degrees C, with 20 % extractant concentration and stripping of the loaded organic phase at T: 40 degrees C with diluted H 2 SO 4 (4 M). (3) Nickel concentration by solvent extraction using Cyanex 272 at pH: 7. 5, T: 40 degrees C, with 10 % extractant concentration and stripping of the loaded organic phase by nickel spent electrolyte (55. 45 g/L Ni) at T: 40 degrees C with diluted H 2 SO 4 (2 M). (4) Nickel electrowinning from sulphate solutions, using stainless steel as cathode and Pb- 8 %Sb as anode. The pH of the electrolyte (10 g/L H 3 BO 3, 75. 95 g/L Ni 2 + and 130 g/L Na 2 SO 4) was adjusted at 3. 5 and at 60 degrees C, while the current density was kept constant at 20 mA/cm(2).
