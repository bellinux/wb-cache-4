500|$|Clarkson {{continued}} feuding with Tedder in 2010. In December 2009, Tedder {{said that}} he was no longer angry over the accusations Clarkson made, but warned, [...] "fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. [...] I don't wanna get some crazy-ass backlash or get my head snapped off for writing a hit song." [...] He later told The Denver Post that he had gotten over the situation and is working on new material for Clarkson's fifth album. Clarkson, however, told the Daily Star that she is writing and recording new songs with new, low-profile producers. [...] "I don’t like working with people who have worked with everyone. Sometimes I get blackmailed into doing so by my label," [...] she said, [...] "but I prefer collaborating with people who aren't on the grid. I don’t want to sound exactly like other people's records." [...] In May, an unreleased electro-pop song by Clarkson called [...] "Wash, Rinse, Repeat" [...] was leaked on the Internet. The song contains auto tuned lyrics that Idolator say are likely written about Tedder: [...] "I can't take the pressure of new. Give me old, rip it off. / Let's see if it sticks to the wall again. / Does it <b>sound</b> <b>familiar?</b> Does it linger in your ear? / Like something you remember from just last year?" [...] and [...] "Music from the past, from the present, well, just last week / We will change a note and get away with it, wait and see." [...] Tedder {{said that he}} thinks the song was written about him, too, but admitted he likes the song. [...] "I think Kelly speaks her mind regardless of anything. She's great with lyrics, and I love that she is her own person. She's no puppet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Signaling in a four star {{review by}} HM Magazine, Nate Lake recognizes, [...] "From music to lyrics to album structure, Disciple's Attack backs up its already solid {{reputation}} with a quality set of powerful tracks that pushes the band's listeners to attack life {{in their own}} faith journeys." [...] Matt Conner, indicating in a three star review from CCM Magazine, realizes, [...] "unfortunately the new chemistry is a bit lacking. Attack is a straightforward rock release with hand's up anthems... and heartfelt anthems. <b>Sound</b> <b>familiar?</b> It should." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with her}} {{previous}} albums thematical prime focus on Afrodisiac is on [...] "relationship {{with love and}} life in general." [...] "It's about passion. It's romantic, and that's where I am in my life right now," [...] Norwood noted during promotion touring in 2004, {{a time when she}} was engaged to New York Knicks guard Quentin Richardson. [...] "I'm not trying to be edgy, sassy, romantic, vulnerable or whatever emotions come across," [...] she said. [...] "I really am all that." [...] Afrodisiac contains several references to Timbaland and longtime partner Missy Elliott, and alludes to fellow 1990s R singers such as Aaliyah and Monica. The album's opening track [...] "Who I Am" [...] discusses her rocky relationship with Robert Smith as well as the progression of her public image, while [...] "I Tried" [...] was heavily inspired by English rock band Coldplay, also incorporating lyrics of their 2000 song [...] "Sparks." [...] The tenth track [...] "Turn It Up" [...] is an homage to the early 1990s with references to Donnie Simpson's Video Soul, Kid n' Play, their 1990 film House Party and Tony! Toni! Toné!'s 1996 studio album House of Music. The line [...] "'Cause I don't wanna <b>sound</b> <b>familiar,</b> want a guaranteed single, not an album filler" [...] levels indirect criticism at former main producer Rodney Jerkins. On ending track [...] "Should I Go," [...] which samples Coldplay's [...] "Clocks," [...] Norwood openly talks about contemplating stepping away from the music business, admitting that she's {{trying to figure out where}} she fits in today.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was a deep}} voice, {{and foreign}} in tone; yet there was {{something}} in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it <b>sound</b> <b>familiar.</b> I turned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I had seen nobody on approaching the steps. Something stirred in the porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the side, and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. 'Who can it be?' I thought. 'Mr. Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no resemblance to his.' ...|$|E

I fared sumptuously on bread when flour was $200 a barrel and had beans for dinner every Sunday, when none but bloated aristocrats could afford such grandeur. But I finished by feeding batteries in a quartz mill at $15 a week, and wishing I was a battery myself and had somebody to feed me. My claims in Esmeralda are there yet. I suppose I could be persuaded to sell.|$|E
60|$|The loud rasping alarm- and angry-cry of the jay is a <b>sound</b> <b>familiar</b> {{to every}} one; the cry {{used by the}} bird to call his fellows {{together}} is somewhat different. It resembles the cry or call of the carrion crow, in localities where that bird is not persecuted, when, in the love season, he takes his stand {{on the top of}} the nesting-tree and calls with a prolonged, harsh, grating, and exceedingly powerful note, many times repeated. The jay's call has the same grating or grinding character, but is louder, sharper, more prolonged, and in a quiet atmosphere may be heard distinctly a mile away. The wood is in an uproar when the birds assemble and scream in concert while madly pursuing one another over the tall trees.|$|E

60|$|Baptiste {{was not in}} a {{humor to}} bear these merited reproaches, and he rejoined upon the aggrieved Nicklaus in a manner that would speedily have brought their ill-timed wrangle to an issue, had not Maso passed rudely between them, shoving them asunder with the sinews of a giant. This repulse served to keep the peace for the moment, but the wordy war {{continued}} with so much acrimony, and with so many unmeasured terms, that Adelheid and her maids, pale and terror-struck by the surrounding scene as they were, gladly shut their ears, to exclude epithets of such bitterness and menace that they curdled the blood. Maso passed on among the workmen, when he had interposed between the disputants. He gave his orders with perfect self-possession, though his understanding eye perceived that, instead of magnifying the danger, he had himself not fully anticipated its extent. The rolling of the waves was now incessant, and the quick, washing rush of the water, a <b>sound</b> <b>familiar</b> to the seaman, announced that they had become so large that their summits broke, sending their lighter foam ahead. There were symptoms, too, which proved that their situation was understood by those on the land. Lights were flashing along the strand near Vévey, and it was not difficult to detect, even at the distance at which they lay, the evidences of a strong feeling among the people of the town.|$|E
60|$|I now can but {{share with}} a friend my {{thoughts}} and my emotions, {{and there is a}} continual discovery of difference, but in those days, before I had found myself, we could share adventures. When friends plan and do together, their minds become one mind and the last secret disappears. I was useless at games. I cannot remember that I ever kicked a goal or made a run, but I was a mine of knowledge when I and the athlete and those two notoriously gentlemanly boys--theirs was the name that I remember without a face--set out for Richmond Park, for Coomb Wood or Twyford Abbey to look for butterflies and moths and beetles. Sometimes to-day I meet people at lunch or dinner whose address will <b>sound</b> <b>familiar</b> and I remember of a sudden how a game-keeper chased me from the plantation behind their house, and how I have turned over the cow-dung in their paddock in the search for some rare beetle believed to haunt the spot. The athlete was our watchman and our safety. He would suggest, should we meet a carriage on the drive, that we take off our hats and walk on as though about to pay a call. And once when we were sighted by a game-keeper at Coomb Wood, he persuaded the eldest of the brothers to pretend to be a school-master taking his boys for a walk, and the keeper, instead of swearing and threatening the law, was sad and argumentative. No matter how charming the place, (and there is a little stream in a hollow where Wimbledon Common flows into Coomb Wood that is pleasant in the memory,) I knew that those other boys saw something I did not see. I was a stranger there. There was something in their way of saying the names of places that made me feel this.|$|E
