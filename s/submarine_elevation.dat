The eastern pool rapidly deepens to more than 12,000 feet, and sends off to the north its comparatively shallow branches, the Adriatic and the Aegean Seas. The western pool is less deep, though it reaches some 10,000 feet. And, just as {{the western end of}} the eastern pool communicates by a shallow passage, not a sixth of its greatest depth, with the western pool, so the western pool is separated from the Atlantic by a ridge which runs between Capes Trafalgar and Spartel, on which there is hardly 1,000 feet of water. All the water of the Mediterranean which lies deeper than about 150 fathoms, therefore, is shut off from that of the Atlantic, and there is no communication between the cold layer of the Atlantic (below 1,000 fathoms) and the Mediterranean. Under these circumstances, what is the temperature of the Mediterranean? Everywhere below 600 feet it is about 55° Fahr.; and consequently, at its greatest depths, it is some 20° warmer than the corresponding depths of the Atlantic.|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{distribution}} of magnetic susceptibility and the gravel fraction in surface sediments in the Atlantic {{sector of the}} Southern Ocean were investigated to reconstruct source areas and recent transport pathways of magnetominerals and ice-rafted debris. Maxima of magnetic susceptibility were observed offshore from areas where mafic source rocks occur, e. g. Queen Maud Land and the northern Antarctic Peninsula. The glacigenic input of debris and subsequent redeposition of fine material by bottom and turbidity currents on the continental margins result in regional variations of the gravel and susceptibility values.

Above the Walters shoal this difference was 13. 2 mg/m** 3 and was not equal to zero for P < 0. 001. These results contradict previous ideas of biomass increase in benthic layers. The most likely cause of the observed impoverishment of plankton may be predominant consumption of living zooplankton component of seston by bottom and near-bottom predators.

40|$|In {{comparison}} to subaerial and planetary landscapes, submarine environments are rarely investigated using quantitative geomorphological techniques. Application of traditional geomorphometric techniques is hindered by the spatial variability in bathymetric data resolution and the extensive scale over which changes in topography occur. We propose a novel methodology for the improved quantitative analysis of <b>submarine</b> <b>elevation</b> data by adapting numerical techniques, developed for subaerial analyses, to submarine environments. The method integrates three main morphometric techniques: (1) morphometric attributes and their statistical analyses, (2) feature-based quantitative representation, and (3) automated topographic classification. These techniques allow useful morphological {{information to be}} extracted from a digital elevation model. Morphometric attributes and their statistical analyses provide summary information about an area, {{which can be used}} to calibrate computer-generated geomorphometric maps. In these maps the boundaries of geomorphological features are delineated, and they can thus be used as the basis for geomorphological interpretation. Ridge patterns and their morphological characteristics provide an accurate representation of specific aspects of terrain variability. Moment statistics are used as proxies of surface roughness to differentiate between surface types. Unsupervised classification, carried out using ridge characteristics and moment statistics, reliably segments the surface into units of homogeneous topography. A case study of debris flow lobes within the Storegga Slide shows that the techniques work robustly and that the new methodology integrating all the techniques can significantly enhance submarine geomorphological investigation...|$|E
40|$|Typical {{examples}} from different morphological and geological settings in the Antarctic Ocean are reviewed {{in order to}} discuss the value of clay mineral assemblages for reconstructing the glacial history of Antarctica, the paleoceanographic history of the Antarctic Ocean and the sedimentary processes at the Antarctic continental margin. The significance of clay minerals for paleoenvironmental reconstructions strongly varies with both the position of the sites under investigation and the age of the sediments. In late Mesozoic to Paleogene sediments clay mineral assemblages are sensitive tools for reconstructing climatic conditions. For example, the shift from smectite-dominated assemblages to illite- and chlorite-dominated assemblages in the earliest Oligocene clearly documents the transition from chemical weathering conditions under a warm and humid climate to physical weathering under cooler conditions. <b>Submarine</b> <b>elevations</b> such as Maud Rise and Kerguelen Plateau give the best record for direct paleoclimatic and paleoceanographic studies. At the proximal sites of the continental slope and shelf, {{as well as in the}} deep sea, the paleoclimatic information normally is masked by a variety of processes resulting in sediment redistribution. At those sites, in contrast, the clay mineral assemblages bear a wealth of information on different sedimentary processes. After the establishment of a continental East Antarctic ice sheet, physical weathering prevailed. Variations in the clay mineral records predominantly reflect the influence of different sediment sources resulting from different glacial, hydrographic or gravitational transport processes. Because these sedimentation processes are generally linked to climatic variations, the cla...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLarval {{shells of}} benthic marine {{bivalves}} occur frequently in plankton samples from temperate to tropical eastern North Atlantic waters. At many sites their abundance {{is higher than}} fifty specimens per cubic meter of surface water, thus outnumbering the other planktonic components with calcareous shells. Generally they are more frequent in nearshore water masses than far from land, {{but it could be}} shown that not only faunas on continental shelves, but also on oceanic inlands and on <b>submarine</b> <b>elevations,</b> produce larvae, which can be found far out in the ocean. Although it cannot be excluded that long-transported bivalve larvae have also been found in these samples, two arguments seem to assure that the bulk of these shells has been produced in the neighbouring shallow-water areas: decreasing abundance as well as increasing size of shells with increasing distance from the shallow-water area (this applies both to island and continental shelves). The bulk of bivalve shells is concentrated in surface waters. However, shells have also been found with decreasing abundance in water depths down to 600 m. The size distribution in the water column is qualitatively similar for water masses close to the coast and far from land; large shells occur in the upper 50 m, but average diameter decreases below this depth. However, far from land in water depths of 500 – 600 m they can reach sizes up to about 0. 5 mm in diameter (according to one specimen). Generally, shell sizes are larger in corresponding water depth levels far from than in those close to land. The occurrence of larval shells of bivalves throughout the eastern North Atlantic also has wide paleogeographic implications. Since no specific determinations of these bivalves have been tried, it is unknown in which water depths their parental generations occur. However, it can be assumed that eastern North Atlantic island shelves and peaks of submarine guyots and other subsurface elevations which reach to within a few hundred. meters of the surface, can be populated by faunas from eastern Atlantic continental margins being transported by off-shore currents far into the ocean. Since the islands and presumably guyots, etc. as well, produce pelagic larval assemblages from their own benthic molluscan faunas, it can easily be assumed that larval shells can be transported across the ocean by surface and subsurface currents...|$|R
40|$|Plankton pump {{samples and}} {{plankton}} tows (size fractions between 0. 04 mm and 1. 01 mm) {{from the eastern}} North Atlantic Ocean contain the following shell- and skeleton-producing planktonic and nektonic organisms, which can be fossilized in the sediments: diatoms, radiolarians, foraminifers, pteropods, heteropods, larvae of benthic gastropods and bivalves, ostracods, and fish. The abundance of these components has been mapped quantitatively in the eastern North Atlantic surface waters in October - December 1971. More ash (after ignition of the organic matter, consisting mostly of these components) per cubic meter of water is found close to land masses (continents and islands) and above shallow <b>submarine</b> <b>elevations</b> than in the open ocean. Preferred biotops of planktonic diatoms in the region described are temperate shallow water and tropical coastal upwelling areas. Radiolarians rarely occur close to the continent, but are abundant in pelagic warm water masses, even near islands. Foraminifers {{are similar to the}} radiolarians, rarer in the coastal water mass of the continent than in the open ocean or off oceanic islands. Their abundance is highest outside the upwelling area off NW Africa. Molluscs generally outnumber planktonic foraminifers, implying that the carbonate cycle of the ocean might be influenced considerably by these animals. The molluscs include heteropods, pteropods, and larvae of benthic bivalves and gastropods. Larvae of benthic molluscs occur more frequently close to continental and island margins and above submarine shoals (in this case mostly guyots) than in the open ocean. Their size increases, but they decrease in number with increasing distance from their area of origin. Ostracods and fish have only been found in small numbers concentrated off NW Africa. All of the above-mentioned components occur in higher abundances in the surface water than in subsurface waters. They are closely related to the hydrography of the sampled water masses (here defined through temperature measurements). Relatively warm water masses of the southeastern branches of the Gulf Stream system transport subtropical and southern temperate species to the Bay of Biscay, relatively cool water masses of the Portugal and Canary Currents carry transitional faunal elements along the NW African coast southwards to tropical regions. These mix in the northwest African upwelling area with tropical faunal elements which are generally assumed to live in the subsurface water masses and which probably have been transported northwards to this area by a subsurface counter current. The faunas typical for tropical surface water masses are not only reduced due to the tongue of cool water extending southwards along the coast, but they are also removed from the coastal zone by the upwelling subsurface water masses carrying their own shell and skeleton assemblages. Tropical water masses contain much more shelland skeleton-producing plankters than subtropical and temperate ones. The climatic conditions found at different latitudes control the development and intensity of a separate continental coastal water mass with its own plankton assemblages. Extent of this water mass and steepness of gradients between the pelagic and coastal environment limit the occurrence of pelagic plankton close to the continental coast. A similar water mass in only weakly developed off oceanic islands...|$|R

Such catastrophic episodes of destabilization can be voluminous and generate large tsunamis, which may cause considerable damage and thus represent extremely hazardous events. The Azores islands {{east of the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge are located on the Eurasia(Eu) /Nubia(Nu) plate boundary, and therefore subject to structural control and seismic activity (historical events of magnitude up to ca. 7). However, prior to MEGAHazards Project (PTDC/CTE-GIX/ 108149 / 2008, funded by FCT, Portugal), large-scale flank collapses in the Azores {{were considered to be}} lacking, mainly due to the small dimension of the volcanic edifices. Here, we conclude unequivocally on the occurrence of such events in the Azores. The present PhD thesis addresses the evolution of the Pico-Faial steep volcanic ridge, which sits on a major normal fault associated with the Eu/Nu diffuse boundary, focusing especially on the large-scale flank failures in Pico Island. Based on high-resolution sub-aerial and <b>submarine</b> Digital <b>Elevation</b> Models, new structural and stratigraphic data, and highresolution K-Ar dating on separated volcanic groundmass, we: (1) constrain the volcano stratigraphy of Pico; (2) reconstruct the major phases of growth and destruction in Pico and Faial islands in the last 200 kyr; (3) reconstruct the ca. 125 kyr evolution of the currently active large-scale slump in the SE of Pico Island; (4) provide new structural data/interpretations regarding the scarp that sharply cuts the S flank of Pico Stratovolcano; (5) report on the occurrence of large-scale failures in the N and S flanks of the Pico Island between ca. 125 and 70 ka, which generated large submarine debris deposits; and (6) propose that the role of the Pico-Faial ridge as a structure accommodating part of the extension on the diffuse Nu/Eu boundary has been consolidated in the last ca. 125 kyr. Many factors favouring the development of such large-scale flank instabilities have been proposed in the literature, but their exact role and mutual contribution remain poorly understood. We here present an analytical solution for the cohesive Coulomb Critical Wedge theory applied to gravitational instabilities, and associated analogue simulations to test some structural implications of the model. We investigate the impact of several variables on the stability of volcanic flanks, including: wedge slope and dimensions, cohesion, internal friction along the basal detachment, and fluid overpressure. We conclude that: (1) the steepening of the volcanic flanks and basal detachment lead to a decrease in the fluid overpressure ratio (fluid overpressure divided by lithostatic pressure) necessary to produce failure. (2) The decrease of the stabilizing effect of cohesion with increasing depth of the basal detachment favours the occurrence of deep-seated large-scale gravitational destabilization in basal detachments deeper than ca. 2000 - 2500 m (in volcanic edifices necessarily higher than 2500 m). For shallower basal detachments, the overpressure ratios required to induce failure are comparatively larger. For shallower basal detachments, steeper flanks and stronger edifice materials, shallow failure parallel to the edifice flank surface is favoured, instead of deep-seated deformation. (3) With increasingly deeper basal detachments (possible in larger volcanic edifices), while the impact of cohesion diminishes, the relative importance of basal internal friction for the stability of the edifice increases. The investigation of the occurrence of large-scale mass-wasting in the Azores islands, and the modelling of the variables controlling the stability of the volcanic edifices are only at their first steps and will be further developed in the future.
