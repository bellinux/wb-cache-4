These traditions precipitated new genres of literature in which prophetic supplications were gathered together in single volumes that were memorized and taught.

50|$|Oil price {{increases}} were partially fueled by reports that petroleum production is {{at or near}} full capacity. In June 2005, OPEC stated that they would 'struggle' to pump enough oil to meet pricing pressures {{for the fourth quarter}} of that year. From 2007 to 2008, the decline in the U.S. dollar against other <b>significant</b> <b>currencies</b> was also considered as a significant reason for the oil {{price increases}}, as the dollar lost approximately 14% of its value against the Euro from May 2007 to May 2008.|$|R

40|$|Currency gifts {{have proven}} to be a mixed blessing, as {{positive}} income shocks are often followed by financial problems and slow economic growth rates. Norway has twice been granted <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> gifts: Firstly, through Britain’s huge demand for merchant fleet services in the nineteenth century, secondly, by the exploration of petroleum reserves during the last decades.

Now, the contributors to this volume make a start on the important task of systematically exploring evil in the context of political theory. Intuitively, we know what evil means. Yet once we begin to think about its meaning we quickly uncover competing definitions. In recent years, political theorists have generally set the concept aside as outdated or inappropriate. Yet the idea that some things are wrong beyond toleration still has <b>significant</b> <b>currency.</b> If 'evil' can capture that significance, it merits a closer look...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{episodes of}} current account adjustment in individual economies. A central {{finding is that}} these episodes are very divergent and can be usefully classified, {{on the basis of}} cluster analysis, in three groups. A majority of cases is characterised by internal adjustment, exhibiting slowing domestic demand growth. In some cases, the adjustment was mainly external, facilitated by an exchange rate depreciation but without economic slowdown. Finally, some cases involved a crisis-like combination of a severe slowdown and a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation. Using a multinomial logit, we find that this classification of episodes helps improve the predictability of current account adjustment. external imbalances, current account adjustment, cluster analysis, multinomial logit...|$|R

40|$|The {{notions of}} {{inclusion}} and exclusion {{have a long}} tradition in sociology, but have gained <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> more recently in public policy analysis. However, a certain conceptual inflexibility arises when the distinction is applied to complex social situations. This article examines the main approaches to inclusion/exclusion in the sociological tradition, systems theory and the theory of new inequalities. On this basis, five interrelated situations of inclusion and exclusion are constructed: self-inclusion/self-exclusion, inclusion by risk/exclusion by danger, compensatory inclusion, inclusion in exclusion and sub-inclusion. They are illustrated with specific examples to refine an analytical approach to problems of inclusion and exclusion, {{with a view to}} contributing to sociological analysis and to assessing the consequences of public and private decisions...|$|R
50|$|Firstly, {{liability}} dollarization (see Domestic liability dollarization) is {{one main}} reason against floating exchange rate. It {{refers to the}} situations where liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies (usually denominated in US dollar) while assets are in the local currency. Consequently. liability dollarization is also used interchangeably with currency mismatch. Under this currency mismatch, an unexpected depreciation of local currency would deteriorate bank and corporation's balance sheets, and the shrink in asset relative to foreign currency debts would threaten {{the stability of the}} financial system in local country. In countries with <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> mismatches, the balance sheet effect is quite substantial, ignoring the high exchange rate volatility can prove to be very costly. This could provide an argument for sterilized foreign market intervention.|$|R

It benchmarks Africa's experience with that of the world using an augmented version of the gravity model and applying a comprehensive set of robustness checks. The empirical findings suggest that membership in a currency union should benefit Africa as much as it does the rest of the world. In addition, for both samples, we find evidence that (1) there is a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> union trade-generating effect; (2) currency unions are associated with trade creation and increased price comovements among member countries; and (3) the duration of currency union membership matters for trade: longer duration brings about greater benefits, and vice versa, however with some diminishing returns. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{collapse}} of the Bretton Woods Global International System in 1971, the world economy has experienced <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> volatility. The major economies of the world have addressed such volatility differently. The EU has chosen to follow a monetary union and introduced successfully a new currency. The U. S. has paid less attention to the fluctuations of the dollar and has pursued an independent monetary policy to promote national economic stability. Japan has seen its currency appreciate significantly.

2500|$|By September 2010, {{international}} tensions {{relating to}} imbalances had further increased. Brazil's finance minister Guido Mantega [...] declared that an [...] "international currency war" [...] has broken out, with countries competitively trying to devalue their currency {{so as to}} boost exports. Brazil {{has been one of}} the few major economies lacking a reserve currency to abstain from <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> intervention, with the real rising by 25% against the dollar since January 2009. Some economists such as Barry Eichengreen have argued that competitive devaluation may be a good thing as the net result will effectively be equivalent to expansionary global monetary policy. Others such as Martin Wolf saw risks of tensions further escalating and advocated that coordinated action for addressing imbalances should be agreed on at the November G20 summit.|$|R

The 'triple helix' model of economic development, which seeks to promote increased interaction across the government, business and higher education sectors, has gained <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> as an approach for improving the fortunes of lagging regions. This paper examines a lagging region in the shape of Wales in the UK, which has achieved significant political autonomy in recent years, and assesses how the higher education sector is taking a more prominent role in the regional development agenda. It is concluded that the burden being placed on universities to become the bases of commercialisable knowledge is too heavy, and that Wales should consider establishing a series of publicly-funded research institutes to complement the activities of the higher education sector...|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{currency}} denominated debt as {{an influence}} of exchange rate pressure during the 2008 global crisis is explored across 58 countries. Countries with higher ratios of foreign currency denominated debt to total international debt experienced <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> depreciation during the global crisis. Predicted values of foreign currency denominated indebtedness are obtained based on country characteristics by employing a double censored tobit model estimation technique. Comparison of actual to predicted values {{just prior to}} the crisis demonstrates whether or not countries are over-indebted. According to our analysis, over-indebted countries experienced higher rates of exchange rate depreciation in the global crisis of 2008. Additionally, oil exporters, countries with strong financial linkages with the US and net importers experienced significant depreciation. International reserve accumulation before the crisis is associated with currency appreciation during the crisis. However, this result is insignificantly estimated...|$|R

To reduce this divergence, the paper classifies episodes with similar characteristics in three groups, using cluster analysis. A {{majority of cases}} was characterised by internal adjustment through a slowdown of domestic demand and did not involve significant exchange rate movements. In some cases, the adjustment was mainly external, facilitated by a relatively modest exchange rate depreciation and without economic slowdown.

Our main conclusion is that, even though the problem {{has to be taken}} seriously, its order of magnitude should not be exaggerated. Only a few sectors are at significant risk: public debts of Greece and Portugal, financial sectors of Greece, Ireland and Luxembourg. In particular, the consequences for the non- financial private sector should be manageable.

Based on empirical findings from an African case study, this paper argues that other forms of contributions to regional development exist, which are neither from deliberate efforts nor steered by direct policies. This article proposes new forms of contributions termed „unintended contributions‟, in which universities become growth poles by virtue of being located in a particular region. Using the counterfactual and „export and import substitution‟ methods of analysis, this study shows the various ways in which a rural university in Cameroon has „contributed to regional development as a „growth pole‟.

40|$|We review {{some aspects}} of {{financial}} dollarization in Russia, applying the main relevant theories to analyze the dynamics of several dollarization indicators. An econometric model of the short run dynamics of deposit and loan dollarization is estimated for the last decade. We find that ruble appreciation was the main driver of the de-dollarization that occurred then and of the later episode of renewed dollarization. We estimate the overall (and sectoral) currency mismatches of the Russian economy. The results show a gradual improvement of the net foreign currency position of the public sector, where we have seen significant accumulation of international reserves by the Bank of Russia and repayment of government debt. Evidence is also presented for the <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> risk vulnerability of the nonbanking private sector.

In this paper we examine the direction of the currency exposure of firms in India over the period 1993 - 2008.

40|$|While the {{importance}} of currency movements to industry competitiveness is theoretically well established, {{there is little evidence}} that currency risk impacts US industries. Applying a conditional asset pricing model to 36 US industries, we find that all industries have a <b>significant</b> <b>currency</b> premium that adds about 2. 47 percentage points to the cost of equity and accounts for approximately 11. 7 % of total risk premium in absolute value. Cross-industry variation in the currency premium is explained by foreign income, industry competitiveness, leverage, liquidity, and other industry characteristics, while its time variation is explained by US aggregate foreign trade, monetary policy, growth opportunities, and other macro variables. The results indicate that methodological weakness, not hedging, explains the insignificant industry currency risk premium found in previous work, thus resolving the puzzle that currency risk premium is important at the aggregate stock market level, but not at the industry level.

40|$|World {{currency}} network constitutes one of {{the most}} complex structures that is associated with the contemporary civilization. On a way towards quantifying its characteristics we study the cross correlations in changes of the daily foreign exchange rates within the basket of 60 currencies in the period December 1998 [...] May 2005. Such a dynamics turns out to predominantly involve one outstanding eigenvalue of the correlation matrix. The magnitude of this eigenvalue depends however crucially on which currency is used as a base currency for the remaining ones.

This largest eigenvalue is seen to systematically decrease and thus the structure of correlations becomes more heterogeneous, when more <b>significant</b> <b>currencies</b> are used as reference.

Besides providing further insight into subtle nature of complexity, these observations point to a formal procedure that in general can be used for practical purposes of measuring the relative currencies significance on various time horizons. ...|$|R
