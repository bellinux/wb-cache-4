5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A <b>successful</b> <b>career</b> required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E

5|$|All three {{captured}} {{ships were}} taken into the Royal Navy.

Belleisle had a long and <b>successful</b> <b>career,</b> fighting at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 under Captain William Hargood.|$|E
