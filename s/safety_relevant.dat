50|$|Today, machines, {{plants and}} safety systems {{are stuck in}} a rigid scheme made up of {{hardware-based}} safety functions. The consequences of this are cost-intensive cabling and limited diagnostic options. The solution is the integration of <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> application data into the standard serial control protocol. OpenSAFETY allows both publish/subscriber and client/server communication. <b>Safety</b> <b>relevant</b> data is transmitted via an embedded data frame inside of standard communication messages. Measures to avoid any undetected failures due to systematic or stochastic errors {{are an integral part}} of a functional safety protocol. OpenSAFETY is in conformance with IEC 61508. The protocol fulfills the requirements of SIL 3. Error detection techniques have no impact on existing transport layers.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerning}} the <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> {{layout of the}} environment of a mercury based 5 -Megawatt-spallation target. All <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> aspects related to construction, operation and dismantling as well economical issues were taken into account. Safety concerns are basically driven by the toxic and radioactive inventory {{as well as the}} kind and intensity of radiation produced by the spallation process. Due to significant differences in inventory and radiation between a spallation source and a fission reactor, for the design of the spallation source mentioned above the safety philosophy of a fission reactor must not be used unchanged. Rather than this a systematic study of all safety related boundary conditions is necessary. Within this thesis all <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> boundary conditions for this specific type of machine are given. Beside the spatial distribution of different areas inside the target station, influence of medias to be used as well as arising radiation and handling requirements are discussed in detail. A general layout of the target station is presented, serving as a basis for all further component and system development. An enclosure concept for the target station was developed, taking into account the <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> issues concerning the mercury used as target materials, the water cooling loops containing massive amounts of tritium as well as the materials used for the moderators potentially forming explosive mixtures. Concept and detailed technical layout of the enclosure system was chosen to guarantee safe operation of the source as well as taking care of requirement arising for handling needs. For design of the shielding different suitable materials have been discussed. A design for assembling the shielding is shown taking into account the <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> equirements during operation as well as during dismantling. The neutron beam shutters, buried inside the shielding were designed to optimize handling and positioning issued of the inner part of the neutron guide system. Due to the high amount of <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> handling procedures, concepts for time efficient and safe handling of the major components have been developed. Based on the concepts shown is this thesis, construction an operation of a high power spallation source of the described kind seem to be feasible considering safety and costs...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the nuclear safety aspect this work points out the possibility of applying the Monte-Carlo simulation method to design a spallation neutron source in the energy regime up to 2. 5 GeV incident proton energy. A nuclear physics experiment carried out at the Juelich proton accelerator COSY provides the data to validate the commonly used program systems to calculate nuclear and <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> design parameters. The measurement of neutron multiplicity distributions allows a much more sensitive comparision between simulation and experiment, while former experiments have only measured the mean neutron multiplicity. The influence of several parameters in the codes was studied and optimized. The precision of the investigated codes is suited for the <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> design associated with neutron production caused by proton induced spallation reactions.

40|$|In modern railway Automatic Train Protection and Automatic Train Control systems, odometry is a <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> {{on-board}} subsystem which estimates the instantaneous speed and the travelled {{distance of the}} train; a high reliability of the odometry estimate is fundamental, since an error on the train position {{may lead to a}} potentially dangerous overestimation of the distance available for braking. To improve the odometry estimate accuracy, data fusion of different inputs coming from a redundant sensor layout may be used. Simplified two-dimensional models of railway vehicles have been usually used for Hardware in the Loop test rig testing of conventional odometry algorithms and of on-board <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> subsystems (like the Wheel Slide Protection braking system) in which the train speed is estimated from the measures of the wheel angular speed. Two-dimensional models are not suitable to develop solutions like the inertial type localisation algorithms (using 3 D accelerometers and 3 D gyroscopes) and the introduction of Global Positioning System (or similar) or the magnetometer. In order to test these algorithms correctly and increase odometry performances, a three-dimensional multibody model of a railway vehicle has been developed, using Matlab-Simulink™, including an efficient contact model which can simulate degraded adhesion conditions (the development and prototyping of odometry algorithms involve the simulation of realistic environmental conditions). In this paper, the authors show how a 3 D railway vehicle model, able to simulate the complex interactions arising between different {{on-board subsystem}}s, can be useful to evaluate the odometry algorithm and <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> to on-board subsystem performances...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the shielding of particle radiation from high current accelerators, spallation neutron sources and so called ADS-facilities (Accelerator Driven Systems). ADS-facilities {{are expected to}} gain importance {{in the future for}} transmutation of long-lived isotopes from fission reactors as well as for energy production. In this paper physical properties of the radiation as well as <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> requirements and corresponding shielding concepts will be discussed. New concepts for the layout and design of such shielding will be presented. Focal point of this work will be the fundamental difference between conventional fission reactor shielding and the <b>safety</b> <b>relevant</b> issues of shielding from high-energy radiation. Key point of this paper is the safety assessment of shielding issues of high current accelerators, spallation targets and ADS-blanket systems as well as neutron scattering instruments at spallation neutron sources. <b>Safety</b> <b>relevant</b> shielding requirements will be presented and discussed. For the layout and design of the shielding for spallation sources computer base calculations methods are used. A discussion and comparison of the most important methods like semi-empirical, deterministic and stochastic codes will be presented. Another key point within the presented paper is the discussion of shielding materials and their shielding efficiency concerning different types of radiation. The use of recycling material, as a cost efficient solution, will be discussed. Based on the conducted analysis, flowcharts for a systematic layout and design of adequate shielding for targets and accelerators have been developed and will be discussed in this paper.
