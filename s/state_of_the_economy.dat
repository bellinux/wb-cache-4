5|$|In {{the wake}} of the High Court ruling, and with the {{appropriation}} bills due to be considered by the Senate on 16 October, Fraser was undecided whether to block supply. His biographer, Philip Ayres, contends that, had there been no further government scandals, he would not have done so. Khemlani, however, had alleged - contrary to government statements - that Connor had never revoked his authority to obtain loans and had been in regular contact with him even into mid-1975. On 13 October, the Melbourne Herald printed documents in support of Khemlani's allegations, and on the following day, Connor resigned. Fraser determined to block supply, convened a shadow cabinet meeting and received the unanimous support of the Coalition frontbench. At a press conference, Fraser cited the poor <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and the continuing scandals as reasons for his decision. Without the passage of fresh appropriations, supply would be exhausted on 30 November.|$|E

However, the Ottoman {{economic}} crisis of 1875 and the additional financial burden of the disastrous Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) deprived the Ottoman Empire from the financial resources and economic independence to maintain and modernize a large fleet. The {{second half of the}} 19th century was a period of breakthroughs in the field of naval engineering.

25|$|Despite his strategy, Giuliani did {{compete to}} a {{substantial}} extent in the January 8, 2008 New Hampshire primary, but finished a distant fourth with 9percent of the vote. Similar poor results continued in other early contests, as Giuliani's staff went without pay {{in order to}} focus all efforts on the crucial late January Florida Republican primary. The shift of the electorate's focus from national security to the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> also hurt Giuliani, as did the resurgence of McCain's similarly themed campaign. On January 29, 2008, Giuliani finished a distant third in the Florida result with 15percent of the vote, trailing McCain and Romney. Facing declining polls and lost leads in the upcoming large Super Tuesday states, including that of his home New York, Giuliani withdrew from the race on January 30, endorsing McCain.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, it was {{announced}} that civil service salaries had lagged behind those in the private sector and required revision. MPs' salaries were therefore increased in phases. In 2007, the monthly allowance was revised to $13,200, raising the annual sum to $158,400. A gross domestic product (GDP) bonus payable to civil servants was also extended to MPs to link their annual remuneration to the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> They would receive no bonus if GDP growth was 2% or less, one month's bonus if the GDP grew at 5%, and up to two months' bonus if the GDP growth reached or exceeded 8%. MPs' allowances to engage legislative and secretarial assistants were also increased from $1,000 to $1,300 and from $350 to $500 respectively. With effect from January 2008, each MP received another increase of his or her allowance package to $13,710 a month, bringing it to $225,000 per year. Subsequently, in 2012, MP's allowances were reduced to $192,500 per annum.|$|E

It was quickly {{becoming one of the}} most prosperous countries in the world but was hit hard by a major financial crisis. The crisis resulted in the greatest migration from Iceland since 1887, with a net emigration of 5,000 people in 2009. Iceland's economy stabilised under the government of Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir, and grew by 1.6% in 2012. Many Icelanders, however, have remained unhappy with the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> and government austerity policies. The centre-right Independence Party was returned to power in coalition with the Progressive Party in the 2013 elections. In the following years, Iceland saw a surge in tourism as the country became a popular holiday destination. In 2016, Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned after being implicated in the Panama Papers scandal. Early elections in 2016 resulted in a right-wing coalition government of the Independence Party, the Reform Party and Bright Future.|$|E

500|$|Relations with Spain {{during the}} 19th century were {{generally}} amicable. Regular British soldiers {{were forbidden to}} cross the border but officers could cross freely into Spain, as could the inhabitants of Gibraltar, some of whom had second houses in the town of San Roque about [...] away. The garrison introduced the very British activity of fox hunting {{in the form of the}} Royal Calpe Hunt, started in 1812, which saw British officers and local Spanish gentry pursuing foxes across the Campo de Gibraltar. A major bone of contention during this period was the issue of smuggling across the border. The problem arose after Spain imposed tariffs on foreign manufactured goods in a bid to protect Spain's own fledgling industrial enterprises. Tobacco was also heavily taxed, providing one of the government's principal sources of revenue. The inevitable result was that Gibraltar, where cheap tobacco and goods were readily available, became a centre of intensive smuggling activity. The depressed <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> caused smuggling to become a mainstay of Gibraltar's trade; the mid-19th-century Irish traveller Martin Haverty described Gibraltar as [...] "the grand smuggling depot for Spain".

40|$|This paper {{employed}} eleven data series which {{consist of}} stocks, bonds, bills, equity premiums, term premiums, and various default premiums {{to investigate whether}} January seasonality reported in existing literature is robust across different <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> as this has important trading implications. For the periods 1926 - 1990, small stocks, small stock premiums, low grade bonds, and default premiums (spread between high grade, low grade and government bonds) reveal January seasonality and that the seasonality is robust across different <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> except for low grade bond returns and default premiums. January seasonality for low grade bond returns and low grade bond default premiums are primarily driven by results found during periods of economic expansion. Overall, January seasonality is more evident during the economic expansion periods although <b>the</b> magnitude <b>of</b> default premiums is larger during periods of economic contraction. Furthermore, prior findings of strong summer equity returns are primarily driven by the results found during <b>the</b> periods <b>of</b> economic contraction. It is also found that equity returns are generally higher during periods of economic expansion. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1997. ...|$|R
