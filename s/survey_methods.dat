5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative <b>survey</b> <b>methods</b> also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{survey is}} the most common method of {{monitoring}} giraffe population trends in the vast roadless tracts of African landscapes, but aerial methods are known to undercount giraffes. Ground-based <b>survey</b> <b>methods</b> are more accurate and should be used in conjunction with aerial surveys to make accurate estimates of population sizes and trends. In 2010, giraffes were assessed as Least Concern from a conservation perspective by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), but the 2016 assessment categorized giraffes as Vulnerable. Giraffes have been extirpated from much of their historic range including Eritrea, Guinea, Mauritania and Senegal. They may also have disappeared from Angola, Mali, and Nigeria, but have been introduced to Rwanda and Swaziland. Two subspecies, the West African giraffe and the Rothschild giraffe, have been classified as Endangered, as wild populations of each of them number in the hundreds. In 1997, Jonathan Kingdon suggested that the Nubian giraffe was the most threatened of all giraffes; , it may number fewer than 250, although this estimate is uncertain. Private game reserves have contributed to the preservation of giraffe populations in southern Africa. Giraffe Manor is a popular hotel in Nairobi that also serves as sanctuary for Rothschild's giraffes. The giraffe is a protected species in most of its range. It is the national animal of Tanzania, and is protected by law. Unauthorised killing can result in imprisonment. In 1999, it was estimated that over 140,000 giraffes existed in the wild, estimations as of 2016 indicate that there are approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild, down from 155,000 in 1985, with around 1,144 in captivity.|$|E

25|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} (PS) data {{is often}} confused with other conditions due {{to differences in}} definitions, <b>survey</b> <b>methods</b> and whether or not occupational groups or general population are surveyed. This causes a lack of group harmony about the diagnosis and treatment of PS, affecting its epidemiology. In a study, 0.33% of 1293 patients with lower back pain cited an incident for PS. A separate study showed 6% of 750 patients with the same incidence. About 6% - 8% of lower back pain occurrences were attributed to PS, though other reports concluded about 5% - 36%. In a survey conducted on the general population, 12.2% - 27% included a lifetime occurrence of PS, while 2.2% - 19.5% showed an annual occurrence. However further studies show that the proportion of the sciatica, in terms of PS, is about 0.1% in orthopaedic practice. This is more common in women with a ratio of 3 to 1 and most likely due to the wider quadriceps femoris muscle angle in the os coxae. Between the years of 1991- 1994, PS was found to be 75% prevalent in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania; 20% in other American urban centers; and 5% in North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The common ages of occurrence happen between thirty and forty, and are scarcely found in patients younger than twenty; this has been known to affect all lifestyles.|$|E

40|$|Drought-sensitive bryophytes are {{especially}} vulnerable to edge effects caused by forest fragmentation. Because of increased forest fragmentation, these bryophyte species are declining and {{are in need of}} conservation. Considering that a field survey including all bryophyte species is very time consuming, methods that make identification less difficult should be tested for their usefulness in conservation. This paper describes an alternative <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> that utilizes the correlation between bryophyte life-forms and microclimates for evaluating drought-sensitive bryophytes. This <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> was examined using epiphytic bryophyte flora on tree trunks in 27 fragmented forests of Kyoto city, {{in the western part of}} Japan. The usefulness of life-forms for this evaluation was discussed based on the correlation of life-forms with species richness and microclimates. The results indicated that, while life-from richness was considered to reflect the heterogeneity of moisture availability and light intensity in bryophyte habitats, a certain life-form category (for example, fans and dendroids) seemed to correlate with drought sensitivity of bryophytes. Considering this correlation, an alternative <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> was proposed that utilizes the richness of hygrophilous life-forms. This <b>survey</b> <b>method</b> seems to be more cost-effective than a traditional all-species survey, and provides an important step toward the conservation of drought-sensitive species...|$|R
2500|$|Functionalist systems theorists such as Niklas Luhmann {{remained}} dominant {{forces in}} sociology {{up to the}} end of the century. In 1994, Robert K. Merton won the National Medal of Science for his contributions to the sociology of science. The positivist tradition is popular to this day, particularly in the United States. The discipline's two most widely cited American journals, the American Journal of Sociology and the American Sociological Review, primarily publish research in the positivist tradition, with ASR exhibiting greater diversity (the British Journal of Sociology, on the other hand, publishes primarily non-positivist articles). [...] The twentieth century saw improvements to the quantitative methodologies employed in sociology.
