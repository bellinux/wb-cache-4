The bark is beaten on all sides, and twisted off of the wood. The blowing end is closed off with a stopper made from the wood, with one side cut off. At the place where the <b>stopper</b> <b>ends,</b> a whistle hole is cut into the bark, and one end of the hole is bent {{slightly}} inwards. Three to six finger holes are cut in the pipe.

The blowing hole, whistle hole and finger holes are made {{in the same way as}} for the bark pipes. Lamzdeliai are usually tuned to a diatonic major scale. The timbre is soft and breathy, but when the instrument is blown too strongly, the sound becomes sharp and shrill.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{existence}} of <b>stoppers</b> on the <b>ends</b> of the rotaxanes units, polyrotaxanes are more thermodynamically stable than polypseudorotaxanes (similar structure to polyrotaxane but without <b>stoppers</b> at two <b>ends).</b> Also, if the interactions between guest and host molecules are attractive, such as hydrogen bonding or charge transfer, they have better stabilities than those without attractive interactions. However, specific salts, changes of pH condition or temperature that can disturb or interrupt the interactions between ring-ring, ring-backbone, or backbone-backbone will destroy the structural integrity of polyrotaxanes. For example, dimethylformamide or dimethyl sulfoxide is able to interrupt the hydrogen bonding between CDs in the CDs-based polyrotaxanes. Also, change of pH or high temperature can also destroy the crystalline domains. Some chemical bonds between stoppers and chains are not stable in acidic or basic solution. As the stoppers cut from the chain, the rings will dethread from the axles, which leads to the dissociation of the polyrotaxanes.|$|R

40|$|We {{have applied}} a fluids density {{functional}} theory {{based on that}} of Yu and Wu [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 7094 (2002) ] to treat reversible supramolecular polymers near a hard surface. This approach combines a hard-sphere fluids density functional theory with the first-order thermodynamic perturbation theory of Wertheim. The supramolecular polymers are represented in the theory by hard-spheres with two associating sites. We explore {{the effects of the}} bonding scheme, monomer concentration, and association energy upon the equilibrium chain sizes and the depletion lengths. This study is performed on simple systems containing two-site monomers and binary mixtures of two-site monomers combined with <b>end</b> <b>stopper</b> monomers which have only a single association site. Our model has correct behavior in the dilute and overlap regimes and the bulk results can be easily connected to simpler random-flight models. We find that there is a nonmonotonic behavior of the depletion length of the polymers as a function of concentration and that this depletion length can be controlled through the concentration of <b>end</b> <b>stoppers.</b> These results are applicable to the study of colloidal dispersions in supramolecular polymer solutions.

5000|$|If {{the rings}} and axes are {{biodegradable}} and biocompatible, the polyrotaxanes {{can also be}} used for biomedical application, such as gene/drug delivery. The advantage of polyrotaxanes over other biomedical polymers, such as polysaccharides, is that because the interlocked structures are maintained by bulky <b>stoppers</b> at the <b>ends</b> of the strings, if the bulky stoppers are removed, such as removed by a chemical stimulus, rings dethread from the axes. The drastic structural change can be used for programmed drug or gene delivery, in which the drug or gene can be released with the rings when the stoppers are cut off at the specific destination.|$|R
50|$|For example, an {{enhanced}} gene delivery vehicle {{can be obtained}} by using a polyrotaxane formed by rings, backbones, then stoppers that linked by a disulfide bond (or other chemical bond that can be selected cleave in the body). The cation-funcitionalized polyrotaxanes can bind with pDNA to form complex through the electronstatic interaction. Glutathione(GSH) (or other corresponding chemicals that can cleave the sensitive chemical bond) is over-expressed in the target cells. When the polyrotaxane/plasmid DNA (pDNA) complexes are uptaken by the target cells, intercellular GSH could cleave the disulfide bond to cut off the <b>stoppers</b> at the <b>end</b> of polyrotaxanes, which results in the dissociation of the polyrotaxanes. As the rings dethread from the chain, pDNA is release with the ring molecules.|$|R

5000|$|Rope {{splicing}} in ropework is {{the forming}} of a semi-permanent joint between two ropes or {{two parts of}} the same rope by partly untwisting and then interweaving their strands. Splices can be used to form a <b>stopper</b> at the <b>end</b> of a line, to form a loop or an eye in a rope, or for joining two ropes together. Splices are preferred to knotted rope, since while a knot typically reduces the strength by 20-40%, a splice is capable of attaining a rope's full strength. However, splicing usually results in a thickening of the line and, if subsequently removed, leaves a distortion of the rope. Most types of splices are used on 3-strand rope, but some can be done on 12-strand or greater single-braided rope, as well as most double braids.While a spliced 3-strand rope's strands are interwoven to create the splice, a braided rope's splice is constructed by simply pulling the rope into its jacket.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} design, synthesis and characterization {{of a set}} of bis(pyridinium) ethane and dibenzo- 24 -crown- 8 based systems that form self-assembled monolayers on a gold substrate. Chapter 1 introduces the concept of interpenetrated and interlocked molecules, molecular machines and self-assembled monolayers with representative examples found in the literature. Chapter 2 provides an introduction to the various surface characterization techniques that were employed. In chapter 3, an interpenetrated system capable of forming self-assembled monolayers on a gold substrate is described. The chapter begins with the design and synthesis of the linker molecule. The recognition site was then synthesized, <b>stoppered</b> at one <b>end</b> with 3, 5 -lutidine and terminated at the other end with a thioacetate protected mercaptoundecanoic acid. SAMs were formed and characterized through RAIRS. While confirmation of SAM formation was acquired, evidence that the macrocycle was present could not be obtained. Chapter 4 describes the synthesis and characterization of slippage [2]rotaxanes. The rotaxanes were <b>stoppered</b> at one <b>end</b> with cyclohexyl isonicotinate and the other end with a 3, 5 -substituted phenyl ring. The kinetic and thermodynamics showed association constants strong enough to isolate the [2]rotaxanes with substituted DB 24 C 8 macrocycles. The synthesis was redesigned with diphenylmethyl as a protecting group since it is able to be removed without damaging the recognition site. SAMs, with and without the macrocycle, were formed and characterized using RAIRS, EIS, XPS, and contact angle measurements. The SAMs formed were seen to be loosely packed, even more so when the rotaxane was present. Attempts to remove the macrocycles after SAM formation were conducted. While this may have been successful, it was unclear due to intercalation of DMSO into the SAM. Chapter 5 describes attempts to improve the packing of the SAM by using a co-adsorbent. Mixed SAMs were formed with the slippage system, using mercaptoundecanoic acid as the co-adsorbate. The mixed SAMs were characterized at various ratios of the adsorbates. After determining the ideal ratios of each compound for the best packing of the SAM, further attempts at removal of the macrocycle were conducted using DMSO, however, intercalation of DMSO into the SAM was still an issue...|$|R

40|$|A {{strategy}} for creating foldameric oligorotaxanes composed of only positively charged components is reported. Threadlike components—namely oligoviologens—in which different numbers of 4, 4 ′-bipyridinium (BIPY^(2 +)) subunits are linked by p-xylylene bridges, are {{shown to be}} capable of being threaded by cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) (CBPQT^(4 +)) rings following the introduction of radical-pairing interactions under reducing conditions. UV/vis/NIR spectroscopic and electrochemical investigations suggest that the reduced oligopseudorotaxanes fold into highly ordered secondary structures {{as a result of the}} formation of BIPY•+ radical cation pairs. Furthermore, by installing bulky <b>stoppers</b> at each <b>end</b> of the oligopseudorotaxanes by means of Cu-free alkyne–azide cycloadditions, their analogous oligorotaxanes, which retain the same stoichiometries as their progenitors, can be prepared. Solution-state studies of the oligorotaxanes indicate that their mechanically interlocked structures lead to the enforced interactions between the dumbbell and ring components, allowing them to fold (contract) in their reduced states and unfold (expand) in their fully oxidized states as a result of Coulombic repulsions. This electrochemically controlled reversible folding and unfolding process, during which the oligorotaxanes experience length contractions and expansions, is reminiscent of the mechanisms of actuation associated with muscle fibers...|$|R
40|$|Oligoynes are archetypical {{molecular}} wires due {{to their}} 1 -D chain of conjugated carbon atoms and ability to transmit charge over long distances by coherent tunneling. However, {{the stability of the}} oligoyne can be an issue. Here we address this problem by two stabilization methods, namely sterically shielding endgroups, and rotaxination to produce an insulated molecular wire. We demonstrate the threading of a hexayne within a macrocycle to form a rotaxane and report measurements of the electrical conductance of this single supramolecular assembly within an STM break junction. The macrocycle is retained around the hexayne through the use of 3, 5 -diphenylpyridine <b>stoppers</b> at both <b>ends</b> of the molecular wire, which also serve as chemisorption contacts to the gold electrodes of the junction. Molecular conductance was measured for both the supramolecular assembly and also for the molecular wire {{in the absence of the}} macrocycle. The threaded macrocycle, which at room temperature is mobile along the length of the hexayne between the stoppers, has only a minimal impact on the conductance. However, the probability of molecular junction formation in a given break junction formation cycle is notably lower with the rotaxane. In seeking to understand the conductance behavior, the electronic properties of these molecular assemblies and the electrical behavior of the junctions have been investigated by using DFT-based computational methods...|$|R

The supramolecular architectures I was interested in are Rotaxanes, mechanically-interlocked architectures consisting of a "dumbbell shaped molecule", threaded through a "macrocycle" where the <b>stoppers</b> at the <b>end</b> of the dumbbell prevent disassociation of components and catenanes, two or more interlocked macrocycles which cannot be separated without breaking the covalent bonds.

Chapter 1 underlines the main concepts upon which supramolecular {{chemistry is}} based, clarifying the nature of supramolecular interactions and the principles of host-guest chemistry. In chapter 2 it is pointed out the use of ESR spectroscopy to investigate the properties of organic non-covalent assemblies in liquid solution by spin labels and spin probes.

Westinghouse initially did not put in a bid {{to power the}} Fair but agreed to be the contractor for a local Chicago company that put in a low bid of US$510,000 to supply an alternating current based system. Edison General Electric, which at the time was merging with the Thomson-Houston Electric Company to form General Electric, put in a US$1,720,000 bid to power the Fair and its planned 93,000 incandescent lamps with direct current. After the Fair committee went over both proposals, Edison General Electric re-bid their costs at $554,000 but Westinghouse under bid them by 70 cents per lamp to get the contract. Westinghouse could not use the Edison incandescent lamp since the patent belonged to General Electric and they had successfully sued to stop use of all patent infringing designs. Since Edison specified a sealed globe of glass in his design Westinghouse found a way to sidestep the Edison patent by quickly developing a lamp with a ground glass <b>stopper</b> in one <b>end,</b> based on a Sawyer-Man [...] "stopper" [...] lamp patent they already had.
