A numerical model predicts {{the performance of}} absorption cycle operating under transient conditions along with the entropy generation computation at assorted heat source temperatures, and it captures also the dynamic changes of lithium bromide solution properties such as concentration, density, vapor pressure and overall heat transfer coefficients.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a coarse-graining of high-dimensional potential energy landscapes basedupon persistences, which correspond to lowest barrier heights to lower-energy min-ima. Persistences {{can be calculated}} efficiently for local minima in kinetic transitionnetworks {{that are based on}} stationary points of the prevailing energy landscape. Thenetworks studied here represent peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, an atomic cluster,and a glassy <b>system.</b> <b>Minima</b> with high persistence values are likely to representsome form of alternative structural morphology, which, if appreciably populated atthe prevailing temperature, could compete with the global minimum (defined as in-finitely persistent). Threshold values on persistences (and in some cases equilibriumoccupation probabilities) have therefore been used in this work to select subsets ofminima, which were then analysed to see how well they can represent features ofthe full network. Simplified disconnectivity graphs showing only the selected minimacan convey the funnelling (including any multiple-funnel) characteristics of the corre-sponding full graphs. The effect of the choice of persistence threshold on the reduceddisconnectivity graphs was considered for a system with a hierarchical, glassy land-scape. Sets of persistent minima were also found to be useful in comparing networksfor the same system sampled under different conditions, using minimum orientedspanning forests...|$|E

40|$|The Minima Hopping global {{optimization}} method uses physically realizable {{molecular dynamics}} moves {{in combination with}} an energy feedback that guarantees the escape from any potential energy funnel. For the purpose of finding reactions pathways, we argue that Minima Hopping is particularly suitable as a guide through the potential energy landscape and as a generator for pairs of minima {{that can be used}} as input structures for methods capable of finding transition states between two minima. For Lennard-Jones benchmark systems we compared this Minima Hopping guided path search method to a known approach for the exploration of potential energy landscapes that is based on deterministic mode-following. Although we used a stabilized mode-following technique that reliably allows to follow distinct directions when escaping from a local minimum, we observed that Minima Hopping guided path search is far superior in finding lowest-barrier reaction pathways. We therefore suggest that Minima Hopping guided path search {{can be used as a}} simple and efficient way to identify energetically low-lying chemical reaction pathways. Finally we applied the Minima Hopping guided path search approach to 75 -atom and 102 -atom Lennard Jones systems. For the 75 -atom system we found pathways whose highest energies are significantly lower than the highest energy along the previously published lowest-barrier pathway. Furthermore, many of these pathways contain a smaller number of intermediate transition states than the previously publish lowest-barrier pathway. In case of the 102 -atom <b>system</b> <b>Minima</b> Hopping guided path search found a previously unknown and energetically low-lying funnel. Comment: 15 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
