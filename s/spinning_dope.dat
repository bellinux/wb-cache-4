Different organic solvents N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), and dimethylformamide (DMF) were used as solvents in the inner layer spinning dopes. The precipitation order of the two layers was estimated from the cloud point curves for the respective systems. The {{purpose of this paper}} was to give out a method to control the interface structure of the dual-layer asymmetric hollow fiber membranes. The experimental result shows that if the inner <b>spinning</b> <b>dope</b> demixes prior to the outer <b>spinning</b> <b>dope,</b> dense skin will form both on the outer surfaces of the two layers, while if the outer <b>spinning</b> <b>dope</b> demixes prior to the inner <b>spinning</b> <b>dope,</b> the dense skin on the outer surface of the outer layer will prevent the formation of the dense skin on the outer surface of the inner layer. The skin morphology investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) proves this result. The double dense skin structure of membranes increases the mass transfer resistance and decreases the gas permeance. (C) 2013 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved...|$|E

To increase purified gas recovery during the sorption step {{and to ensure}} consistent sorption capacity over repeated cycles, a dense, thin polymer barrier layer on the fiber sorbents is needed to allow only thermal interactions between the sorbate loaded layer and the thermal regeneration fluid.

Low permeability polymers were screened for sheath layer creation, with the core layer comprising cellulose acetate polymer as binder and zeolite NaY as sorbent fillers. Appropriate core and sheath layer dope compositions were determined by the cloud-point method and rheology measurements.

40|$|Dragline {{spider silk}} is nature’s strongest known fiber and, since it compares well with many {{synthetic}} fibers, it has {{great potential for}} use in a wide array of industrial and medical applications that range from surgical sutures to bulletproof vests. Spiders use specialized glands to produce as many as seven different types of silk, and they tailor them to diverse uses such as web construction, egg sacks, draglines, and cocoons. Dragline silk, which forms the scaffold of the spider’s web, is the strongest of all types and is even tougher than Kevlar. Composed of two different proteins, dragline silk is located inside spiders ’ silk glands in a liquid crystalline solution known as “spinning dope. ” This silk protein solution can be transformed to a thread through a series of steps, including protein molecule orientation, ion exchange, pH gradient, water removal, and drawing, all of which happen naturally in the spider’s spinneret. Despite having this knowledge, it has not been possible to make fabrics from spider silk simply because spiders can’t be “farmed ” and there is no other concentrated source for spinning. So if we want to make such fabrics, we need to duplicate spider silk in some other system. Development of machinery to do the spinning can be accomplished through engineering.

40|$|Orb-weaving spiders produce six {{different}} types of silks, each with unique mechanical properties. The mechanical properties {{of many of these}} silks, in particular the dragline silk, are of interest for various biomedical applications. Spider silk does not elicit an immune response, making it an ideal material for several applications in the medical field. However, spiders cannot be farmed for their silk as they are cannibalistic and territorial. The most reasonable alternative for producing spider silk fibers is to utilize genetic engineering to produce the proteins in a foreign host and then spin fibers from the synthetic protein. Spider silk-like proteins have been expressed in transgenic goats on a scale sufficient to spin synthetic fibers. To spin it, the protein is dissolved in a solvent to create a viscous <b>spin</b> <b>dope.</b> This <b>spin</b> <b>dope</b> is extruded into a coagulation bath where it forms a fiber. Fibers spun in this manner have poor mechanical properties and are water soluble, unlike natural spider silk. By applying a post-spin draw, the mechanical properties of the fibers improve and they are no longer water soluble. This increase occurs because β-sheets, important secondary structures, form and begin to align parallel to the fiber axis. In previous work, post-spin draw has been applied by hand to the fibers after initial spinning. This is not a viable method for the commercial production of synthetic spider silk.

40|$|La 1 -xSrx) (Zn 1 -yMny) AsO is a two {{dimensional}} diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor {{that has the}} advantage of decoupled charge and <b>spin</b> <b>doping.</b> The substitution of Sr 2 + for La 3 + and Mn 2 + for Zn 2 + into the parent semiconductor LaZnAsO introduces hole carriers and spins, respectively. This advantage enables us to investigate the influence of carrier doping on the ferromagnetic ordered state through the control of Sr concentrations in (La 1 -xSrx) (Zn 0. 9 Mn 0. 1) AsO. 10 % Sr doping results in a ferromagnetic ordering below TC ~ 30 K. Increasing Sr concentration up to 30 % heavily suppresses the Curie temperature and saturation moments. Neutron scattering measurements indicate that no structural transition occurs for (La 0. 9 Sr 0. 1) (Zn 0. 9 Mn 0. 1) AsO below 300 K. Comment: Submitted to EP...|$|R
40|$|International audienceN-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) {{hydrates}} are direct solvents for cellulose used commercially in {{the preparation}} of cellulose <b>spinning</b> <b>dopes</b> for fibre and film manufacturing. The fact that the cellulose/NMMO/water solutions can crystallise under cooling is important in the process of preparing fibres and films and in their structure formation. It is shown here that the major difference with classical polymer solutions is that the crystallisation of cellulose/NMMO/water solutions is only due to the crystallisation of the solvent, not of the cellulose. The reason for the decrease in crystallisation velocity with the increase in the cellulose concentration is the reduction in the crystallisable part of the solution. The concentration of water in solutions with the same cellulose content is found to strongly influence the crystallisation velocity and the morphology of crystallised solutions. The variation of the crystallisation velocity values with the type of cellulose can be explained by different amounts of free water bound to NMMO, that depend on the cellulose origin...|$|R
