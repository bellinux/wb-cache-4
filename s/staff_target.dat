25|$|In 1964, the Royal Air Force {{specified}} {{a requirement}} (Air <b>Staff</b> <b>Target</b> (AST) 362) {{for a new}} fast jet trainer to replace the Folland Gnat. The SEPECAT Jaguar was originally intended for this role, but it was soon realised {{that it would be}} too complex an aircraft for fast jet training and {{only a small number of}} two-seat versions were purchased. Accordingly, in 1968, Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) began studies for a simpler aircraft, initially as special project (SP) 117. The design team was led by Ralph Hooper.|$|E
25|$|This {{project was}} funded by the company as a private venture, in {{anticipation}} of possible RAF interest.

40|$|Abstract Background The Ministry of Health (MOH) in Zambia is {{currently}} operating {{with fewer than}} half of the health workers required to deliver basic health services. The MOH has developed a human resources for health (HRH) strategic plan to address the crisis through improved training, hiring, and retention. However, the projected success of each strategy or combination of strategies is unclear. Methods We developed a model to forecast the size of the public sector health workforce in Zambia {{over the next ten years}} to identify a combination of interventions that would expand the workforce to meet <b>staffing</b> <b>targets.</b> The key forecasting variables are training enrolment, graduation rates, public sector entry rates for graduates, and attrition of workforce staff. We model, using Excel (Office, Microsoft; 2007), the effects of changes in these variables on the projected number of doctors, clinical officers, nurses and midwives in the public sector workforce in 2018. Results With no changes to current training, hiring, and attrition conditions, the total number of doctors, clinical officers, nurses, and midwives will increase from 44 % to 59 % of the minimum necessary staff by 2018. No combination of changes in staff retention, graduation rates, and public sector entry rates of graduates by 2010, without including training expansion, is sufficient to meet <b>staffing</b> <b>targets</b> by 2018 for any cadre except midwives. Training enrolment needs to increase by a factor of between three and thirteen for doctors, three and four for clinical officers, two and three for nurses, and one and two for midwives by 2010 to reach <b>staffing</b> <b>targets</b> by 2018. Necessary enrolment increases can be held to a minimum if the rates of retention, graduation, and public sector entry increase to 100 % by 2010, but will need to increase if these rates remain at 2008 levels. Conclusions Meeting the minimum need for health workers in Zambia this decade will require an increase in health training school enrolment. Supplemental interventions targeting attrition, graduation and public sector entry rates can help close the gap. HRH modelling can help MOH policy makers determine the relative priority and level of investment needed to expand Zambia's workforce to <b>target</b> <b>staffing</b> levels. </p...|$|R
500|$|The Jaguar {{programme}} {{began in}} the early 1960s, in response to a British requirement (Air <b>Staff</b> <b>Target</b> 362) for an advanced supersonic jet trainer to replace the Folland Gnat T1 and Hawker Hunter T7, and a French requirement (ECAT or École de Combat et d'Appui Tactique, [...] "Tactical Combat Support Trainer") for a cheap, subsonic dual role trainer and light attack aircraft to replace the Fouga Magister, Lockheed T-33 and Dassault Mystère IV. In both countries several companies tendered designs: BAC, Hunting, Hawker Siddeley and Folland in Britain; Breguet, Potez, Sud-Aviation, Nord, and Dassault from France. A Memorandum of Understanding was signed in May 1965 for the two countries to develop two aircraft, a trainer based on the ECAT, and the larger AFVG (Anglo-French Variable Geometry).|$|E
50|$|These {{developments}} all {{suggested the}} TV-guided Martel {{was no longer}} competitive, {{and a series of}} studies during 1973 to 1975 came up with specifications for its replacement. This was known as Air <b>Staff</b> <b>Target</b> (AST) 1226 in the Air Force, and Naval <b>Staff</b> <b>Target</b> (NST) 6451. This called for a missile with greater range than Ship Martel, which required the switch to a jet engine. Hawker Siddeley submitted a design using the Marconi seeker and a more highly modified version of the Martel airframe. This would have the advantage of being able to be fired from any aircraft already able to fire the TV guided Martel.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{capacity}} for a hospital inpatient unit to provide high quality nursing care {{depends on a}} complex range of factors. Accurately identifying and measuring these factors {{is one of the}} challenges of nursing care quality research. Nursing hours per patient day and skill mix are two quantifiable indicators of capacity to provide nursing care. Aims: The aims of the study are to measure fortnightly, unit-level nurse staffing and compare them to <b>target</b> nurse <b>staffing</b> levels. Method: Nurse staffing and inpatient unit movement data were sourced for the administrative records of three Western Australian tertiary metropolitan hospitals (2004 – 2008). The impact of data source on nurse staffing estimates was tested with linear mixed models, adjusting for financial year. Counts, proportions, means, and standard deviations were used to describe nurse staffing data. Bar graphs depict proportion of nursing hours provided by nurses of different skill levels. Results: Data source did not significantly affect estimate of nursing hours per patient day (p = 0. 788). Fortnights during which nurse <b>staffing</b> <b>targets</b> were not reached were recorded for all units. Skill mix varied between units with different <b>staffing</b> <b>targets.</b> Conclusion: It is feasible to calculate fortnightly nursing hours and skill mix per hospital unit from raw nursing payroll and inpatient unit movement records. Fortnightly, unit-level measurement highlights nurse staffing fluctuations that are masked by annually aggregated data and are relevant for studies which investigate the association between nurse staffing levels and inpatient complication rates. Staffing shortfalls may affect nurses’ experiences of working or patients’ care experiences...|$|R
50|$|Tier one is {{primarily}} based on prevention. At this level, school wide positive behavioral expectations and procedures are taught. PBIS consists {{of rules and}} routines that are developed and taught by school personnel (e.g. principals, teachers, school psychologists, counselors, etc.) to prevent initial incidences of behaviors presented by student the school would like to change. For example, a school team may determine that disrespect for self and others are behaviors {{they would like to}} see eliminated within their school. As a result, school <b>staff</b> <b>targets</b> the behavior by positively reframing disrespectful behaviors to respectful behavior as their behavioral expectation for students. Positive framing such as 'Be respectful, Be resourceful, and Be responsible' are expectations that can be utilized to promote positive social behavior.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the MCTFS data, Deployment Staffing Reports (DSRs) are used to facilitate proper assignment of deployable Marines. DSRs are addressed in detail via message traffic to deploying units possessing a dedicated MCC. A year prior to the scheduled deployment, HQMC (MMEA) issues an implementation message. This message explains the DSRs, establishes <b>staffing</b> <b>targets,</b> sets [...] "lock-on," [...] identifies predicted entry-level school graduate arrivals, and directs submission of a monthly DSR to HQMC (MMEA-12). This report establishes a dialogue that ensures staffing of the unit by lock-on, a date when a unit has received full staffing with deployable Marines. Synchronized unit cohesion units receive staffing of their deployable Marines on a varied schedule (between 8-12 months prior to deployment) based on their fill window.|$|R
40|$|As the United States {{grows in}} diversity, health care {{providers}} are increasingly challenged to understand and address the linguistic and cultural needs of a diverse clientele. The Health Resources and Services Administration [HRSA] has had a long-standing and particular interest in cultural competence {{because so many of}} its grantees provide care to traditionally underserved populations that include culturally and linguistically diverse communities. The following is a useful definition of cultural and linguistic competence: Cultural and linguistic competence is a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes, and policies that come together in a system, agency, or among professionals that enables effective work in cross-cultural situations.
