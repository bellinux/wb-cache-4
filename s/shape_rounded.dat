25|$|The exact {{shape of}} the Irish tonsure is unclear from the early sources, {{although}} they agree that the hair was in some way shorn over the head from ear to ear.

This {{is said to have}} occurred in 1675 when Charles II of England introduced waistcoats.

Watch fobs began to be used, the name originating from the German word fuppe, a small pocket. Later in the 1800s Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. The watch was wound and also set by opening the back and fitting a key to a square arbor, and turning it.|$|E
50|$|Filaments usually {{longer than}} the anthers. Anthers are having four locules. The pollen sacs {{arranged}} mostly in two pairs above each other, all introrse. Lower pollen sacs are latrorse.The staminodes usually are absent. The tepals usually are deciduous. The Pistillo or gynoecium well developed to absent. Fruits on a light or markedly thickened pedicel, supported by a shallow or deep dome, simple margin. The flower have a flat to deeply cup-shaped receptacle.The fruit is a drupe of variable shape and size.e The most striking are its fruits, The fruit is an ellipsoid to ovoid drupe or berry, and the seed is a single kernel. Plum-like to olive-like drupe settled on a discoid small dome. With <b>shape</b> <b>rounded</b> or ovoid, brown to black, rarely green, purple, reddish, orange to pale yellow. The fruits are a very important food source for birds and other wildlife.

Most seeds pass through the bird's digestive system intact. Seed dispersal via ingestion by vertebrate animals, mostly birds and mammals, is the dispersal mechanism for most tree species.|$|E
50|$|Austrolestes colensonis is {{a member}} of the zygoptera family, which can be {{identified}} by their mobile head and robust multi-faceted compound eyes, short bristle-like antennae, an enlarged thorax supporting the flight muscles for two pairs of richly veined elongated membranous wings and the ten part segmentation of the abdomen. In terms of the species itself, Austrolestes colensonis is the largest damselfly in New Zealand, with an average length of 40 to 47 millimeters. The key identifying features of Austrolestes colensonis are the distinct blue markings on the males and green marking on females as well as the tendency for males to perch at right angles on the support plant. In contrast to the adults, the larvae are between 17 and 21 millimeters in length and characterised by a broad head with large eyes, cylindrical body <b>shape,</b> <b>rounded</b> tip on the tail gill with no hairs and three horizontal brown stripes. The larvae are quite active due to their ability to perform jumping movements and when disturbed the larvae swim very rapidly with the legs held close to the body towards the bottom sediments in which it burrows itself. Adult males can be distinguished by their widely separated blue eyes alongside a pale blue upper border on the mouthparts. The thorax has three blue stripes separated by black, which is the predominant colour of the Austrolestes colensonis. Along the abdomen each segment from two to seven has a blue anterior ring located on the margin between segments, the remainder of the abdomen is black except for a dorsal blue area on segment ten. Females have similar characteristics to the male with the exception of having a bright yellow-green colouration, a thicker abdomen and being clubbed distally.|$|E

40|$|The {{comparative}} morphology of {{the seeds}} of three Australian Citrus species, C. australasica C. inodora and C. garrawayi, was studied. Their seed characteristics were broadly {{similar to those of}} the cultivated species of the genus, when observed under light and scanning electron microscopy. Citrus garrawayi differed in seed <b>shape</b> (<b>rounded</b> to triangular) and seed coat morphology (i. e., thicker with longer epidermal protrusions) from C. australasica and C. inodora (rounded surface with flat underside in shape). The well-developed minute epidermal protrusions on the seed coat of C. garrawayi were more similar to those in the cultivated species, C. נsinensis and C. נaurantium. In contrast, the surface topography of C. australasica and C. inodora seeds was more like that of the cultivated species, C. נaurantifolia and C. נlimon. Seed morphology, especially surface topography, was found to be a useful tool for taxonomic identification in Australian wild citrus. Griffith Sciences, School of Natural SciencesNo Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{data show}} that the {{phenomenon}} of a separation induced leading edge vortex {{is influenced by the}} wing thickness and the shape of the leading edge. Both thickness and leading edge <b>shape</b> (<b>rounded</b> rather than point) delay the formation of a vortex. Existing computer programs used to predict the effect of a leading edge vortex do not include a procedure for determining whether or not a vortex actually exists. Studies under NASA Contract NAS 1 - 15678 have shown that the vortex development can be predicted by using the relationship between the leading edge suction coefficient and the parabolic nose drag. The linear theory FLEXSTAB was used to calculate the leading edge suction coefficient. This report describes the development of a method for calculating leading edge suction using the capabilities of the higher order panel methods (exact boundary conditions). For a two dimensional case, numerical methods were developed using the double strength and downwash distribution along the chord. A Gaussian quadrature formula that directly incorporates the logarithmic singularity in the downwash distribution, at all panel edges, was found to be the best method...|$|E

This {{electron microscope}} study demonstrates the fine {{structure of the}} trophozoite of Giardia muris in the lumen of the duodenum of the mouse as it appears after combined glutaraldehyde and acrolein fixation and osmium tetroxide postfixation. Giardia muris is of teardrop <b>shape,</b> <b>rounded</b> anteriorly, with a convex dorsal surface and a concave ventral one. The anterior two-thirds of the ventral surface is modified to form an adhesive disc. The adhesive disc is divided into 2 lobes whose medial surfaces form the median groove. The marginal grooves are the spaces between the lateral crests of the adhesive disc and a protruding portion of the peripheral cytoplasm. The organism has 2 nuclei, 1 dorsal to each lobe of the adhesive disc. Between the anterior poles of the nuclei, basal bodies give rise to 8 paired flagella. The median body, unique to Giardia, is situated between the posterior poles of the nuclei. The cytoplasm contains 300 -A granules that resemble particulate glycogen, 150 - to 200 -A granules that resemble ribosomes, and fusiform clefts. The dorsal portion of the cell periphery is occupied by a linear array of flattened vacuoles, some of which contain clusters of dense particles. The ventrolatera...|$|E

40|$|Background and aims: To {{analyze the}} pharmacognostic {{characteristics}} and physiochemical {{parameters of the}} leaves of Gomphrena serrata (G. serrata). Methods: Microscopic characters and powder analysis had been carried out {{with the help of}} a microscope. The physiochemical properties such as loss on drying, total ash value, acid insoluble ash value, water soluble ash value, extractive values and fluorescence of G. serrata had been performed. Results: Macroscopically, the leaves are simple, elliptical in <b>shape,</b> <b>rounded</b> or obtuse apex with an entire margin. Microscopically, the leaf showed the presence of epidermal cells with uniseriate multicellular covering trichomes and anomocytic stomata, followed by 1 - 2 layered collenchymatous cells and 10 - 15 numbered conjoint, collateral closed vascular bundles are some of the diagnostic characteristics observed from an anatomical study. Powder microscopy of leaf revealed the presence of uniseriate multicellular covering trichomes, lignified xylem vessels, epidermis with anomocytic stomata and parenchyma cells. The investigations also included leaf surface data i. e., quantitative leaf microscopy and fluorescence analysis. Physiochemical parameters such as loss on drying, extractive values and ash values were also determined. Preliminary phytochemical screening showed the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, steroids, carbohydrates, glycosides, amino acids and proteins. Conclusion: The morphological, microscopical and physicochemical parameter results provided in this paper may be utilized as a basis for the preparation of a monograph on G. serrata leaves...|$|E
40|$|When {{a mixture}} of two kinds of grains differing in size and shape is poured in a {{vertical}} two-dimensional cell, the mixture spontaneously stratifies in alternating layers of small and large grains, whenever the large grains are more faceted than the small grains. Otherwise, the mixture spontaneously segregates in {{different regions of the}} cell when the large grains are more rounded than the small grains. We address the question of the origin of the instability mechanism leading to stratification using a recently proposed set of equations for surface flow of granular mixtures. We show that the stable solution of the system is a segregation solution due to size (large grains tend to segregate downhill near the substrate and small grains tend to segregate uphill) and <b>shape</b> (<b>rounded</b> grains tend to segregate downhill and more faceted grains tend to segregate uphill). As a result, the segregation solution of the system is realized for mixtures of large-rounded grains and small-cubic grains with the large-rounded grains segregating {{near the bottom of the}} pile. Stability analysis reveals the instability mechanism driving the system to stratification as a competition between size-segregation and shape-segregation taking place for mixtures of large-cubic grains and small-rounded grains. The large-cubic grains tend to size-segregate at the bottom of the pile, while at the same time, they tend to shape-segregate near the pouring point. Thus, the segregation solution becomes unstable, and the system evolves spontaneously to stratification. Comment: 10 pages, 10 figures, [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The Bradypus variegatus inhabits {{the forests}} of South America and feeds from leaves, {{branches}} and sprouts from different plants. Due to its diet {{and the lack of}} literature on the morphological aspect of Xenarthras, five Bradypus variegatus tongues from animals which died from natural causes were evaluated, and they came from Pará State Museum Emílio Goeldi and were donated to the Laboratory of Animal Morphological Research (LaPMA) from UFRA, for revealing the different types of papillae and epithelial-connective tissue. Macroscopically, the tongues presented elongated <b>shape,</b> <b>rounded</b> apex, body, root, median sulcus in the root's apex, and two vallate papillae. The mucous membrane of the tongue revealed a keratinized stratified pavement epithelium, while the ventral surface of the tongue was thin and smooth, not provided with any type of papillae. However, the dorsal surface of the tongue was irregular with the presence of three types of papillae: filiform, fungiform and vallate papillae. The filiform papillae found were of a simple type, presenting a rounded base, irregularly distributed with a larger concentration and development on the tongue's apex and body. The fungiform papilla showed a practically smooth surface with irregular format, with the presence of gustatory pores; these were found all over the dorsal surface, with larger concentration at the rostral part of the apex. Only two vallate papillae were observed disposed in the root of the tongue, surrounded by a deep groove, and revealing several taste buds. The tongues from Bradypus variegatus presented gustatory papillae similar to the ones described for other Xenarthras species and wild mammals...|$|E

40|$|The {{fate of the}} {{follicular}} basal lamina during atresia {{was investigated}} using bovine follicles, in which different follicle phenotypes have been observed. These phenotypes include: healthy follicles with rounded basal granulosa cells with an aligned basal lamina or follicles with columnar basal granulosa cells with a basal lamina of many loops (loopy), and atretic follicles in which either the antral granulosa cells (antral atresia) or the basal cells (basal atresia) die first. Loopy lamina and basal atresia occur only in small antral follicles 3 ̆c 5 mm in diameter. Follicles were collected from cattle of unknown reproductive history and processed for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, and from animals in which follicle growth had been monitored by daily measurements of follicle diameter by ultrasonography. Electron microscopic observations of dominant follicles during the growth phase, plateau and regression showed that the basal lamina was still visible and intact upon atresia. These follicles had a conventional aligned basal lamina, which they retained, except for some degree of folding, as they progressed into antral atresia.

Laminin alpha 2 expression was found in both phenotypes of healthy follicles, antral and basal atretic follicles, and follicles with aligned or loopy basal laminae. It is concluded that the basal lamina is not degraded upon atresia, but does undergo a variety of other changes. HF Irving-Rodgers, ML Mussard, JE Kinder, and RJ Rodger...|$|E
