40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} volatility <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> preference <b>shocks</b> in an analytically tractable endogenous growth model with recursive preferences and stochastic volatility.

30|$|According to this view, {{there are}} several layers of {{interactions}} between <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> policies. In particular, Argentina’s trade policies are intimately connected to the external <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> the relative strength of the different political coalitions that emerge, given the country’s institutions. These interplay between <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> policy, depend in turn on how <b>shocks</b> <b>and</b> economic events are interpreted, and on people’s beliefs concerning the relevant policy elasticities. If professional economists seldom agree on the magnitude (and sign) of these forces, {{it is no wonder}} that policy reactions depend heavily on the narratives that political entrepreneurs provide.|$|R
