40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{the risk factors}} and source of infection leading to human infections with the Influenza A(H 7 N 9) virus in urban and rural areas. METHODS: We conducted a case-control investigation to identify potential exposures and risk factors. Controls {{were randomly selected from}} the same community as the cases using random digit dialing. We used exact conditional logistic regression to evaluate the exposures and risk factors, stratified by urban and rural residence. RESULTS: Buying live or freshly <b>slaughtered</b> <b>poultry</b> from a market was significantly associated with illness onset among both urban [48 % of 25 case-patients and 12 % of 125 control-persons, adjusted odds ratio (AOR)  = 19, 95 % CI: 2. 3 - 929] and rural (33 % of 18 case-patients and 8. 9 % of 90 control-persons, AOR = 13, 95 % CI: 1. 5 -∞) residents. In rural area, tending to home-raised poultry (56 % of 18 case-patients and 10 % of 90 control-persons, AOR = 57, 95 % CI: 7. 5 -∞) and existence of a poultry farm {{in the vicinity of the}} residence (28 % of 18 case-patients and 5. 6 % of 90 control-persons, AOR = 37, 95 % CI: 3. 8 -∞) were also significantly associated with disease onset.

40|$|Background and Aim: Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{digestive}} diseases in the world. Salmonellosis is caused by varieties of salmonella serotypes and there are concerns about the contamination of poultry and its products by this microorganism. Given that the carcasses of poultry, as a major source of infection with this microorganism, determine the frequency and the rate of this type of bacterial contamination, they are considered a criterion in the assessment of the health status of respective poultry farms and their potential health hazards to consumers. The present study aimed at determining prevalence of salmonella contamination of poultry carcasses in Birjand industrial slaughterhouses in 2012. Materials and Methods: Immediately after poultry slaughtering, 550 samples were randomly taken from different slaughterhouses. Salmonella spp were isolated from suspected positive cultures. Then, they were identified and confirmed by means of biochemical and serological tests. Results: Based on the results of bacteriological tests, out of a total of 250 samples taken from the poultry slaughtered before putting in boiling water, 8 cases (3. 2 %) were positive for Salmonella contamination. Serotyping results revealed that all isolates belonged to Salmonella infantis serotype. Among a total of 300 samples taken from the cases after being placed in boiling water, only one sample (0. 3 %) was positive for Salmonella infantis. Conclusion: The results indicate that there is a relatively low prevalence of salmonella contamination in the poultry farms in the South Khorasan. Furthermore, lack of diversity in salmonella isolates reveals good health control and low levels of microbial transmission into poultry farms of this area. The outbreak of Salmonella infantis is uniformly consistent with the global spread of this serotype. Differences in the frequency of positive samples before and after placing the carcasses in boiling water may reveal the role of boiling process in reducing salmonella contamination of <b>slaughtered</b> <b>poultry...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the results of {{different}} consumer surveys conducted between 2004 and 2006 with regard to consumers’ perceptions and reactions concerning AI in Vietnam, (mainly in Hanoi). The main results observed are as follows: A high proportion of consumers consider AI to be a food-related risk. However, over time,there has been a slight shift from a fear of consuming poultry to a fear of preparing it (slaughtering it). AI has {{had a profound effect on}} poultry consumption, even outside peak crisis times, more in terms of the quantity consumed (approximately a third less in 2006) than in terms of the number of consumers (6 % less). Blood and internal organs are considered particularly risky, while eggs are viewed as being safer. Poultry from industrial farms is considered to be more risky than poultry from small farms. Purchasing practices have also been affected by AI: in Hanoi, consumers declare that they prefer to buy poultry directly from producers that they know, or from supermarkets in the case of the wealthiest consumers. A high proportion still buy live poultry from market traders, but more consumers now ask sellers to slaughter it for them. With a view to lessening market shocks in the wake of the crisis while maintaining the priority of consumer safety, a number of measures should nevertheless be implemented: Risk communication should not over-emphasize AI as a food-related risk. Reliable safe distribution channels should be promoted (with reliable quality signs and controls) in order to encourage safe production and poultry consumption. Otherwise, a market recovery will only benefit supermarkets and large-scale farmers capable of supplying supermarkets. As numerous live birds are still slaughtered in urban market places, facilities should be provided for safe slaughter. At the same time, more attention should be paid to the provision of a real “cold chain” with a view to promoting the sale of <b>slaughtered</b> <b>poultry...</b>|$|E
40|$|After the {{implementation}} of new health inspection regulations in 2000 there was a precipitous decline {{of the number of}} slaughter plants in the United States. Particularly affected were small and very small slaughter plants. This loss of capacity is affecting local food supply chains and may limit local supply options. The empirical analysis in this thesis uses the spatial distribution of people and livestock to analyze the location choice decisions of existing and new meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> facilities. Utilizing a spatial probit estimator the model analyzes how location factors from the existing stock of USDA inspected meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> plants in 2007 are different from new USDA inspected plants established during the time period 2008 - 2010. This comparison provides an understanding of factors that affect the location decision of new USDA inspected plants. Empirical results reveal that slaughter plant location behavior is strongly affected by the location of existing firms, infrastructure, and agglomeration factors. Inspection type as well as input supplies also significantly influences the location choice of USDA inspected meat and poultry plants. The analysis further reveals that new USDA inspected meat and <b>poultry</b> <b>slaughter</b> plants increasingly tend to locate in the Northeast region, as compared to the North Central Region and other areas of the United States. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Live poultry {{exposure}} and risk behaviors are {{more prevalent in}} rural communities, increasing the risk of influenza A/H 5 N 1 infection. We examined the economic and socio-cultural influences on poultry-related practices by comparing the poultry-related practices among Vietnamese and Thai rural residents by family income and consumption preference. Methods: Stratified cluster sampling was performed to select households. Within each household, one adult was randomly selected for a face-to-face interview in five Vietnamese and five Thai rural districts. Using a standardized questionnaire to assess domestic poultry husbandry, live poultry purchase, and demographics, logistic regression enabled comparisons of behaviors related to live poultry {{exposure and}} examination of associated factors. Results: Among 994 Vietnamese and 907 Thai rural residents, live poultry exposure (prevalence of raising poultry, improper handling of sick or dead poultry, touching live poultry before buying, and <b>slaughtering</b> <b>poultry</b> at home) was more prevalent among Vietnamese than Thai respondents. After adjusting for other demographics, respondents with higher family incomes {{were less likely to}} rear backyard poultry in both Vietnam and Thailand, and with more likely to buy live poultry in Vietnam, but not in Thailand. Consumption preference for live poultry was associated with being more likely to rear backyard poultry in Vietnam and Thailand, and with being more likely to buy live poultry in Thailand, but not in Vietnam. Conclusion: The findings suggest important roles of economic imperatives and cultural preference for live poultry for consumption in supporting poultry rearing and live poultry purchase among rural residents. © 2014 Liao et al. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
