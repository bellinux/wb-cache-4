40|$|Stock price {{prediction}} {{is an important}} and challenging problem in stock market analysis. Existing prediction methods either exploit autocorrelation of stock price and its correlation with the supply and demand of stock, or explore predictive indictors exogenous to stock market. In this paper, using transaction record of <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> identifier of <b>traders,</b> we introduce an index to characterize market confidence, i. e., {{the ratio of the}} number of traders who is active in two successive trading days to the number of active traders in a certain trading day. Strong Granger causality is found between the index of market confidence and stock price. We further predict stock price by incorporating the index of market confidence into a neural network based on time series of stock price. Experimental results on 50 stocks in two Chinese Stock Exchanges demonstrate that the accuracy of stock price {{prediction is}} significantly improved by the inclusion of the market confidence index. This study sheds light on using cross-day trading behavior to characterize market confidence and to predict stock price...|$|R
50|$|For example, {{a trader}} is long 10 calls struck at $90.00 on IBM stock, and {{five minutes before}} the close of trading, IBM's stock price is $89.75. These calls {{are out of the}} money and {{therefore}} will expire worthless at this price. However, two minutes before the close of trading, IBM's price suddenly moves to $90.26. These options are now in the money, and the trader will now want to exercise them. However, to do so, the trader should first sell 1000 shares of IBM at $90.26. This is done so that the trader will be flat IBM stock after expiration. Thirty seconds before the close, IBM drops back to $89.95. The calls are now out of the money, and the trader must quickly buy back the <b>stock.</b> Option <b>traders</b> <b>with</b> a broad portfolio of options can be very busy on Expiration Friday.|$|R

40|$|Using a {{database}} of more than 1. 85 million retail investor transactions over 1991 - 1996, we show that these trades are systematically correlated-that is, individuals buy (or sell) stocks in concert. Moreover, consistent <b>with</b> noise <b>trader</b> models, we find that systematic retail trading explains return comovements for <b>stocks</b> <b>with</b> high retail concentration (i. e., small-cap, value, lower institutional ownership, and lower-priced stocks), especially if these stocks are also costly to arbitrage. Macroeconomic news and analyst earnings forecast revisions do not explain these results. Collectively, our findings support a role for investor sentiment {{in the formation of}} returns.

This phenomenon cannot be explained by exposure to aggregate volatility risk.
