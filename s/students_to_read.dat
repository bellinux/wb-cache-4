25|$|Reinvented by the McCoys, {{the program}} was {{organized}} around experimentation in the studio, with minimal structure or assignments – {{a return to the}} Art Academy's original method. There were no deadlines, papers, or finals, other than the expectation of new work in weekly critiques and semester-end self-evaluations and extended bibliographies. A final degree project and thesis were required in the last semester. The McCoys required <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> deeply about the history and theory behind the design concerns on which they were focusing. Each student was encouraged to develop their own design voice and vision, through a mix of studio experiments and client projects, sometimes on grant-funded projects with the McCoys. Students sometimes had the opportunity to work directly with Katherine McCoy, and this became the counterbalance for the experimental studio work. The process that Katherine and Michael McCoy brought to the program initiated change in many aspects. It transformed the design program itself and the studios, along with its critiques, centered on the possibility of breaking from the norms of everyday design practice. Although the McCoy's program was sometimes thought to be controversial, their tenure at Cranbrook resulted in the graduation and success of many known designers, including Lorraine Wild, Edward Fella, Nancy Skolos and Tom Wedell, P. Scott Makela, Andrew Blauvelt, Lucille Tenazas, Meredith Davis and Patrick Whitney. After McCoy left Cranbrook in 1995, she held several other teaching positions. Her most well-known position with the Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute of Design, from 1995–2003, and the Royal College of Art in London.|$|E
