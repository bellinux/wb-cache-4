5|$|By 1938, over 400 {{contraceptive}} manufacturers were in business, over 600 {{brands of}} female contraceptives were available, and industry revenues exceeded $250million per year. Condoms {{were sold in}} vending machines in some public restrooms, and men spent twice as much on condoms as on shaving.Tone, p. 136. Although condoms had become commonplace in the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued to push for development of a contraceptive that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led to the birth control pill decades later. To increase the availability of high-quality contraceptives, birth control advocates established the Holland–Rantos company to manufacture contraceptives– primarily diaphragms, which were Sanger's recommended method. By the 1930s, the diaphragm with <b>spermicidal</b> jelly had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception; in 1938, female contraceptives accounted for 85 percent of annual contraceptive sales.|$|E
5|$|The {{thrust of}} Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty {{in order to}} cover up the bribery case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a tubal ligation, thus having no reason to use the <b>spermicidal</b> contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} done to assess the {{performance}} of specially prepared professional nurses {{in the provision of}} family planning services at Shatby Maternity Hospital. A special family planning record was designed for their use and implemented for six months. The data accumulated were then analyzed. The results of the study were to a great extent encouraging. During the six months, these nurses provided services for 425 clients, 86. 4 % of whom received some kind of contraceptive on their first visit. The nurses inserted IUDs for 60. 9 % of clients, prescribed oral contraceptives for 11. 3 %, fitted diaphragms for 8 % and dispensed <b>spermicidals</b> and condoms for 4. 5 %. Also, seven clients (1. 7 %) were referred for tubal ligation. Papanicolaou smears for 357 women and wet smears for 309 women were analyzed. Nurses also contributed to decreasing the workload on doctors because they were able to care for 69. 7 % of the clients alone with no need for medical consultation. The study also showed that nurses were successful in motivating women to use contraceptives, to shift some to a more suitable method and to make follow up visits. When different contraceptives were prescribed by nurses, the incidence of complications or complaints was found to be within reasonable limits for all.

25|$|Dr. Clarence Gamble, an American physician, {{established}} {{a network of}} birth control clinics in Puerto Rico {{during the period of}} 1936 to 1939. He believed that Puerto Rican women and the women from other American colonies, did not have the mental capacity and were too poor to understand and use diaphragms for birth control as the women in the United States mainland. He inaugurated a program funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, which would replace the use of diaphragms with foam powders, cremes and <b>spermicidal</b> jellies. He did not know that in the past Rosa Gonzalez had publicly battled with prominent physicians and named her and Carmen Rivera de Alvarez, another nurse who was a Puerto Rican independence advocate, to take charge of the insular birth control program. However, the insular program lacked funding and failed.|$|E

2500|$|Opposition to condoms did {{not only}} come from moralists: {{by the late}} 19th century many feminists {{expressed}} distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and <b>spermicidal</b> douches. [...] Despite social and legal opposition, {{at the end of}} the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method. Two surveys conducted in New York in 1890 and 1900 found that 45% of the women surveyed were using condoms to prevent pregnancy. [...] A survey in Boston just prior to World War I concluded that three million condoms were sold in that city every year.|$|E

50|$|Healthy vaginal pH is {{typically}} quite acidic, with a pH value of around 4. However, the alkaline pH of semen can neutralize vaginal pH.

50|$|Up to the 1960s, a {{great deal}} of energy went into {{building}} up the organisation, which in its heyday ran over 60 birth control clinics in The Netherlands. Much work in those early years was put into improving the quality and availability of contraceptives (condom, diaphragm and <b>spermicidal</b> jelly). In 1966 the society reached a membership of 220,000. Contraceptives were officially legalized in 1970, after which membership began to fall. In 2002, the number was about 1500 and late 2008 about 700.|$|E
5000|$|Dr. Jim Whitley, a math {{professor}} and {{assistant to the}} Principal, helped spearhead a student project in 1971 called the Birth Control and Abortion Information and Referral Centre, which was also staffed by full-time coordinators.

[...] The Centre moved to the Grey House at 51 Bader Lane in 1975 and established a lending library. The name was again changed to the shorter “Birth Control Centre” in 1983. [...] The Centre began selling sexual health products at cost {{with the introduction of}} <b>spermicidal</b> foam and condom wallets in the late 1980s. [...] This selection expanded by 1991 to include <b>spermicidal</b> jelly and sponges. [...] In 1995, the Centre was again renamed as the “(Not Just the) Birth Control Centre” in recognition of its growing mandate, which was again promptly changed to the Sexual Health Resource Centre, which it remains today. [...] In 2004, theSHRC began receiving direct funding from Queen’s University undergraduate students through the establishment of a mandatory $0.85 CAD fee per student. [...] The fee withstood a challenge that it discriminated against students on the basis of religion that same year.|$|E
50|$|An {{inverted}} Red Triangle is {{the symbol}} for family planning health and contraception services, {{much as the}} red cross is a symbol for medical services.
