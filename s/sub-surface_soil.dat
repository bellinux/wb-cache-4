The percent of the four mercury species in soils are 85. 77 %, 12. 44 %, 0. 93 % and 0. 86 %, respectively. The total concentrations and each species of mercury in soils show positive relationship with the concentration of sands, and negative relationship with the concentration of clays in soils.

40|$|This applied study {{investigates the}} {{capability}} of field and airborne hyperspectral remote sensing to detect the spectral and spatial characteristics of <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soil</b> disturbance from associated overlying subtle canopy scale vegetation stress features. A 9 km stretch of buried gas pipeline, in Aberdeenshire, {{was used as a}} real world case study. Hyperspectral techniques, in particular derivative analysis, have a number of advantages over existing broadband approaches under operational conditions, reducing changes in illumination or background reflectance and aiding in suppressing the continuum caused by other leaf biochemicals. Various peaks in red-edge derivative spectra are also well correlated with plant pigment concentrations thus being able to detect more subtle stress features than conventional broadband reflectance approaches. The capability of these hyperspectral techniques to detect a generic stress response to gas induced soil oxygen depletion, which could also result from soil compaction and water logging due to <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soil</b> disturbance, has shown great potential under controlled conditions. However, their transferability to heterogeneous, canopy scale, field conditions for operational applications has not been published yet. This thesis aims to develop a rigorous method for spatially intensive field spectroradiometry acquisition to identify the full spatial and spectral (VIS-NIR) characteristics of subtle, canopy scale, surface vegetation stress features that maybe indicative of <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soil</b> disturbance to inform operational sensor specifications. In order to achieve this aim field spectroscopy data of barley, wheat, oilseed rape and grassland were acquired at selected transects perpendicular to a buried gas pipeline. The application of derivative analysis, vegetation band ratios and in particular the Smith et al (2004) 725 : 702 nm ratio, Lagrangian red-edge and continuum removal are evaluated to identify the optimal hyperspectral analytical technique for detecting vegetation stress associated <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soil</b> disturbance under operational conditions. Moreover, the ability of operational airborne hyperspectral sensors to detect the same stress features in the field data is investigated through field spectroradiometry data simulating sensor spectral Gaussian point spread functions and acquired CASI- 2 imagery of the study area. First derivative analysis coupled with the 723 : 700 and 725 : 702 nm ratios was the most effective hyperspectral approach for detecting vegetation stress associated with pipeline soil disturbance. The 725 : 702 nm ratio of Smith et at. (2004) and a 723 : 700 nm ratio performed consistently well detecting stress for all sites over two consecutive field seasons under different cropping regimes, barley being particularly stress sensitive. The ratios exhibited a parabolic trend of decreasing ratio values with proximity to the pipeline, whilst being insensitive to soil background effects, intimating their transferability to heterogeneous field conditions. Field spectroradiometry data simulating the default channel settings for CASI- 2, AVIRIS and programmable 725 : 702 and 723 : 700 nm wavelengths for CASI- 2, AVIRIS and Eagle hyperspectral airborne sensors revealed that channel centre wavelength positions influenced the sensors ability to detect stress. The CASI- 2 713 : 703 and 743 : 703 nm default channels were able to distinguish vegetation stress associated with pipeline earthworks to the same degree as the 725 : 702 and 723 : 700 nm wavelengths. Under operational conditions the CASI- 2 743 : 703 nm ratio was also capable of detecting barley field stress identified by the original field spectra 723 : 700 and 725 : 702 nm ratios.

Ten male adults of D. zarudnyi were collected from Riyadh during AprilâMay 2011. To study the sperm tail at the ultrastructural level the testes were fixed in 3 % glutaraldehyde, than post fixed in 1 % osmium tetaroxide followed by dehydration in ethanol grades; samples were cleared in propylene oxide and embedded in resin. Tail formation begins by the moving of centrioles and mitochondria towards the posterior pole of sperm head.

40|$|Nitrate {{contamination}} of groundwater arises from anthropogenic activities, such as, fertilizer and animal manure applications and infiltration of wastewater/leachates. During migration of wastewater and leachates, the vadose zone (zone residing above the groundwater table), {{is considered to}} facilitate microbial denitrification. Particle voids in vadose zone are deficient in dissolved oxygen as the voids are partially filled by water and the remainder by air. Discontinuities in liquid phase would also restrict oxygen diffusion and therefore facilitate denitrification in the vadose/unsaturated soil zone. The degree of saturation of soil specimen (S (r)) quantifies the relative volume of voids filled with air and water. Unsaturated specimens have S (r) values ranging between 0 and 100 %. Earlier studies from naturally occurring nitrate losses in groundwater aquifers in Mulbagal town, Kolar District, Karnataka, showed that the <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soils</b> composed of residually derived sandy soil; hence, natural sand was chosen in the laboratory denitrification experiments. With a view to understand the role of vadose zone in denitrification process, experiments are performed with unsaturated sand specimens (S (r) = 73 - 90 %) whose pore water was spiked with nitrate and ethanol solutions. Experimental results revealed 73 % S (r) specimen facilitates nitrate reduction to 45 mg/L in relatively short durations of 5. 5 - 7. 5 h using the available natural organic matter (0. 41 % on mass basis of sand); consequently, ethanol addition did not impact rate of denitrification.

40|$|Collapsible {{soils are}} weak soils {{that appear to}} be stable in their natural state, {{normally}} dry condition, but rapidly deform under saturation (wetting), thus generating large and unexpected settlements which often yield disastrous consequences for structures unwittingly built on such deposits. In this study, a prediction model for the relative subsidence of stressed collapsible soils based on dielectric permittivity measurement is presented. Unlike most existing methods for soil subsidence prediction, this model does not require moisture content as an input parameter, thus providing the opportunity to obtain accurate estimation of the relative subsidence of collapsible soils using dielectric measurement only. The prediction model is developed based on an existing relative subsidence prediction model (which is dependent on soil moisture condition) and an advanced theoretical frequency and temperature-dependent electromagnetic mixing equation (which effectively removes the moisture content dependence of the original relative subsidence prediction model). For large scale <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soil</b> exploration purposes, the spatial <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soil</b> dielectric data over wide areas and high depths of weak (collapsible) soil deposits can be obtained using non-destructive high frequency electromagnetic (HF-EM) measurement techniques such as ground penetrating radar (GPR). For laboratory or small scale in-situ measurements, techniques such as an open-ended coaxial line with widely applicable time domain reflectometry (TDR) or vector network analysers (VNAs) are usually employed to obtain the soil dielectric data. By using soil dielectric data obtained from small or large scale non-destructive HF-EM investigations, the new model can effectively predict the relative subsidence of weak soils without the need to extract samples for moisture content measurement. Some of the resulting benefits are the preservation of the undisturbed nature of the soil as well as a reduction in the investigation costs and analysis time in the identification of weak (problematic) soils. The accuracy of prediction of the presented model is assessed by conducting relative subsidence tests on a collapsible soil at various initial soil conditions and a good match between the model prediction and experimental results is obtained...|$|E

These results contradict assumptions thatÂ underpin Indonesian catchment management policies. The geospatial, interview andÂ field methods applied in this study were effective in identifying, mapping andÂ quantifying sub-surface sediment sources, and can readily be applied generally inÂ areas where data are few and technical capacity and financial resources are low...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Kaolin was {{modified}} by propionamide {{in the present}} study. XRD analysis with X-ray diffractometer of Rigaku Corporation, infrared analysis with a Nicolet MagnaâIR 750 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscope and {{the analysis of the}} TG and DTA curve with Composite Thermal Ana-lyzer were carried out. A Plant Growth Chamber was used to study the water-retaining property of modified kaolin. The results demonstrated that the microstructure of modified kaolin was flaky. Using the modified kaolin in arid regions the <b>sub-surface</b> moisture of <b>soil</b> can be maintained effectively, and the seedling survival rate increases obviously...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} quantitatively {{evaluates the}} water retention capacity and flood control {{function of the}} forest catchments by using hydrological data of the large flood events which happened after the serious droughts. The objective sites are the Oodo Dam and the Sameura Dam catchments in Japan. The kinematic wave model, which considers saturated and unsaturated <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soil</b> zones, {{is used for the}} rainfall-runoff analysis. The result shows that possible storage volume of the Oodo Dam catchment is 162. 26 MCM in 2005, while that of Samerua is 102. 83 MCM in 2005 and 102. 64 MCM in 2007. Flood control function of the Oodo Dam catchment is 173 mm in water depth in 2005, while the Sameura Dam catchment 114 mm in 2005 and 126 mm in 2007. This indicates that the Oodo Dam catchment has more than twice as big water capacity as its capacity (78. 4 mm), while the Sameura Dam catchment has about one-fifth of the its storage capacity (693 mm) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Liquefaction {{and related}} {{phenomena}} {{have been responsible}} for tremendous amounts of damage in historical earthquakes around the world, especially in the cities built on young alluvial deposits. Delhi, the second most populated city of India {{is also one of the}} favorable sites for earthquake amplification with liquefiable younger alluvium. According to Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS 1893, Part 1 : 2002), Delhi falls in the high damage risk zone and can feel destruction up to MSK VIII (or MSK- 64; Medvedev-Sponheuer-Karnik Scale). Though the city has a number of high rise buildings, it still continues to construct the high rise buildings and other mega structure, especially in the north campus area of the Delhi University. The present study is an attempt to evaluate the liquefiable subsurface soil in part of Delhi University North Campus. This study revealed that the average depth of liquefiable <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soil</b> in the study area is more than 8 meters. The study concluded that the area is highly susceptible to earthquake liquefaction and required appropriate mitigation to reduce the risk...|$|E
40|$|Though much {{research}} has been conducted regarding traction of tires in soft granular terrain, little empirical data exist on the motion of soil particles beneath a tire. A novel experimentation and analysis technique has been developed to enable investigation of terramechanics fundamentals in great detail. This technique, the Shear Interface Imaging Analysis Tool, provides visualization and analysis capability of soil motion at and below the wheel-soil interface. The method places a wheel (or other traction device) in granular soil up against a transparent sidewall. While driving or towing the tire, images are taken of the <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soil,</b> and are processed with optical flow software. Analysis of the resulting displacement field identifies clusters of soil motion and shear interfaces. Complexities in soil flow patterns greatly affect soil structure below the wheel and the resulting tractive capability. The Shear Interface Imaging Analysis Tool visualizes and helps analyze these complexities in richer detail than possible before, and allows for {{a deeper understanding of the}} physics behind wheel-terrain interaction. Results are presented for rigid wheels at various slip conditions, and various wheel configurations such as diameter, grouser spacing and compliance...|$|E
40|$|Hydrocarbon {{contamination}} of soil from accidental spills and negligence represents {{a major cause}} of sub-surface contamination. There are numerous physical, chemical and biological techniques available for contaminant remediation. However, many of these methods can be difficult to implement at sites where access to soils, or delivery of treatments, requires substantial excavation works and disruption (for example where contamination is located beneath or adjacent to building structures and underground services). An innovative technology that may provide a solution for the remediation of subsurface contamination without causing interim damage is that of electrokinetic remediation. Electrokinetic remediation is the application of a low voltage, direct current (of the order of mA/cm 2) between electrodes placed in a contaminated soil system. The production of an electric field causes a number of electrically-induced processes to occur that can promote soil remediation, principally: electromigration, electroosmosis, electrophoresis, and electrolysis. This study examined the use of electrokinetics coupled with biodegradation to remediate kerosene and transformer oil from <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soils.</b> The principal investigations carried out within this study included: the use of electroosmosis as an in situ flushing technique; use of electrokinetics to deliver surfactants into the soil to promote mobilisation of contaminants within the sub-surface; and the use of electrokinetics to create optimum conditions for biodegradation by the delivery of nutrients and electron acceptors, the removal of toxic metabolites, and by controlling the pH and moisture content of the soil. As {{an integral part of the}} research, a field trial was designed and set up to determine whether electrokinetics could be used to promote the biodegradation of transformer oil from the subsurface. This was one of the first field trials in the UK for the electrokinetic remediation of hydrocarbon contaminants. The results of the study support the use of electrokinetics as a field tool for the enhancement of remediation in the sub-surface. Laboratory-scale studies showed the potential to mobilise the more soluble hydrocarbons (such as toluene and xylene) in the soil, to deliver enhancing agents (e. g. surfactants and nutrients) and to remove toxic metabolites. The field-scale experiment demonstrated the concept of a relatively low cost treatment cell on-site and provided some evidence that biodegradation of the transformer oil was promoted. Consequently, it is suggested that electrokinetics, with the correct engineering controls in place, provides a valuable method of optimising the biodegradation of hydrocarbons in the sub-surface. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFine {{sediment}} source fingerprinting {{techniques have}} been widely applied in agricultural river catchments. Successful source discrimination in agricultural environments depends on the key assumption that land-use source signatures imprinted on catchment soils are decipherable from those due to other landscape factors affecting soil and sediment properties. In this study, we re-examine this critical assumption by investigating (i) the physical and chemical basis for source discrimination and (ii) potential factors that may confound source un-mixing in agricultural catchments, including particle size and organic matter effects on tracer properties. The study is situated in the River Tamar, a predominantly agricultural catchment (920 km 2) in south-west England that has also been affected by mining. Source discrimination focused on pasture and cultivated land uses and channel banks. Monthly, time-integrated suspended sediment samples were collected across seven catchments for a 12 -month period. Physical and chemical properties measured in source soils and sediment included fallout radionuclides (137 Cs, excess 210 Pb), major and minor element geochemical constituents, total organic carbon and particle size. Source discrimination was entirely dependent on differences in tracer property concentrations between surface and <b>sub-surface</b> <b>soils.</b> This is based on fallout radionuclide concentrations that are surface-elevated, while many geochemical properties are surface-depleted due to weathering and pedogenetic effects, although surface soil contamination can reverse this trend. However, source discrimination in the study catchments was limited by (i) rotation of cultivated and pasture fields resulting in reduced differences between these two sources, and (ii) the cultivated source signature resembling a mix of the pasture and channel bank sources for many tracer properties. Furthermore, a combination of metal pollution from abandoned historic mines and organic enrichment of sediment from upland areas of peaty soils resulted in the non-conservative behaviour of some tracer properties in several catchments. Differences in the particle size and organic carbon content of source soils could explain much {{of the variation in}} these properties in downstream sediment, rather than selective transport effects. Inconsistent relationships between particle size, organic carbon and tracer property concentrations further undermined the basis for the use of widely applied corrections to tracer datasets. Sensitivity analysis showed that correcting source tracer data for differences in organic matter can produce large changes to source contribution estimates that cannot be justified, and such corrections should not be used. Confounding factors related to poor source discrimination and non-conservative behaviour are highly likely to affect sediment fingerprinting studies in many agricultural catchments. As a result, estimates of source contributions in many fingerprinting studies may contain significant unquantified errors...|$|R
