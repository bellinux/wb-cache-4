Because chemical synthesis of indole derivatives from arylamino ketones requires drastic solvent conditions, it is interesting by what mechanism the enzyme catalyzes the same condensation reaction. Seven invariant polar residues in the active site of the enzyme from Escherichia coli have been mutated directly or randomly, to identify the catalytically essential ones. A strain of E. coli suitable for selecting and classifying active mutants by functional complementation was constructed by precise deletion of the trpC gene from the genome. Judged by growth rates of transformants on selective media, mutants with either S 58 or S 60 replaced by alanine were indistinguishable from the wild-type, but R 186 replaced by alanine was still partially active. <b>Saturation</b> random <b>mutagenesis</b> of individual codons showed that E 53 was partially replaceable by aspartate and cysteine, whereas K 114, E 163, and N 184 could not be replaced by any other residue.

Although previous studies using recombinant Escherichia coli have shown that either SCL or MCL PHA polymers could be produced from glucose, this study presents the first evidence that an SCL-MCL PHA copolymer can be made from glucose in recombinant E. coli. The 3 -ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III gene (fabH) from E. coli was modified by <b>saturation</b> point <b>mutagenesis</b> at the codon encoding amino acid 87 of the FabH protein sequence, and the resulting plasmids were cotransformed with either the pAPAC plasmid, which harbors the Aeromonas caviae PHA synthase gene (phaC), or the pPPAC plasmid, which harbors the Pseudomonas sp. strain 61 - 3 PHA synthase gene (phaC 1), and the abilities of these strains to accumulate PHA from glucose were assessed. It was found that overexpression of several of the mutant fabH genes enabled recombinant E. coli to induce the production of monomers of C 4 to C 10 and subsequently to produce unusual PHA copolymers containing SCL and MCL units.

The colicin E 1 ion channel domain contains one prominent hydrophobic region near its COOH terminus that has been proposed to be an anchor for the assembly of the channel. <b>Saturation</b> site-directed <b>mutagenesis</b> of the hydrophobic anchor region of the colicin E 1 ion channel was used to probe whether it spanned the bilayer once or twice. A nonpolar amino acid was replaced by a charged residue in 29 mutations made at 26 positions in the channel domain. Substitution of the charged amino acid at all positions except those {{in the center of the}} hydrophobic region and the periphery of the hydrophobic region caused a large decrease in the cytotoxicity of the purified mutant colicin E 1 protein. This result implies that the hydrophobic domain spans the membrane bilayer twice in a helical hairpin loop, with the center of this domain residing in an aqueous or polar phase. The lengths of the trans-membrane helices appear to be approximately 18 and 16 residues. The absence of significant changes in ion selectivity in five of nine mutants indicated that these mutations did not cause a large change in the channel structure. The ion selectivity changes in four mutants and those previously documented for the flanking Lys residues imply that the hydrophobic hairpin is part of the channel lumen.

In both enzymes, aspartate residues at the C-terminal end of beta-strand 1 (Asp 8 in tHisA and Asp 11 in tHisF) and beta-strand 5 (Asp 127 in tHisA and Asp 130 in tHisF) {{are essential for}} catalytic activity. It was demonstrated earlier that in tHisA the substitution of Asp 127 by valine (tHisA-D 127 V) generates phosphoribosylanthranilate isomerase (TrpF) activity, a related (betaalpha) (8) -barrel enzyme participating in tryptophan biosynthesis. It is shown here that in tHisF the corresponding substitution of Asp 130 by valine (tHisF-D 130 V) also generates TrpF activity. To determine the effectiveness of individual amino acid exchanges in these conversions, each of the 20 standard amino acid residues was introduced at position 127 of tHisA and 130 of tHisF by <b>saturation</b> random <b>mutagenesis.</b> The tHisA-D 127 X and tHisF-D 130 X variants with TrpF activity were identified by selection in vivo, and the proteins purified and characterized. The results obtained show that removal of the negatively charged carboxylate side-chain at the C-terminal end of beta-strand 5 is sufficient to establish TrpF activity in tHisA and tHisF, presumably because it allows the binding of the negatively charged TrpF substrate, phosphoribosylanthranilate. In contrast, the double mutants tHisA-D 8 N+D 127 V and tHisF-D 11 N+D 130 V did not show detectable activity, demonstrating that the aspartate residues at the C-terminal end of beta-strand 1 are essential for catalysis of the TrpF reaction.

40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae F 1 -ATPase beta subunit {{precursor}} contains redundant mitochondrial protein import {{information at}} its NH 2 terminus (D. M. Bedwell, D. J. Klionsky, and S. D. Emr, Mol. Cell. Biol. 7 : 4038 - 4047, 1987). To define the critical sequence {{and structural features}} contained within this topogenic signal, one of the redundant regions (representing a minimal targeting sequence) was subjected to <b>saturation</b> cassette <b>mutagenesis.</b> Each of 97 different mutant oligonucleotide isolates containing single (32 isolates), double (45 isolates), or triple (20 isolates) point mutations was inserted {{in front of a}} beta-subunit gene lacking the coding sequence for its normal import signal (codons 1 through 34 were deleted). The phenotypic and biochemical consequences of these mutations were then evaluated in a yeast strain deleted for its normal beta-subunit gene (delta atp 2). Consistent with the lack of an obvious consensus sequence for mitochondrial protein import signals, many mutations occurring throughout the minimal targeting sequence did not significantly affect its import competence. However, some mutations did result in severe import defects. In these mutants, beta-subunit precursor accumulated in the cytoplasm, and the yeast cells exhibited a respiration defective phenotype. Although point mutations have previously been identified that block mitochondrial protein import in vitro, a subset of the mutations reported here represents the first single missense mutations that have been demonstrated to significantly block mitochondrial protein import in vivo. The previous lack of such mutations in the beta-subunit precursor apparently relates to the presence of redundant import information in this import signal. Together, our mutants define a set of constraints that appear to be critical for normal activity of this (and possibly other) import signals. These include the following: (i) mutant signals that exhibit a hydrophobic moment greater than 5. 5 for the predicted amphiphilic alpha-helical conformation of this sequence direct near normal levels of beta-subunit import (ii) at least two basic residues are necessary for efficient signal function, (iii) acidic amino acids actively interfere with import competence, and (iv) helix-destabilizing residues also interfere with signal function.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, protein {{engineering}} by directed evolution {{has been applied}} as a powerful algorithm to improve proteins for applications as biocatalysts, biosensors or therapeutic proteins. Exploring functions and characteristics of these proteins are still often limited by low to no heterologous protein production in the selected hosts. Additionally, improving these proteins by directed evolution is limited by low diversity of mutant libraries and the available high-throughput screening systems. These are introduced in detail in Chapter I. The low diversity of amino acid substitution reduces the chances to find beneficial substitutions for the improved enzyme properties. Furthermore, {{the lack of an}} efficient screening method could lead to the loss of potentially improved variants, waste of the previous time and efforts when generating diversified mutant library. All these are tackled in this thesis, aiming for improved methods in directed evolution and protein production. Considering the low or no production of the heterologous protein, in Chapter II, we developed a novel PLICable promoter toolbox which enables in a single cloning and after a screening experiment to identify out of ten IPTG-inducible promoters (T 7, A 3, lpp, tac, pac, Sp 6, lac, npr, trc and syn) the most suitable one for high level protein production. The target gene is cloned under the control of different promoters in a single and efficient cloning step using the ligase-free cloning method PLICing (phosphorothioate-based ligase-independent gene cloning). The promoter toolbox was firstly validated using three well producible proteins (a cellulase from a metagenome library, a phytase from Yersinia mollaretii and an alcohol dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida) and then applied to two poorly producible enzymes (3 D 1 DNA polymerase and glutamate dehydrogenase) in Escherichia coli. By applying our PLICable promoter toolbox, we were able to increase production by 2 fold for 3 D 1 DNA polymerase (lac promoter) and 29 fold for glutamate dehydrogenase (trc promoter) compared to those under the T 7 promoter in Escherichia coli. In order to solve the weakness of low diversity generation in directed evolution, in Chapter III, a new random mutagenesis strategy named cepPCR (casting error prone polymerase chain reaction) was developed to generate mutant libraries with high ratio of transversion, high mutation frequency, and increased consecutive mutations to explore more amino acid positions compared to typical epPCR (error prone PCR). In cepPCR, the model gene lipase A from Bacillus subtilis (bsla) (543 bp) was divided into 3 fragments and randomized by epPCR with high mutation load. CepPCR leads to 2 times increased beneficial amino acid positions in only sequencing 500 mutations. Additionally, for the first time, the minimum number of clones that needs to be screened to cover most common generated beneficial amino acid positions was defined and can be carried over for other similar target genes. Although cepPCR allows to generate high diversity libraries, however, it still has a strong transition bias. In Chapter III we could conclude that combining the transversion biased sequence <b>saturation</b> random <b>mutagenesis</b> method (SeSaM) with cepPCR, 39 % beneficial positions for improved ionic liquids [BMIM][TfO] could be obtained. Therefore, in Chapter IV, SeSaM was further improved to supplement the mutation patterns in the mutant library generated by typical epPCR. In this Chapter, the aim is to improve the protocol of SeSaM by directed evolution of DNA polymerase and subsequently applied it in the step 3 of SeSaM to increase the fraction of consecutive transversions. According to the codon usage, consecutive substitutions could cover 90 % of possible substitutions at amino acid level, the increases of consecutive transversions is crucial for exploring more amino acid substitutions. For engineering a DNA polymerase capable of efficient elongating consecutive transversions, high-throughput screening assay is primarily the prerequisite. A screening assay based on Scorpion real-time PCR and in vitro expression in emulsions cooperating with flow cytometry screening was investigated. However, because of the high fluorescent background even after the optimization of different factors, the screening assay was not successfully established and need to be further optimized. Nevertheless, further literature and experimental studies showed that 5 D 4 DNA polymerase has higher activity for elongating consecutive mismatches than 3 D 1 DNA polymerase. It could be used to replace original used 3 D 1 DNA polymerase in the step 3 of SeSaM to obtain more diverse mutant library. Finally, in Chapter V, we tried to evolve DNA polymerase by incorporating more nucleotide analogs and applied it in typical epPCR for adjusting the mutation patterns (more transversions and consecutive mutations). Prerequisite for the evolution of the DNA polymerase is a reliable and efficient high-throughput screening assay. Here the screening assay is based on the fluorescence from DNA dye intercalated DNA products which were amplified by the DNA polymerase variants incorporating nucleotide analogs. For construction of the most sensitive screening assay, SYBR® Green I was selected by the comparison of 10 DNA dyes. The critical values of the nucleotide analog concentrations were also determined. The validation of the screening assay to screen 3 D 1 DNA polymerase variants generated by epPCR was performed using model analog dITP, and four mutants with higher incorporation efficiency for nucleotide analogs were selected, concluding that this assay could be used to screen the DNA polymerase libraries for incorporating more nucleotide analogs. The improved DNA polymerase could be further improved by iterative directed evolution and finally used in epPCR to increase the diversity of mutant libraries...|$|R
50|$|Generally, {{directed}} evolution may {{be summarized as}} an iterative two step process which involves generation of protein mutant libraries, and high throughput screening processes to select for variants with improved traits.

50|$|<b>Saturation</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> is {{commonly}} achieved by artificial gene synthesis, {{with a mixture}} of nucleotides used at the codons to be randomised. Different degenerate codons can be used to encode sets of amino acids. Because some amino acids are encoded by more codons than others, the exact ratio of amino acids cannot be equal. Additionally, it is usual to use degenerate codons that minimise stop codons (which are generally not desired). Consequently, the fully randomised 'NNN' is not ideal, and alternative, more restricted degenerate codons are used. 'NNK' and 'NNS' have the benefit of encoding all 20 amino acids, but still encode a stop codon 3% of the time. Alternative codons such as 'NDT', 'DBK' avoid stop codons entirely, and encode a minimal set of amino acids that still encompass all the main biophysical types (anionic, cationic, aliphatic hydrophobic, aromatic hydrophobic, hydrophilic, small).|$|E
50|$|By the {{classical}} genetics approach, a researcher would then locate (map) the gene on its chromosome by crossbreeding with individuals that carry other unusual traits and collecting statistics on how frequently the two traits are inherited together.

Eventually {{the hope is that}} such screens would reach a large enough scale that most or all newly generated mutations would represent a second hit of a locus, essentially saturating the genome with mutations. This type of <b>saturation</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> within classical experiments was used to define sets of genes that were a bare minimum for the appearance of specific phenotypes.

50|$|In {{directed}} evolution, random mutagenesis, e.g. by error-prone PCR or Sequence <b>Saturation</b> <b>Mutagenesis,</b> {{is applied}} to a protein, and a selection regime is used to select variants having desired traits. Further rounds of mutation and selection are then applied. This method mimics natural evolution and, in general, produces superior results to rational design. An added process, termed DNA shuffling, mixes and matches pieces of successful variants to produce better results. Such processes mimic the recombination that occurs naturally during sexual reproduction. Advantages of directed evolution are that it requires no prior structural knowledge of a protein, nor is it necessary {{to be able to}} predict what effect a given mutation will have. Indeed, the results of directed evolution experiments are often surprising in that desired changes are often caused by mutations that were not expected to have some effect. The drawback is that they require high-throughput screening, which is not feasible for all proteins. Large amounts of recombinant DNA must be mutated and the products screened for desired traits. The large number of variants often requires expensive robotic equipment to automate the process. Further, not all desired activities can be screened for easily.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{approaches}} to mutagenesis rely on methods which are entirely random in the mutations produced.

[...] For Escherichia coli, mutants may be selected first by exposure to UV radiation, then plated onto agar medium. The colonies formed are then replica-plated, one in rich medium, another in minimal medium, and mutants that have specific nutritional requirements can then be identified by their inability to grow in minimal medium. Similar procedures may be repeated with other types of cells and with different media for selection. A number of methods for generating random mutations in specific proteins were later developed to screen for mutants with interesting or improved properties. These methods may involve the use of doped nucleotides in oligonucleotides synthesis, or conducting a PCR reaction in conditions that enhance misincorporation of nucleotides (error-prone PCR), for example by reducing the fidelity of replication or using nucleotide analogues.

Some of the best variants are also excellent catalysts in the hydrolytic desymmetrization of other meso-epoxides, although both enantiomeric diols are not always accessible.|$|E
40|$|<b>Saturation</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> is a {{cornerstone}} technique in protein engineering {{because of its}} utility (in conjunction with appropriate analytical techniques) for assessing effects of varying residues at selected positions on proteins ’ structures and functions. Site-directed mutagenesis with degenerate primers is the simplest and most rapid <b>saturation</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> technique. Thus, it is highly appropriate for assessing whether or not variation at certain sites is permissible, but not necessarily the most time- and cost-effective technique for detailed assessment of variations ’ effects. Thus, in the presented study we applied the technique to randomize position W 373 in b-glucosidase Zm-p 60. 1, which is highly conserved among b-glucosidases. Unexpectedly, b-glucosidase activity screening of the generated variants showed that most variants were active, although they generally had significantly lower activity than the wild type enzyme. Further characterization of the library led us to conclude that a carefully selected combination of randomized codon-based <b>saturation</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> and site-directed mutagenesis may be most efficient, particularly when constructing and investigating randomized libraries with high fractions of positive hits...|$|E
