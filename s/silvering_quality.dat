6000|$|The elation of success, which surely now flamed high in Osmond, emitted {{meanwhile}} {{very little}} smoke for so brilliant a blaze. Contentment, on his part, took no vulgar form; excitement, {{in the most}} self-conscious of men, {{was a kind of}} ecstasy of self-control. This disposition, however, made him an admirable lover; it gave him a constant view of the smitten and dedicated state. He never forgot himself, as I say; and so he never forgot to be graceful and tender, to wear the appearance--which presented indeed no difficulty--of stirred senses and deep intentions. He was immensely pleased with his young lady; Madame Merle had made him a present of incalculable value. What could be a finer thing to live with than a high spirit attuned to softness? For would not the softness be all for one's self, and the strenuousness for society, which admired the air of superiority? What could be a happier gift in a companion than a quick, fanciful mind which saved one repetitions and reflected one's thought on a polished, elegant surface? Osmond hated to see his thought reproduced literally--that made it look stale and stupid; he preferred it to be freshened in the reproduction even as [...] "words" [...] by music. His egotism had never taken the crude form of desiring a dull wife; this lady's intelligence was to be a silver plate, not an earthen one--a plate that he might heap up with ripe fruits, to which it would give a decorative value, so that talk might become for him a sort of served dessert. He found the <b>silver</b> <b>quality</b> in this perfection in Isabel; he could tap her imagination with his knuckle and make it ring. He knew perfectly, though he had not been told, that their union enjoyed little favour with the girl's relations; but he had always treated her so completely as an independent person that it hardly seemed necessary to express regret for the attitude of her family. Nevertheless, one morning, he made an abrupt allusion to it. [...] "It's the difference in our fortune they don't like," [...] he said. [...] "They think I'm in love with your money." ...|$|R
50|$|Between 1887 and 1892 over 1.75 million sucres {{worth of}} {{substandard}} coin was withdrawn, {{so that only}} high <b>quality</b> <b>silver</b> coin remained in circulation.

But the total face value of coin in circulation had been reduced. In order to alleviate the shortage of small change, the President authorized (June 14, 1890) the minting of 30,000 sucres in copper coins of 1/2 and 1 centavo.|$|R

50|$|The Proton Saga {{made its}} European debut on 11 March 1988 with its launch in Ireland. Both saloon and {{hatchback}} models were made available {{at a cost}} of between £8,999 and £10,799.

Additionally, the Irish automotive market was small at around 50,000 units a year at that period, as opposed to the much larger U.K. market at 2 million units. Proton launched the Saga in several small Commonwealth countries while they prepared for their large scale launch in the U.K. with over 100 dealers.

50|$|The {{most closely}} {{controlled}} commodity from New Spain (and Peru) was {{the production and}} transportation of silver.

But the crown also established monopolies over tobacco production and manufacturing. Guilds ("gremios") restricted the practice of certain professions, such as those engaged in painting, gilded framer makers, music instrument makers, and others. Indians and mixed-race castas were considered a threat, producing quality products far more cheaply.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{monetary}} use and function of the Anglo-Scandinavian coinages, especially the Sigtuna coinage. Ever since their discovery by the Swedish scholar Nicolas Keder, in 1706, the Anglo-Scandinavian coinages have been puzzling. In the early days of numismatic research their status among other Viking-age and early medieval coinages was not clearly understood, nor was it clear how they should be classified. Today, their status as Scandinavian imitations of English coins – minted in Viking towns such as Sigtuna and Lund – has been recognized. Their numismatic classification has recently been accomplished by meticulous die-studies, but the question of how they were used as means of payment remains unresolved. It is suggested that the coinages did not necessarily have a nominal value, but an officially sanctioned exchange-value, which could only be reckoned and valued by weight and not by number. In such a monetary system, which had both elements of a coin-based and a bullion-based economy, weighing was probably the only way in which to settle the exchange-value. The archaeological evidence from the Sigtuna mint seems to suggest that the Sigtuna coins were weighed with oblate spheroid weights. These weights follow the Islamic mitqal standard which was the basis for the Scandinavian ertog standard. It is also argued that at some stage in the bullion economy, coined silver was preferred to hack-silver in transactions. Because of that there might have existed a similar situation in the transactional sphere in the Viking Age, as later during the Middle Ages, whereby different <b>qualities</b> of <b>silver</b> were recognized and valued according to different exchange-rates. This change in the transactional sphere had probably been influenced by the arrival of Western European silver coins to Scandinavia at the turn of the first millennium AD. Finally, the Anglo-Scandinavian coinages probably did not have any monetary valueoutside the strongholds in which they were minted. They were intended for use only by people visiting the town and using its market. It would be reasonable to suggest a short time period of value and use during which these coins were regarded as being worth more than ordinary weighed silver. Another conclusion based on this observation is that both English coins and Anglo-Scandinavian imitations were regarded as being of the same <b>silver</b> <b>quality</b> and handled for a higher exchange-rate than, for instance, German coins or hack-silver in the Sigtuna market...|$|R
50|$|Yemenite silver-work {{is noted}} for its {{intricate}} use of filigree and fine granulation. Jewelry containing a high silver content was called by local Jews, ṭohōr, or in the Arabic tongue, muḫlaṣ, the intent being to jewelry whose silver content ranged from 85% to 92%, while the rest being copper. The disadvantaged of the cities and in the rural regions, as well as Bedouins, would routinely order jewelry whose silver content was lower, up to 60% silver, the remainder of which being copper and which had the name of fuḍah. A lower <b>quality</b> <b>silver</b> was called niṣfī, a word having the connotation of “half,” implying that it was made half of silver and half of copper.|$|R
5000|$|Bows have {{a leather}} {{wrapping}} {{on the wooden}} part of the bow near the frog. Along with the leather wrapping, {{there is also a}} wire wrapping, made of gold or <b>silver</b> in <b>quality</b> bows. The hair is usually horsehair. Part of the regular maintenance of a bow is having the bow [...] "rehaired" [...] by a luthier with fresh horsehair and having the leather and wire wrapping replaced. The double bass bow is strung with either white or black horsehair, or {{a combination of the two}} (known as [...] "salt and pepper"), as opposed to the customary white horsehair used on the bows of other string instruments. Some bassists argue that the slightly rougher black hair [...] "grabs" [...] the heavier, lower strings better. As well, some bassists and luthiers believe that it is easier to produce a smoother sound with the white variety. [...] Red hair (chestnut) is also used by some bassists. Some of the lowest-quality, lowest cost student bows are made with synthetic hair. Synthetic hair does not have the tiny [...] "barbs" [...] that real horsehair has, so it does not [...] "grip" [...] the string well or take rosin well.|$|R
5000|$|The {{specific}} {{feature of}} German silver overlay {{is the degree}} of purity - 925 for Sterling silver or 999 for fine <b>silver.</b> [...] The <b>quality</b> of <b>silver</b> used for German overlay {{can be seen by}} identifying the impressed 1000 mark (usually on the base or side of an item). The purity and thickness of the silver overlay ensures the beauty of the item is maintained without any loss to the silver even after many years of cleaning. This cannot be said for some of the so-called silver overlay pieces seen on the market today. Bohemian and Venetian Murano glass are often described as silver overlay, but the silver is so thin that it looks as though it has been painted onto the surface, producing a flat effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{currency}} in 1830 was chaotic. Circulation consisted of old silver macuquina minted at Caracas under both royalists and republicans and {{of silver and}} gold coin from the various American states, especially from Colombia. Good <b>quality</b> <b>silver</b> coin tended to disappear from circulation (being {{used to pay for}} imports). Macuquina and worn coin remained to serve retail trade. The government published a table December 30, 1830 fixing the value of foreign coin in terms of local macuquina. On December 22, 1832, the Secretary of Finance ordered customs houses and finance offices to receive and pay out the silver peso fuerte as equivalent to 10 reales of silver macuquina. After this, peso or peso sencillo (current peso) indicated payment in macuquina; peso fuerte indicated payment in standard silver pesos.|$|R
