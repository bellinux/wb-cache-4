25|$|The {{cultivated}} {{forms are}} of the species sweet cherry (P. avium) to which most cherry cultivars belong, and the <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> (P. cerasus), which is used mainly for cooking. Both species originate in Europe and western Asia; they do not cross-pollinate. Some other species, although having edible fruit, are not grown extensively for consumption, except in northern regions where the two main species will not grow. Irrigation, spraying, labor, and their propensity to damage from rain and hail make cherries relatively expensive. Nonetheless, demand is high for the fruit. In commercial production, cherries are harvested by using a mechanized 'shaker'. Hand picking is also widely used to harvest the fruit to avoid damage to both fruit and trees.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the wines}} {{produced}} under the Valpolicella DOC are red and usually contain a sizable {{amount of the}} area's most distinguished grape, Corvina. Other grapes used {{in the production of}} Valpolicella wine most often include Rondinella and Corvinone, but also Molinara, Rossignola, Negrara, Barbera, Sangiovese and Bigolona. A few producers are experimenting with reviving the indigenous grape Oseleta in Valpolicella. The wines are produced {{in a wide variety of}} styles ranging from basic nouveau table wines, full-bodied red wines, sweet dessert wines and even sparkling spumante. The most basic Valpolicella are light-bodied and often served slightly chilled. They have many characteristics similar to a Beaujolais wine and are often noted for their <b>sour</b> <b>cherry</b> flavor. While full-bodied recioto and Amarone styles reach alcohol levels of 15–16%, most Valpolicellas have more moderate alcohol levels around 11%. For wines labeled Valpolicella Superiore the wines must be aged a minimum of one year in wood and reach a minimum alcohol level of 12%.|$|E

5000|$|Cherry {{leaf spot}} is a fungal disease which infects {{cherries}} and plums.
