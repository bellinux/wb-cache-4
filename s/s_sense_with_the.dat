40|$|Right Wing Justice {{raises the}} alarm about the {{creeping}} conservative campaign to 2 ̆ 2 pack 2 ̆ 2 America 2 ̆ 7 s courts with judges more identified with their ideological affiliation than their skill or {{regard for the}} Constitution. The consequence is that {{the rule of law}} is taking a terrific beating from the Supreme Court. Who can forget the debacle of Election 2000 ? But the consequences of the campaign go far deeper than that, impinging on the daily lives of ordinary Americans who are at the receiving end of attempts to overturn or erode Supreme Court rulings on abortion, school prayer, civil rights, criminal justice, and economic regulation. As the author shows, the problem does not end at the Supreme Court—it filters down to the lowers courts and circuits. Right Wing Justice gives an alarming account of how this has come to pass over the last two decades, how conservative activists hatched this strategy in the 1960 s only to see it really come of age during the Reagan revolution and the successive Republican administrations. Combining a scholar 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sense</b> of history <b>with</b> <b>the</b> immediacy of eyewitness testimony, Right Wing Justice will come not only as a sobering reading to many concerned Americans—but also as a call to wake-up.

40|$|Do {{politicians}} {{appeal to}} fear, and if so, {{how does the}} public respond to potentially fear-inducing messages? I reason that changes in the political environment necessitate entrepreneurial efforts if politicians hope to maximize positive attention. Scholarship indicates that presidents can often shape press coverage or move public opinion, particularly {{in the domain of}} foreign policy or during national crises. In this dissertation I conceptualize government-issued terrorism warnings as a type of fear appeal. Specifically, I examine the relationship between changes in aggregate presidential approval and the timing of terrorism warnings over the two and one-half years after the 9 / 11 attacks, and whether warnings were related to changes in the overall tone of news coverage for the Bush administration and select policies. On balance, the evidence suggests that strategic considerations informed the timing of terrorism warnings as presidential approval was negatively associated with publicly disseminated terrorism warnings, and the tone of coverage tended to become more positive following each alert. ^ I then use experimental methods to examine patterns of individual-level responses to mediated messages about terrorism. Drawing insights from the fear appeals literature and political science research, I reason that cognitive (threat perceptions and confidence in government) and affective (fear and anger) responses to news coverage about terrorism-related threats should relate to policy preferences and presidential approval. Further, because terrorist threats target the national group, I consider how one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>sense</b> of identification <b>with</b> <b>the</b> American people relates to cognitive and affective responses. The experimental results are mixed as cognitive and affective responses relate to policy attitudes in meaningful ways, but are unrelated to presidential approval, and national identity is largely unrelated to the outcomes of interest. In sum, this dissertation contributes to a more robust understanding of the types of strategic considerations salient at the elite level as politicians strive to maintain approval. Moreover, it extends our understanding of how people respond to terrorism-related messages by moving beyond 9 / 11 specifically. This study provides valuable insights for future research seeking to examine the use of emotional appeals in the political realm. ...|$|R
