40|$|Background: In working {{environment}} of waste treatment facilities, employees {{are exposed to}} high concentrations of airborne microorganisms. Fungi constitute {{an essential part of}} them. This study aims at evaluating the diurnal variation in concentrations and species composition of the fungal contamination in 2 plastic waste <b>sorting</b> <b>facilities</b> in different seasons. Material and Methods: Air samples from the 2 <b>sorting</b> <b>facilities</b> were collected through the membrane filters method on 4 different types of cultivation media. Isolated fungi were classified to genera or species by using a light microscopy. Results: Overall, the highest concentrations of airborne fungi were recorded in summer (9. 1 × 103 – 9. 0 × 105 colony-forming units (CFU) /m 3), while the lowest ones in winter (2. 7 × 103 – 2. 9 × 105 CFU/m 3). The concentration increased {{from the beginning of the}} work shift and reached a plateau after 6 – 7 h of the sorting. The most frequently isolated airborne fungi were those of the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus. The turnover of fungal species between seasons was relatively high as well as changes in the number of detected species, but potentially toxigenic and allergenic fungi were detected in both facilities during all seasons. Conclusions: Generally, high concentrations of airborne fungi were detected in the {{working environment}} of plastic waste <b>sorting</b> <b>facilities,</b> which raises the question of health risk taken by the employees. Based on our results, the use of protective equipment by employees is recommended and preventive measures should be introduced into the working environment of waste <b>sorting</b> <b>facilities</b> to reduce health risk for employees.

25|$|During the 1800s, the Georgetown {{waterfront}} {{was largely}} a commercial harbor. Most of the land was occupied by warehouses. Between 1900 and 1960, the harbor largely closed as commercial river traffic declined sharply.

By 1960, many of these plants closed, and the waterfront fell into disuse.

The plan ended up failing, and moved back to CVG in 2009 to resume its original operations. CVG now serves as the largest of DHL's three global hubs (The other two being Leipzig/Halle and Hong Kong) with 84 flights each day to destinations across North America, Europe, Middle East, Asia, and the Pacific. DHL has completed a $105-million expansion and employs approximately 2,500 at CVG. Because of this growth, CVG now stands as the 6th busiest airport in North America based on cargo tonnage and 34th in the world. On May 28, 2015 DHL announced a $108-million expansion to its current facility, which doubled the current cargo operations. The money was used to double the gate capacity for transferring cargo, an expansion to the <b>sorting</b> <b>facility,</b> and various technical improvements, which was completed in Autumn 2016.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate and compare the efficiency of a filter based sampling method and a high volume sampling method for sampling airborne culturable fungi present in waste <b>sorting</b> <b>facilities.</b> Material and Methods: Membrane filters method was compared with surface air system method. The selected sampling methods were modified and tested in 2 plastic waste <b>sorting</b> <b>facilities.</b> Results: The total number of colony-forming units (CFU) /m 3 of airborne fungi was dependent on the type of sampling device, on the time of sampling, which was carried out every hour from the beginning of the work shift, and on the type of cultivation medium (p < 0. 001). Detected concentrations of airborne fungi ranged 2 × 102 – 1. 7 × 106 CFU/m 3 when using the membrane filters (MF) method, and 3 × 102 – 6. 4 × 104 CFU/m 3 when using the surface air system (SAS) method. Conclusions: Both methods showed comparable sensitivity to the fluctuations of the concentrations of airborne fungi during the work shifts. The SAS method is adequate for a fast indicative determination of concentration of airborne fungi. The MF method is suitable for thorough assessment of working environment contamination by airborne fungi. Therefore we recommend the MF method for the implementation of a uniform standard methodology of airborne fungi sampling in working environments of waste treatment facilities...|$|R
