This amount can build up from initial trading {{and is based on}} account activity. After the account is closed, the retaining balance will be returned in full, providing that no chargebacks occur after the account is closed.

40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{whether the}} {{domiciliation}} decision {{of mutual funds}} {{has an impact on}} mutual fund fees. To explain the decision behavior, we consider characteristics specific to funds, fund companies and countries. We find that fees vary considerably across fund types and countries. In particular, funds <b>set</b> <b>up</b> under the UCITS directive are more expensive for investors. We show that the sale of funds in multiple countries drives <b>up</b> <b>fees.</b> However, these disadvantages are outweighed by the significant economies of scale that can be generated if the domiciliation of funds is concentrated in financial centers. Financial integration creates economic benefits by encouraging the concentration of fund specialists in clusters. These benefits are reflected by significantly lower costs for the cross-border distribution of Luxembourg-based funds compared to funds domiciled in other countries. The implementation of UCITS IV in 2011 affirms the importance to focus on the supply-side of the mutual fund industry...|$|R

40|$|Top <b>up</b> <b>fees</b> and {{medicine}} Waive repayments completely if working life {{is spent in}} the NHS EDITOR—If, as Mayor reports, 1 the BMA is concerned that one in four medical graduates is considering not practising medicine and that the introduction of top <b>up</b> <b>fees</b> might encourage more graduates into lucrative private work instead of public service, then why cap the fees at £ 3000 a year for medical students? Why not instead charge them nearer the full costs but waive their repayments while they are earning less than £ 15 000 or working exclusively as a medical practitioner for the NHS or in another public sector? Medical students who worked until retirement for the state would then never have to repay a penny {{of the costs of}} their expensive state funded education. At the very least, this should help applicants to medical schools think a little more carefully about their future careers before applying. Should they wish to work in private medicine or in another career unrelated to health that is similarly lucrative, they could at least help, through their repayments, to fund the training of the extra medical students needed to replace their lost efforts.

Underpinning ZI is <b>set</b> <b>up</b> reduction and this paper examines what eventuates when <b>set</b> <b>up</b> costs are cut. The folklore is that <b>set</b> <b>up</b> reduction lowers inventory and costs. We obtain results contrary to that. Reducing <b>set</b> <b>up</b> costs need not reduce inventory, for example. Likewise lowering <b>set</b> <b>up</b> costs need not necessarily lower total production and inventory costs. Furthermore, most investments produce marginally decreasing returns. <b>Set</b> <b>up</b> cost reduction prompts the opposite; it produces marginally increasing (not decreasing) returns. A parametric algorithm that calculates the benefit of <b>set</b> <b>up</b> cost reduction is provided. Most presentations of ZI have been descriptive with very few mathematical models of it yet untaken. By modeling certain ZI concepts mathematically, we scrutinize their validity and sometimes invalidity. inventory/production: zero inventory, facilities/equipment: planning, inventory/production: parametric analysis...|$|R
