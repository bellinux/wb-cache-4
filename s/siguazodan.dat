40|$|The cyclic {{nucleotide}} phosphodiesterases (PDEs) {{present in}} an insulin secreting cell line, BRIN–BD 11, were characterized using calcium/calmodulin, IGF- 1, isoenzyme-selective PDE inhibitors and RT–PCR. Calmodulin activated cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP PDE activity in pellet and was 3 fold (P= 0. 002) more potent in activating cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis in pellet compared with supernatant fractions. The PDE 1 /PDE 5 inhibitor zaprinast inhibited both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP PDE activity in both pellet and supernatant fractions of cell homogenates by {{a maximum of}} around 25 % (IC 50 1 – 5 [*]μM), while rolipram (PDE 4 selective) inhibited only cyclic AMP hydrolysis. The PDE 3 -selective inhibitors Org 9935 (0. 02 – 10 [*]μM) and <b>siguazodan</b> (0. 1 – 10 [*]μM) inhibited cyclic AMP PDE activity in the pellet but not the supernatant fractions of cell homogenates, with a maximum inhibition of about 30 %. IGF- 1 (2 – 7. 5 [*]ng[*]ml− 1) potently augmented this PDE activity. RT–PCR using specific primers for PDE 3 B, but not for PDE 3 A, amplified, from BRIN–BD 11 cell total RNA, a 351 base pair product that was > 97 % homologous with rat adipose tissue PDE 3 B. IBMX, Org 9935, <b>siguazodan</b> and rolipram (1 – 50 [*]μM), but not zaprinast, each augmented glucose-induced insulin secretion {{in the presence of}} 16. 7 [*]mM but not 1 [*]mM glucose. These findings, in a clonal insulin secreting cell line, are consistent with an important role for PDE 3 B in regulating the pool of cyclic AMP relevant to the modulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the role of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) on arginase activity in a murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264. 7 cells) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Materials and methods: The cells were treated with A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS for 24 h. The effects of SQ 22536 (an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor), ODQ (a guanylyl cyclase inhibitor), dibutyryl cAMP (a cAMP analog), 8 -bromo cyclic guanosine monophosphate (a cGMP analog), forskolin (an adenylyl cylase activator), and cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor) on arginase activity in A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells were also determined. Arginase activity was assessed in LPS-stimulated cells in the presence of 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX), <b>siguazodan</b> and rolipram [phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors] as well as KT 5720 [a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor]. Results: Arginase activity in A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS-stimulated RAW 264. 7 cells was suppressed by SQ 22536 but not ODQ. Enhancement of arginase activity was observed in the presence of cAMP analog or forskolin but not cGMP analog. Cycloheximide blocked arginase activity in the cells in the presence of cAMP analog or forskolin with or without A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS. IBMX augmented arginase activity in A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS-stimulated cells. Rolipram (a PDE 4 inhibitor) increased the levels of arginase activity higher than <b>siguazodan</b> (a PDE 3 inhibitor) in the antigen-stimulated cells. The effect of cAMP analog or forskolin on arginase activity in the presence or absence of A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS was blocked by the PKA inhibitor (KT 5720). Conclusion: The results {{of the present study}} suggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans LPS may stimulate arginase activity in murine macrophages (RAW 264. 7 cells) in a cAMP-PKA-dependent pathway...|$|E

40|$|The non-hydrolysable cyclic AMP analogue, dibutyryl (Bu 2) -cyclic AMP, {{inhibited}} the stimulated {{release of}} histamine from both basophils and human lung mast cells (HLMC) in a dose-dependent manner. The concentrations required to inhibit histamine release by 50 % (IC 50) were 0. 8 and 0. 7 [*]mM in basophils and HLMC, respectively. The cyclic GMP analogue, Bu 2 -cyclic GMP, was ineffective as an inhibitor of histamine release in basophils and HLMC. The non-selective phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, theophylline and isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX) inhibited the IgE-mediated release of histamine from both human basophils and HLMC in a dose-dependent fashion. IBMX and theophylline were more potent inhibitors in basophils than HLMC. IC 50 {{values for the}} inhibition of histamine release were, 0. 05 and 0. 2 [*]mM for IBMX and theophylline, respectively, in basophils and 0. 25 and 1. 2 [*]mM for IBMX and theophylline in HLMC. The PDE 4 inhibitor, rolipram, attenuated the release of both histamine and the generation of sulphopeptidoleukotrienes (sLT) from activated basophils at sub-micromolar concentrations but was ineffective at inhibiting the release of histamine and the generation of both sLT and prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) in HLMC. Additional PDE 4 inhibitors, denbufylline, Ro 20 - 1724, RP 73401 and nitraquazone, were all found to be effective inhibitors of mediator release in basophils but were ineffective in HLMC unless high concentrations (1 [*]mM) were employed. Neither 8 -methoxymethyl IBMX (PDE 1 inhibitor), zaprinast (PDE 5 inhibitor) nor a range of PDE 3 inhibitors (<b>siguazodan,</b> SKF 94120, SKF 95654) were effective inhibitors of mediator release from either basophils or HLMC. In basophils, rolipram acted to potentiate the inhibitory effects of the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, whereas in HLMC, rolipram failed to potentiate the inhibitory effects of forskolin. Extracts of purified HLMC and basophils hydrolysed cyclic AMP. IBMX (100 [*]μM) inhibited the PDE activity in basophil extracts by 67 ± 7 % (P< 0. 0001) and in HLMC extracts by 63 ± 9 % (P< 0. 0005). The hydrolysis of cyclic AMP by basophil extracts was inhibited by the selective PDE inhibitors (all at 10 [*]μM), rolipram (56 ± 8 %, P< 0. 0001) and the mixed PDE 3 / 4 inhibitor, Org 30029 (47 ± 9 %, P< 0. 01), whereas 8 -methoxymethyl IBMX, <b>siguazodan</b> and zaprinast were ineffective. In HLMC, rolipram, Org 30029, 8 -methoxymethyl IBMX, <b>siguazodan</b> and zaprinast all inhibited the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP by extracts to a significant (P< 0. 05) and similar extent (approximately 25 % inhibition at 10 [*]μM).

40|$|Phosphodiesterase (PDE) {{activities}} that {{were capable of}} hydrolysing cyclic AMP (Km = 6. 8 +/- 2 microM) and cyclic GMP (Km = 6. 7 +/- 1. 6 microM) were isolated from tracheal smooth muscle. These enzyme(s) activities were insensitive to stimulation by calcium/calmodulin and to inhibition by cyclic GMP, rolipram (type IV inhibitor) and <b>siguazodan</b> (type III inhibitor). Zaprinast was a relatively poor inhibitor of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP hydrolysis (IC 50 = 46 +/- 9 microM and 45 +/- 14 microM respectively). These results suggest that tracheal smooth muscle may contain an apparently novel PDE. However, KCl (30 mM) which facilitates calcium entry in cells, depressed bradykinin-stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP formation, suggesting that the type I PDE may be functionally present.

40|$|Asthma is a complex, {{multifactorial disease}} that is {{underpinned}} by airway inflammation. A variety of cytotoxic substances are {{released into the}} airway from infiltrating inflammatory cells, especially the eosinophil. These cytotoxic substances, including reactive oxygen metabolites, produce damage to the airway epithelium, a histologic feature of chronic asthma. Damage to the airway epithelium, in turn, {{is thought to be}} a major factor responsible for the development of airway hyperreactivity, a hallmark of asthma. One notable molecular target for novel antiasthmatic drugs is the cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase (PDE) or PDE IV. This isozyme is the predominant form of cyclic nucleotide PDE activity in inflammatory cells. Thus, in view of the putative role of cyclic AMP as an inhibitory second messenger in these cells, PDE IV inhibitors have been shown to suppress inflammatory cell activity. The purpose of the present experiments was to examine the effect of the PDE IV inhibitor, R-rolipram, on three key functions of the guinea pig eosinophil: a) superoxide anion (°O) production, b) adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and c) infiltration into the airway. R-rolipram-elevated eosinophil cyclic AMP content (EC 50 = 1. 7 pM) and inhibited fMLP-induced ° 2 production in a concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 = 0. 3 pM). In contrast, neither <b>siguazodan,</b> a PDE IlIl inhibitor, nor zaprinast, a PDE V inhibitor, had an appreciable effect. R-rolipram (30 pM) also reduced by 25 to 40 % the adhesion of eosinophils to HUVECs stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate or tumor necrosis factor-a, particularly under conditions in which both cell types were simultaneously exposed to the PDE IV inhibitor. Again, <b>siguazodan</b> and zaprinast had little or no effect. Finally, pretreatment of conscious guinea pigs with R-rolipram (1 - 10 mg/kg, intragastric) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of antigen-induced eosinophil infiltration into the airway. Thus, by virtue of their ability to modify eosinophil function at several levels, PD...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the suppressive effects of rolipram, RP 73401 (piclamilast) and other structurally diverse inhibitors of cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) on interleukin (IL) - 2 generation from Balb/c mouse splenocytes exposed to the superantigen, Staphylococcocal enterotoxin-A (Staph. A). The purpose {{was to determine whether}} their potencies are more closely correlated with inhibition of PDE 4 from CTLL cells, against which rolipram displays weak potency (low-affinity PDE 4), or displacement of [3 H]-(±) -rolipram from its high-affinity binding site (HARBS) in mouse brain cytosol. RP 73401 (IC 50 0. 46 ± 0. 07 [*]nM, n= 4) was a very potent inhibitor of Staph. A-induced IL- 2 release from Balb/c mouse splenocytes, being > 1100 fold more potent than (±) -rolipram (IC 50 540 ± 67 [*]nM, n= 3). A close correlation (r= 0. 95) was observed between suppression of IL- 2 release by PDE inhibitors and inhibition of PDE 4. In contrast, little correlation (r= 0. 39) was observed between suppression of IL- 2 release and their affinities for the high-affinity rolipram binding site (HARBS). RP 73401 only inhibited partially (30 – 40 %) Staph. A-induced incorporation of [3 H]-thymidine into splenocyte DNA. The PDE 3 inhibitor, <b>siguazodan</b> (10 [*]μM), had little or no effect on IL- 2 release or DNA synthesis. This concentration of <b>siguazodan</b> did not enhance the inhibitory action of RP 73401 on IL- 2 release but potentiated its effect on DNA synthesis, increasing potency and efficacy. Staph. A-induced DNA synthesis was only partially inhibited by anti-IL- 2 neutralizing antibody, whereas dexamethazone (100 [*]nM) and cyclosporine A (100 [*]nM) completely blocked the response. RP 73401 (IC 50 6. 3 ± 1. 9 [*]nM, n= 4) was 140 fold more potent than rolipram (IC 50 900 ± 300 [*]nM, n= 3) in inhibiting Staph. A-induced [3 H]-thymidine incorporation into splenocyte DNA. The results implicate a low-affinity form of PDE 4 in the suppression of Staph. A-induced IL- 2 release from murine splenocytes by PDE inhibitors. The data also indicate that mitogenic factors other than IL- 2, whose elaboration or responses to which are regulated by PDE 3 as well as PDE 4, contribute to the superantigen-induced DNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) modulates the stimulated generation of the cytokines, interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) and IL- 13, from human basophils. This was addressed by evaluating the effects of both nonselective and selective inhibitors of PDEs on the generation of cytokines from basophils. The nonselective PDE inhibitors, isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX) and theophylline, attenuated the IgE-mediated generation of IL- 4 and IL- 13 and, also, the release of histamine from basophils. The effects of the isoform-selective inhibitors, 8 -methoxymethyl-IBMX (PDE 1 inhibitor), <b>siguazodan</b> (PDE 3 inhibitor), rolipram (PDE 4 inhibitor), denbufylline (PDE 4 inhibitor), Org 30029 (mixed PDE 3 and 4 inhibitor) and zaprinast (PDE 5 inhibitor), were studied. Of these selective compounds, only rolipram, denbufylline and Org 30029 inhibited the IgE-dependent generation of IL- 4, IL- 13 and histamine from basophils to a statistically significant (P< 0. 05) degree. The effects of isoform-selective inhibitors on basophils activated by IL- 3 were evaluated. The IL- 3 -induced generation of IL- 4, IL- 13 and histamine was inhibited to a statistically significant (P< 0. 05) extent, only by compounds that act as inhibitors of PDE 4. These data suggest that inhibition of PDE 4 can regulate the generation of cytokines from human basophils...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (PDE) on the early and late phase bronchoconstriction in sensitized, conscious guinea-pigs and the subsequent development of acute airway hyperreactivity to the inhaled thromboxane mimetic, U 46619, and leukocyte infiltration following ovalbumin (OvA) challenge. Following an inhalation challenge with OvA, there was an early bronchoconstriction which peaked at 15 [*]min with recovery after 3 – 4 [*]h. A late phase bronchoconstriction occurred between 17 and 24 [*]h after challenge. The PDE 4 inhibitors, Ro[*] 20 - 1724 (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) and rolipram (1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. p.) administered 30 [*]min before and 6 [*]h after antigen challenge (double dosing regimen), did not affect the development of the early or late phase responses. Seventeen to twenty four hours following an acute OvA or saline challenge, a consistently greater bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled U 46619 was observed in the OvA challenged group. This increase in responsiveness was significantly attenuated by the administration of Ro[*] 20 - 1724 and rolipram 30 [*]min before and 6 [*]h after antigen challenge (P< 0. 05); this was not attributable to a residual bronchodilator effect of these compounds. There was a trend towards inhibition of the hyperreactivity to U 46619 by aminophylline but not by the PDE 3 inhibitors, <b>siguazodan</b> or SKF[*] 95654. Aminophylline, rolipram and Ro[*] 20 - 1724 when administered as the double dose regimen attenuated the rise in macrophages, eosinophils and neutrophils recovered in bronchial lavage fluid 17 to 24 [*]h after antigen challenge. The dose of Ro[*] 20 - 1724 given at 6 [*]h post challenge was essential for attenuation of airway hyperreactivity and to protect against leukocyte influx. In summary, aminophylline, rolipram and Ro[*] 20 - 1724 have anti-inflammatory effects against antigen-induced airway leukocyte infiltration. Rolipram and Ro[*] 20 - 1724 additionally attentuated the development of acute airway hyperreactivity, effects which are probably mediated through inhibition of PDE type 4. A dose of PDE inhibitor 6 [*]h after the antigen challenge appears to be essential to achieve this protection. Inhibitors of PDE type[*] 3 were generally without effect. However, there was no effect of rolipram or Ro[*] 20 - 1724 on the development of either the early or late phase type responses...|$|E
