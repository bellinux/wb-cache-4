40|$|In {{spite of}} growing {{research}} attention to structural innovations for large university courses, {{the actual practice of}} supervising {{such a course}} remains extremely challenging. Against a backdrop of similar efforts, this paper reports our own attempt over two years to develop a large-course structure cultivating greater freedom and authentic exploration for students. While more empowering teaching obviously entails meaningful shifts in practice itself, we also found ourselves interrogating fundamental assumption about teaching and learning to a surprising degree. Consequently, we begin by reviewing competing <b>interpretive</b> <b>frameworks</b> or “problem definitions ” that we propose as partially constituting distinct educational practices. We then turn to an evaluation of our own practical efforts at promoting greater democracy and dialogue within a large course. These efforts ranged from particular note-taking formats, to unique attendance and evaluation policies, to whole class poster sessions. By inviting more collective interrogation of the <b>basic</b> <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> and practice of large class supervision, we hope to encourage other university teachers to further consider more empowering and transformative course formats. In spite of long-standing research attention to innovative possibilities in large university classes (Weimer, 1987), the experience of actually supervising such a course typically remains extremely difficult. From limited interaction to the sheer grading burden, a mass undergraduate class presents particular challenge to even the best of teachers. Hu and Kuh (2002) cite their own analyses a decade earlier indicating that a substantial fraction of 50, 000 students at 128 American colleges were “not engaged at meaningful levels in educationally purposeful activities, ” with a solid 18 % qualifying as “disengaged ” (p. 556).

Previous field research into smaller enterprises, concentrating on goods-oriented small and medium enterprises in urban settings, has shown that more context-rich <b>interpretive</b> <b>frameworks</b> are needed to accommodate the differences in ways of doing business between smaller and larger organisations. Using further fieldwork findings, this paper highlights the factors common to both urban and rural SMEs and those that appear unique to the rural setting A context-rich <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> for smaller enterprises in this rural setting is developed...|$|R

40|$|On the 29 th of June 2007, {{the representatives}} of the Government of Uganda (GoU) and {{the representatives of}} the Lord's Resistance Army/Movement rebels (LRA/M) signed an Agreement on Reconciliation and Accountability (AAR). The AAR {{provided}} for the use of both International Criminal Law (ICL) and Traditional Justice Mechanisms (TJMs) as part of the framework on accountability and reconciliation due to the conflict in Northern Uganda. Since warrants of arrest had already been issued against the top leaders of the LRA/M prior to the signing of this AAR, a rift arose between those who supported the ICC and those who supported the AAR. The former group argued that the AAR was promoting impunity while the latter group viewed the AAR as a vehicle for a sustainable post conflict transition. This project argues that a critical legal pluralist <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> (CLP) for implementing Agenda Item III of the Juba peace accord is more responsive to the complexities of Uganda's history and politics than the <b>interpretive</b> <b>frameworks</b> of mainstream international criminal law (ICL) or traditional legal pluralism (TLP).

40|$|In {{emphasizing}} the interpretive nature of perception and knowledge, proponents of a hermeneutic approach {{are faced with}} a basic difficulty: how to avoid the dogmatic positing of a single correct interpretation without lapsing into an unmitigated relativism which, rejecting 2 ̆ 2 correctness 2 ̆ 2 as the interpretive telos, is unable to adjudicate between competing interpretations. The premise {{of this study is that}} this dilemma has animated the various controversies within the hermeneutic tradition and the aim of this study is to show that a pluralistic approach generated from Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s text suggests a way to avoid the noxious consequences of this hermeneutic dilemma. ^ In part one, I examine the two leading interpretive methodologies as they are exhibited in their respective readings of Nietzsche. In so doing, I show that the disagreement between these two methods of reading emerges as a re-inscription of the dilemma of interpretive dogmatism and relativism. In chapter one, Heidegger is criticized for unjustifiably limiting the rich ambiguity of Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s text in his dogmatic claim to have discovered the 2 ̆ 2 essential truth 2 ̆ 2 of that text as the culmination of the metaphysical oblivion of Being. In chapter two, I examine the deconstructionist approach, showing that in opening new areas of interpretive inquiry within the Nietzschean text, their fondness for indeterminacy tends toward sanctioning any and all interpretations. ^ In part two, I explore a pluralistic approach suggested by the Nietzschean text. In chapter three, his view of language is shown to open the fields of traditional epistemology to the creative play of interpretation. Chapter four examines the opposition between Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> two <b>basic</b> <b>interpretive</b> motifs, showing that in claiming there is nothing other than interpretation (perspectivism) while at the same time calling for an apprehension of the text without falsifying it by interpretation (philology), a tension is present which anticipates the hermeneutic dilemma. In chapter five, I argue that Nietzsche 2 ̆ 7 s genealogical method plays between the demands of philological attentiveness and perspectival creativity. Genealogy emerges as an example of the praxis of interpretive pluralism, allowing for a proliferation of interpretations while retaining a standard in terms of which these interpretations can be judged. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} that addresses both {{the distribution and}} comprehen-sion of different forms of referring expressions in language. This model is expressed in a formalism (Kamp & Reyle, 1993) that uses interpretive rules to map syntactic representations onto representations of discourse. <b>Basic</b> <b>interpretive</b> rules are developed for names, pronouns, definite descriptions, and quantified descriptions. These rules are triggered by syntactic input and interact dynamically with representations of discourse to establish reference and coreference. This interaction determines {{the ease with which}} corefer-ence can be established for different linguistic forms given the existing dis-course context. The performance of the model approximates that observed in studies of intuitive judgments of grammaticality and studies using online measures of language comprehension.

It aims to develop an <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> for these practices. Specifically, we take up Abu-Lughod's injunction to 'use resistance as a diagnostic of power' in order to explore the political rationalities and governmental technologies of microfinance, as well as the cultural ideologies and material conditions in particular locales. We then consider the difficult question of political agency by drawing on prevailing theories of resistance to develop a typology that distinguishes among three overlapping kinds of transgressive practices. The objective ultimately is to explore how this <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> might contribute to imagining more politically engaged and responsive models of development, as well as to critiquing the market-oriented foundation of existing models. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on the moral {{philosophy}} and theory of African humanness termed ubuntu. A qualitative methodology has been adopted to interpret ubuntu in the light of, and in contrast to the Eurocentrisim of human rights law, particularly as contained in the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights. The study identifies the inconsistencies in the African Charter and the weaknesses in the jurisprudence of the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights. The researcher argues that inconsistencies and weaknesses arise due to the absence of an <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> in the African Charter. Ubuntu is proposed as an <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> at the hand of which the provisions of the Charter can be read and interpreted. Research shows that ubuntu aligns itself with the historical experiences and human rights values of the African continent. It is in line with the aspirations and intents of the drafters of the African Charter and more importantly, ubuntu has proved to be capable of promoting and protecting the rights and interests of a society without jeopardizing the rights and interests of the individual. It also has the potential of an harmonious balance between an individual s duties and his rights or needs. In conclusion, the researcher contends that with the adoption of ubuntu as an <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> of the African Charter, those humanist aspirations of the African Charter which have so far been igored, can be achieved.

To demonstrate how students’ use of a specific mathematical approach leads to a particular type of understanding when solving problems in electricity, an <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> was developed. This <b>interpretive</b> <b>framework</b> combined two extensively used frameworks, namely Mathematical Resources (MR) and Extended Semantic Model (ESM) and was rationalised in electricity subtopics namely electric circuit, electric force and electric field. An interpretivist research paradigm was chosen to explain and derive meaning from fifteen first year physics students’ mathematical approaches in solving electricity problems. In general, students were found to be more inclined to activate formal mathematical rules, even when the use of basic or everyday mathematics that require activation of intuitive knowledge elements and reasoning primitives, would be more efficient. The need for a qualitative approach to solving physics problems rather than a quantitative one was presented and this has implications for future approaches to teaching science...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} a number of debates {{recently}} around the development of paradigms and research methodologies in the field of small business and entrepreneurship research.
