50|$|Using his wealth, Keiller {{decided to}} buy nearby Windmill Hill and then {{undertake}} excavations there. His work proved that the site was a causewayed enclosure, and it became the monument type-site for decades afterward. In 1934, he began a two-year excavation of the West Kennet Avenue, which led south east from the Avebury stone circle. As he discovered buried stones, he had them re-erected, and marked the <b>stone-holes</b> with pillars.|$|E
50|$|Keiller's {{first major}} {{excavation}} at Avebury was in 1937, {{the first of}} three seasons over the ensuing years. Each concentrated on a quadrant of the circle, clearing undergrowth, restoring and conserving the site. Buried stones, some up to a metre below ground, were uncovered and replaced in their original <b>stone-holes.</b> As with the avenue, he placed concrete pylons to denote missing stones. That same year, he founded the Morven Institute of Archaeological Research.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{excavated}} in 1968 which revealed four additional <b>stone-holes,</b> one having supported a further chamber stone, the others indicating a possible passage leading {{off to the}} northwest. Slight traces of a covering cairn were found {{to the south and}} it was shown that the monument had been raised over a pit 0.8 metres deep, filled with clay and stones. Finds included a small quantity of burnt bone, pottery, and flints.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are nine}} upright stones, each of local {{millstone}} grit, each {{less than a}} metre high, in a clearing in a modern wood planted on Stanton Moor. They sit in a rough circle with a gap at {{the south side of}} the circle where no <b>stone-hole</b> has been found. However, an additional stone, lying flat rather than upright, was discovered after being exposed as a crop mark in the dry weather of 1976. It is now visible. The circle is built on an embankment which levelled the local terrain. The small [...] "King Stone" [...] lies forty metres from the circle to the west-south-west and is clearly visible from it.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{beautiful}} waterfall in the river valley of Indravati, which was initially recognized by Chindak Nagas of Chakrakot. Many believe that Ghumura dance originated from this river valley and gradually spread into the areas between Indravati and Mahanadi, indicating this dance form belongs to the 10th century A.D. On the other hand, analysts opine that 'Banka-Paika' of Kalampur had carried Lankeswari deity with a grand procession of Ghumura music to Junagarh in 1008 A.D. when the Naga dynasty shifted their old capital from Jugasaipatna to Junagarh. The terracotta and stone objects found from medieval site in Nehena, 3 km from Khariar, resembles Ghumura object dated to the 9th and 10th centuries. In the 12th century A.D. Ghumura dance was already popular, which is evident from a scene of one person playing the instrument Ghumura in a <b>stone-hole</b> of Nritya Mandir of Konark Sun Temple. Bhimeswar temple in Bhubaneswar shows another scene of Ghumura dance reconfirming that origin of Ghumura dance was in the 10th century A.D.|$|R
