500|$|Walton of The Moving Picture News, who {{typically}} praised Thanhouser films, deviated {{from the norm}} by immediately dismissing the film as a whole by stating, [...] "This theme is getting threadbare; a foreign film is almost identical. The son's wife acts brutally to her husband's mother; things are set right by a child. Compare Gaumont's Twilight of a Soldier's Life, etc. The acting of the child is charming, and of the old lady a womanly concept – even to details. The wife's grabbing the old lady's bag, umbrella, etc. was, as one said who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'a bit too rushed. This criticism of the theme was accurate because the Gaumont Film Company release had a nearly identical plot except that that [...] "grandma" [...] was an elderly soldier. The similarities between the two films likely are coincidental because the Gaumont film was released four days prior.|$|E

Tony Reyes played the guitar and Larry Cox the organ while Thicke and Jay contributed Backing vocals and drums. Rich Travali mixed the track, while audio recording of [...] "Giving Myself" [...] was overseen by Bill Molina. Speaking about what motivated her {{to record the}} song, Hudson said: [...] "It's unexpected from me, but it still is me. I love how Thicke allowed <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>me</b> but introduced another side. He introduced a more vulnerable side vocally, but yet he put it with the ballad side of Jennifer." [...] In an interview with E! Online, Thicke also elaborated on the recording process, stating: [...] "Luckily, her voice {{is ready to go}} at all times. She showed up, I had this great little song in the spirit of Whitney Houston, and she <b>sat</b> down <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and I started singing it for her, and she loved it right off the bat.

When we were forty feet away and coming fast, he dropped the rifle, lighted a stick of dynamite with the cigar, and threw it at us. He lighted another and another, and threw them at us very rapidly, many of them. I know now that he must have split the ends of the fuses and stuck in match heads, because they lighted so quickly. Also, the fuses were very short. Sometimes the dynamite sticks went off in the air, but most of them went off in the canoes. And each time they went off in a canoe, that canoe was finished. Of the twenty canoes, the half were smashed to pieces. The canoe I was in was so smashed, and likewise the two men who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> The dynamite fell between them. The other canoes turned and ran away. Then that mate yelled, Yah! Yah! Yah!' at us. Also he went at us again with his rifle, so that many were killed through the back as they fled away. And all the time the black boys in the boat went on rowing. You see, I told you true, that mate was hell.|$|E

Do you suppose I don’t know that the man in the blue coat was Mr. Jenkins?’ ‘Jenkins in a blue coat!’ cries the gentleman with a groan; ‘Jenkins in a blue coat! a man who would suffer death rather than wear anything but brown!’ ‘Do you dare to charge me with telling an untruth?’ demands the lady, bursting into tears. ‘I charge you, ma’am,’ retorts the gentleman, starting up, ‘with being a monster of contradiction, a monster of aggravation, a—a—a—Jenkins in a blue coat!—what have I done that I should be doomed to hear such statements!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|One afternoon, in {{the height}} of this public quarrel, we met in the street. [...] "Franklin," [...] says he, [...] "you must go home with me and spend the evening; I am to have some company that you will like;" [...] and, taking me by the arm, he led me to his house. In gay {{conversation}} over our wine after supper, he told us jokingly that he much admired the idea of Sancho Panza,[156] who, when it was proposed {{to give him a}} government, requested it might be a government of blacks, as then, if he could not agree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> says, [...] "Franklin, why do you continue to side with these Quakers? Had not you better sell them?

[...] He, indeed, had labored hard to blacken the Assembly in all his messages, but they wiped off his coloring as fast as he laid it on, and placed it in return thick upon his own face; so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr. Hamilton, grew tired of the contest, and quitted the government.|$|E

The kid, the perfect kid would be cold and ruined. Both fire and candle were burning low. Someone {{had been out}} for a new candle, but there was evidently no means of replenishing the fire. The mate still crouched on the hearth, the dull red fire-glow on his handsome face, patiently trying to roast the kid and poking it against the embers. He had heavy, strong limbs in his khaki clothes, but his hand that held the spit was brown and tender and sensitive, a real Mediterranean hand. The girovago, blond, round-faced, mature and aggressive with all his liveliness, {{was more like a}} northerner. In the background were four or five other men, of whom I had distinguished none but a stout soldier, probably chief carabiniere.|$|R
60|$|Next Day.--Several {{hours at}} E.'s house, and dinner there. An old {{familiar}} house, (he {{has been in}} it thirty-five years,) with surroundings, furnishment, roominess, and plain elegance and fullness, signifying democratic ease, sufficient opulence, and an admirable old-fashioned simplicity--modern luxury, with its mere sumptuousness and affectation, either touch'd lightly upon or ignored altogether. Dinner the same. Of course {{the best of the}} occasion (Sunday, September 18, '81) was the sight of E. himself. As just said, a healthy color in the cheeks, and good light in the eyes, cheery expression, and just the amount of talking that best suited, namely, a word or short phrase only where needed, and almost always with a smile. Besides Emerson himself, Mrs. E., with their daughter Ellen, the son Edward and his wife, with my friend F. S. and Mrs. S., and others, relatives and intimates. Mrs. Emerson, resuming the subject of the evening before, (I <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> her,) gave <b>me</b> further and fuller information about Thoreau, who, years ago, during Mr. E.'s absence in Europe, had lived for some time in the family, by invitation.|$|R

60|$|It {{was quite}} a {{pleasant}} room, with deep divans upholstered in pale colours, and palm-trees standing behind little tables, and a black upright piano. Our bounder sat on the piano-stool and gave us an exhibition. He splashed out noise on the piano in splashes, like water splashing out of a pail. He lifted his head and shook his black mop of hair, and yelled out some fragments of opera. And he wriggled his large, bounder's back upon the piano stool, wriggling upon his well-filled haunches. Evidently {{he had a great}} deal of feeling for music: but very little prowess. He yelped it out, and wriggled, and splashed the piano. His friend the other bounder, a quiet one in a pale suit, with stout limbs, older than the wriggler, stood by the piano whilst the young one exhibited. Across the space of carpet sat the two brother jewellers, deep in a divan, their lean, semi-blond faces quite inscrutable. The q-b <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> asking for this and that music, none of which the wriggler could supply. He knew four scraps, and a few splashes--not more. The elder bounder stood near him quietly comforting, encouraging, and admiring him, as a lover encouraging and admiring his ingénue betrothed. And the q-b sat bright-eyed and excited, admiring that a man could perform so unself-consciously self-conscious, and give himself away with such generous wriggles. For my part, as you may guess, I did not admire.|$|E
6000|$|I here {{recall a}} lady who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on the coach that took me from Minehead to Lynton. The lady resided at Lynton, and finding that I was visiting the place for the first time, she {{proceeded}} to describe its attractions with fluent enthusiasm. When {{we arrived at the}} town, and were moving very slowly into it, my companion turned and examined my face, waiting to hear the expressions of rapturous admiration that would fall from my lips. Said I, [...] "There is one thing you can boast of in Lynton. So far as I know, it is the only town in the country where, sitting in your own room with the windows open, you can listen to the song of the wood wren." [...] Her face fell. She had never heard of the wood wren, and when I pointed to the tree from which the sound came and she listened and heard, she turned away, evidently too disgusted to say anything. She had been wasting her eloquence on an unworthy subject--one who was without appreciation for the sublime and beautiful in nature. The wild romantic Lynn, tumbling with noise and foam over its rough stony bed, the vast wooded hills, the piled-up black rocks (covered in places with beautiful red and blue lettered advertisements), had been passed by in silence--nothing had stirred me but the chirping of a miserable little bird, which, for all that she knew or cared, might be a sparrow! When we got down from the coach a couple of minutes later, she walked away without even saying good-bye.|$|E
6000|$|I listened at the outset, {{expecting to}} get some information. Our {{readings}} in modern history at Tadmor had informed us of the dominant political position of the middle classes in England, {{since the time of}} the first Reform Bill. Mr. Farnaby's guests represented the respectable mediocrity of social position, the professional and commercial average of the nation. They all talked glibly enough--I and an old gentleman who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> being the only listeners. I had spent the morning lazily in the smoking-room of the hotel, reading the day's newspapers. And what did I hear now, when the politicians set in for their discussion? I heard the leading articles of the day's newspapers translated into bald chat, and coolly addressed by one man to another, as if they were his own individual views on public affairs! This absurd imposture positively went the round of the table, received and respected by everybody with a stolid solemnity of make-believe which it was downright shameful to see. Not a man present said, [...] "I saw that today in the Times or the Telegraph." [...] Not a man present had an opinion of his own; or, if he had an opinion, ventured to express it; or, if he knew nothing of the subject, was honest enough to say so. One enormous Sham, and everybody in a conspiracy to take it for the real thing: that is an accurate description of the state of political feeling among the representative men at Mr. Farnaby's dinner. I am not judging rashly by one example only; I have been taken to clubs and public festivals, only to hear over and over again what I heard in Mr. Farnaby's dining-room. Does it need any great foresight to see that such a state of things as this cannot last much longer, in a country which has not done with reforming itself yet? The time is coming, in England, when the people who have opinions of their own will be heard, and when Parliament will be forced to open the door to them.|$|E

60|$|After {{twenty minutes}} spent {{in what seemed}} to me the very ostentation of success, another man was got to the wickets. This was Stumps, one of the professionals, who was not quite so much like a Minerva, though he, too, was prodigiously greaved. Jack again set his ball, snap went the machine, and Stumps wriggled his bat. He touched the ball, and away it flew behind the wicket. Five republican Minervas ran after it as fast as their legs could carry them; and I was told by a gentleman who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> scoring, that a dozen runs had been made. He {{spent a great deal}} of time in {{explaining}} how, in the old times, more than six at a time were never scored. Now all this was altered. A slight tip counted ever so much more than a good forward blow, because the ball went behind the wicket. Up flew on all sides of the ground figures to show that Stumps had made a dozen, and two British clarionets were blown with a great deal of vigour. Stumps was a thick-set, solid, solemn-looking man, who had been ridiculed by our side as being much too old for the game; but he seemed to think very little of Jack's precise machine. He kept chopping at the ball, which always went behind, till he had made a great score. It was two hours before Jack had sorely lamed him in the hip, and the umpire had given it leg-before-wicket. Indeed it was leg-before-wicket, as the poor man felt when he was assisted back to his tent. However, he had scored 150. Sir Lords Longstop, too, had run up a good score before he was caught out by the middle long-off,--a marvellous catch they all said it was,--and our trumpets were blown for fully five minutes. But the big gun was only fired when a ball was hurled from the machine directly into the wicket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wait, and I'll tell you." [...] He {{drew the}} reins tightly to {{accelerate}} the horse's speed, and, half turning to his companion, without, however, moving {{his eyes from the}} darkness before him, spoke quickly between the blasts: [...] "I've seen her only half a dozen times. Met her first in 6.40 train out from Boston last fall. She <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Covered up with wraps and veils; never looked twice at her. She spoke first--kind of half bold, half frightened way. Then got more comfortable and unwound herself, you know, and I saw she was young and not bad-looking. Thought she was some school-girl out for a lark--but rather new at it. Inexperienced, you know, but quite {{able to take care of}} herself, by George! and although she looked and acted as if she'd never spoken to a stranger all her life, didn't mind the kind of stuff I talked to her. Rather encouraged it; and laughed--such a pretty little odd laugh, as if laughing wasn't in her usual line, either, and she didn't know how to manage it. Well, it ended in her slipping out at one end of the car when we arrived, while I was looking out for a cab for her at the other." [...] He stopped to recover from a stronger gust of wind. [...] "I--I thought it a good joke on me, and let the thing drop out of my mind, although, mind you, she'd promised to meet me a month afterwards at the same time and place. Well, when the day came I happened to be in Boston, and went to the station. Don't know why I went, for I didn't for a moment think she'd keep her appointment. First, I couldn't find her in the train, but after we'd started she came along out of some seat in the corner, prettier than ever, holding out her hand." [...] He drew a long inspiration. [...] "You can bet your life, Ned, I didn't let go that little hand the rest of the journey." ...|$|E

6000|$|How I {{wish you}} could have been there! The hearing lasted three days, and I would not have missed a minute of it. As it was, I did not miss a syllable, and it was so deeply printed on my mind that I believe I could repeat it word for word if I had to. But, in the first place, I must try and realize the scene to you. I was once summoned as a witness in one of our courts, you remember, and I have never {{forgotten}} the horror of it: the hot, dirty room, with its foul air, the brutal spectators, the policemen stationed among them to keep them in order, the lawyers with the plaintiff and defendant seated all at one table, the uncouth abruptness of the clerks and janitors, or whatever, the undignified magistrate, who looked as if his lunch had made him drowsy, and who seemed half asleep, as he slouched in his arm-chair behind his desk. Instead of such a setting as this, you must imagine a vast marble amphitheatre, larger than the Metropolitan Opera, by three or four times, all the gradines overflowing (that is the word for the [...] "liquefaction of the clothes" [...] which poured over them), and looking like those Bermudan waters where the colors of the rainbow seem dropped around the coast. On the platform, or stage, sat the Presidents of the Assembly, and on a tier of seats behind and above them, the national Magistrates, who, as this is the capital of the republic for the time being, had decided to be present at the hearing, because they thought the case so very important. In the hollow space, just below (like that where you remember the Chorus stood in that Greek play which we saw at Harvard ages ago), were the captain and the first-mate on one hand, and the seamen on the other; the second-mate, our particular friend, was not there because he never goes ashore anywhere, and had chosen to remain with the black cook in charge of the ship. The captain's wife would rather have stayed with them, but I persuaded her to come to us for the days of the hearing, because the captain had somehow thought we were opposed to him, and because I thought she ought to be there to encourage him by her presence.

6000|$|... "'I {{am sorry}} to say, I have had a little quarrel with my aunt. It is all made up now, but it has hardly left us such good friends as we were before. Last week, there was a dinner-party here; and, among the guests, was a Hindoo gentleman (converted to Christianity) to whom my aunt has taken a great fancy. While the maid was {{dressing}} me, I unluckily inquired if {{she had seen the}} Hindoo--and, hearing that she had, I still more unfortunately asked her to tell me what he was like. She described him as being very tall and lean, with a dark brown complexion and glittering black eyes. My mischievous fancy instantly set to work on this horrid combination of darknesses. Try as I might to resist it, my mind drew a dreadful picture of the Hindoo, as a kind of monster in human form. I would have given worlds to have been excused from going down into the drawing-room. At the last moment I was sent for, and the Hindoo was introduced to me. The instant I felt him approaching, my darkness was peopled with brown demons. He took my hand. I tried hard to control myself--but I really could not help shuddering and starting back when he touched me. To make matters worse, he <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> at dinner. In five minutes I had long, lean, black-eyed beings all round me; perpetually growing in numbers, and pressing closer and closer on me as they grew. It ended in my being obliged to leave the table. When the guests were all gone, my aunt was furious. I admitted my conduct was unreasonable in the last degree. At the same time, I begged her to make allowances for me. I reminded her that I was blind at a year old, and that I had really no idea of what any person was like, except by drawing pictures of them in my imagination, from description, and from my own knowledge obtained by touch. I appealed to her to remember that, situated as I am, my fancy is peculiarly liable to play me tricks, and that I have no sight to see with, and to show me--as other people's eyes show them--when they have taken a false view of persons and things. It was all in vain. My aunt would admit of no excuse for me. I was so irritated by her injustice, that I reminded her of an antipathy of her own, quite as ridiculous as mine--an antipathy to cats. She, who can see that cats are harmless, shudders and turns pale, for all that, if a cat is {{in the same room with}} her. Set my senseless horror of dark people against her senseless horror of cats--and say which of us has the right to be angry with the other?'" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{my journey}} to Boston this year, I met at New-York with our new governor, Mr. Morris, just arrived there from England, with whom I {{had been before}} intimately acquainted. He brought a {{commission}} to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tired with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to, had resigned. Mr. Morris asked me if I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said [...] "No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will only {{take care not to}} enter into any dispute with the Assembly." [...] "My dear friend," [...] said he, pleasantly, [...] "how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible, avoid them." [...] He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful in argumentative conversation. He had been brought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion, while sitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice was not wise; for, {{in the course of my}} observation, those disputing, contradicting, and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs. They get victory sometimes, but they never get good-will, which would be of more use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia and I to Boston. In returning, I met at New-York with the votes of the Assembly of Pennsylvania, by which it appeared that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and the house were already in high contention; and it was a continual battle between them as long as he retained the government. I had my share of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the committees always desired to make the draughts. Our answers, as well as his messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and as he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that, when we met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats. But he was so good-natured a man, that no personal difference between him and me was occasioned by the contest, and we often dined together. One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the street; [...] "Franklin," [...] said he, [...] "you must go home with me and spend the evening; I am to have some company that you will like;" [...] and, taking me by the arm, led me to his house.

As {{he said in the}} Foley interview:It was a class on Plato taught by a Dominican very well known in those days named Festugiere. It was a lousy course, quite frankly. Bloom <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> on my left and would make little comments to me on the text, comments which I found more interesting than Festugiere's. Those teachers, outstanding as their reputation may have been, were no great shakes.At first I was a little bit shocked by Bloom's remarks. I had an innate reverence for famous people, and these were extremely well-known scholars, and it offended me to hear these things said about them.|$|E

The son's wife acts brutally to her husband's mother; things are set right by a child. Compare Gaumont's Twilight of a Soldier's Life, etc. The acting of the child is charming, and of the old lady a womanly concept - even to details. The wife's grabbing the old lady's bag, umbrella, etc. was, as one said who <b>sat</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> 'a bit too rushed. This criticism of the theme was accurate because the Gaumont Film Company release had a nearly identical plot except that that [...] "grandma" [...] was an elderly soldier. The similarities between the two films likely are coincidental because the Gaumont film was released four days prior.|$|E
