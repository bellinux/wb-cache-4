50|$|<b>Shower</b> {{doors are}} doors used in {{bathrooms}} that help keep water inside a <b>shower</b> or bathtub and are alternatives to <b>shower</b> curtains. They {{are available in}} many different styles such as framed or frameless, sliding or swing. They are usually constructed of aluminium, clear glass, plexi-glass or tempered glass. <b>Shower</b> doors can come in many different hardware finishes and glass patterns that can match other bathroom hardware such as faucets and <b>shower</b> heads. There are also <b>shower</b> doors that are in a neo angle design for use on <b>shower</b> pans that have the neo design as well. The design of the <b>shower</b> pan is extremely important as the <b>shower</b> door must be the type required for the pan in order to work. A <b>shower</b> door requires plastic lining {{along the edges of}} the door to protect against water leaking out.|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{there are}} two types of <b>shower</b> events; (1) occur in {{separate}} <b>shower</b> stalls, and (2) occur in shower/bathtub combinations. Each type of <b>shower</b> event produces a distinct pattern. A <b>shower</b> event from a shower/bath tub combo typically begins with a high flow rate. Then, the diverter valve is tripped and the flow is throttled down to a much lower rate for the duration of the <b>shower.</b> A standard <b>shower</b> stall event does not exhibit the high flow rate at the beginning or end of the <b>shower</b> event; also, it tended to have a relatively consistent flow rate throughout the duration of the <b>shower</b> event. Volume and the most frequent flow rate (mode) property are two critical features for identifying a <b>shower</b> event.|$|R

An equal number of reasons can be offered for <b>showering</b> at night as for <b>showering</b> in the morning. Contrary to myth, there are no adverse health effects from <b>showering</b> at night.|$|R

40|$|The {{vertical}} profile of atmospheric depth {{is an important}} element in extensive air <b>shower</b> studies. The depth of <b>shower</b> maximum {{is one of the most}} important characteristics of the <b>shower.</b> In the fluorescence technique of <b>shower</b> detection, the geometrical reconstruction provides the altitude of <b>shower</b> maximum, so that an accurate profile of atmospheric depth is needed to convert this altitude to the depth of <b>shower</b> maximum. In this paper the temporal variation of experimentally measured profiles of atmospheric depth at different sites is studied and implications for <b>shower</b> reconstruction are shown. The atmospheric profiles vary on time scales from hours to years. It is shown that the daily variation of the profile is as important as its seasonal variation and should be accounted for in air <b>shower</b> studies. For precise <b>shower</b> reconstruction, the daily profiles determined locally at the site of the air <b>shower</b> detector are recommended.

50|$|<b>Shower</b> {{curtains}} are curtains used in bathtubs with a <b>shower</b> or <b>shower</b> enclosures. They {{are usually}} made from vinyl, cloth or plastic. The <b>shower</b> curtain has two main purposes: to provide privacy {{and to prevent}} water from flooding or spraying outside the <b>shower</b> area. <b>Shower</b> curtains usually surround the bath inside the tub or <b>shower</b> area and are held up with railings or curtain rods high on the wall or ceiling. To accommodate {{the different types of}} bathtub shapes, railings can come in different sizes and are flexible in their design. Some people use two <b>shower</b> curtains: one that is inside the tub, which is mainly functional or decorative as well, and an outer <b>shower</b> curtain, which is purely decorative. The bottom portion of the inner curtain often comes with magnetic discs or suction cups which adhere to the bathtub itself.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{potential}} for <b>shower</b> water heat recovery from bathrooms equipped with instantaneous water heaters in high-rise residential buildings of Hong Kong. A simple single-pass counter-flow heat exchanger installed horizontally beneath the <b>shower</b> drain is employed as a localized heat recovery measure for preheating cold water going to a water heater. The thermal energy exchange is evaluated using the effectiveness-number of transfer units ([epsilon]-NTU) approach. <b>Shower</b> usage patterns including <b>shower</b> operating time and water flow rate sampled from an interview survey via the Monte-Carlo sampling technique, together with the water temperatures at the <b>shower</b> heads, <b>shower</b> drains and cold water supply mains recorded in sample <b>shower</b> operations, are the input parameters. The results indicate that 4 - 15 % <b>shower</b> water heat can be recovered through a 1. 5 Â m long single-pass counter-flow heat exchanger for a drainage pipe of diameter 50 Â mm.

40|$|Abstract: Earth-skimming {{neutrino}} experiment such as NuTel or CRTNT detects air <b>shower,</b> {{which is}} produced by decay of tau lepton, from near horizontal direction. Traditional <b>shower</b> simulations have difficulty in simulating <b>shower</b> at zenith angle near 90 degree, where some variables diverge to infinity. Recent CORSIKA simulation code had updates on simulation of horizontal air <b>shower.</b> We also developed a method to simulate horizontal air <b>shower.</b> This talk will compare results from both methods...|$|R

50|$|<b>Shower</b> gel is {{available}} in different colors and scents. Practically all <b>shower</b> gels {{on the market today}} are pH-balanced. Some <b>shower</b> gels are herb-infused, and some claim aroma therapeutic benefits. <b>Shower</b> gels for men may contain the ingredient menthol, which gives a cooling and stimulating sensation on the skin, and many men's <b>shower</b> gels are also designed specifically for use on hair and body and are thus more convenient to use. <b>Shower</b> gels contain milder surfactant bases than shampoos and in addition to being pH-friendly to the skin, most also contain gentle conditioning agents in the formula. This means that <b>shower</b> gels can also double as an effective and perfectly acceptable substitute to shampoo, even if they are not labelled as a hair and body wash. Washing hair with <b>shower</b> gel should give approximately the same result as using a moisturising shampoo.|$|R
