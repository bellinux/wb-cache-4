The cover was also right. I think it's become like a benevolent noose hanging behind us.

500|$|By 1972, Deep Purple had {{achieved}} considerable commercial success in Japan, including several hit singles, so {{it made sense}} to tour there. Three dates were booked; the Festival Hall, Osaka on 11 and 12 May, and the Budokan, Tokyo on 16 August, though these were later changed to the 15 and 16 August, and 17 August respectively due to an earlier US tour being rescheduled. The dates sold out almost immediately, and consequently the Japanese arm of the band's label, Warner Bros. Records, wanted to record the tour for a live album to be released in the country. The band eventually agreed to the idea, but insisted {{if it was going to}} be released, they wanted it to be done properly. Gillan recalled, [...] "we <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have to OK the equipment, we wanted to use our own engineer and we would have the last say on whether the tapes were released". The band enlisted producer Martin Birch, who had worked on previous studio albums, to record the shows onto an 8-track recorder so they could subsequently be mixed.|$|E
500|$|Benfica {{started their}} {{season with the}} third {{qualifying}} round of the Champions League, attempting to make their first presence in the group stage since 1998–99. On 10 August, Benfica beat Anderlecht 1–0 after Zlatko Zahovič scored in the 13th minute. When asked why Anderlecht had more goal opportunities than Benfica, Trapattoni said, [...] "Do you know international football? It is very balanced nowadays. I wish we had more chances but our opponent was stronger." [...] Following the win, Benfica were due to meet Porto in the Supercup on 20 August. Ricardo Quaresma of Porto scored the only goal {{of the game in}} an individual effort. It was Benfica's tenth consencutive loss in the competition; the previous win occurred in 1989. Four days later, Benfica travelled to Belgium to play Anderlecht. The home team scored first by Aruna Dindane, who scored another on the hour-mark. Nenad Jestrović scored the last goal. Trapattoni blamed fatigue and anxiety for the defeat, saying, [...] "I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> try to score, but lacked composure to do so. In the first half {{he spent a lot of}} energy. On the second, we tried to fight back, until he conceded a second goal, which killed us." [...] The fans insulted the team on their arrival in Lisbon. On 29 August, Benfica made their debut in the Primeira Liga by visiting Beira-Mar. Two goals in the first half and another within five minutes of the second, gave Benfica a lead that help them beat the locals.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1991, McCall signed for Scottish club Rangers for £1.2 million. Rangers had just won their third {{successive}} Scottish Premier Division title. Under newly appointed manager Walter Smith, McCall ended up playing in the final six of the club's nine successive Scottish league titles. In his first season at Ibrox, Rangers won the league and cup double, before they achieved greater success in 1992–93, winning both cups 2–1 against Aberdeen and coming nine points ahead of Aberdeen in the league. McCall also enjoyed European success that season when the Glasgow club narrowly missed out on an appearance in the UEFA Champions League 1992–93 final, coming second in the semi-final group stage to eventual winners Olympique de Marseille. Citing the reason for their success as the spirit which Smith instilled in the team, McCall later said: [...] "It was an incredible season. We won the domestic Treble, we went 44 games unbeaten {{and we did not}} lose a single game in Europe. And, though we <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> do it again next year, we all knew it was unrepeatable." [...] In 1993–94, Rangers added another Scottish League Cup title along with the league championship, but lost 1–0 in the final of the Scottish Cup to Dundee United, surprisingly being denied a second successive treble. The following season saw Rangers win the league by their greatest margin as they finished 15 points ahead of Motherwell, but they failed to reach the final of either of the domestic cups. Although their winning margin was reduced to four points, from city rivals Celtic, in 1995–96, Rangers' points tally of 87 was a record-high total. McCall played in his fourth Scottish Cup final as Rangers defeated Hearts 5–1. His Rangers side again pushed Celtic into second place in 1996–97 and defeated Hearts 4–3 in the Scottish League Cup. But with the club chasing an unprecedented 10th straight title in 1997–98 they had to settle for the runners-up position, with Celtic winning the league by two points {{on the final day of}} the season. McCall was substituted in the Scottish Cup final defeat to Hearts as Rangers went the season without picking up a single title for the first season in McCall's time at the club.|$|E

Later, this was chosen as the optimal route for the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the continental divide.|$|E
2500|$|Corbyn has campaigned {{strongly}} against tuition fees in England, and supports {{an increase in}} corporation tax to fund public services such as free higher education. The 2017 Labour manifesto pledged to remove tuition fees {{at a cost of}} around £10 billion per year. Before the election, Corbyn said that he would [...] "deal with" [...] the existing student debt, but after the election, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell clarified that this was an [...] "ambition" [...] for Labour rather than a firm promise. Labour did not know how much the student debt would cost to wipe when Corbyn made his statement, with Corbyn saying in July 2017 [...] "We never <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> completely abolish it because we were unaware of the size of it at that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|When President Ronald Reagan signed {{legislation}} {{establishing the}} Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, {{she was at}} the event.

Reagan clarified his remarks came {{from the fact that the}} papers had been sealed off until the year 2027. King accepted the apology and pointed out the Senate Select Committee on Assassinations had not found any basis to suggest her husband had communist ties. On February 9, 1987, eight civil rights activists were jailed for protesting the exclusion of African-Americans during the filming of The Oprah Winfrey Show in Cumming, Georgia. Oprah Winfrey tried to find out why the [...] "community has not allowed black people to live there since 1912." [...] King was outraged over the arrests, and wanted members of the group, [...] "Coalition to End Fear and Intimidation in Forsyth County," [...] to meet with Georgia Governor Joe Frank Harris to [...] "seek a just resolution of the situation." [...] On March 8, 1989, King lectured hundreds of students about the civil rights movement at the University of San Diego. King tried to not get involved in the controversy around the naming of the San Diego Convention Center after her husband. She maintained it was up to the [...] "people within the community" [...] and that people had tried to get her involved in with [...] "those kind of local situations." ...|$|E

I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like. For instance, I delayed going on the set by two days and he did not say anything. He called me on the set and <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> start shooting in five days. On the second day, I tried hair, make-up, and costume. He told me I was ready to give my first shot and indeed, I was." [...] About the script Bhansali said that he had worked on the script for 18 months and says, [...] "My film is mainstream in terms of budgets, cast and audience and I had to make sure that I did not hurt anyone but evoked a debate." [...] He points out that without star-clout, such themes will not make any impact on the audience or society.
