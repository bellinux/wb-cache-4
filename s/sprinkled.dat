5000|$|<b>Sprinkle</b> {{commenced}} her {{profession in}} the conventional porn business in the mid 1970s, slowly shifting to directing her own pictures, such as Deep Inside Annie <b>Sprinkle.</b> In the 1990s <b>Sprinkle</b> became largely involved in creating films, performances, and publications that were openly feminist and that participated in a playful and new form that involved women's, queer, and transgender sexuality. The majority of Annie <b>Sprinkle’s</b> works consists of several self-help-styles videos for example, such as Annie <b>Sprinkle's</b> Amazing World of Orgasm (U.S., 2004) and The Sluts and Goddesses Video Workshop (U.S., 1992), in which <b>Sprinkle</b> is portrayed as a skilled “sexpert”, motivating the audience to test out a range of elements of their own pleasures and fantasies. In the 1990s Annie <b>Sprinkle</b> became extensively renowned because she had switched from conventional porn to a feminist performance practice that combined live shows, writings on sexuality, and instructional videos. Yet, Deep Inside Annie <b>Sprinkle,</b> the initial film that <b>Sprinkle</b> both starred in and directed, had already shared several similar traits that later became hallmarks for her later works. These fundamentals incorporated an autobiographical emphasis, in which she displays to the viewer genuine photographs of her youth at the commencement of the film, for instance and the significance of women's self-satisfaction. Deep Inside, in distinction to <b>Sprinkle's</b> productions from the 1990s forward, was still advertised to conventional porn viewers, and extremely productively. Thus, it became the second leading grossing porn film of 1981. Annie <b>Sprinkles</b> also becamse {{well known in the}} queer art movement for being the first to promote the term [...] "postporn", and because she co-signed the Post-Porn Manifesto in 1989. Postporn became a niche term in the 80s and 90s, and continues to be an influential praxis in the transfeminist and queer movements, specifically in the fields of contemporary video and performance art.|$|R

5|$|Coimbatore cuisine is {{predominantly}} south Indian with rice as its base. Most local restaurants still retain their rural flavor, with many restaurants serving food over a banana leaf.

The top layer of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and <b>sprinkled</b> with crushed pistachios.

40|$|Abstract. The bead sizes used in {{approved}} {{modified release}} capsules labeled for <b>sprinkling</b> on food was investigated to generate bead size guidelines for generic products labeled for <b>sprinkling.</b> The conclusions from {{a survey of}} FDA databases were corroborated with experimental data obtained by measuring the bead sizes of several reference-listed drugs on the market labeled for administration by <b>sprinkling</b> on food. The experimental data show that majority of the marketed products {{were found to have}} bead sizes of less than 1, 500 μm (1. 5 mm).

5|$|Salt is {{considered}} to be a very auspicious substance in Hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. In Jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is <b>sprinkled</b> on a person's cremated remains before the ashes are buried. Salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in Mahayana Buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. In Shinto, salt is used for ritual purification of locations and people (harae, specifically shubatsu), and small piles of salt are placed in dishes by the entrance of establishments for the two-fold purposes of warding off evil and attracting patrons.|$|E
5|$|The Naradiya Purana narrates that Uttanka {{lived in}} an ashram in Ujjalaka. In his old age, he left for a pilgrimage and {{travelled}} to various temples. Once, the sage saw a hunter named Gulika stealing the golden plates of the temple of Vishnu at Sauvira. Gulika tried to kill the sage. Then Uttanka informed Gulika that the sin of murder would be to live through many births to expiate his sin. Hearing this the hunter was penitent and fell dead. Uttanka then <b>sprinkled</b> water from the holy Ganges on the hunter's corpse, which restored Gulika who then attained Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu. As advised by Vishnu, Uttanka went to Badari, performed tapas and attained Vaikuntha himself.|$|E
5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, Snowflake, is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has <b>sprinkled</b> crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When Snowflake approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells Snowflake that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} July of 2012 in Iowa, in WARM (< 26. 7 °C) and HOT (≥ 26. 7 °C) weather. Four <b>sprinkling</b> methods were compared, with one treatment being randomly assigned to each load: control- no <b>sprinkling</b> (not applied in HOT weather), pigs only, bedding only, or pigs and bedding. Experiment 1 used 51 loads in WARM- and 86 loads in HOT weather to determine <b>sprinkling</b> effects on pig measures (surface temperature, vocalizations, slips and falls, and stress signs). Experiment 2 used 82 loads in WARM- and 54 loads in HOT weather to determine the <b>sprinkling</b> effects on transport losses (non-ambulatory, dead, and total transport losses). Experiment 1 found that, in WARM weather, {{there were no differences}} between <b>sprinkling</b> treatments for surface temperature, vocalizations, or slips and falls (p ≥ 0. 18). However, stress signs were 2 % greater when <b>sprinkling</b> pigs- or bedding only- compared to control (p = 0. 03). Experiment 2 found that, in WARM and HOT weather, <b>sprinkling</b> did not affect non-ambulatory, dead, or total transport losses (p ≥ 0. 18).

5|$|Mercury {{and most}} of its {{compounds}} are extremely toxic and must be handled with care; in cases of spills involving mercury (such as from certain thermometers or fluorescent light bulbs), specific cleaning procedures are used to avoid exposure and contain the spill. Protocols call for physically merging smaller droplets on hard surfaces, combining them into a single larger pool for easier removal with an eyedropper, or for gently pushing the spill into a disposable container. Vacuum cleaners and brooms cause greater dispersal of the mercury and should not be used. Afterwards, fine sulfur, zinc, or some other powder that readily forms an amalgam (alloy) with mercury at ordinary temperatures is <b>sprinkled</b> over the area before itself being collected and properly disposed of. Cleaning porous surfaces and clothing is not effective at removing all traces of mercury and it is therefore advised to discard these kinds of items should they be exposed to a mercury spill.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 1988, {{the present}} Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of Htilin Monastery and Pitaka Kyaung {{initiated}} {{the ritual of}} daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when monks wash the face and brush {{the teeth of the}} Buddha image. It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels. After this, sandalwood paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally <b>sprinkled</b> with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.|$|E
5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try {{to go back to}} work and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let him stay and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast <b>sprinkled</b> with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the spiking of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E
