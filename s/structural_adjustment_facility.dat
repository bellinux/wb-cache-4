Secondary data on maize production in Nigeria during the Pre - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period (1970 to 1985), <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> period (1986 to 1994) and post - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme period (1995 to 2007) were employed in this study. A growth rate model was used to estimate the growth rates of maize in the three sub - periods. The results of the analysis showed that the instantaneous growth rates of maize production are - 0. 1 %, 5. 7 % and 2. 4 % and the compound rates of growth of maize production are - 0. 001 %, 0. 059 % and 0. 024 % for the pre - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme, <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme and post - <b>Structural</b> <b>Adjustment</b> Programme periods respectively.

40|$|The Government of Zimbabwe {{has neither}} fully {{implemented}} <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> nor has it clearly stated its position {{regarding the use}} of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> in its management of the economy. However, Government has, while strongly criticizing the IMF/World Bank approach to <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> sought to effect <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> in the economy and to apply its own brand as well as conventional IMF instruments of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The Government's brand of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> seeks to satisfy the stated objective of strengthening the productive sectors of the economy. This is done in the contradictory context of a programme for transition to socialism and standing recognition of the need for meaningful social spending. In applying <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment,</b> Government does not appear to consider in "package form" the impacts of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> on women nor does it consider any immediate compensatory cushioning. The removal of consumer, however, has been tied to minimum wage enactments. The activities of Government in general do seek to guarantee the security of women under a national macro-economic programme which seeks to generally elevate women into a position of equality and self-reliance in the economy. This programme, if successful, would make it unnecessary to treat women as a special and disadvantaged group needing cushioning from the impacts of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment.</b> The programme has, so far, only made notable progress in expanding social, public, health and educational facilities for women. These facilities have a direct bearing on the economic advancement of women. The one area where Government's approach has failed is in effecting a transition by women to meaningful management or ownership positions in the productive sectors. Generally, the impact of <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> on women is hard to determine. Only a few of the instruments analysed in this paper had a direct determinable bearing on women. These are, the removal of consumer subsidies, credit facilitation for agricultural production, tax adjustment and producer subsidies.,Canadian Agency for International Development...|$|R
40|$|Does the {{implementation}} of a <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> agreement increase or decrease government respect for democratic rights?

IMF officials also have emphasized the need for economic data. In 1999, the Equato-Guinean Government began attempting to meet IMF-imposed requirements, maintaining contact with IMF and the World Bank representatives.

To increase the borrowing country's involvement, developing countries are now encouraged to draw up Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs), which essentially {{take the place of}} SAPs.

From 1991 to 1993, the government successfully followed an enhanced <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>facility</b> (ESAF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) {{but failed to}} follow through on reforms {{in large part because of}} preoccupation with the government's domestic political troubles.

50|$|At {{the time}} of unification, South Yemen and North Yemen had vastly {{different}} but equally struggling underdeveloped economic systems. Since unification, {{the economy has been}} forced to sustain the consequences of Yemen's support for Iraq during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War: Saudi Arabia expelled almost 1 million Yemeni workers, and both Saudi Arabia and Kuwait significantly reduced economic aid to Yemen. The 1994 civil war further drained Yemen's economy. As a consequence, for the past 10 years Yemen has relied heavily on aid from multilateral agencies to sustain its economy. In return, it has pledged to implement significant economic reforms. In 1997 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved two programs to increase Yemen's credit significantly: the enhanced <b>structural</b> <b>adjustment</b> <b>facility</b> (now known as the poverty reduction and growth facility, or PRGF) and the extended funding facility (EFF). In the ensuing years, Yemen's government attempted to implement recommended reforms—reducing the civil service payroll, eliminating diesel and other subsidies, lowering defense spending, introducing a general sales tax, and privatizing state-run industries. However, limited progress led the IMF to suspend funding between 1999 and 2001.|$|E
