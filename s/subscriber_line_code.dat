40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} problem of {{designing}} an efficient resource allocation scheme {{in the application of}} providing integrated multimedia services over digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line.</b> For a predefined quality of service (QoS) requirement and data throughput, we show that the transmitted power consumption can be reduced by applying the parallel transmission framework previously proposed. Data streams are recognized as a set of layers with different data rate and bit error rate requirements. The characteristics of the telephone channel can be utilized to provide unequal error protection naturally and thus efficiently. Simulation results provide comparison of the proposed parallel transmission framework to the existing schemes designed for general data, and demonstrate significant performance improvement, such as 0. 5 – 2 dB power gain.

When the called party answers {{by taking the}} telephone handset off the switchhook, the subscriber's telephone draws direct current from the central office battery. This current is sensed by the line card and the ringing relay is de-energized.|$|R

50|$|Asymmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (ADSL) {{is a type}} {{of digital}} <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (DSL) technology, a data {{communications}} technology that enables faster data transmission over copper telephone lines than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. ADSL differs from the less common symmetric digital <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> (SDSL). In ADSL, Bandwidth and bit rate are said to be asymmetric, meaning greater toward the customer premises (downstream) than the reverse (upstream). Providers usually market ADSL as a service for consumers for Internet access for primarily downloading content from the Internet, but not serving content accessed by others.|$|R
50|$|In telephony, pair gain is the {{transmitting}} {{of multiple}} POTS signals over the twisted pairs traditionally {{used for a}} single traditional <b>subscriber</b> <b>line</b> in telephone systems.

The term was invented in the middle 20th century by analogy with earlier use of gain to extend telephone local loops far from the telephone exchange.|$|R
