40|$|Gain {{measurement}} of a horn antenna using three different techniques is discussed. The methods include a two-antenna insertion loss measurement, a pattern integration method, and a near-field measurement method. The {{application of the}} pattern integration method is considered, {{as well as the}} evaluation of the near-field gain correction factors for the horn, which are determined by a method based directly on measured data. This method involves a <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>expansion</b> of the experimental radiation pattern of the specific antenna being tested, rather than evaluation of an assumed analytical model.

The {{goal of this}} paper is to show the methods performance for NF-FF transformation pointing out the advantages and limitations of each one. First, the computational cost is studied, showing its dependence with the antenna under test (AUT) electric size. Second, the NF-FF transformation accuracy of each method is compared for a fixed AUT electric size, analyzing also the influence of the main parameters that affect the SRM and SWE accuracy. Third, the SRM capabilities are presented, with focus on the NF-NF transformation inside the minimum sphere. Practical applications of the SWE and SRM are illustrated by means of an example of NF-FF transformation and antenna diagnostics problem using measured NF data.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a general framework that enables one to compute near- and far-field interactions inside a circuit simulator environment, aimed at efficient system-level electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) analysis. For readability, {{the paper is}} subdivided in two parts. Part I focuses on deriving (high-order) <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> based macromodels in optimal time and describes two truncation criteria which define the maximum complexity of the models. The latter is generally a compromise between the accuracy of reconstructed near-fields and the computation time for evaluating interactions between these models, and is therefore a crucial parameter when such models are to be applied in fast circuit solvers. Existing guidelines on truncating <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>expansions</b> are held against the newly derived criteria. In part II, the framework is extended with optimized routines that enable one to compute efficiently near- and far-field interactions between the macromodels discussed in part I. It will be shown that by extensive understanding of <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>expansions,</b> the underlying computations only add negligible computational cost compared to traditional S-parameter simulations, partially contributed to correctly chosen truncations of the applied models. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>expansion</b> of the {{solution}} of the wave equation to predict Far-Field values from data measured in the Near-Field region is a well known technique, typically used to perform antenna measurements in compact anechoic chambers.

In this regard, a computer application that samples the electric Near-Field and calculates the values of the electric Far-Field region using <b>spherical</b> <b>wave</b> <b>expansion</b> was developed to measure antenna radiation patterns in the Fresnel zone inside a fully anechoic chamber. In order to validate the code, this paper describes three validation methods: firstly, using the theoretical electric Near-Field values of an infinitesimal dipole as the input to the algorithm to compare the output with the response analytically expected; secondly, using a Far-Field electric field data of a calibrated half wavelength dipole measured in an anechoic chamber and finally, using an electric Near-Field data of a calibrated half wavelength dipole measured in the same chamber.
