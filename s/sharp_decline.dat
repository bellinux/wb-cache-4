5|$|From 1810 to 1820, {{the number}} of free blacks in Indiana {{increased}} from 400 to 1200. In 1820 the State Supreme Court case of Polly v. Lasselle ordered all slaves, except those held before the 1787 Northwest Territory Ordinance, to be freed. The new ruling led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in the state's slave population. In 1820 the census recorded 190 slaves; by the 1830 census there were only three.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the {{government}} pressed ahead with its Fast Track Land Reform programme, a policy involving compulsory land acquisition aimed at redistributing {{land from the}} minority white population to the majority black population. Confiscations of white farmland, continuous droughts, and a serious drop in external finance and other supports led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in agricultural exports, which were traditionally the country's leading export-producing sector. Some 58,000 independent black farmers have since experienced limited success in reviving the gutted cash crop sectors through efforts on a smaller scale.|$|E

5|$|In her {{biography}} of McCracken, The Girl Who Fell Down, dance critic Mary Jo Sagolla says that McCracken is little remembered today, and not widely appreciated for her influence on Fosse, {{and for her}} efforts to encourage him to move from dance to choreography. Though her career went into a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in the 1950s due to her diabetes, she directly influenced the career of MacLaine, as well as Fosse, and was a pioneer in combining comedy and dance.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand acclimatisation societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Ploče {{recorded}} a steady {{growth and development}} from 1945, but suffered a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> between 1991 and 1996 due to the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War. In the late 2000s, Luka Ploče d.d., the primary concessionaire of the Port of Ploče, embarked on an ambitious investment plan, aiming for {{a substantial increase in}} the volume of port operations. Funding was secured in 2007, and Luka Ploče d.d. plans to invest €91million in port infrastructure and around €180million in port equipment by 2014.|$|E

5|$|The first {{infrared}} {{observations were}} published in 1998, in which both near and far infrared spectroscopy data was presented. The collected data showed Sakurai's Object's steep brightening in 1996, followed by a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in 1999 as expected. It was later found that the Star's steep decline in light {{was due to the}} circumstellar dust located around the star, which was present at a temperature of ~680 K. Further infrared data recorded by the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope was published in 2000, in which findings of the changing absorption lines were discussed.|$|E

The 11-episode season {{concluded}} 4 June 2006, due to its cancellation by the Seven Network {{as a result of}} its <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in ratings. When, in late 2005, the time came to renew Blue Heelers, Seven commissioned eleven further episodes to be produced, but its future after this was still undecided.|$|E
5|$|There were 8,468 {{immigrants}} to Croatia in 2009, {{more than half}} of them (57.5%) coming from Bosnia and Herzegovina, a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> from the previous year's 14,541. In the same year, there were 9,940 emigrants from the country, 44.8% of them leaving to Serbia. The number of emigrants represents a substantial increase compared to the figure of 7,488 recorded in 2008. In 2009, the net migration to and from abroad peaked in the Sisak-Moslavina County (-1,093 persons) and the city of Zagreb (+830 persons).|$|E

5|$|This period saw a {{political}} alignment with the Eastern Bloc countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures {{stemming from the}} 1973 oil crisis, resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in living standards, and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979. The Ratsiraka administration accepted the conditions of transparency, anti-corruption measures and free market policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and various bilateral donors {{in exchange for their}} bailout of the nation's broken economy.|$|E
5|$|Though {{sometimes}} productive, no {{nineteenth century}} iron mine on the Brendon Hills was profitable and the venture {{as a whole}} was financially ruinous. Furthermore, the industry {{as a whole was}} prone to boom and bust, with a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> from the early 1880s. The railway continued in operation after the end of mining, although it had lost its primary traffic. A second-hand Robey semi-portable steam engine was installed {{at the head of the}} incline to power the drums, hauling wagons up in the absence of a regular downhill flow.|$|E
5|$|Cairano was {{undoubtedly}} {{affected by this}} period of sudden and profound decay, if {{only because of the}} <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in commissions. After a decade of intense activity with several overlapping projects, a new stage in his career began, one which is obscured from the documentary view. The last relevant document in this regard is the contract for the entrance to the Duomo of Chiari in 1513, while the next document, in 1517, states that Cairano was already dead. Apart from this, there are other works from the period attributed to him, including the complex question of the completion of the Martinengo mausoleum.|$|E
50|$|In the 1911 Census {{the village}} {{recorded}} 149 inhabitants of whom 64 {{were from a}} Protestant background. The village had a demographic that was 57.1% Roman Catholic and 42.9% Protestant. Over {{the course of the}} century while the overall population of the village quadrupled in size the minority Protestant population had shrunk to just 20 inhabitants in the 2001 Census. This 39% fall in the Protestant community over the century is the third largest deterioration of a community from either side of Ulster's political divide in any village or district of over one hundred inhabitants behind the <b>sharp</b> <b>declines</b> of the Protestant communities of Derry City and Dungiven Village and marginally higher than the <b>sharpest</b> <b>decline</b> of a Roman Catholic community, experienced in Castlereagh.|$|R
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the complexity inherent in securitization can limit investors' ability to monitor risk, and that competitive securitization markets with multiple securitizers may be particularly prone to <b>sharp</b> <b>declines</b> in underwriting standards.

5|$|Cortina's {{population}} grew steadily {{from the time}} when it was annexed to the Italian State until the 1960s. Thereafter, it underwent a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> (down by 2,099 inhabitants over a 30-year period), with signs of recovery only in the very last few years. Nevertheless, with 6,112 inhabitants, Cortina d'Ampezzo is the seventh most populous place in the province following Belluno (36,509), Feltre (20,688), Sedico (9,734), Ponte nelle Alpi (8,521), Santa Giustina (6,795) and Mel (6,272). In 2008, there were 44 births (7.1 ‰) and 67 deaths (10.9%), resulting in an overall reduction of 23 inhabitants (-3.8 ‰). The town's 2,808 families consisted on average of 2.2 persons.|$|E
5|$|Replacement {{pilots were}} pushed through an {{abbreviated}} training regimen {{in order to}} meet the short-term needs of the fleet. This led to a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in the quality of the aviators produced. These inexperienced pilots were fed into front-line units, while the veterans who remained after Midway and the Solomons campaign were forced to share an increased workload as conditions grew more desperate, with few being given a chance to rest in rear areas or in the home islands. As a result, Japanese naval air groups as a whole progressively deteriorated during the war while their American adversaries continued to improve.|$|E
5|$|The Citra Awards, {{then known}} as the Indonesian Film Festival Awards, were first given at the IFF in early 1955; that year's Best Supporting Actress was Endang Kusdiningsih {{for her role in}} Tarmina. Succeeding festivals were held in 1960 and 1967. From 1973 the IFF was held annually. This {{continued}} uninterrupted until after the 1992 IFF, when a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in film production led the festival to be discontinued. It was reinstated as an annual event in 2004, after receiving funds from the Indonesian government.

5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of the}} top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in fishing along the Columbia in the last century, and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced. Fish ladders have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no fish ladders and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of the Columbia River system.|$|E
5|$|While the {{national}} average for sex ratio shows an increase from 933 in 2001 to 940 in 2011, the 2011 census shows a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in child sex ratio, the number of females per thousand males in a population between age group 06 years. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Mizoram and Andaman and Nicobar Islands recorded an increase in child sex ratio. National child sex ratio has declined from 927 in 2001 to 914 in 2011. Telangana census was separated from Andhra Pradesh state census figures, after Telangana formally took birth on 2 June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Dhaka {{suffered}} stagnation {{and decline}} began during the mid 19th-century. Its muslin industry {{was destroyed by}} high colonial taxation, restriction of trade and forced imports of British manufactured textiles. The city's weavers starved to death during Bengal famines. The rise of the colonial capital Calcutta caused a <b>sharp</b> <b>decline</b> in the city's population. Dhaka became heavily impoverished. In 1824, an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a city of magnificent ruins. During the mutiny of 1857, the city witnessed revolts by the Bengal Army. The British Indian rule was established following the mutiny. It bestowed privileges on the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the city's political and social elite. The Dhaka Cantonment was established {{as a base for}} the British Indian Army. The British developed the modern city around Ramna, Shahbag Garden and Bahadur Shah Park. A modern civic water system was introduced in 1874. The electricity supply began in 1901.|$|E
