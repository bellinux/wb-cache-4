5|$|Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to {{sectional}} rank in his 1856 classification, {{and divided}} it into four series, with B.brownii placed in series Dryandroideae. When George Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles {{together in a}} <b>section</b> <b>that</b> he named Oncostylis. This arrangement would stand for over a century.|$|E

5|$|The Hawaii public {{archives}} building, {{built in}} 1906 on the ʻIolani Palace grounds, in a <b>section</b> <b>that</b> was formerly the Kanaʻina's estate, was dedicated as the Kanaina building.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the swap, all of NY386 north of NY33A—except for the <b>section</b> <b>that</b> {{overlaps}} NY33—is overlapped by unsigned county routes. The portion of NY386 on Chili Center–Coldwater Road is co-designated as CR256. Along Westside Drive, NY386 is part of CR119, the designation for all of Westside Drive. The Coldwater Road segment, meanwhile, is also CR198 while CR158 was extended north to cover all of Elmgrove Road.|$|E

5|$|Each platoon {{now had a}} Lewis gun {{section and}} a <b>section</b> <b>that</b> {{specialised}} in throwing hand-grenades (then known as bombs), each section was compelled to provide two scouts to carry out reconnaissance duties. Each platoon was expected to provide mutual fire support in the attack they were to advance, without halting; but leap frogging was accepted, with the lead platoon taking an objective and the following platoons passing through them and onto the next objective, while the Lewis gunners provided fire support. Grenades were used for clearing trenches and dugouts, each battalion carried forward two trench mortars to provide fire support.|$|E
5|$|For a {{property}} {{to be eligible}} for the National Register, it must meet {{at least one of the}} four National Register main criteria. Information about architectural styles, association with various aspects of social history and commerce, and ownership are all integral parts of the nomination. Each nomination contains a narrative <b>section</b> <b>that</b> provides a detailed physical description of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local, state, or national history. The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following.|$|E
5|$|From 1929 until 1960, {{the road}} {{was part of the}} state highway system as M-135. The {{northern}} end of the highway always contained a <b>section</b> <b>that</b> ran concurrently with M-98, another state highway in the area. For a period in the 1950s, M-135 had a different northern terminus separate from M-98's endpoint. A few years before both highways were removed from the highway system, M-135 was moved to use M-98's terminus with M-28. Since the 1970s, M-135 {{has been a part of}} the county-designated highway system and assigned the number H-33, a moniker it has borne since.|$|E

5|$|In {{the primary}} ballot, voters agreed {{to divide the}} 35th ward into seven wards, {{accounting}} for the increased settlement in the city's Northeast <b>section</b> <b>that</b> made the ward extremely populous. The action brought {{the total number of}} wards to 58. The measure had support from both parties and passed overwhelmingly. In the general election, two loans questions were on the ballot: $16 million for general municipal improvements, and $10 million for water and sewer systems. Both measures passed.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 496 (I-496) is an {{auxiliary}} Interstate Highway that passes through downtown Lansing in the US state of Michigan. Also {{a component of}} the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway connects I-96 to the downtown area. It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east–west from I-96/I-69 near the downtown area and north–south along a <b>section</b> <b>that</b> runs concurrently with US Highway127 (US127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers.|$|E
5|$|NY28N is {{classified}} as a rural major collector road, {{with the exception of}} the <b>section</b> <b>that</b> is overlapped with Route30, which {{is classified}} as a rural minor arterial road. As of 2006, the Route30 overlap had an annual average daily traffic of 1,781 vehicles. Traffic volumes are reduced to 1,231 vehicles per day from the end of the Route30 overlap to the intersection with Blue Ridge Road (CR84). South of this intersection, traffic is reduced further to 350 until the hamlet of Minerva, rising to 751 south of Minerva until near the Warren county line. Traffic increases back up to 1,248 vehicles per day from there to Route28 in North Creek.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as if it continues Route 7, while the short portion of the northern <b>section</b> <b>that</b> lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E
5|$|SR666 is {{not part}} of the National Highway System, a system of routes {{important}} to the nation's economy, mobility and defense. The highway is maintained by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT). ODOT's 2010 annual average daily traffic (AADT) calculations showed that the lowest traffic levels were present on the <b>section</b> <b>that</b> is at the intersection with Washington Township Road 112 (Bateman Road), where only 510 vehicles used the highway daily; the peak traffic volume was 5,340 vehicles AADT along a section of SR666 near its southern terminus.|$|E
5|$|The SL95s make up 32 of the 72 trams in the system, supplementing {{the older}} SL79. The SL95s {{are the only}} {{bidirectional}} trams, and therefore {{the only ones that}} can operate on the Ullevål Hageby Line, that is served by lines 17 and 18. Since line 13 is a continuation of line 17 at Sinsen, the SL95s also operate on that line. Due to a too-small curve radius on the Briskeby Line, the SL95s do not operate on any of the lines to Majorstuen. They run on the Ullevål Hageby-, Ekeberg-, Sinsen-, Grünerløkka–Torshov-, Lilleaker- and Skøyen lines. Each service has a ten-minute headway, giving a five-minute interval on <b>section</b> <b>that</b> are served by two lines.|$|E

5|$|The areas NY3 {{passes through}} {{alternate}} between {{long stretches of}} rural area, consisting of a mix of open terrain and dispersed residences, and compact settlements containing concentrations of houses and businesses. NY3 is classified mainly as a minor arterial road, the major exception being the <b>section</b> <b>that</b> is concurrent with NY812, which is a principal arterial road. Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. Exceptions are in the cities of Watertown and Plattsburgh, where {{at least part of}} the road is city-maintained. In Watertown, NY3 is locally maintained from Massey Street (southbound US11 junction) to the end of the NY3/NY12 overlap. The route is entirely city-maintained in Plattsburgh.|$|E
5|$|The {{road that}} became Route 75 has existed since 1926, {{as part of}} Route 55 from south of Charleston to east of East Prairie. The route was renumbered to Route 77 in 1959, and it was rerouted in 1968. The {{realignment}} replaced Route E with Route 77, and its old alignment became part of Route 88 and Route 105. The <b>section</b> <b>that</b> traveled through Anniston was renumbered to Route 75.|$|E
5|$|The work {{consists}} of three sections, an introduction, a central <b>section</b> <b>that</b> details the trial itself, and a conclusion.

Although the authenticity of the main account has been challenged in the past, most historians consider it a contemporary record of the trial. Six manuscripts containing the work survive, and it was first printed in 1655, with other editions, including translations, appearing after that.|$|E
