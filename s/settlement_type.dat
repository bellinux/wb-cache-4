The basis of Childe’s ideas on <b>settlement</b> <b>types</b> in the Neolithic and Copper Age of eastern Europe was a binary classification into ‘tells’ and ‘flat sites’ that, in turn, reflected a division between permanent and shifting cultivation and greater and lesser cultural complexity. However, the introduction into this debate of questions of trade, surplus production, and Neolithic ‘self-sufficiency’, as well as metallurgy and ritual, meant that the initial binary classification left a series of contradictions that Childe struggled to transcend {{in the last decade}} of his life. ...|$|R

Two criteria were used: quantitative (<b>settlement</b> <b>types,</b> demographic and economic trends, financial and management capacity and performance, and access to services and housing) and qualitative (level of community-based participation in existing projects, the spirit of the place, economic potential and delivery record in terms of projects). These criteria reduced the number of appropriate towns to eight. A provincial steering committee (representing the political dimension) was appointed to incorporate the towns into the programme.

A large resident population provides opportunities for social interaction as well as a feeling of safety in numbers and 'eyes on the street'.

Unpublished material from two settlements, Avgi and Dispilio in Kastoria, will also complement this study. This dissertation {{raises the question}} of how communities were organised and how different forms of habitus or different kinds of entanglements tell us something of daily life and the formation of social identities. My principal field of research lies in the social interfaces developed around consumption practices in diverse spatial contexts in the course of everyday life. Key questions of this study involve the overall emergence and dispersal of social and cultural traditions in time and in space through the examination of different spatial and material entanglements. My analysis clarifies that intra-site spatial organisation in the area studied does not directly correspond with <b>settlement</b> <b>types.</b> The examination of archaeological data showed that similar configurations of social space can be found in dissimilar <b>settlement</b> <b>types.</b> My study demonstrates that cultural ‘assemblages’ in prehistory do not correspond to geographically broad united community groups but instead they show local diversity and social complexity. Instead of being modelled as unified, monolithic ‘cultures’, people seem to have come together around a sequence of chronologically and geographically focused forms of local identities. A local-scale examination of intra-site spatial patterns from Neolithic Macedonia and Western Thrace demonstrated that, although different <b>settlement</b> <b>types</b> are recorded within particular geographical regions, comparable organisation of space among contemporary sites indicates the development of similar social structures...|$|R

50|$|Myszków {{occupies}} {{the area of}} 73.59 km2, of which 56% is arable land, and 22% forests. Since 1925 {{it has been the}} seat of a gmina, but Myszków officially remained a village until 1950, when it received town charter. Today’s Myszków is made of a number of former villages, towns and settlements (Mrzygłód, Nowa Wieś, Pohulanka, Będusz, Helenówka, Myszków, Mijaczów, Ciszówka), which had existed here for centuries. Myszków is home to a sports club MKS Myszków, which was founded in 1947, and whose name changed several times (Jedność, Stal, Papiernik, Krisbut, MŻKS). The town is located on the elevation of 280 meters above sea level, in a valley between Silesian Highlands and Polish Jura, and some of its districts are part of the Jura Landscape Parks. Myszków is characteristic for its <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> of architecture, which is the result of mergers of numerous villages into its borders.|$|E
50|$|On the {{occasion}} of the Royal Assembly of Liège in 1131, Bishop Udo I of Naumburg (1125 - 1148) invited settlers from Flanders or the Netherlands to come and live in the Saale-Unstrut region. The respective place, named ″Flemmingen″ after the new settlers: ″The inhabitants of Flemmingen were called Holland, even though their residence was called Flemmingen, a name they most probably gave themselves to this place″. Flemmingen is documented {{for the first time in}} 1140. The village can be considered a paradigm of a settlement built by Flemish: The circular core of parcels around the parish church initially corresponded to the village centre of Tribun and was remodeled according to the new settlers’ requirements. Flemmingen consists of a horseshoe-shaped arrangement of farms in the centre, with tangentially to this a regular array of other farms in the manner of a ribbon village. The older Slav core settlement and the more recent Flemish colony can thus be clearly identified. The very regularly structured linear village with its narrow, rectangular farmsteads still bears rich testimony as distinctive features of this <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> and its representativeness of the inland colonization phase.|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to Wirth's claim that <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> influences interpersonal relation-ships, Gans {{has argued that}} such influences can be completely explained by demo-graphic differences between the populations of the various settlement types. How-ever, Gans has ignored the possibility of interaction between <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> and demographic characteristics. This study tests the influence of city versus suburban <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> on interpersonal estrangement. In anticipating that interaction ef-fects will be found, it is hypothesized that the influence on estrangement of demo-graphic variables which represent vulnerability to strangers will differ between city and suburb. This "vulnerability hypothesis " is supported, particularly {{as it pertains to}} the child-rearing lifecycle stage. It is concluded that while the effect of <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> on estrangement cannot be explained by demographic characteris-tics, it is largely confined to persons who possess certain characteristics. The relationship between <b>settlement</b> <b>type</b> and the quality of interpersonal relationships has long been debated in urban sociology. The debate rests on two divergent points of view, the first of which is associated with Louis Wirth. Wirth argues that the ecological characteristics of the city settle-ment type, that is, its great population size, density, and social heteroge-neity, independently reduce the quality of interpersonal relationships gen-erally, and in particular produce interpersonal enstrangement (see also Park; Simmel). Wirth notes that in the city, it is not possible for residents to know all others personally, and those who are known tend to be so in a distant and secondary way. Further, city-dwellers treat each other with indifference and not infrequently with distrust owing to the competitive, exploitive, and predatory social relationships engendered by large popula-tion size. The alternative point of view is associated with Herbert Gans. Gans (a) argues that the ecological characteristics of cities have little effect o...|$|E
40|$|Pattern-forming tendencies and patternforming phases in the {{development}} of the rural cultural landscape since high medieval times, especially in north west Germany. The arteile deals with the problem of temporal divisions in {{the development}} of the cultural landscape since high medieval times. Following on from studies made by H. Overbeck and H. Jäger, an attempt is made, with the help of various criteria, to reveal the most important pattern-forming tendencies and to temporally demarcate them. The basis of the division lies in an attempt to serialise different types of form, in the various difficulties involved in the process and with the spatial Organisation of the cultural landscape. The periods of high medieval agricultural expansion (and, after the retreat phenomena of the late middle ages, the expansion of modern times) can each be divided into three phases (in which the dates should be interpreted as mean values) : 1000 - 1070 : small-scale land clearance, non-uniform <b>settlement</b> <b>types.</b> 1070 - 1230 : large-scale land clearance under the influence of territorial rulers, uniform settlemcnt types. 1230 - 1350 : large-scale land clearance, streng urban influence on the form of the cultural landscape. 1350 - 1450 / 1500 : late medieval retreat periods, pronounced social and economic changes. 1450 / 1500 - 1700 : small-scale land clearance, non-niform <b>settlement</b> <b>types.</b> 1700 - 1850 : large-scale land clearance under the influence of the State, uniform <b>settlement</b> <b>types.</b> 1850 - 1950 : expansion and improvement of existing settlements, strenger urban influence. 1950 -till today: mereasing fallow phenomena and decrease in farm numbers, strong social and economic restructuring.
