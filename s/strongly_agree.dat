2500|$|The Connectedness to Nature Scale (CNS). This scale {{measures}} how emotionally {{connected people}} feel {{to the natural}} world, animals, and plants. It also assesses people's perceived equality between nature and themselves. An example of an item is [...] "I recognize and appreciate the intelligence of other living organisms." [...] These items are rated on a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (<b>strongly</b> <b>agree)</b> where higher scores demonstrate a higher connection to nature. This scale can be used both at the trait and state level. The state version is 13-items and shows acceptable reliability (α = [...]91,). The trait version is 14-items and also demonstrates good reliability (α = [...]82). This scale's validity is demonstrated by its positive associations with other environmental scales (such as the New Ecological Paradigm Scale) but is not associated with verbal ability or social desirability. See also Connectedness to nature scale.|$|E

One student commented: “the quizzes gave me a good understanding of where I was up to. It also showed if I had missed something while reading”. Another stated that for them, the most useful aspect of the adaptive quizzes was “being able to identify what I was missing from that week”. Students felt that the weekly quizzes provided a means of continually testing whether their knowledge was up to the level it needed to be and identifying which areas they needed to work more on. Most respondents (88.9 %) <b>agreed</b> or <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> that seeing their performance in an adaptive quiz assisted them with self-assessment of their work, and 77.8 % of them <b>agreed</b> or <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> that the quizzes helped them to focus on the important information in the unit.|$|R
