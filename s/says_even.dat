60|$|The {{speech that}} {{followed}} is no affair of mine or yours. It {{was made up}} of wifely and womanly jealousy; knowledge of old age and sunken cheeks; deep mistrust born of the text that <b>says</b> <b>even</b> little babies' hearts are as bad as they make them; rancorous hatred of Mrs. Larkyn, and the tenets of the creed of the Colonel's Wife's upbringing.|$|E

60|$|A truce is {{proposed}} for the burial of the dead, and Paris offers {{to give up the}} wealth that he brought to Troy, and more, if the Achaeans will go home, but Helen he will not give up.

They will not return, he <b>says,</b> <b>even</b> if Helen be restored, for even a fool knows that Troy is doomed, because of the broken oath. The rest shout acquiescence, and Agamemnon refuses the compromise. Apparently he would not have disdained it, but for Diomede's reply.|$|E

Winds up with a very serious passage, <b>says</b> <b>even</b> if this wild suggestion--mere passing fancy of mine, you know, and misinterpreted at that--this wild suggestion about the schools comes to nothing, that doesn't end the matter. This is a strange food, so strange as to seem to him almost wicked. It has been scattered recklessly--so he says--and it may be scattered again. Once you've taken it, it's poison unless you go on with it. 'So it is,' said Bensington. And in short he proposes {{the formation of a}} National Society for the Preservation of the Proper Proportions of Things. Odd? Eh? People are hanging on to the idea like anything." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{not known}} that, among the Andamanese and other tribes, this last notion is due to missionary influence. But, {{in regard to the}} whole chapter of savage Supreme Beings, we must, as Mr. Tylor advises, keep {{watching}} for Christian and Islamite contamination. The savage notions, as Mr. Tylor <b>says,</b> <b>even</b> when thus contaminated, may have 'to some extent, a native substratum.' We shall select such savage examples of the idea of a Supreme Being as are attested by ancient native hymns, or are inculcated in the most sacred and secret savage institutions, the religious Mysteries (manifestly the last things to be touched by missionary influence), or are found among low insular races defended from European contact by the jealous ferocity and poisonous jungles of people and soil. We also note cases in which missionaries found such native names as 'Father,' 'Ancient of Heaven,' 'Maker of All,' ready-made to their hands.|$|E

"Matilda {{was sure}} he would, so she sat on in the big chair, {{guarding}} the papers, {{and no one could}} get her away, till one day a man came with her father's ring and told her to give up the secret. She knew the ring, but would not tell until she had asked many questions, so as to be very sure, and while the man answered all about her father and the king, she looked at him sharply. Then she stood up and said, in a tremble, for there was something strange about the man: 'Sir, I doubt you in spite of the ring, and I will not answer till you pull off the false beard you wear, that I may see your face and know if you are my father's friend or foe.' Off came the disguise, and Matilda found it was my lord himself, come to take them with him out of England. He was very proud of that faithful girl, I guess, for the old chair still stands in the castle, and the name keeps in the family, Pa <b>says,</b> <b>even</b> over here, where some of the Bassetts came along with the Pilgrims." ...|$|E

"Do you {{remember}} the time I turned the hose on you, Freddie," [...] she said, rising from the fender, [...] "years ago, when we were children, when you and that awful Mason boy--what was his name? Wally Mason--teased me?" [...] She looked at the unhappy Freddie with a hostile eye. It was his blundering words that had spoiled everything. [...] "I've forgotten {{what it was all}} about, but I know that you and Wally infuriated me and I turned the garden hose on you and soaked you both to the skin. Well, all I want to point out is that, if you go on talking nonsense about Derek and his mother and me, I shall ask Barker to bring me a jug of water, and I shall empty it over you! Set him against me! You talk as if love were a thing any third party could come along and turn off with a tap! Do you suppose that, when two people love each other as Derek and I do, that it can possibly matter in the least what anybody else thinks or <b>says,</b> <b>even</b> if it is his mother? I haven't got a mother, but suppose Uncle Chris came and warned me against Derek...." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{may have}} been this memory, or it {{may have been}} some impulse of his nature too subtle for his mind to follow, that made Keats, with his love of {{embodied}} things, of precision of form and colouring, of emotions made sleepy by the flesh, see Intellectual Beauty in the Moon; and Blake, who lived in that energy he called eternal delight, see it in the Sun, where his personification of poetic genius labours at a furnace. I think there was certainly some reason why these men took so deep a pleasure in lights, that Shelley thought of with weariness and trouble. The Moon is the most changeable of symbols, and not merely because it is the symbol of change. As mistress of the waters she governs the life of instinct and the generation of things, for as Porphyry <b>says,</b> <b>even</b> 'the apparition of images' in the 'imagination' is through 'an excess of moisture'; and, as a cold and changeable fire set in the bare heavens, she governs alike chastity and the joyless idle drifting hither and thither of generated things. She may give God a body and have Gabriel to bear her messages, or she may come to men in their happy moments as she came to Endymion, or she may deny life and shoot her arrows; but because she only becomes beautiful in giving herself, and is no flying ideal, she is not loved by the children of desire.|$|E
