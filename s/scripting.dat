5|$|Originally {{designed}} to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on server-side <b>scripting,</b> and it is similar to other server-side <b>scripting</b> languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Microsoft's Classic ASP, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD). Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Zend Framework, offering features similar to other web frameworks.|$|E

5|$|Python {{has been}} used in {{artificial}} intelligence tasks. As a <b>scripting</b> language with modular architecture, simple syntax and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing tasks.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{conceived}} around a protagonist whose abilities {{can not be}} measured through standardized evaluation; as such, he is mistakenly categorized as a poor performing student or an irregular. This premise served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba. Satō has two processes for <b>scripting</b> the story arcs: the first is to create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to that scene. Satō professed that he does not feel his characters are alive or have a will of their own when <b>scripting</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Due to Python's {{extensive}} mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy {{that further}} extends the native capabilities, it is frequently {{used as a}} scientific <b>scripting</b> language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.|$|E

5|$|PHP is a {{general-purpose}} <b>scripting</b> {{language that}} is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. Any PHP code in a requested file is executed by the PHP runtime, usually to create dynamic web page content or dynamic images used on websites or elsewhere. It {{can also be used}} for command-line <b>scripting</b> and client-side graphical user interface (GUI) applications. PHP can be deployed on most web servers, many operating systems and platforms, and can be used with many relational database management systems (RDBMS). Most web hosting providers support PHP for use by their clients. It is available free of charge, and the PHP Group provides the complete source code for users to build, customize and extend for their own use.|$|E
5|$|Perl 5.004 was {{released}} on May 15, 1997, and included among other things the UNIVERSAL package, giving Perl a base object to which all classes were automatically derived {{and the ability to}} require versions of modules. Another significant development was the inclusion of the CGI.pm module, which contributed to Perl's popularity as a CGI <b>scripting</b> language.|$|E
50|$|The Gupta <b>script</b> (sometimes {{referred}} to as Gupta Brahmi <b>Script</b> or Late Brahmi <b>Script)</b> was used for writing Sanskrit and {{is associated with the}} Gupta Empire of India which was a period of material prosperity and great religious and scientific developments. The Gupta <b>script</b> was descended from Brahmi and gave rise to the Nāgarī, Sharada and Siddham <b>scripts.</b> These <b>scripts</b> in turn gave rise to many of the most important <b>scripts</b> of India, including Devanagari (the most common <b>script</b> used for writing Sanskrit since the 19th century), the Gurmukhi <b>script</b> for Punjabi Language, the Assamese <b>script,</b> the Bengali <b>script,</b> and the Tibetan <b>script.</b>|$|R

50|$|Panel script: a {{panel is}} a group of {{graphical}} objects named widgets. Each graphical object is also called a widget because it can trigger one or several <b>scripts.</b> When a widget invokes a <b>script,</b> the <b>script</b> must be a panel <b>script.</b> A panel <b>script</b> can invoke any types of <b>script,</b> panel or independent. Such a <b>script</b> is named Panel <b>script</b> and is stored in a library of panel <b>scripts</b> only.|$|R
5|$|The Microsoft Malware Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF files {{in favor of}} LNK files and PowerShell <b>scripting.</b> These LNK shortcut files install Locky ransomware by automating infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell <b>scripting.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Pather Panchali, Ray {{went on to}} make 36 more films, {{including}} feature films, documentaries and shorts. He {{worked on}} <b>scripting,</b> casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction and editing, as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, {{as was the case}} with Pather Panchali, on visual lyricism and strongly humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of development, Nihilistic wanted to support editing of the game by the user-community, having seen the {{benefits}} to the community while working on other games. Staff who worked on Jedi Knight knew the experience of creating a new, customized programming language called COG that gave the programmers the results they wanted but cost time and significant project resources. With Redemption, they wanted to incorporate an existing <b>scripting</b> engine that would more easily enable users to further develop the game instead of developing their own code again, which would consume months of development time. The team tested various languages, but became aware of another studio, Rebel Boat Rocker, which was receiving attention for its use of the Java language. Speaking to that studio's lead programmer Billy Zelsnak, Nihilistic decided to experiment with Java, having little prior knowledge of it. The language successfully integrated into the NOD engine without problems, providing a standardized and freely distributable <b>scripting</b> engine. Several designers were trained to use Java {{to allow them to}} build the several hundred scripts required to drive the game's storyline.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of development, in-game {{dialogue}} was recorded in Los Angeles by local Asian actors, but much of the audio was then re-recorded in Hong Kong through Drum Music, a specialist recording company. Audio design was complicated; <b>scripting</b> was handled in Vancouver and the recording was in Hong Kong. There were reservations among the developers about the language for the background dialogue; the sound design team eventually prevailed in using Hong Kong Cantonese over English.|$|E
5|$|Each worm {{begins the}} round with a {{specific}} amount of health, which is predefined by the chosen game options or by <b>scripting</b> in campaign levels. When hit with a weapon, the worm will lose health depending upon {{the power of the}} weapon and the directness of the hit. A worm can be killed either by exploding after having its health reduced to zero or by being knocked into the water around and below the level.|$|E

5|$|Moodu Pani, {{which was}} Balu Mahendra's third feature film and second in Tamil after Azhiyatha Kolangal (1979), {{was based on}} Idhuvum Oru Viduthalai Thaan, a 1978 Tamil-language novel by Rajendra Kumar, and The Collector, a 1963 English-language novel by John Fowles. It was {{produced}} by Raja Cine Arts, and edited by D.Vasu. In addition to <b>scripting</b> and directing the film, Mahendra also served as the cinematographer.|$|E
5|$|Originally made in Tamil {{and later}} in Hindi, Chandralekha spent five years in {{production}} (1943–1948). It underwent a number of <b>scripting</b> and cast changes, and was the most-expensive film made in India at the time. Vasan mortgaged all his property and sold his jewellery to complete the film, whose cinematographers were Kamal Ghosh and K. Ramnoth. The music, largely inspired by Indian and Western classical music, was composed by S. Rajeswara Rao and M. D. Parthasarathy with lyrics by Papanasam Sivan and Kothamangalam Subbu.|$|E
5|$|Possible remakes {{of one or}} more of the Hammer film adaptations {{were also}} mooted at various points during the 1990s, with Dan O'Bannon <b>scripting</b> a {{potential}} new version of The Quatermass Experiment in 1993, but again nothing was eventually filmed. In February 2012 Simon Oakes, president of the revived Hammer Films, announced that a new Quatermass film was in active development.|$|E
