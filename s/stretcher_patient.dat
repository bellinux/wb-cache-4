50|$|The {{most common}} {{metropolitan}} ambulance is the Mercedes Sprinters {{with the new}} livery (see image), which is intended {{to allow for a}} uniform vehicle across Australia. In rural areas, due to the need for extra traction or rough roads, 4x4 vehicles are common, based upon a Toyota Landcruiser Cab Chassis (1+1 modular 4x4s) or Toyota Landcruiser Troopcarrier. Both 4x4s carry one <b>stretcher</b> <b>patient</b> in addition to the normal equipment found on a typical Mercedes Sprinter. These vehicles (Mercedes Sprinters) are used by both Advanced Care Paramedics (ACPs) and Patient Transport Officers. The acute vehicles carry one (1) stretcher and the patient transport vehicles Mercedes Sprinters carry two (2). Toyota Hiace PTO vehicles with twin stretchers are also in use around the State, along with a variety of other transport vehicles including wheel-chair vehicles. Additionally, two stretcher Mercedes 519 acute ambulances operate around the state by ACP & CCPs, particularly in regional and rural areas.|$|E

Many were converted into waterbombers after being retired from military service.|$|R
50|$|The {{requirements}} for patients for flights {{and for the}} volunteer pilots who might provide them vary considerably from group to group. Patients typically must demonstrate financial or other compelling need. Generally most groups require that they must also be ambulatory, able to seit in a seat on a small plane and not require professional medical care entroute. Often a physician's signoff is required, along {{with that of a}} social worker at a medical facility attesting to financial need. There are also a few groups who do fly non-ambulatory (<b>stretcher)</b> <b>patients,</b> and at least one group has a fully certified charitable air ambulance.|$|R
