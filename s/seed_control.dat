Flowering culms are unsightly, prevent a uniform surface, and insure a continuous crop of seeds for the future. A field test was conducted to evaluate the effects of PROXY and a PROXY/PRIMO PGR tank mix for <b>seed</b> head <b>control.</b> Treatments were applied on three different dates in order to evaluate the degree of response of treatments and help define treatment window applications for future programs. PROXY when applied alone at 5 ounces/product/M produced a maximum of 60 % <b>seed</b> head <b>control</b> at 26 days after a single application on February 15, and 83 % <b>seed</b> head <b>control</b> at 27 days after a single application on March 1. A tank mix of PROXY/PRIMO (5. 0 / 0. 25 ounces/product/M) generally produced greater <b>seed</b> head <b>control</b> than PROXY alone.

40|$|AbstractObjective: In {{recent years}} {{bioabsorbable}} synthetic or biologic materials {{have been used}} to augment the pulmonary artery or the right ventricular outflow tract. However, each of these polymers has one or more shortcomings. None of these patch materials has been seeded with cells. Thus, we have tested a fast-absorbing biopolymer, poly- 4 -hydroxybutyric acid, with autologous cell seeding for patch augmentation of the pulmonary artery in a juvenile sheep model. Methods: Vascular cells were isolated from ovine peripheral veins (n = 6). Bioabsorbable porous poly- 4 -hydroxybutyric acid patches (porosity > 95 %) were seeded on 3 consecutive days with a mixed vascular cell suspension (21. 3 ± 1. 3 × 106 cells). Forty-five (± 2) days after the vessel harvest, 1 unseeded and 6 autologously <b>seeded</b> <b>control</b> patches were implanted into the proximal pulmonary artery. The animals received no postoperative anticoagulation. Follow-up was performed with echocardiography after 1 week and before explantation after 1, 7, and 24 weeks (2 animals each) for the <b>seeded</b> <b>control</b> patches and after 20 weeks for the nonseeded control patch. Results: All animals survived the procedure. Postoperative echocardiography of the seeded patches demonstrated a smooth surface without dilatation or stenosis. Macroscopic appearance showed a smooth internal surface with increasing tissue formation. Histology at 169 days demonstrated a near-complete resorption of the polymer and formation of organized and functional tissue. Biochemical assays revealed increasing cellular and extracellular matrix contents. The control patch showed a slight bulging, indicating a beginning dilatation. Conclusion: This experiment showed that poly- 4 -hydroxybutyric acid is a feasible patch material in the pulmonary circulation. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2000; 120 : 1158 - 68...|$|R
