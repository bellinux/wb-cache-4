50|$|Deficiency of sex hormones {{can result}} in {{defective}} primary or secondary sexual development, or withdrawal effects (e.g., premature menopause) in adults. Defective egg or sperm development results in infertility. The term hypogonadism usually means permanent rather than transient or reversible defects, and usually implies deficiency of reproductive hormones, with or without fertility defects. The term is less commonly used for infertility without hormone deficiency. There are many possible types of hypogonadism and several ways to categorize them. Hypogonadism is also categorized by endocrinologists by {{the level of the}} reproductive system that is defective. Physicians measure gonadotropins (LH and FSH) to distinguish primary from <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b> In primary hypogonadism the LH and/or FSH are usually elevated, meaning the problem is in the testicles, whereas in <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism,</b> both are normal or low, suggesting the problem is in the brain.|$|E

50|$|Hypogonadotropic {{hypogonadism}} (HH), {{also known}} as <b>secondary</b> or central <b>hypogonadism,</b> as well as gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency or gonadotropin deficiency (GD), is a medical condition characterized by hypogonadism due to an impaired secretion of gonadotropins, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), by the pituitary gland in the brain, and in turn decreased gonadotropin levels and a resultant lack of sex steroid production.|$|R
50|$|The orchidometer {{can be used}} to {{accurately}} determine size of testes. Discrepancy of testicular size with other parameters of maturation can be an important clue to various diseases.

50|$|Aromatase inhibitors like {{anastrozole}} {{prevent the}} conversion of testosterone into estradiol by aromatase. As {{only a very small}} fraction of testosterone is converted into estradiol, this does not affect testosterone levels, but it can prevent estrogenic side effects like gynecomastia that can occur when testosterone is administered at relatively high dosages. However, estradiol exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and, for this reason, prevention of its formation can reduce this feedback and disinhibit gonadal production of testosterone, which in turn can increase levels of endogenous testosterone. Testosterone therapy is sometimes combined with an aromatase inhibitor for men with <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> who wish to conceive children with their partners.|$|E

40|$|Hyperprolactinaemia is {{a common}} side effect in people {{receiving}} antipsychotics. The propensity to cause hyperprolactinaemia differs markedly between antipsychotics {{as a result of}} differential dopamine D 2 receptor binding affinity and ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Sexual dysfunction is common and under-recognised in people with severe mental illness and is in part caused by hyperprolactinaemia. There are a number of long term consequences of hyperprolactinaemia, including osteoporosis. Regular monitoring before and during treatment will help identify those developing antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinaemia. The treatment includes dose reduction and change in antipsychotic.

50|$|For {{both men}} and women, an {{alternative}} to testosterone replacement is low-dose clomifene treatment, which can stimulate the body to naturally increase hormone levels while avoiding infertility and other side effects that can result from direct hormone replacement therapy. This therapy has only been shown helpful for men with <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism.</b> Recent studies have shown it can be safe and effective monotherapy for up to 2 years in patients with intact testicular function and impaired function of the HPTA(http://www.nature.com/ijir/journal/v15/n3/full/3900981a.html). Clomifene blocks estrogen from binding to some estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, thereby causing an increased release gNRH and subsequently LH from the pituitary. Clomifene is a Selective Estrogen Reuptake Modulator (SERM).Generally clomifene does not have adverse effects at the doses used for this purpose.

40|$|CONTEXT: <b>Secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> {{is common}} in aging men; its natural history and predisposing factors are unclear. OBJECTIVES: The {{objectives}} were 1) to identify factors that predispose eugonadal men (T >/= 10. 5 nmol/L) to develop biochemical <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> (T /= 30 kg/m(2); odds ratio [OR] = 2. 86 [95 % confidence interval, 1. 67; 4. 90]; P /= 102 cm, respectively). Incident secondary hypogonadal men experienced new/worsening sexual symptoms (low libido, erectile dysfunction, and infrequent spontaneous erections). Recovery from <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> was predicted by nonobesity (OR = 2. 28 [1. 21; 4. 31]; P =. 011), weight loss (OR = 2. 24 [1. 04; 4. 85]; P =. 042), normal waist circumference (OR = 1. 93 [1. 01; 3. 70]; P =. 048), younger age (< 60 y; OR = 2. 32 [1. 12; 4. 82]; P =. 024), and higher education (OR = 2. 11 [1. 05; 4. 26]; P =. 037), but symptoms did not show significant concurrent improvement.

50|$|The {{apparent}} pituitary adenoma had {{at least}} three additional secondary effects on his medical condition besides causing acromegaly. First, his eyes show progressive misalignment, indicating the tumor grew laterally into the cavernous sinus and compromised the cranial nerves controlling eye muscle power. Second, he has a hairless face. Although potentially just a personal choice, {{in the presence of}} a large pituitary tumor, this is more likely due to testosterone deficiency. This condition results from the enlarging tumor interfering with the normal function of gonadotropin pituitary cells resulting in <b>secondary</b> hypogonadotropic <b>hypogonadism</b> and infertility. Third, in 1858 his lateral eyebrows were absent, indicating secondary hypothyroidism, also caused by the tumor compromising the function of the normal pituitary thyrotrope cells. The 1852 daguerreotype of Pio Pico may be the earliest objective image of acromegaly ever recorded since the disease was not recognized and named until Pierre Marie coined the term in 1886 while he was working at the clinic of Jean-Martin Charcot in Paris, France.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{modifications}} in lipid profile, blood glucose and pressure, and morphological {{aspects of the}} adrenal gland in animals with <b>hypogonadism</b> <b>secondary</b> to total bilateral epididymectomy and orchiectomy. Methods: Young and adult male Wistar rats were distributed into the following groups: Group 1 – control, animals submitted only to scrotal incision and suture. Group 2 – animals submitted to total bilateral epididymectomy and orchiectomy. After these operations, {{studies were carried out}} to analyze possible repercussions of hypogonadism. In Study A, serum levels of free testosterone were measured, along with the body weight and cortical thickness of the adrenal gland of 30 adult rats. In Study B, serum values of glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and HDL, LDL and VLDL fractions were measured in 20 young rats and 10 adult rats. In Study C, pressure of the caudal artery was measured by plethysmography in 24 adult animals. Rresults: Total bilateral epididymectomy and orchiectomy reduced serum levels of testosterone regardless of the age of the animal, and apparently does not modify macro- or microscopically the morphology of the adrenal gland. <b>Hypogonadism</b> <b>secondary</b> to total bilateral epididymectomy and orchiectomy did not modify the serum values of glucose, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL fractions.

40|$|Elderly {{men with}} low {{testosterone}} (T) levels are increasingly diagnosed to have partial androgen deficiency {{of the aging}} male (PADAM). Frequently, magnetic resonance imaging is performed to exclude pituitary adenoma. The value of GnRH testing to differentiate PADAM from <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> is unknown. Serum levels of T as well as LH and FSH at baseline and after GnRH were evaluated in the following groups: 1) 24 elderly men with low serum T (11. 7 nmol/liter), 3) 10 men with primary hypogonadism, 4) 24 men with <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism,</b> and 5) 13 healthy young volunteers. In elderly men, T levels were lower (P > 0. 001) and gonadotropin levels higher (P = 0. 03) compared with younger controls. LH and FSH response to GnRH was higher in elderly men with low T levels (PADAM) compared with elderly men with normal T levels (P = 0. 02 and P > 0. 001) {{in the presence of}} similar basal gonadotropin levels. To differentiate <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> from PADAM with a sensitivity of 100 %, a T less than 10 nmol/liter had a specificity of 50 %. This specificity was improved to 75 % by using a cutoff of {{less than or equal to}} 15 mU/liter increase of LH upon GnRH stimulation. Overall, decreased T levels and increased LH levels in elderly men suggest a primary Leydig cell dysfunction. In the subgroup of elderly men with low T levels, an increased LH response to GnRH with normal basal LH levels suggests additional, possibly hypothalamic changes. To exclude <b>secondary</b> <b>hypogonadism</b> in PADAM, diagnostic accuracy can be improved by using GnRH testing...|$|E
