40|$|In {{response}} to regulatory focus on secure retention of electronic records, businesses are using magnetic disks configured as write-once read-many (WORM) <b>compliance</b> <b>storage</b> devices to store business documents such as electronic mail for their mandated retention periods. A document {{committed to a}} <b>compliance</b> <b>storage</b> device cannot be altered or deleted even by a superuser until its retention period is over, and hence is secure from attacks originating from company insiders. Secure retention, however, is {{only a part of}} a document’s lifecycle: it is often crucial to properly delete documents once their retention period ends. It is relatively simple to delete a document, but much harder to remove its index entries from WORM. Yet if these entries are not obliterated, the contents of the deleted document can often be reconstructed. In this paper, we formally define secure deletion of document entries from an inverted index on <b>compliance</b> <b>storage.</b> We show that previously proposed deletion schemes for <b>compliance</b> <b>storage</b> index entries do not meet the objectives of secure deletion. On the other hand, the naive approach is secure but results in very poor query performance. To provide secure deletion of index entries without compromising lookup efficiency, we propose a novel indexing technique that employs noise terms, merged posting lists, and deletion epochs. Experiments with real-life data show that lookups in our scheme are 5 times faster than the naive approach. 1...|$|R

These formulae involve values of the creep compliance at times which are equally spaced on a logarithmic time scale. The ratio between succeeding times corresponds to a factor of two. A method is introduced by which bounds for the relative error of those formulae can be derived. These bounds depend on the value of the damping, tan δ. The calculation of the <b>storage</b> <b>compliance</b> is easier with the lower damping values. This calculation involves the value of the creep compliance at time t 0 = 1 /ω, and that of its derivative with respect to the logarithm of time in a rather narrow region around t 0. In contrast the calculation of the loss compliance is more difficult with the lower damping values. This calculation involves the value of the derivative of the creep compliance with respect to the logarithm of time in a broad interval around t 0. © 1969 Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag...|$|E
40|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling (FDM) {{additive manufacturing}} has been intensively used for many industrial applications {{due to its}} attractive advantages over traditional manufacturing processes. The process parameters used in FDM have significant influence on the part quality and its properties. This process produces the plastic part through complex mechanisms and it involves complex relationships between the manufacturing conditions {{and the quality of}} the processed part. In the present study, the influence of multi-level manufacturing parameters on the temperature-dependent dynamic mechanical properties of FDM processed parts was investigated using IV-optimality response surface methodology (RSM) and multilayer feed-forward neural networks (MFNNs). The process parameters considered for optimization and investigation are slice thickness, raster to raster air gap, deposition angle, part print direction, bead width, and number of perimeters. <b>Storage</b> <b>compliance</b> and loss compliance were considered as response variables. The effect of each process parameter was investigated using developed regression models and multiple regression analysis.

40|$|Viscoelastic {{properties}} of skin samples were measured in {{three types of}} mice (tight skin, Tsk, control and Mov- 13), that are known to differ with regard to content of type I collagen. The experimental design used uniaxial stretching and measured the creep response and the complex compliance. The creep response was measured directly. The complex compliance was determined using a Wiener-Volterra constitutive model for each sample. The models were calculated from data obtained by applying a stress input having a pseudo-Gaussian waveform, and measuring the strain response. The <b>storage</b> <b>compliance</b> of Mov- 13 and control skin were similar and were greater than Tsk (p< 0. 001). The loss compliance of each group was significantly different (p< 0. 001) from each other group;, Tsk had the lowest and control had the highest loss compliance. The phase angle of the Mov- 13 and Tsk were similar and were less than the controls (p< 0. 001). The creep response was fit with a linear viscoelastic model. None of the parameters in the creep model differed between groups. The results indicate that gene-targeted and mutant animals have soft tissue mechanical phenotypes that differ in complex ways. Caution should be exercised when using such animals as models to explore the role of specific constituents on tissue properties. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|<b>Compliance</b> <b>storage</b> servers are {{designed}} to meet organizational needs for trustworthy records retention, largely mandated by recent legislations such as HIPAA, SEC Rule 17 a, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These devices export a file-system-level interface, and enforce write-once readmany (WORM) semantics for file access. <b>Compliance</b> <b>storage</b> protects records from alteration, {{as long as they}} remain on the same storage server. However, the decades-long records retention requirements of recent legislation mean that a <b>compliance</b> <b>storage</b> server will often be obsolete long before the documents it contains can be destroyed. Unfortunately, records will be vulnerable to change during migration to a new server. Records are also vulnerable during retrieval, when they are taken off the server and “migrated” to the person or organization who needs them. In this paper, we propose techniques for trustworthy document migration and retrieval, by enhancing the storage servers with the capability to sign their files and directories. The proposed techniques can be used to verify that a migration was carried out properly, even across multiple migrations, deletions of expired documents, and changes in the content and structure of migrated directories. In our approach, file writers incur no performance penalty, which is important since compliance workloads are write-intensive. Migration incurs a reasonable 5 - 10 % space overhead and requires 24 msec processing time per file. The result of the migration can be verified at a rate of 24 msec per file by a trustworthy auditor (or ordinary user), who can then generate a certificate attesting to the correctness of the migration. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Compliance</b> <b>storage</b> is an {{increasingly}} important area for businesses faced with a myriad of new document retention regulations. Today, businesses have turned to Write-One Read Many (WORM) storage technology to achieve compliance. But WORM answers {{only a part of}} the compliance puzzle; in addition to guaranteed document retention, businesses also need secure indexing, to ensure auditors can find required documents in a large database, secure deletion to expire documents (and their index entries) from storage once they are past their expiry period, and support for litigation holds, which require that certain documents are retained pending the resolution of active litigation. We build upon previous work in <b>compliance</b> <b>storage</b> and attribute-based encryption to design a system that satisfies all three of these requirements. In particular, we design a new encrypted index, which allows the owner of a database of documents to grant access to only those documents that match a particular query. This enables litigation holds for expired documents, {{and at the same time}} restricts auditor access for unexpired documents, greatly limiting the potential for auditor abuse as compared to previous work. We show by way of formal security proofs that our construction is secure and that it prevents reconstruction attacks wherein the index is used to recover the contents of the document. Our experiments show that our scheme can be practical for large databases and moderate sizes of queries. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Spurred by {{financial}} scandals and privacy concerns, governments worldwide {{have moved to}} ensure confidence in digital records by regulating their retention and deletion.

We propose a compliant DBMS architecture and two refinements that illustrate the additional security that one can gain with only a slight performance penalty, with almost no modifications to the DBMS kernel.

Although insulin therapy {{has been the}} main treatment modality over decades but considering its cost and parenteral mode of administration, {{it does not seem}} to be appropriate, especially in low-resource settings. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of metformin in GDM and know its efficacy as well as adverse effect on foetus and mother. Methods: All pregnant women with GDM who were not controlled on medical nutrition therapy and required metformin therapy were included in the study. Careful monitoring of blood sugar was done. Development of any maternal or foetal complications and adverse effect were recorded. Results: A total of 2797 pregnant women were screened, of whom 233 (8. 3 %) were found to have GDM. Of the 64 women with GDM (28. 7 %) who required metformin therapy, majority (93. 8 %) achieved blood sugar control, whereas three (4. 7 %) women failed. Caesarean section rate was 54 per cent, and 15. 6 per cent neonates were large for gestational age. Only two (3. 1 %) women had gastrointestinal side effects which were minor and got resolved with time. No case of hypoglycaemia or perinatal mortality was reported. Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings indicate that metformin may be used as a safe and effective oral hypoglycaemic agent in GDM, especially in low-resource settings where cost, <b>storage</b> and <b>compliance</b> are logistic issues.

This QAPP follows DOE Quality Assurance Management System Guide for Use with 10 CFR 830 Subpart A, Quality Assurance Requirements, and DOE O 414. 1 C, Quality Assurance (DOE G 414. 1 - 2 A June 17, 2005). The Environmental Monitoring Program is located within the Environmental Operations Department. The Environmental Operations Department is {{responsible}} for ensuring that SNL/CA operations have minimal impact on the environment. The Department provides guidance to line organizations to help them comply with applicable environmental regulations and DOE orders. To fulfill its mission, the department has groups responsible for waste management; pollution prevention, air quality; environmental planning; hazardous materials management; and environmental monitoring. The Environmental Monitoring Program is responsible for ensuring that SNL/CA complies with all Federal, State, and local regulations and with DOE orders regarding the quality of wastewater and stormwater discharges. The Program monitors these discharges both visually and through effluent sampling. The Program ensures that activities at the SNL/CA site do not negatively impact the quality of surface waters in the vicinity, or those of the San Francisco Bay. The Program verifies that wastewater and stormwater discharges are in compliance with established standards and requirements. The Program is also responsible for compliance with groundwater monitoring, and underground and above ground <b>storage</b> tanks regulatory <b>compliance.</b> The Program prepares numerous reports, plans, permit applications, and other documents that demonstrate compliance...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy's Integrated Surveillance Program (ISP) is {{responsible}} for the storage and surveillance of plutonium-bearing material. During storage, plutonium-bearing material has the potential to generate hydrogen gas from the radiolysis of adsorbed water. The generation of hydrogen gas is a safety concern, especially when a container is breached within a glove box during destructive evaluation. To address this issue, the DOE established a standard (DOE, 2004) that sets the criteria for the stabilization and packaging of material for up to 50 years. The DOE has now packaged most of its excess plutonium for long-term <b>storage</b> in <b>compliance</b> with this standard. As part of this process, it is desirable to know within reasonable certainty the total maximum pressure of hydrogen and other gases within the 3013 container if safety issues and compliance with the DOE standards are to be attained. The principal goal of this investigation is to document the method and query used to estimate total (i. e. hydrogen and other gases) gas pressure within a 3013 container based on the material properties and estimated moisture content contained in the ISP database. Initial attempts to estimate hydrogen gas pressure in 3013 containers was based on G-values (hydrogen gas generation per energy input) derived from small scale samples. These maximum G-values were used to calculate worst case pressures based on container material weight, assay, wattage, moisture content, container age, and container volume. This paper documents a revised hydrogen pressure calculation that incorporates new surveillance results and includes a component for gases other than hydrogen. The calculation is produced by executing a query of the ISP database. An example of manual mathematical computations from the pressure equation is compared and evaluated with results from the query. Based on the destructive evaluation of 17 containers, the estimated mean absolute pressure was significantly higher (P. 10) between the mean pressures from DR and the calculation. The mean predicted absolute pressure was consistently higher than GEST by an average difference of 57 kPa (8 psi). The mean difference between the estimated pressure and digital radiography was 11 kPa (2 psi). Based on the initial results of destructive evaluation, the pressure query was found to provide a reasonably conservative estimate of the total pressure in 3013 containers whose material contained minimal moisture content...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{sought to}} compare urodynamic {{parameters}} of ambulatory versus non-ambulatory acute spinal cord injured (SCI) patients. PATIENTS & METHODS: A total of 60 patients (mean age 58 years, 27 women and 33 men) suffering from neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) due to acute SCI (duration of injury < 40 days) were prospectively evaluated. The patients were dichotomized {{according to the}} Mobility for Moderate Distances subscale of the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) version III into ambulatory (≥ 3) and non-ambulatory (< 3). Video-urodynamic parameters including maximum detrusor pressure during <b>storage</b> phase, bladder <b>compliance,</b> detrusor overactivity (DO), detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia (DESD), and vesico-uretero-renal reflux were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Of the 60 acute SCI patients, 17 were ambulatory and 43 non-ambulatory patients, respectively. Mean duration of injury at urodynamic investigation was 30 ± 8 days. The lesion level was cervical in 14, thoracic in 28, lumbar/sacral in 18 patients. Comparing unfavorable urodynamic parameters, {{no significant differences were}} found between ambulatory versus non-ambulatory patients: high-pressure system during storage phase (29 % versus 33 %, p= 0. 81), low-compliance bladder (12 % versus 7 %, p= 0. 54), DO (24 % versus 47 %, p= 0. 1), DESD (18 % versus 21 %, p= 0. 77), and vesico-uretero-renal reflux (0 % versus 5 %, p= 0. 36). CONCLUSIONS: In acute SCI, ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients have a similar risk for unfavorable urodynamic measures. Thus, we strongly recommend the same neuro-urological assessment including urodynamic investigations in all acute SCI patients independent of the walking ability...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} self-medication with antimicrobial drugs and to record the stored medicine at home. Methods: This is a descriptive study involving a questionnaire survey {{to determine the extent}} of drug storage and self-medication. A total of 300 household units in Basrah, Iraq were including in this study. A survey was conducted in 300 households in Basrah, southern Iraq to determine the availability, source, and storage conditions of medicinal drugs and the prevalence of self medication with antimicrobials. Results: The majority of households (94 %) stored drugs at home. A total of 4279 of different types of drug preparations were encountered, the mean being 14. 26 products/household. The results also showed that a minority of these drugs (31 %) were rationally prescribed. Hence only 31 % of the total drugs were for current use, while 45 % were leftovers and 23 % of the drugs were kept for future use. A large proportion of the stored drugs (66 %) was obtained from private pharmacies. Only 42 % of all the drugs were stored appropriately. Antibiotics, as a group was the most common drug stored and used at home (26 %). The results indicated that the level of education has influence over dose <b>compliance,</b> <b>storage</b> of expired drugs and drugs exchange. Furthermore, a majority of the families (78 %) admitted to practicing self-medication. The most common reasons for self-medication with antimicrobial drugs were associated with influenza, upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea and tonsillitis. Conclusion: There are numerous indications of inappropriate storage, self- medication, poor compliance and use of drugs that have been kept beyond their expiry date in Basrah, Iraq...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 17, 000 {{containers}} of solid transuranic and hazardous waste have been stored beneath earthen cover for {{nearly twenty years}} at Technical Area 4 of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The mission of the Transuranic Waste Inspectable Storage Project (TWISP) is to retrieve, vent, and place these containers into an inspectable <b>storage</b> configuration in <b>compliance</b> with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, prior to final disposition at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. Significant hazards currently identified with TWISP activities include: (1) the pressurization of drums; (2) volatilization of organic compounds (VOCs) within the drums; and (3) the generation of elevated hydrogen levels by certain waste streams. Based on the retrieval of 15 % of the waste containers, the following preliminary conclusions are presented to better protect personnel and the environment: (1) the likelihood of unvented drums becoming pressurized increases when environmental conditions change; (2) pressurized drums must be vented before they become bulging drums; (3) vented drums present the potential for VOC emissions and personnel exposure; (4) the vapor pressure and boiling points of waste stream constituents may be {{an indication of the}} likelihood of VOC emissions from stored hazardous waste containers; (5) large numbers of co-located vented drums may present the potential of increased hydrogen and VOC concentrations within unventilated storage domes; (6) monitoring and sampling vented drum storage domes is necessary to ensure that the levels of risk to drum handlers and inspection personnel are acceptable; (7) identifying, tagging, and segregating special case drums is necessary to prevent personnel overexposures and preclude environmental contamination; (8) applying rust inhibitor prolongs the useful life of waste containers stored under earthen cover; (9) acoustic drum pressure detection may be a viable tool in assessing elevated drum pressures...|$|R
