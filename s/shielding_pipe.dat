40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{three-dimensional}} model has been developed to study shielding gas in a laser welding process using computational fluid dynamics. Laser heating of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V was done by imposing a volumetric laser heat source. The model was implemented in the open source software OpenFOAM and applied to {{the investigation of the}} shielding gas behaviour over the base metal. Three different cases regarding the outlet shape of the <b>shielding</b> <b>pipe</b> were studied. In some laser welding processes a shielding plate is used to help protecting the welded area. The plate injects the additional shielding gas screen during the welding process. This plate is also considered in the modelling as the fourth case. The influence of the shape of the pipe outlet is discussed. The simulation results confirmed that the shielding plate can protect the welded area by covering the welding path with shielding gas. However, the simulation showed that the shielding gas leaving the plate flows towards the keyhole. It can thus bring some fumes over the keyhole which is not desired since it can make it difficult to track the welding with optical method...|$|E
30|$|Ultrasonic {{tomography}} (UT) is a non-invasive {{multiphase flow}} detection technique. In ultrasonic transmission tomography, reconstruction images {{are derived from}} a direct wave signal transmitted through the materials in the sensing area. The maximum values of the received direct wave from the reference pattern and the measured pattern are normally used to reconstruct the images. The speed of sound in the pipe wall and the materials in the sensing area affect the received signal. This in turn affects image quality—especially when the arrival time of the direct wave propagated through the sensing area {{is close to the}} arrival time of the direct wave propagated through the pipe wall. Here, we describe a novel shielding structure for ultrasonic transmission tomography. The relative variation ratio (RVR) is defined and used to evaluate the validity of the shielding structure. Larger RVR values imply better signal resolution and better signal suppression. A simplified mode is discussed including the influence of the shielding structure’s design parameters on the received direct wave. The optimized shielding structure size was determined. A comparison of the results between the normal pipe and the <b>shielding</b> <b>pipe</b> indicated that the RVR increased from 57.25 to 91.27 %. This proves that the shielding structure can suppress the effect of the signal from the pipe wall on received direct wave signals.|$|E

40|$|A new {{bolometer}} system {{using an}} infrared (IR) camera {{has been developed}} to measure the 3 -D structure of plasma radiation. This bolometer is called the IR imaging bolometer (IRIB) and of this diagnostic {{there are two types}} of the mask pattern that are known as the Segmented Mask Infrared Imaging Bolometer (SIB) and the Infrared Imagine Video Bolometer (IRVB). The incident radiation power coming from the plasma is collimated by an aperture and then absorbed by a thin foil located in the vacuum vessel. An IR camera outside of the vacuum vessel measures the temperature rise of the foil by means of the thermal radiation that passes through the vacuum interface by means of an IR vacuum window. Therefore, this system does not use electrical vacuum feed-throughts, and has a very simple design as described above, compared to conventional resistive bolometers. The difference between the two IR bolometer systems is in how the spatial channels are determined. The spatial channels of the SIB foil are physically defined and separated by the segmnented mask and those of the IRVB are determined by numerically dividing up the space on a single large foil exposed to the plasma radiation. 　　In this study, the design, production and installation of the two differential types of IRIB systems were made for LHD. 　　The mask was designed by taking into consideration the incident power of the radiation. For a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio of the detected foil temperature, a thin metal foil was used in the mask, aluminum with a thickness of aobut 0. 8 μm for the SIB system and gold with a thickness of about 1 μm for the IRVB system were selected. The other parts of these systems including the aperture plate, the light <b>shielding</b> <b>pipe</b> and the support of the IR camera were also designed. 　　After the installation of these IR bolometers, an in-situ calibraiton experiment was done. The common parameters for both systems, the calibration factor (K/mW) and the cooling decay times, were measured using a He-Ne laser as a known radiation source. For the SIB system, the calibration was done for each channel and for the IRVB system, a combination of in-situ calibraiton and model profile of the temperature rise of the foil was used. 　　Using these coefficients, the plasma radiation power density at the foil was calculated from the two-dimensional temperature distribution of the foil as measured by the IR camera. This resulted in images of the plasma radiation intensity with a sufficient signal and a time response to demonstrate the usefulness of this two-dimensional diagnostic system for plasma radiation. 　　The merits of the IR bolometer are as follows: 　　 1. Broad two-dimensional radiation brightness profiles are measured by one IR camera using infrared camera imaging technology. 　　 2. Electrical vacuum feed-throughs are not necessary in this system as the information aobut the foil temperature is passed as IR radiation through an IR vacuum window to the IR camera. 　　 3. One IR bolometer has over one hundred spatial channels. 　　 4. For the case of the IRVB, these spatial channels can be determined after the plasma experiments with flexibility depending on the experimental objectives and the conditions of the plasma. 　　In the latter half of this thesis, some experimental results are shown using the IRVB data. At present two IRVBs are installed, one at an upper port and the other at a tangential port, and began to measure the plasma radiation from two directions simultaneously during the 2001 - 2002 experimental campaign in LHD. Both of these IRVB biew the same field period and use a 1 μm thick gold foil. The frame rates of these IR cameras are 15 Hz for that with the tangential views and 60 Hz for that with the view from the upper port. 　　Initial measurements with the IRVB at the tangential port show the variations of the radiative structure as two-dimensional brightness profiles and are compared to data from resistive bolometer arrays, the visible CCD camera and the magnetic field line simulation. Images from two different limiter experiments show the source of the radiation to be localized near the plasma-limiting surface. Also comparison with the magnetic field line calculation shows the structure of a hollow radiation profile in the helical geometry of LHD during standard discharges using the natural helical divertor. In particular, a change in the radiation structure was observed as a continuous series of images or movie made by the IRVB as the discharge passes through assymetric radiative collapse. 　　Finally, using data from the two IRVBs, the three-dimensional position of the radiation source in the field of view of the two cameras was determined during the collapse. The brightness source region of the inboard asymmetric collapse was observed to be below the horizontal midplane at the vertically elongated cross-section of the plasma and this region continued in an axisymmetric manner in the field of view of the two cameras (approximately half of a field period). This was confirmed by qualitative agreement of the measured images with a calculation of the two-dimensional brightness profiles at each camera resulting from an axisymmetric model of the radiation source localized at the lower inboard side of the torus...|$|E

The need for making the most profitable use of the available sources of energy requires the full exploitation of plant operational capacity.

This third stage was {{a continuation of the}} on-site monitoring of full-scale pipe jacks during construction. Four schemes were monitored in different ground conditions: London clay, dense fine sand below the water table, stiff glacial till and soft alluvial clay. Pipe sizes ranged from 1000 mm to 1800 mm internal diameter and excavation methods included hand tools, slurry machines and an open face tunnel boring machine. The main objective was to collect information on jacking loads and stresses at the pipe-soil interface to provide a better basis for future designs. This was achieved by building twelve stress cells -capable of measuring total normal stresses, shear stresses and pore pressures - into the wall of a standard concrete jacking pipe that could be inserted anywhere in the pipe string. Jacking loads and forward movement of the pipe string were simultaneously recorded and the results were correlated against site activities, including lubrication operations, and tunnel alignment surveys. Another objective was to monitor the ground response by measuring displacements around the tunnel and ground pressures above the perpendicular to the intended line. Ground movements were measured using conventional surveying techniques for surface settlements, and inclinometer access tubes for sub-surface deformation. On one scheme, electro-levels were employed in a near-horizontal tube to measure centre line settlement as the tunnel bore advanced. Push-in spade cells and pneumatic piezometers were installed on two schemes to measure the change in horizontal pressures {{with the passage of the}} shield. Because of the myriad data collected, it has only been possible to present a summary of the results obtained. Jacking force records from all the monitored schemes - including the previous fieldwork stage - are presented. The pattern of jacking load build up and the magnitude of frictional resistance can differ significantly according to the type of ground and use of lubricants. Stress measurements at the pipe-soil interface show that the interaction between jacking loads, pipeline misalignment, stoppages, lubrication, excavation technique etc, is highly complex.

The reverse depicts Boone with rifle and powder horn, and a Native American—Swiatek and Breen noted that the frontiersman appears to be sending away the Indian, who bears a <b>shield</b> and peace <b>pipe,</b> apparently dramatizing Montgomery's desire to show the white man supplanting the Indian in Missouri [...] "as though this was something to brag about". The 1921 Report of the Director of the Mint describes the interaction as [...] "Daniel Boone, with powder and rifle, directing the attention of an Indian to the westward course of the white man". The Missouri Centennial half dollar, in having Boone on both sides, {{it is one of the}} few coins in United States numismatic history to have the same individual depicted on both sides. Other individuals so honored on commemoratives include Boone himself on the 1934-1938 Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar, Lafayette on the 1900-dated Lafayette dollar, the frontiersman on the 1936 Elgin, Illinois, Centennial half dollar, and Dwight Eisenhower on the 1990 Eisenhower commemorative dollar.|$|R
40|$|Reprocessing {{nuclear fuel}} is {{becoming}} more viable in the United States due to the anticipated increase in construction of nuclear power plants, the growing stockpile of existing used nuclear fuel, and a public desire {{to reduce the amount}} of this fuel. However, a new reprocessing facility in non-weapon states must be safeguarded and new reprocessing facilities in weapon states will likely have safeguards due to political and material accountancy reasons. These facilities will have state of the art controls and monitoring methods to safeguard special nuclear materials, as well as to provide real-time monitoring. The focus of this project is to enable the development of a safeguards strategy that uses well established photon measurement methods to characterize samples from the UREX+ 3 a reprocessing method using a variety of detector types and measurement times. It was determined that the errors from quantitative measurements were too large for traditional safeguards methods; however, a safeguards strategy based on qualitative gamma ray and neutron measurements is proposed. The gamma ray detection equipment used in the safeguard strategy could also be used to improve the real-time process monitoring in a yet-to-be built facility. A facility that had real-time gamma detection equipment could improve product quality control and provide additional benefits, such as waste volume reduction. In addition to the spectral analyses, it was determined by Monte Carlo N Particle (MCNP) simulations that there is no noticeable self <b>shielding</b> for internal <b>pipe</b> diameters less than 2 inches, indicating that no self shielding correction factors are needed. Further, it was determined that HPGe N-type detectors would be suitable for a neutron radiation environment. Finally, the gamma ray spectra for the measured samples were simulated using MCNP and then the model was extended to predict the responses from an actual reprocessing scenario from UREX+ 3 a applied to fuel that had a decay time of three years. The 3 -year decayed fuel was more representative of commercially reprocessed fuel than the acquired UREX+ 3 a samples. This research found that the safeguards approach proposed in this paper would be best suited as an addition to existing safeguard strategies. Real-time gamma ray detection for process monitoring would be beneficial to a reprocessing facility and could be done with commercially available detectors...|$|R
