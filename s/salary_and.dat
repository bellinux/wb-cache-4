5|$|As at 31 December 2010, the {{remuneration}} of ministers depended on which ministerial grade – from the lowest to the highest, MR4, MR3, MR2 or MR1 – they were at. Each minister's pay package {{was made up}} of fixed components (a monthly salary for 12 months, a non-pensionable annual allowance of one month's salary, a special allowance of one month's <b>salary,</b> <b>and</b> a public service leadership allowance of two months' <b>salary)</b> <b>and</b> variable components (an annual variable component, a performance bonus, and a gross domestic product (GDP) bonus). The annual variable component of up to one and a half month's salary was paid based on Singapore's economic performance. In years where economic performance was exceptional, a special variable payment was also made. Each minister's performance bonus was determined by the Prime Minister and could be up to 14 months' salary, though most good performers received the equivalent of nine months' salary. The GDP bonus depended on the nation's GDP growth rate. No bonus was paid if the rate was below 2%, and a maximum bonus of eight months' salary was paid if the rate was 10% or greater. In addition, ministers received the same medical benefits as civil servants. In 2010, the benchmark annual remuneration for an MR4-grade minister was $2,598,004, while the actual salary paid was $1,583,900. An MR1-grade minister's salary was $2,368,500. The annual pay of the Prime Minister was set at a fixed ratio to the MR4 <b>salary,</b> <b>and</b> was $3,072,200 in 2010. This included a fixed service bonus in lieu of a performance bonus since {{there was no one to}} assess the Prime Minister's individual performance. The fixed service bonus was the same as the performance bonus paid to a good performer at the MR4 grade.|$|E

Strong support from vice-chairman Antonín Čísek, and an ultimatum from prominent musicians among whom was Antonín Dvořák, ensured Smetana's survival. In January 1873 he was reappointed, with a bigger <b>salary</b> <b>and</b> increased responsibility as Artistic Director.|$|E

5|$|Where the Prime Minister's {{remuneration}} was concerned, the Committee {{recommended that}} it be pegged to twice of a MR4-grade minister's <b>salary</b> <b>and</b> doing away with the fixed service bonus. Instead, the Prime Minister will receive a larger national bonus. His annual bonus where the targets for the indicators have been met will be six months' <b>salary,</b> <b>and</b> 12 months' salary {{where they have been}} greatly exceeded. This will lead to a reduction in the Prime Minister's annual salary of 28% to $2.2 million (about US$1.7 million). Lee Hsien Loong said that he accepted the Committee's recommendations. He remains the best-paid head of government in the world, his proposed annual pay package exceeding that of the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Donald Tsang, the political leader with the second-highest salary in the world (around US$550,000), by about three times; and that of the President of the United States Barack Obama (US$400,000) by over four times.|$|E
