25|$|The CEGB {{took over}} project management, imposed light {{penalties}} {{in order not}} to cripple Fairey and International Combustion, and appointed British Nuclear Design and Construction (BNDC) as main contractor. In 1971, problems with corrosion of mild steel components in the first generation Magnox reactors gave the designers cause for concern. The Dungeness B restraint couplings - mechanical linkages that held the graphite core in place whilst allowing it to expand and contract in response to temperature changes - were made of mild steel and could be subject to the same corrosion. It was decided to replace them with components made from a new material. In 1972, problems were found with the galvanised wire that was used to attach thermocouples to stainless <b>steel</b> <b>boiler</b> tubes. During heat treatment of the tubes at temperatures up to 1,050°C, the galvanising zinc diffused into the tubes and made them brittle. The cost had by then risen to £170million. By 1975, the CEGB was reporting that the power station would not be completed until 1977 and that its cost had risen to £280 million. By 1979 the cost had risen further to £410 million. Reactor 1 first generated power on 3 April 1983, some 13 years behind schedule and at a cost of £685 million, four times the initial estimate in inflation-adjusted terms.|$|E

50|$|Stress {{corrosion}} cracking {{is a phenomenon}} where a synergistic action of corrosion and tensile stress leads to brittle fracture of normally ductile materials at generally lower stress levels. During stress {{corrosion cracking}}, the material is relatively unattacked by the corrosive agent, but fine cracks form within it. This process has serious implications on {{the utility of the}} material because the applicable safe stress levels are drastically reduced in the corrosive medium. Season cracking and caustic embrittlement are two stress corrosion cracking processes which affected the serviceability of brass cartridge cases and riveted <b>steel</b> <b>boilers</b> respectively.|$|R

5000|$|For {{much of the}} Victorian [...] "age of steam", {{the only}} {{material}} used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron, with assembly by rivetting. This iron was often obtained from specialist ironworks, such as at Cleator Moor (UK), noted for the high quality of their rolled plate and its suitability for high-reliability use in critical applications, such as high-pressure boilers. In the 20th century, design practice instead moved towards the use of steel, which is stronger and cheaper, with welded construction, which is quicker and requires less labour. It should be noted, however, that wrought iron boilers corrode far slower than their modern-day steel counterparts, and are less susceptible to localized pitting and stress-corrosion. This makes the longevity of older wrought-iron boilers far superior to those of welded <b>steel</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R
