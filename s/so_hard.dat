5|$|After {{the public}} and press {{interest}} garnered from Echo & the Bunnymen's debut album, Crocodiles, the band released the Shine <b>So</b> <b>Hard</b> EP which maintained their profile. Work then soon began on their second album, Heaven Up Here. Following musical differences between the band and Crocodiles producers Bill Drummond and David Balfe, Hugh Jones {{was brought in to}} produce Heaven Up Here. Jones had previously engineered Crocodiles and co-produced Shine <b>So</b> <b>Hard</b> with Drummond. Jones would later go on to produce the band's 2005 album Siberia. The band were also given an additional producer credit. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth in Wales during March 1981.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Estianty often {{fought with}} her classmates; in an {{interview}} with the weekly entertainment magazine Tabloid Nova, she recalled that, while at Yohanes Gabriel Catholic Elementary School in Surabaya, she once hit a classmate with an object <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that the classmate began to bleed profusely. She also took up music during this time, leading her marching band to win a national championship; she also took up the piano.|$|E
5|$|Davout, {{seeing the}} confusion, {{personally}} led the 57th Line Regiment (Le Terrible) forward {{until he had}} his horse shot from under him; he fell <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that General Sorbier reported him as dead. General Rapp arrived to replace him, only to find Davout alive and leading the 57th forward again. Rapp then led the 61stLine Regiment forward when he was wounded (for the 22ndtime in his career).|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{has helped}} autistic {{individuals}} bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing {{that they find}} <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.|$|E

5|$|Because I {{always try}} <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> {{to win and}} had my {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E
5|$|Florida State placekicker Sebastian Janikowski, who {{was born}} in Poland, also was a key {{component}} of the Seminoles' scoring offense. In his career at Florida State prior to the Sugar Bowl, Janikowski made 65 of 83field goal attempts, including 33 of his previous 38kicks of less than 50yards. Janikowski also handled kickoffs, kicking the ball <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that 57 of his 83kickoffs were touchbacks. Janikowski was considered to have the potential to be an early selection in the 2000 NFL Draft by several scouts for professional teams.|$|E
5|$|Later, Liz apologizes to Jenna for {{allowing}} her to be injured, and agrees to let Jenna tell the TGS writing staff about her role in an advertisement for a phone sex line. The writers find the ad online, and greatly enjoy watching it. Jack comes in while the writers are watching and laughs <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that he vomits. The laughter lifts Jack out of his bad mood, and he tells Liz what an important friend she is.|$|E

6000|$|... “Oh, Gawd, Gawd, wot ’ave I done?” he wailed; {{sitting down}} in the coal-box and nursing his new hurt by rocking back and forth. “W’y ’as all this come on me? It mykes me fair sick, it does, an’ I try <b>so</b> <b>’ard</b> to go through life ’armless an’ ’urtin’ nobody.” ...|$|R

5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, {{but that was not}} enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made the difference in the outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E
5|$|The Coalition forces—Austria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others—achieved several {{victories}} at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, but {{in northern}} Italy, they could neither lift nor escape the siege at Mantua. The efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian {{forces to the}} border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, leading to the formal Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to acquire, including the strategic river crossings at Hüningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} league {{pitching}} appearance of Musial's career occurred as {{a publicity stunt}} during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season. Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season. With Baumholtz batting right-handed {{for the first time}} in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and into the left field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.|$|E
5000|$|It {{comprises}} eight extinction [...] "datum points"—the {{first four}} being regularly spaced, every 30,797 years, and {{linked to the}} Milankovic obliquity cycle. The fifth and sixth probably reflect maxima in the precessional cycles, with periods of around 16.5 and 19 ka. The final two data are much further spaced, <b>so</b> <b>harder</b> to link with Milankovic changes.|$|R
60|$|He got two {{or three}} taps in the next round which made his 'ead ring, {{and then he got}} 'ome on the mark and follered it up by a left-'anded punch on Bill's jaw that {{surprised}} 'em both--Bill because he didn't think Ginger could hit <b>so</b> <b>'ard,</b> and Ginger because 'e didn't think that prize-fighters 'ad any feelings.|$|R

5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet is <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell of}} the object is <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that even a boron nitride drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, {{vibrations}} cause severe distress in people around the object. Quatermass interviews local residents and discovers ghosts and poltergeists have been common {{in the area for}} decades. A hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk through the wall of the artefact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E
60|$|Then Peter see {{the joke}} and 'e begun to laugh <b>so</b> <b>'ard</b> that Ginger 'ad to {{threaten}} to knock 'is {{head off to}} quiet 'im. Ginger laughed 'imself when they got outside, and at last, arter walking about till the shops opened, they got into a pawnbroker's and put old Isaac's clothes up for fifteen shillings.|$|R

50|$|On March 11, 1921, President Warren G. Harding {{appointed}} Esch to the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Senate {{did not act}} on {{the nomination}} before it recessed four days later <b>so</b> <b>Harding</b> granted Esch a recess appointment on March 21 and Esch took {{the oath of office}} on March 28, 1921. When the Senate reconvened, it confirmed Esch on April 18 by a vote of 52-3.|$|R
5|$|They are {{captured}} by the gangster Bully Bull the anthropomorphised bulldog, and although they escape once, he recaptures them, before Bluebell kicks him <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that he flies {{into the air and}} lands in Santa Barbara, where he is found and imprisoned by a sheriff. While Popol, Virginia, and Bluebell manage to make their way across a deep ravine, Bully Bull escapes from jail, and attacks Popol on a steep face. All of them fall down the cliff, but are rescued by firemen with a trampoline, and Bully Bull is once more apprehended.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{improvisation}} {{took place}} during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film. Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar {{near the end of the}} film, Gina Gershon hit her hand <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> when she knocked a gun from Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required stitches.|$|E
5|$|Aden meets Cassie and flirts with her. He {{ensures that}} her {{previous}} relationship with Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) is definitely over, then asks Cassie out. Her acceptance makes Ric jealous, so {{during a game}} of rugby, he tackles Aden <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that he is knocked unconscious and hospitalised. Aden's brother Sean (Gabriel Egan) attacks Ric in retaliation, and when Aden recovers, he gives Sean a false alibi. Cassie discovers the truth and breaks up with him. Aden next appears as a rival of Geoff's on the school football team. Annoyed that PE teacher Tony Holden (Jon Sivewright) favours Geoff, Aden spikes Geoff's drink and locks him in the boot of Tony's car. Tony throws Aden off the team, so Aden vandalises Geoff's grandfather's farm, and bullies Geoff and his younger sister Annie (Charlotte Best).|$|E
5000|$|He {{began his}} musical career as the bugler for the Boys Brigade in Paris. Since Paris High School {{did not yet}} have a band, he became a bugler for the Paris High School Cadets. Also, he and some of his school mates formed a band called the [...] "Bum Notes Band". Each member of the band played an {{unfamiliar}} instrument <b>so</b> <b>Harding</b> chose the baritone.|$|R
