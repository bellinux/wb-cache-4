5|$|Depending on the {{interest}} that the applicant seeks to represent, standing {{can be categorized}} as either private or public standing. Applicants must establish they have private standing if they seek to represent personal interests. In contrast, an applicant who seeks to represent {{the interest}}s of a larger group or {{the public at large}} must establish he or she has public or representative standing. Where private standing is concerned, the Singapore courts have not yet directly addressed the issue of the standing required to obtain a declaration in an administrative law case, but where constitutional claims are concerned the Court of Appeal held that three elements must exist: (1) the applicant must have a real interest in bringing the case, (2) there must be a real controversy between the parties to the case, and (3) a personal right possessed by the applicant must have been violated. The Court also suggested that the same test applied to applications for prerogative orders. The legal position on public standing in administrative law cases is indeterminate as, to date, no applicant has sought to rely on public standing to obtain leave for judicial review. In constitutional law cases, the Court has drawn a distinction between public and private rights, and held that people will not have standing to vindicate public rights unless they have suffered <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> and have genuine private interests to protect or further.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} in Mega Man Legends 2 is {{very similar}} to that of its predecessor and has a few changes. The player controls the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt in his explorations through ruins and fights against Reaverbots. The ruins, however, are from various islands in contrast to the prequel in which most ruins belonged to Kattelox Island. The player is able to travel to other islands with Roll's ship, the Flutter, although he can only enter certain islands by completing different missions. Unlike Mega Man Legends in which the player could enter to different ruins by having the approval of Kattelox's mayor, here the player must pass different tests in order to win Digger licenses from a specific level. The license allows Mega Man to enter into ruins which are forbidden to lower-class Diggers. Additionally, when winning a license, the Reaverbots' health is higher, but once they are destroyed, they drop more refractors' shards which are used in shops to buy items. Mega Man's interactions with other characters can also affect the character's state depending whether he is good with other people or makes them angry. Mega Man is also able to grab objects or people which help the player to complete missions. Mega Man can also suffer from <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> when fighting Reaverbots or touching fields that damage him such as lava. If the player equips Mega Man specific body part, he will become invulnerable to such states. Another addition is the underwater dungeon, in where the objects' weight is reduced and Mega Man can jump higher. The energy of the special weapons, which are developed by Roll using unusable items, are now shown in two energy bars, one green and one blue. The blue bar indicates how much energy the weapon has, while the green bar shows how much energy is consumed when the weapon is used.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, in Tan Eng Hong the Court of Appeal drew a {{distinction}} between public rights which are [...] "held and vindicated by public authorities" [...] and a private right which is [...] "held and vindicated by a private individual". It took the view that [...] "f a public right was involved, the applicant must show that he had suffered <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> {{as a result of}} the public act being challenged and that he had a genuine private interest to protect or further". Relying on this, in Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v. Attorney-General (2012) the High Court held that the applicant, who was an ordinary citizen, had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of a contingent loan of US$4billion offered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to the International Monetary Fund to assist the latter in dealing with an ongoing financial crisis and to promote global economic and financial stability. Such a restrictive approach to standing is consistent with the green-light approach to administrative law adopted by the Singapore courts.|$|E

50|$|<b>Special</b> <b>damages</b> {{can include}} direct losses (such as amounts the {{claimant}} {{had to spend}} to try to mitigate problems) and consequential or economic losses resulting from lost profits in a business. <b>Special</b> <b>damages</b> basically include the compensatory and punitive damages for the tort committed {{in lieu of the}} injury or harm to the plaintiff.|$|R
2500|$|Thus, upon {{a review}} of the pre-1977 English and present-day Australian case law, the Court of Appeal {{concluded}} that <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> is not limited to actual pecuniary loss, and it is not required that the applicant alone has suffered damage. An applicant asserting a violation of a public right must show that his [...] "personal interests are directly and practically affected over and above the general class of persons who hold that right". The Court declined to offer more specific guidelines as the <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> requirement is necessarily fact sensitive, dependent on individual cases.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{noted that}} there is [...] "no {{categorical}} answer" [...] as to what constitutes <b>special</b> <b>damage.</b> The Court considered the view of Peter Cane, an English academic, who had argued that <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> was either damage to the common interests to {{all members of the}} public but suffered to a greater degree by the applicant, or damage qualitatively different from that suffered by the public. The Court also agreed with the High Court of Australia's decision in Australia Conservation Foundation Inc. v. Commonwealth (1980) which equated the <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> criterion to a requirement for [...] "special interest" [...] in {{the subject matter of the}} action. However, special interest cannot be a [...] "mere intellectual or emotional concern". If the applicant's action succeeds, he or she must gain some advantage [...] "other than the satisfaction of righting a wrong, upholding a principle or winning a contest". If the application fails, he or she must suffer some disadvantage [...] "other than a sense of grievance or a debt for costs".|$|E
2500|$|While {{the earlier}} case of Tan Eng Hong had {{established}} {{the test for}} standing, namely that [...] " [...] a public right was involved, the applicant must show that he had suffered <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> {{as a result of}} the public act being challenged and that he had a genuine private interest to protect or further", the Court of Appeal did not elaborate on the meaning of [...] "special damage" [...] in that case as it did not concern a public right.|$|E

2500|$|After the {{by-election}} was held, Vellama's {{basis for}} bringing the action was rendered factually moot. Thus, she could only claim a public right, rendering her [...] "no {{different from any other}} citizen interested in the proper construction of Art 49". On the facts, Vellama was unable to show any <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> or special interest over and above that enjoyed by other members of the public in having the case heard; her interest {{was no more than a}} [...] "general desire to have Art 49 interpreted by the court". Thus, the Court dismissed the appeal on the basis of Vellama's lack of standing.|$|E
2500|$|The Singapore Court of Appeal {{endorsed}} the reasoning in Boyce v. Paddington Borough Council (1902) which explained the applicable test for standing regarding public rights. Since public rights {{are shared by}} everyone in common because they arise from public duties owed by public authorities to the general class of persons as a whole, an applicant must prove [...] "special damage" [...] peculiar to himself or herself to distinguish his or her claim from those of other potential litigants in the same class. The Court justified the need for <b>special</b> <b>damage</b> in cases involving public rights to prevent frivolous or vexatious actions. Otherwise, courts will be swamped by an array of actions raised by [...] "mere busybodies and social gadflies, {{to the detriment of}} good public administration" [...] where the burden of bearing costs may not be a sufficient deterrence.|$|E
2500|$|The Court of Appeal applied its {{judgment}} in Vellama {{in the later}} case of Jeyaretnam Kenneth Andrew v. Attorney-General (2013). Expanding {{on the meaning of}} <b>special</b> <b>damage,</b> the Court noted [...] "that 'special damage' might also possibly encompass those rare and exceptional situations where a public body has breached its public duties in such an egregious manner that the courts are satisfied that {{it would be in the}} public interest to hear it". In the National Federation case, the House of Lords also suggested the theoretical possibility that an ordinary taxpayer might have standing to bring a claim if a public authority had failed to perform its statutory duty, but it would have to be [...] "a most extreme case". Similarly, erring on the side of caution, the Court specified that this is [...] "a very narrow avenue which concerns only extremely exceptional instances of very grave and serious breaches of legality... should not in any way be taken as a spurring move towards the surge of public interest litigation".|$|E

50|$|A {{personal}} injury claim {{consists of two}} main sections: General <b>damages</b> and <b>Special</b> <b>damages</b> (see Damages), Gratuitous care is a head of claim that comes under <b>Special</b> <b>damages.</b> <b>Special</b> <b>damages</b> normally encompasses expenses that the injured party has paid for (for example taxi fares where he/she {{has not been able}} to drive to places as normal), or of monies he/she would have received but has not due to his/her injuries (for example loss of earnings). However, in the case of Gratuitous care the injured party can claim for the care and help he/she has received by friends and/or family even though he/she has probably not actually paid over any money. The law recognises that this care and help provided by friends and family is necessary and would otherwise need to be paid for, and therefore enables the injured party to claim just as he/she would have done if the care had been purchased from an outside agency.|$|R

50|$|It {{was clear}} to the court, from the {{language}} of the Environment Conservation Act, that the legislature intended the provisions of the Act to operate {{in the interests of the}} public at large.

5000|$|Factual {{causation}} {{is established}} {{by means of}} the [...] "but-for" [...] (or conditio sine qua non) test. The test for legal causation asks whether the causal connection between the breach and the loss is sufficiently close to justify the imposition of liability. General damages are generally and objectively foreseeable as flowing from the type of breach and are thus not too remote and are recoverable. <b>Special</b> <b>damages</b> would not normally be expected to flow from the type of breach in question and are thus presumed to be too remote unless exceptional circumstances are present. In terms of the convention principle, <b>special</b> <b>damages</b> can be claimed where the parties entered into the contract {{on the basis of their}} knowledge of the special circumstances, and thus can be taken to have agreed that there would be liability for damages arising from such circumstances.|$|R
