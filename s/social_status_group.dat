50|$|Another {{way people}} {{rationalize}} {{the status quo}} is through the use of stereotypes. When people perceive threats to the predominant system, they are more inclined to cling to and back the existing structure, and one way of doing so is by means of endorsing stereotypes that rationalize inequality. If one considers oneself a member of a higher <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>group</b> (economic standing, race, gender) he or she will hold favorable stereotypes about their group and less positive ones toward lower status outgroups. As perceived legitimacy of the system or threat to it increases, members of both disadvantaged and advantaged groups will be more motivated to utilize stereotypes as explanatory rationalizations (no matter how weak) for unequal status differences. Those that belong to disadvantaged groups will tend to associate positive characteristics (favorable stereotypes) to high status members and lead low status group members to minimize negative feelings about their low status. Thus, stereotype endorsement as system justification is consensual and holds a palliative function. This is true for both the ingroup and outgroup. Stereotypes also deflect blame of unfair status differences from the system and instead, attribute inequality to group traits or characteristics. Such rationalization for inequality via stereotyping is said to be what makes political conservatives happier than liberals. In a recent research study on the connection of system justification beliefs and ambivalent sexism, researchers found that benevolent sexism beliefs related to higher life satisfaction through system justification. That is, both men and women may be motivated to hold benevolent sexism beliefs because such beliefs may help to promote the notion that {{the status quo is}} fair, which in turn can maintain life satisfaction.|$|E

40|$|Background Low {{socioeconomic}} status (SES) {{has been linked}} to increased risk of hypertension, a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. How the risk is altered by intergenerational social mobility is not well known. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate parental SES, adult SES and the intergenerational social mobility in relation to hypertension risk. Methods By using data from the Swedish Twin Registry, the authors obtained information about both parental and adult SES and hypertension in 12 030 individuals born from 1926 to 1958. Generalised estimating equations were used to estimate ORs with 95 % CIs. Results Low parental SES was associated with increased odds of hypertension (OR 1. 42, 95 % CI 1. 14 to 1. 76). Low SES in adulthood was associated with increased odds for women but not for men (OR 1. 40, 95 % CI 1. 15 to 1. 70 and OR 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 83 to 1. 24, respectively). Compared with the stable low <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>group,</b> the upward mobile group had lower odds of hypertension (OR 0. 82, 95 % CI 0. 70 to 0. 97). Compared with the stable high <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>group,</b> the results for the downward mobile group indicated an increased risk. A co-twin case-control analysis indicated that the results were independent of familial factors. Conclusions These findings suggest that the risk of hypertension associated with low parental social status can be modified by social status later in life. Possibly, this could be targeted by public health or political interventions. As parental social status has an impact on later health, such interventions should be introduced early...|$|E

40|$|Investigations in {{biological}} anthropology of archaeological samples of human remains are uniquely positioned to infer {{the effects of}} social, political, and economic conditions and transformations directly from the individuals who experienced these changes during their lifetimes. This evidence, {{in the form of}} skeletal and dental indicators, provides a partial record of individual biology and life ways. Members of the community buried at the cemetery of Puruchuco-Huaquerones witnessed the expansion, apogee and collapse of the Inca empire (A. D. 1476 – 1532). This investigation hypothesizes that the dissolution of power from the regional polities to the Inca state administrators installed in this area may have resulted in changes in health for members of the community. This examination of health from skeletal remains of the different <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups</b> interred at the cemetery of Puruchuco-Huaquerones will test whether or not a health disparity exists between <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups.</b> A total of 207 individuals were examined for evidence of nonspecific indicators of stress, fractures, dental caries, and degenerative joint disease. The mortuary contexts of an adult subsample of these individuals were examined in order to explore the evidence of social differentiation in the community interred at the cemetery of Puruchuco-Huaquerones. Several aspects of the burials provide evidence of social differentiation: (1) presence of false head, (2) shell offerings, specifically Spondylus, (3) metal offerings, and (4) ceramic offerings. These features present evidence of elaborated ritual mortuary practice and social differentiation described by ethnohistorical sources of Inca society. The results of this investigation indicate that no statistically significant differences in morbidity exist between the different <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups</b> defined from the mortuary treatment and offerings from the individuals buried in the cemetery of Puruchuco-Huaquerones. The association between <b>social</b> <b>status</b> and health is not apparent in this sample of skeletal remains and health differences between different <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups</b> are significantly less hierarchical than anticipated. Inca social organization is multidimensional and this investigation represents a nascent understanding of the significance of the patterning of mortuary behavior for uncovering social organization and evidence of social differentiation at the Late Horizon cemetery of Puruchuco-Huaquerones. ...|$|R

Here, we tested whether and how behavioural type influences the establishment of social ties using the cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. In a habitat saturation experiment with individuals pre-tested for behavioural type, we first analysed whether behavioural type affected the likelihood of settlement (i. e. <b>social</b> <b>status),</b> <b>group</b> sizes, {{and the types of}} dominant and subordinate individuals accepted as group members. Corrected for effects of body size and sex, the behavioural type did not affect settlement. However, bold dominant males only accepted smaller females, and grouped with bold subordinates, while shy dominant males accepted larger females than themselves, and grouped with shy subordinates. Second, we analysed the relationships between behavioural type and the aggressiveness or affiliation social network. Behavioural type significantly affected the number and quality of connections within the two networks. We show that behavioural types affect group composition, social networks and status achieved, in interaction with body size.

Oral health may be directly associated with general health status, as well as related to diet. The aims are to assess dietary, self-reported oral health and socio-demographic predictors of general health status among older adults. DESIGN: Cross-sectional mailed survey. Participants: A random sample of adults in Adelaide, South Australia aged 60 - 71 years in 2008. MEASUREMENTS: Health status was measured using the EuroQol (EQ- 5 D). Compliance with dietary guidelines was measured using a 16 -item index of grocery purchasing. Oral health was measured by self-reported number of teeth, oro-facial pain and sore gums. Socio-demographics included age, sex, birth place and subjective social status. RESULTS: Responses were collected from n= 444 persons (response rate = 68. 8 %). The average EQ- 5 D score was 0. 80 (se= 0. 01). Unadjusted analyses showed (p< 0. 05) EQ- 5 D scores were lower in the bottom tertile of compliance with dietary guidelines, for those reporting oro-facial pain, sore gums and fewer teeth, and for the lower <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>group.</b> Multivariate analyses showed (p< 0. 05) lower compliance with dietary guidelines was associated with poorer general health (beta=- 0. 10), as was oro-facial pain (beta=- 0. 11), sore gums (beta=- 0. 17), and lower social status (beta=- 0. 28).

40|$|With {{the rapid}} and {{sustained}} economic growth since the Reform and Opening of 1978, Chinese travelers have become a substantial market segment of the resort industry. As the first generation born after the Reform and Opening and the One Child policy, China 2 ̆ 7 s Generation Y, or the Post- 80 s generational cohort has entered into young adulthood and begun to play major roles on the social stage as employees, future leaders and for sure, consumers. However, few empirical resort studies have targeted this generation. This research investigates China 2 ̆ 7 s Post- 80 s consumers and their attribute preferences in resort selection. In addition, the study also compares the Post- 80 s with previous generations in resort consumption, attribute preferences and personal values and explores {{an explanation of the}} Post- 80 s resort attribute preferences and possible generational differences through an investigation of the relationship with personal values. Quantitative data were collected through a web-based survey with Chinese resort consumes. The results suggest that not many {{significant differences were found between}} the Post- 80 s and their predecessors in resort consumption and attribute preferences and the Chinese resort market is relatively homogeneous. Unlike traditional western resort vacationers, Chinese resort consumers stay at resort for a short period and engage in tourism activities such as sightseeing more than resort activities. When selecting resort, both the Post- 80 s and previous generations attach most importance to resort quality and basic hotel attributes and least importance to resort-featured entertainment and recreational facilities and programs. This can be linked to the confounding influence of the shared traditional Chinese values among the Post- 80 s and their predecessors, such as pursuing a sense of security, self-esteem, <b>social</b> <b>status,</b> <b>group</b> orientation, and conservatism. Despite, the study also found that compared with previous generations, the Post- 80 s are more influenced by western values and are more self-oriented. They place higher importance on resort ambience, room features, and efficiency and are willing to pursue their self-identity, personal pleasure and enjoyment, and interaction with others through those attributes.

40|$|This thesis’ {{original}} contribution to knowledge is {{to indicate the}} unique contribution of qasbah ­‐based Urdu newspapers {{to the emergence of}} an Urdu public sphere in early 20 th century South Asia, using as a primary lens the Urdu newspaper Madīnah. In doing so, this thesis will shed light on debates relating to Muslim religious identity, urban life, social status, and gender reform. Madīnah newspaper was published in Bijnor qasbah in Bijnor district, UP, from 1912 onwards. By the early 20 th century, elite, literate qasbah dwellers increased their attachment to their ashrāf identity, even as the definition of that <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>group</b> was being transformed. The nature of ashrāf conceptions of the qasbah in the Urdu newspaper conversation sheds light onto the nature of the Urdu public sphere, complicating existing narrative explanations of UP Muslim identity transformations. In the 12 years that constitute the span of the study, international developments such as the Italo-­‐Turkish War, the Balkan Wars, and World War I, with domestic transformations in municipal policies and the activism of some Hindu groups motivated Muslims to redefine their place in early 20 th century society. At the same time, the early 20 th century saw the rising prominence of the qasbah as a centre of spiritual and cultural life among ashrāf Muslims. World War I and the non-­‐cooperation movement threatened the British Empire’s hold on South Asia. In the midst of these shifting sands stood the city of Bijnor, a backwoods qasbah in the district of the same name. Bijnor’s publication Madīnah provided a regional platform for scholars, laymen, and poets to discuss their place in the new order. As part of a network of literary publications exchanged between qasbahs {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century, Madīnah shaped and complicated gender boundaries, religious identity, social status, and political alliance, all in the service of the Muslim ummah, or community. This thesis places Madīnah in the context of the broader Urdu newspaper market and the incipient newspaper culture of qasbahs, which both reflected the broadened geographic horizon of the qasbatī ashrāf and placed a premium on the qasbah as a place set apart from the city. After laying this foundation, the thesis turns to the place of Islam in qasbah newspapers and Madīnah. Newspapers reflected a division among ashrāf regarding the centrality of Islam in elite culture, revealing an ideological division between the qasbah and major urban centres Delhi, Lucknow, and Calcutta. Madīnah and other newspapers sought to establish an indelible link between Islam and ashrāf identity, in contrast to some urban newspapers, which sought to lay the groundwork instead for a secular, nationalized Muslim identity. This thesis then turns to the expanding geographic horizons of Madīnah newspaper, both enabled by novel technology and neutralized as a threat by careful framing of international and trans-‐regional content. The subsequent chapter deals with Madīnah 's Women’s Newspaper, which demonstrated a trend toward gender ventriloquism in reformist approaches to gender. Many articles penned ostensibly by women had male authors; Madīnah 's articles expressed a complex set of reactions to intimate female experiences, including curiosity, fascination, and anxiety. Qasbah newspapers offer new avenues for insight into the tensions that characterized the Urdu public of the early 20 th century. This thesis highlights the character of qasbatī ashrāf 's engagement with the broader literary conversation via newspapers during a time of dramatic social transformation, in the process contributing to the form of the Urdu public sphere.

40|$|Across {{the life}} course, {{substance}} use is highest in adolescence and young adulthood in the U. S. Although substance use declines with age, {{a significant number}} of young adults go beyond normative to problematic use. Despite the strong relationship between low <b>social</b> <b>status</b> and poor health, substance use varies by <b>social</b> <b>status</b> in inconsistent ways. Smoking is higher among lower <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups.</b> Alcohol use is higher among higher <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups.</b> Substance use is often higher among Whites compared to racial/ethnic minorities. Problematic substance use is often higher among minorities compared to Whites. These inconsistent patterns may be due to drug type (e. g., smoking vs. alcohol) or difficulty in assessing <b>social</b> <b>status</b> during the transition to adulthood and across race/ethnicity. The goal of this dissertation is to ascertain the effects of <b>social</b> <b>status</b> on substance use behaviors across race/ethnicity during the transition to adulthood using secondary data analysis of three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Using social stratification theories and the life course perspective, this study conceptualized <b>social</b> <b>status</b> as a life-course construct from adolescence (ages 12 - 17) to young adulthood (ages 18 - 26) and adulthood (ages 24 - 32). Furthermore, <b>social</b> <b>status</b> was examined across the domains of economic, human, and social capitals. Cigarette smoking and heavy episodic alcohol use served as the key outcomes. Through a person-oriented framework, latent class analysis captured {{the ebb and flow of}} <b>social</b> <b>status</b> advantages and disadvantages with four latent groups for the domains of economic and social capitals, and five groups for the domain of human capital. These latent classes were substantively similar across Whites, Blacks, and Latinos; however, variations within subgroups differed. Regardless of domain or race/ethnicity, persistently low <b>social</b> <b>status</b> had higher smoking prevalence when compared to other groups. For heavy episodic drinking, there was no clear pattern across domains and race/ethnicity, which suggest a complex picture that may be difficult to disaggregate. Overall, these findings highlight several dimensions of <b>social</b> <b>status</b> that present opportunities to reduce substance use disparities, and reveal life-course <b>social</b> <b>status</b> groupings from adolescence to adulthood that may provide important avenues to prevent problematic substance use...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{relationships between}} the social and physical environments of a village on Butaritari atoll in Kiribati. The system of ambilineal descent and land inheritance obtaining there results in complex networks of genealogical relationships which affect most aspects of social life, including land rights. While previous studies conducted in Kiribati have recognised the intimate connection between genealogy and land rights, none has investigated its ramifications for the distribution of land rights within a community. In contrast, this study engages that question as a central concern using a framework which integrates Bourdieu's concepts of social space, field and habitus with post-neo-Darwinian ideas {{about the relationship between}} organism and environment. The social space was found to be primarily structured by relationships based upon genealogy and secondarily by age and gender, each of which constituted a field within the wider social space. The genealogical field was defined by a network of positions, each representing a particular descent group. In accordance with the prevailing system of ambilineal descent, residents could belong to more than one descent group and it was upon the resulting networks of relationships between descent groups that the disposition of those groups within the genealogical field was defined. Because land-use rights were associated with genealogical connections the reconstruction of the genealogical field encompassing all of the village residents was a necessary precursor to discovering the distribution of those rights and the genealogical field was a central point of articulation between the social and physical spaces. The fields of age and gender relations provided further points of articulation between the social and physical spaces, the natures of which are examined through discussion of the material culture of the village and village and island politics. Despite a contemporary ideology of egalitarianism there were vestiges of a former hierarchy of <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups.</b> While the inter-group obligations, rights and responsibilities associated with this hierarchy were no longer practised, the association of contemporary residents with those <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups</b> bore a relationship to their position within the genealogical field and the amounts of land to which they shared rights...|$|R

The early oral health environment and <b>social</b> <b>status</b> and gender were related to oral health in 1983 by multiple regressions. The impact of <b>social</b> <b>status</b> was studied in combined datafiles from 1983 and 2006. RESULTS: The oral health environment in childhood was important for adults' oral health. The attention from parents and the local environment lead to a better oral health outcome in adulthood. <b>Social</b> <b>status</b> affected choices leading to better oral health. Regular dental visits were important especially for the eldest birth-cohort. Good oral health behaviours early and during adulthood were also important for oral health. Judged by number of tooth surfaces the difference between <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups</b> had not increased by 2006. CONCLUSIONS: A life-course perspective provides an opportunity to understand oral health over time. The present study supports the assumption that oral health is continuously exposed to environmental and behavioural risks that lead to accumulated diseases in the dental tissues...|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] As {{there is}} a <b>social</b> <b>status</b> {{gradient}} in chronic disease mortality in Australia, this study aimed to establish whether there were substantial differences among socioeconomically defined groups with respect to food choice and nutrient intake, {{in the context of}} risk of nutrition related chronic diseases. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS [...] Cross sectional data were collected from a randomly selected population sample of 1500 urban Australian adults. Data were collected by postal questionnaire, which included an assessment of dietary intake and questions on sociodemographic details. Three measures of social position were collected: occupation, educational status, and income status. Occupation was interpreted both on a continuous, prestige scale, and also as categorical occupational groupings. MAIN RESULTS [...] The study achieved a 70 % response rate. Higher <b>social</b> <b>status</b> was generally associated with healthier dietary intakes, with lower fat and refined sugar densities, and higher fibre densities, but also with higher alcohol density. No differences were found in salt, polyunsaturated fat, protein, or complex carbohydrate densities across groups. Food intake differences were also found between occupational <b>status</b> <b>groups,</b> with the upper social groups tending to consume more wholegrain cereal foods, low fat milk, and fruit, and less refined cereal foods, full cream milk, fried meat, meat products, and discretionary sugar; but also more cheese and meat dishes. CONCLUSIONS [...] Although this study did show statistically significant differences across <b>social</b> <b>status</b> <b>groups</b> in relation to nutrient and food intakes, these differences were small compared to the disparity between intakes of all groups and the recommended patterns of intake, and {{did not appear to be}} great enough to be a major explanatory variable in differences in disease risk across groups...|$|R
