In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic Amanita species, {{most of which are}} found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing A. bisporigera, A.subjunquillea var. alba, A.exitialis, and A.virosa.

40|$|Background: The {{so-called}} {{gold standard}} for treatment of periprosthetic joint infection following total knee arthroplasty is two-stage reimplantation. However, {{it is unclear whether}} use of static or articulating antibiotic-impregnated <b>spacers</b> during the interim period between these two stages is superior. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the outcomes of static and articulating <b>spacers</b> in the treatment of infection following total knee arthroplasty. Methods: A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature indexed byMEDLINE and Embase was performed to identify studies reporting the outcomes of antibiotic <b>spacers</b> in the treatment of infection following total knee arthroplasty. Seven Level-III comparative studies and thirty-two Level-IV case series remained following the screening process. The data in these studies were extracted and aggregated to compare the reinfection rate, range of knee motion, functional scores, and complication rates between static and articulating <b>spacers.</b> Results: The two types of <b>spacers</b> demonstrated similar reinfection rates (7 % for articulating and 12 % for static, p = 0. 2). However, the articulating <b>spacers</b> resulted in significantly greater range of knee motion after reimplantation (101 for articulating and 91 for static, p = 0. 0002). Despite this difference in ultimate kneemotion, functional scores in the treatment groups were similar. Rates of wound-related and spacer-related complications were similarly low with both types of <b>spacers.</b> Conclusions: Our review failed to identify a significant difference in the ability of static or articulating <b>spacers</b> to eradicate periprosthetic infection following total knee arthroplasty.

5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of {{nucleic acid sequences}} from the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> and elongation factor EF-1α regions suggests that the genus Morchella {{can be divided into}} three lineages. M.rufobrunnea belongs to a lineage that is basal to the esculenta clade ("yellow morels"), and the elata clade ("black morels"). This phylogenetic placement implies that it has existed in its current form since the Cretaceous era (roughly 145 to 66 million years ago), and all known morel species evolved from a similar ancestor. M.rufobrunnea is genetically closer to the yellow morels than the black morels. M.anatolica, described from Turkey in 2012, is a closely related sister species.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{analysis}} of the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> (IT) region of S.thailandica showed that the species {{was part of the}} Boletineae, one of several lineages of Boletales recognized taxonomically at the level of suborder. The similarity between S.thailandica and S.squarepantsii was confirmed with molecular analysis, which showed a 98% match between large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of the two—a value typical of many species in the same genus of Boletaceae. Spongiforma is sister (sharing a common ancestor) to the genus Porphyrellus; Spongiforma and Porphyrellus form a clade that is sister to Strobilomyces. All three genera are members of the Boletaceae family.|$|E

30|$|To further {{investigate}} {{the primary cause}} of significant differences in CRISPR elements between periodontally diseased patients and healthy people, we conducted F-test to compare the abundance variation of each DRs and <b>spacers.</b> We used 0.0007 (0.05 / 68) and 0.001 (0.05 / 32) as P-value cutoffs to perform the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing of DRs (68 genera) and <b>spacers</b> (32 genera), respectively. For 68 bacterial genera carrying DRs, abundance variation of 32 genera was significantly lower in health people than in patients (Fig. S 3). We also observed a similar situation for <b>spacers</b> (Fig.  2 B). The <b>spacers</b> aligned to 305 of 444 phage species had greater concordance in healthy people, and they occupied 69.2 % of total <b>spacers.</b> 96 species were left even with P-value cutoff 0.0001. The most substantial variation came from the species Clostridium phage phiCD 27. We also classified these <b>spacers</b> to the genus level and got a similar result. 23 out of 28 genera had greater concordance in healthy people, and they occupied 91.8 % of all the <b>spacers.</b> Since <b>spacers</b> indicate the ability of bacteria to resist invasion of certain bacteriophages, and thus the microbiome in healthy people seems to be fairly adapted to defend invasion of such phages and could be much more robust to micro-environment alteration.|$|R
5|$|The phylogenetic {{relationships}} in the genus Sarcoscypha were analyzed by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s.

Based on this analysis, S.dudleyi {{is part of a}} clade of evolutionarily related taxa that includes the species S.occidentalis, S.emarginata, S.hosoyae, S.korfiana and S.mesocyatha. All of these species contain large oil droplets in their spores, in contrast to the other major clade of Sarcoscypha (containing the type species S.coccinea), characterized by having smaller, more numerous droplets.|$|E

Molecular analyses of internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> DNA sequences supports the placement of P.nevadensis in Celluloderma, and further suggest that it has a sister relationship with P.horakianas.

5|$|Of {{the species}} of Marginatae {{associated}} with willow, five (I.salicis-herbaceae, I.substellata, I.praetervisa, I.salicis and I.mixtilis) {{can be readily}} distinguished from I.saliceticola as their spores feature distinct, strongly protruding excrescences. In addition, they are found in vastly different habitats: I.mixtilis and I.praetervisa favour willow only in montane habitats, while I.salicis-herbaceae and I.substellata grow exclusively in montane habitats. I.salicis is rare in Nordic countries, and is typically collected from dunes. Of the other two listed by Vauras and Kokkonen, the spores of I.dunensis are distinctly larger and of a different shape to those of I.saliceticola, and the cystidia are shorter. While the species is typically found on the beach, it grows on fine sand, {{and has not been}} recorded in Finland. I.obtusiuscula also has larger spores of a different shape, and they are a darker colour, owing to their thick cell walls.

5|$|Phylogenetic {{analysis}} of large subunit and internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> DNA sequence data, {{the results of}} which were published in 2012, concluded that the species then known as F.ellipsoidea was closely related to Phellinus gabonensis, P.caribaeo-quercicolus and the newly described P.castanopsidis. The four species share morphological characteristics, and form a monophyletic clade. This clade resolved more closely with the Phellinus type species P.igniarius than it did with the Fomitiporia type species F.langloisii, and so the authors proposed a transference of F.ellipsoidea to Phellinus, naming the new combination Phellinus ellipsoideus. While the taxonomic database Index Fungorum follows the 2012 study, MycoBank continues to list Fomitiporia ellipsoidea as the correct binomial. Some mycologists consider Fomitiporia to be a synonym of Phellinus anyway.|$|E

5|$|Psilocybe allenii was {{described}} as new to science in 2012 by Jan Borovička, Alan Rockefeller, and Peter G. Werner. Borovička received material collected from Seattle, Washington, which he noted was microscopically similar to Psilocybe cyanescens, but lacked the wavy cap margins characteristic of that species. In previous publications, Borovička had noted that both macro- and microscopic characters of certain Psilocybe species were highly variable, which could also account for the differences observed in the Seattle material. However, DNA sequencing revealed a 5-base pair change in the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> regions (a segment of RNA often used in molecular phylogenetics to identify or distinguish fungal species) between P.cyanescens and the Seattle collections. This difference, {{in addition to the}} readily observable macroscopic differences, was deemed sufficient to warrant describing the taxon as a new species.

A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed <b>spacer</b> sequences of ribosomal DNA by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum–Tricholoma–Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C.racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C.racemosa.|$|E
