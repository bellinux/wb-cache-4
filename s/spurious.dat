5|$|He 111 U: A <b>spurious</b> {{designation}} {{applied for}} propaganda purposes to the Heinkel He 119 high-speed reconnaissance bomber design which set an FAI record in November 1937. True identity only becomes {{clear to the}} Allies after World War II.|$|E
5|$|If {{claims for}} pure {{economic}} loss in such cases were allowed, it might lead to countless claims, {{some of which may}} be <b>spurious.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although communists {{had killed}} the entire {{imperial}} Romanov family in July 1918, including 17-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia, for years afterwards communist disinformation fed rumors {{that members of the}} Tsar's family had survived. The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make <b>spurious</b> claims that they were a surviving Romanov.|$|E
5|$|Another related <b>spurious</b> {{generation}} {{method is}} the slight modulation {{due to the}} GRR outlined above. The amplitude of these spurs is low for large N and their frequency is generally too low to be detectable but they may cause issues for some applications.|$|E
5|$|Both Ariel and the {{slightly}} larger Uranian satellite Umbriel were discovered by William Lassell on 24 October 1851. Although William Herschel, who discovered Uranus's two largest moons Titania and Oberon in 1787, {{claimed to have}} observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be <b>spurious.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1998 the {{discovery}} of a possible dust disk around 55 Cancri A was announced. Calculations gave the disk radius at least 40AU, similar to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System, with an inclination of 25° with respect to the plane of the sky. However, {{the discovery}} could not be verified and was later deemed to be <b>spurious,</b> caused instead by background galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Konishi {{describes}} a wideband 12GHz band-pass filter, which uses 60° butterfly stubs {{and also has}} a low-pass response (short-circuit stubs are required to prevent such a response). As {{is often the case}} with distributed element filters, the bandform into which the filter is classified largely depends on which bands are desired and which are considered to be <b>spurious.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Spurious</b> {{products}} {{are the result}} of harmonic or non-harmonic distortion {{in the creation of the}} output waveform due to non-linear numerical effects in the signal processing chain. Only numerical errors are covered here. For other distortion mechanisms created in the digital-to-analog converter see the corresponding section in the direct-digital synthesizer article.|$|E
5|$|The monastery is {{mentioned}} {{for the first}} time in the early 14th century, although Yevgeniy Bolkhovitinov claimed that it had been founded by the first Metropolitan of Kiev, Michael, along with Greek monks arriving from Byzantium in 988 AD. The claim is likely <b>spurious,</b> since Mezhyhirya is not listed by modern authors among the monasteries of Kievan Rus.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noticeable}} difference in behaviour between a distributed element filter and its lumped-element approximation {{is that the}} former will have multiple passband replicas of the lumped-element prototype passband, because transmission line transfer characteristics repeat at harmonic intervals. These <b>spurious</b> passbands are undesirable in most cases.|$|E
5|$|Their work {{culminated in}} co-authoring of The Polish Peasant in Europe and America (1918–20), {{considered}} a sociology classic. It was his collaboration with Thomas {{that marked the}} transition in Znaniecki's career from philosopher to sociologist. Znaniecki stayed with Thomas in Chicago until mid-1919, {{when he moved to}} New York, following Thomas, who had lost his job at Chicago due to a <b>spurious</b> scandal.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel, {{along with}} another Uranian satellite, Ariel, was {{discovered}} by William Lassell on October 24, 1851. Although William Herschel, the discoverer of Titania and Oberon, claimed {{at the end of}} the 18th century that he had observed four additional moons of Uranus, his observations were not confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be <b>spurious.</b>|$|E
5|$|When clocked, {{the phase}} {{accumulator}} (PA) creates a modulo-2N sawtooth waveform {{which is then}} converted by the phase-to-amplitude converter (PAC) to a sampled sinusoid, where N {{is the number of}} bits carried in the phase accumulator. N sets the NCO frequency resolution and is normally much larger than the number of bits defining the memory space of the PAC look-up table. If the PAC capacity is 2M, the PA output word must be truncated to M bits as shown in Figure 1. However, the truncated bits can be used for interpolation. The truncation of the phase output word does not affect the frequency accuracy but produces a time-varying periodic phase error which is a primary source of <b>spurious</b> products. Another <b>spurious</b> product generation mechanism is finite word length effects of the PAC output (amplitude) word.|$|E
5|$|After Herschel {{discovered}} Titania and Oberon on January 11, 1787, he subsequently {{believed that}} he had observed four other moons: two on January 18 and February 9, 1790, and two more on February 28 and March 26, 1794. It was thus believed for many decades thereafter that Uranus had a system of six satellites, though the four latter moons were never confirmed by any other astronomer. Lassell's observations of 1851, in which he discovered Ariel and Umbriel, however, failed to support Herschel's observations; Ariel and Umbriel, which Herschel certainly ought to have seen if he had seen any satellites beside Titania and Oberon, did not correspond to any of Herschel's four additional satellites in orbital characteristics. Herschel's four <b>spurious</b> satellites were thought to have sidereal periods of 5.89 days (interior to Titania), 10.96 days (between Titania and Oberon), 38.08 days, and 107.69 days (exterior to Oberon). It was therefore concluded that Herschel's four satellites were <b>spurious,</b> probably arising from the misidentification of faint stars {{in the vicinity of}} Uranus as satellites, and the credit for the discovery of Ariel and Umbriel was given to Lassell.|$|E
5|$|Ahn {{had already}} left Korea and was {{studying}} Mandarin Chinese at a university in China, where he began {{a relationship with a}} Filipino-Chinese woman conducting research for her doctoral dissertation. In 2010, he moved to Metro Manila with her to head a small market research company she owned there. They planned to marry, but their engagement came to an end shortly after her family decided to Google his name and read the <b>spurious</b> allegations against him.|$|E
5|$|Oberon was {{discovered}} by William Herschel on January 11, 1787; {{on the same day}} he discovered Uranus's largest moon, Titania. He later reported the discoveries of four more satellites, although they were subsequently revealed as <b>spurious.</b> For nearly fifty years following their discovery, Titania and Oberon would not be observed by any instrument other than William Herschel's, although the moon can be seen from Earth with a present-day high-end amateur telescope.|$|E
5|$|One of Bach's {{predecessors}} {{as director}} musices of the Neukirche in Leipzig was Melchior Hoffmann. Around 1707 he composed a German Magnificat based on Luther's German {{translation of the}} Magnificat. The portfolio of performance parts of this composition was updated until well into Bach's time in Leipzig. The work, known as Kleine Magnificat (Little Magnificat), was for some time attributed to Bach, but later listed as <b>spurious</b> in the BWV catalogue (BWVAnh.21 / Anh. III 168‑>). BWV189, a Visitation cantata on a libretto that paraphrases {{the text of the}} Magnificat canticle, also seems rather to have been composed by Hoffmann than by Bach, to whom this work used to be attributed.|$|E
5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have <b>spurious</b> passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this <b>spurious</b> passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual <b>spurious</b> passband at this frequency.|$|E
5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the {{interdigital}} filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that is, free of <b>spurious</b> passbands at all frequencies of interest.|$|E
5|$|The evacuation, {{which had}} been delayed for months, was {{initiated}} due to fear of the Red Army advances during the East Prussian Offensive. Some parts of the evacuation were planned as a military necessity, Operation Hannibal being the most important military operation involved in the evacuation. However, many refugees took to the roads on their own initiative because of reported Soviet atrocities against Germans in the areas under Soviet control. Both <b>spurious</b> and factual accounts of Soviet atrocities were disseminated through the official news and propaganda outlets of Nazi Germany and by rumors that swept through the military and civilian populations.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it will pass DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first <b>spurious</b> passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E
5|$|After the {{supporters}} of Henry III of England suppressed opposition from the English nobility in the Second Barons' War, Henry granted to his second son Edmund Crouchback the titles and possessions forfeited by attainder of the barons' leader, Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, including the Earldom of Leicester, on 26 October 1265. Later grants included the first Earldom of Lancaster on 30 June 1267 and that of Earl Ferrers in 1301. Edmund was also Count of Champagne and Brie from 1276 by right of his wife. Henry IV of England would later use his descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne, even making the <b>spurious</b> claim that Edmund was the elder son of Henry but had been passed over as king because of his deformity.|$|E
5|$|Counterfeits and <b>spurious</b> {{reproductions of}} the 1804 dollar {{have been created}} since numismatists {{became aware of the}} coins' high value. James A. Bolen, a medallist and coin {{collector}} who created copies of valuable coins between 1862 and 1869, fabricated an 1804 dollar by altering the last digit in the date of a genuine 1803 example. Although Bolen added his name {{to the edge of the}} coin, other forgers created altered date coins with the intent to deceive. Nineteenth-century stage actor John T. Raymond purchased a specimen of the coin, which was later revealed to be a forgery, for $300. All silver dollars dated between 1800 and 1803 were subject to alteration to 1804 dollars, but 1801 was the date most commonly used for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Light Yagami, {{the true}} {{identity}} of Kira, discovers {{the location of}} Mello's hideout. An indirect result {{of this is that}} Mello meets the Shinigami Sidoh, the original owner of Mello's Death Note. Sidoh reveals to him—in exchange for some of Mello's chocolate—that there are two extra fake rules (in addition to a number of real ones specified to each Death Note's owner). Mello begins to theorize that whoever Kira is, he probably used these <b>spurious</b> rules to fool the Japanese police into thinking he is innocent. However, Light launches a SWAT team led by Soichiro to raid the hideout. In order to escape, Mello detonates remote-controlled explosives, after one of his Mafia accomplices fatally wounds Soichiro. Mello is left with a scar on his face, and the failure of his Mafia scheme leaves his real name in Light's hands.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} debates as {{to the nature of}} Van Gogh's illness and its effect on his work, and many retrospective diagnoses have been proposed. The consensus is that Van Gogh had an episodic condition with periods of normal functioning. Perry was the first to suggest bipolar disorder in 1947, and this has been supported by the psychiatrists Hemphill and Blumer. Biochemist Wilfred Arnold has countered that the symptoms are more consistent with acute intermittent porphyria, noting that the popular link between bipolar disorder and creativity might be <b>spurious.</b> Temporal lobe epilepsy with bouts of depression has also been suggested. Whatever the diagnosis, his condition was likely worsened by malnutrition, overwork, insomnia and alcohol.|$|E
5|$|These three works {{which we}} have {{composed}} we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities {{as well as in}} the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed <b>spurious</b> lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter be guilty of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, by compromising CIA methods, Ames {{enabled the}} KGB and its successor, the SVR, to filter feed {{material}} to the CIA from 1986 to 1993. In 1987, KGB agent Aleksandr Zhomov offered to sell the CIA intelligence on how the Soviets had detected and arrested the CIA's agents. The SE Division accepted Zhomov and assigned him the cryptonym GTPROLOGUE. Zhomov, who was actually a Soviet double agent assigned to protect Ames, furnished fake documents ascribing the CIA's agent losses to superior KGB surveillance and luck. He then told the CIA that he would identify upcoming KGB plants, but only {{on the condition that}} the CIA treat them as genuine, lest the KGB discover the leak and arrest him. The fake agents soon overwhelmed Moscow Station's resources, and Zhomov disappeared in July 1990 after receiving payment from the U.S. The <b>spurious</b> sources and the disinformation they provided reportedly convinced the CIA that the 1985–1986 debacle was an anomaly, thus protecting Ames. Other genuine CIA agents were compromised by the Soviets, who used them to feed false intelligence back to the U.S.|$|E
