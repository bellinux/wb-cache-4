40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} preferences and attitudes of Ontario ophthalmologists and ophthalmology residents toward screencasting as an educational tool with potential use for continuing medical education (CME) events. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Eighty of 256 participants completed the survey. Methods: The surveys were sent to participants by email, with follow-up via telephone. Study participants were urban and rural Ontario ophthalmologists, registered with the Canadian Ophthalmological Society, and University of Toronto ophthalmology residents. Pre-recorded online presentations - screencasts - were used as the main intervention. Online surveys were used to measure multiple variables evaluating {{the attitudes of the}} participants toward screencasting. This data was then used for further quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results: Over 95 % of participants replied favourably to the introduction and future utilization of screencasting for educational purposes. Rural ophthalmologists were the most enthusiastic about future events. Practising in rural Ontario was associated with a higher interest in live broadcasts than practising in urban centres (p< 0. 02), an association supported by qualitative data. Qualitative analysis revealed geographic isolation, busy <b>schedules,</b> <b>ease</b> of use/access, and convenience to be the key factors contributing to interest in screencasting. Conclusions: Practising ophthalmologists and residents in Ontario are interested in academic online screencasting. Rural ophthalmologists were more interested in live lectures than their urban colleagues. More research is required to assess the potential of screencasting as a CME tool.

40|$|Abstract. The ICENI {{middleware}} utilises information captured {{within a}} component based application {{in order to}} facilitate Grid-based scheduling. We describe a system of application related meta-data that features a separation of concerns between meaning, behaviour and implementation, which allows for both communication and implementation selection at run-time, while providing the user with a flow-based programming model. It is shown that this separation enables a flexible approach to <b>scheduling,</b> and <b>eases</b> the integration of components with disparate control flow patterns or data types, by means of converters and tees for collective communication. By explicitly recording application information and supporting multiple scheduling approaches, communication protocols and component applications, while retaining OGSA compatibility, the ICENI component model is ideally suited to Grid computing. ...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{high demand}} for {{correctness}} for safety critical systems, often requiring the use of formal verification.

This paper will show how the TLA logic {{can be used to}} verify schedulers of concurrent components. TLA allows us to prove that one program preserves the behaviour of another program, in particular that an efficient scheduling strategy preserves the behaviour of a simpler one. For an arbitrary program we can use the simpler scheduler for correctness verification, knowing that the properties also hold in the more efficient one, which we then implement. This approach is illustrated with the Hume programming language, which is based on concurrent rich automata. We show an efficient extension to the Hume scheduler, and prove that this extension preserves the behaviour of the standard Hume scheduler...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{traditional}} wireless {{sensor network}} (WSN) applications, energy efficiency {{is considered to be}} the most important concern whereas utilizing the use of bandwidth and maximizing the throughput are of secondary importance. However, recent applications, such as structural health monitoring, require high amounts of data to be collected at a faster rate. We present a multi-channel MAC protocol, MC-LMAC, designed with the objective of maximizing the throughput of WSN by coordinating transmissions over multiple channels. MC-LMAC takes the advantage of interference and contention free parallel transmissions on different channels. It is based on <b>scheduled</b> access which <b>eases</b> the coordination of nodes dynamically switching their interfaces between channels and makes the protocol to operate effectively free of collisions during peak traffic. Time is organized into timeslots and each node shall be assigned control over a timeslot to transmit on a particular channel. We analyze the performance of MC-LMAC with extensive simulations. MC-LMAC exhibits significant bandwidth utilization and high throughput while ensuring an energy-efficient operation. Moreover, MC-LMAC outperforms the contention-based multi-channel MMSN protocol, cluster based channel assignment and single-channel CSMA in terms of data delivery ratio and throughput for high data rate, moderate-size networks of 100 nodes.

The team would also award scholarships, and UConn would also add scholarships to some women's programs due to Title IX issues. On June 21, UConn and Hockey East officially announced that the school's men's team would indeed join the conference effective with the 2014-15 season.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} power-aware SoC design methodology, which {{is characterized by}} four key elements. First, SoC infrastructure is developed specifically to create modularity in both the physical floorplan, and application. Second, a statically <b>scheduled</b> interconnect approach <b>eases</b> physical design, limits network overhead, and assures predictable interconnect behavior. This interconnect approach is well suited for signal processing applications critical to portable electronics, including video and speech coding, graphics, and cryptography. Third, system modularity is exploited for power savings by allowing the independent {{development and use of}} reconfigurable processing cores. Dynamic parameterization is proposed as a formalism for run-time reconfiguration of these cores. Finally, interconnect behavior monitoring is used to estimate core utilization and control individual voltage and frequency scaling for each core. ^ This SoC methodology is applied to create and evaluate power-aware infrastructure for the Adaptive System-on-a-Chip (aSoC). Layout level models are implemented to measure performance and verify architectural assumptions. In aSoC the global floorplan is enforced with specific regions and process layers allocated for cores and interconnect. As a result, infrastructure overhead can be less than 5 % depending on the granularity of the desired IP cores. Interconnect mesh regularity allows for efficient use of resources as well as providing fast and predictable communication links. This structure allows for the routing of global interconnect, global clock, and multiple supply grids together in the top three layers of metal. ^ The combination of dynamically parameterized cores and system wide voltage scaling has the potential to reduce power consumption in future SoC devices by more than 90 %. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite their {{invaluable}} {{contribution to}} health care, men who fulfill the social role of primary caregivers at an older age represent an understudied {{group in the}} state of Nuevo León (Mexico), and elsewhere. Ongoing demographic and epidemiological changes point to a graying population, an increase of disabling chronic and degenerative diseases, and functional limitations linked to a decline in self-reliance. The latter leads to further dependence on assistance which is predominantly home based. This article investigates the lived experiences of caregiving men providing care to their elderly relatives who have Alzheimer's disease (AD). After obtaining verbal informed consent, face-to-face, in-depth interviews were carried out in the natural environment with a convenience sample of 58 spouses and sons. Absenteeism was a common occurrence among those who were still involved in the labor force; however, the ways it was handled differed according to the sector of the economy (formal vs. informal) the participant contributed to. Assistance provided by AD support groups, the availability and use of paid helpers, immediate and extended family, and making adjustments to daily routines to accommodate work <b>schedules</b> contributed to <b>easing</b> the burden of care. However, medical expenses put a strain on caregiver finances, and complaints about the costs of medications were consistent among employed and retired caregivers. A mix of positive and negative aspects inherent to this dyadic process was revealed along with trajectories of elder caregiving that were not always unilineal. Relationships of reciprocity, dependence and interdependence, and strengthened family bonds were salient. These findings are discussed in light of existentialist and humanistic theoretical frameworks on social integration and needs, with their propensity for emphasizing cognitive benefits, and the related meanings to individuals. The findings imply that concerted policy making in public health, labor, and social sectors, to provide timely recognition and support to caregivers, is needed as a proactive approach to lightening the burden of elder caregiving...|$|R
40|$|Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are {{community}} based centers {{created to}} provide comprehensive primary and preventive care to individuals unable to access {{care in the}} commercial medical system (e. g. related to poverty, and/or race-ethnicity). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) proposes offering Medicaid coverage to many such individuals, thus, FQHCs should receive many new Medicaid enrollees. The ACA has triggered {{a number of new}} ideas to improve affordability, health status and patient experience, commonly known as the “triple aim. ” These initiatives include quality incentive programs, payment reform, and the promotion of medical homes and accountable care organizations (ACOs). These are in addition to earlier efforts to facilitate market reform, such as incentives to develop information and communication tools, such as interoperable electronic health records (EHRs) (Doebbeling, Chou 2 ̆ 6 Tierney, 2006). The goals of the “triple aim” cannot be met unless there is greater access to primary and preventive care. Since limited access to poor and minority populations exists today, the FQHC system could easily become overwhelmed with demand. Innovative models are essential to ensure access to needed care. If health care coverage expands beginning in 2014 as expected, FQHCs will {{be in a position to}} transition their uninsured patient population to Medicaid and state insurance exchanges. Provider networks, such as FQHCs, will be held accountable for reaching the triple aim, as measured by cost, quality, and patient experience. Recent federal and state cutbacks in the funding of Medicaid and FQHCs has led to problems with access to care and little improvement in quality of care, efficiency or satisfaction in many states. Recent “secret shopper” calls of FQHCs demonstrated access to care problems for a variety of common significant health problems at most clinics in Indiana. To investigate this problem, we have recently conducted a series of key informant interviews of clinicians, staff and leaders at three FQHCs in Indiana, regarding operational challenges and access to care. Due to current fiscal shortfalls, current patients often have difficulty in being seen and “no show 2 ̆ 2 cases are common. We found the leadership and clinicians at each of our participating FQHCs interested in opportunities to improve access to care and reduce no-shows, as well as strategies to improve provider-patient communication. Our findings suggest an opportunity to design and implement novel models of patient-centered care and redesign current policies and workflow to ensure that primary care is available, timely, coordinated, and cost effective. In order to address these issues, we are partnering with FQHCs and a not for profit health maintenance organization (MDwise, Inc) in Indiana to test new information and access strategies. In the proposed project, we will explore the feasibility of using mobile technology to increase access to information that will improve patient access to care and satisfaction. Short message service (SMS), or text messaging, is one way in which mobile technology has been used in healthcare. In a review of 61 studies, 50 presented findings showing a positive effect on the desired outcome from the intervention (Yeager 2 ̆ 6 Menachemi, 2011). Most of these studies looked at the influence of text messaging on health behaviors, however, 10 examined the impact of text messaging on administrative processes in healthcare. Nine of the ten studies found text message reminders systems reduced the no-show rates in clinics; several found text messaging was more cost effective than phone call reminders (Yeager 2 ̆ 6 Menachemi, 2011). The authors noted that only two of these 10 studies were conducted in primary care and none were conducted in the United States. In addition, few studies have explored the benefits of using this type of technology in vulnerable populations which are cared for by FQHCs. Thus, the present project will help to address this knowledge gap. In our project, we intend to extend beyond text messaging, into the use of social media such as Facebook and Twitter, to provide patient easy access to clinic information and <b>ease</b> <b>scheduling.</b> Other opportunities to leverage mobile technologies in community health centers that will be considered include: 1) immunization reminders; 2) management of chronic disease; 3) reduction in emergency room visits for urgent care; 4) facilitation of Medicaid reenrollment; 5) education to advance health literacy; and 6) enhance communication to improve member retention. Table 1 outlines our proposed phased approach to developing and deploying the mobile technology solution. First, we will conduct a survey to assess the feasibility of using these mobile technologies in the target population. In a recent study examined the interest in using mobile technology for appointment reminders at a safety-net clinic serving an indigent urban population (Denizard-Thompson et al, 2011). Over three hundred surveys were collected in ten days from patients who were “predominantly African-American (68 vs. 27...|$|R
