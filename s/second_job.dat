He is eventually able to convince his former employer Hiroyasu Ueda to hire Chi at his bakery during his anniversary sale. Chi eventually finds herself kidnapped by Yoshiyuki Kojima. Yoshiyuki initiates a program that he had created especially for Chi, which is designed to break through her firewalls, and when he embraces and gropes her, Freya intervenes by binding him with wires connected to Chi and releasing a powerful, concussive blast. Hideki and Shinbo find her, and Freya vanishes, causing Chi to collapse from the energy used. She recovers and briefly reunites with Hideki, before losing consciousness. Shinbo then forces Yoshiyuki to transfer his persocom Kotoko's registration to Hideki to prevent Yoshiyuki from deleting her memories, so that a record of his kidnapping exists.|$|E

During a recession, income effects should lead to increased desire for <b>second</b> <b>jobs</b> due to earnings losses on the primary job (due to reductions in hours and/or wage reductions). Or it may result from a job or earnings loss of another household member. The reverse is true during an expansion.

3000|$|Our final {{analysis}} examines how job quality differences between {{primary and secondary}} jobs vary with the business cycle. As previously observed in Table  1, on average, multiple <b>job</b> holders’ <b>second</b> <b>jobs</b> have a lower O*NET occupational skill index (SK) value and a higher (more demanding) physical working conditions (WC) value, signaling lower “quality” on secondary than on primary jobs.

Twenty-four Jobs {{can be found in}} the game, ranging from the agile Valkyrie, and White and Black Mages that respectively specialize in healing and fighting magic. Each Job has different strengths and weaknesses in battle. Outside battle, characters can be assigned any available Job. In addition to the skills of the equipped Job, the skills of a <b>second</b> <b>Job</b> can be learned, allowing for free customization of parties and the mixing of Job abilities in battle. After obtaining the Summoner Job, characters can use summoned monsters to launch attacks that deal high damage on all enemies.

5|$|On leaving school, Headley was {{appointed}} {{as a temporary}} clerk in a magistrate's court; this enabled him to play competitive cricket for the St Andrew's Police side in 1926, in a cup competition. Some impressive performances for the club earned him an invitation to practice with the Jamaica Colts team. However, his job {{made it impossible to}} attend, and he was not considered for the Jamaican side against Lord Tennyson's English touring side in 1927. That year, Headley began working for Keeling–Lindo Estates, in St Catherine. The firm were enthusiastic cricket patrons, allowing employees time off to play in matches, so that Headley was able to attend practice with the Jamaica team on a regular basis. He also moved to the St Catherine Cricket Club, captained by his immediate superior in Keeling–Lindo. To generate more income, Headley took a <b>second</b> <b>job,</b> working for the Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Company, but he wanted a secure profession. To this end, he planned to move to America to pursue a career in dentistry.

5|$|Due to Tom's illness, Falcon-Price {{takes over}} the {{operation}} of the station and the team must deal with his constant presence and the pressure which they are put under. Falcon-Price's constant attempts to prove that Tom is not up to his job have also grown more intense at Tom's initial sign of weakness. We see that Alex is having trouble dealing with his new role as a father, and, on top of this, Alex is stabbed by a criminal, and this begins to look as if it is all Tom's fault. The two rivals, Kelly and Joss, enter into new romances: Joss with a pickpocket victim and Kelly with a rival lawyer. They must deal with their constant jealousy of each other and their constant drive to outdo each other, as it had been ever since they left the Academy. Joss must also deal with his growing gambling debts and the consequences of these, including his being beaten up, his being forced to get a <b>second</b> <b>job</b> and his becoming homeless. He must also deal with the people around him who, in trying to help him, make him feel worse; particularly the arrival of his mother in town. Dismissed police officer Adam Cooper also arrives back in Mount Thomas, {{for the first time since}} Tom dismissed him in 1998. This time he arrives in Mount Thomas as a photocopier technician and wants to take revenge on Tom. In an attempt to do this, he tries to frame him for a crime he did not commit. In the heat of these allegations against Mount Thomas' top cop, there is the very real possibility that the Mount Thomas police station may be closed forever, and the team are forced to find new placements and the possibility of separation from one another.|$|E

30|$|Comparison {{of means}} for the {{occupational}} skill and working condition indices (SK and WC) shows that on the primary job, multiple job holders display a higher value of occupational skill (0.21 vs. 0.07) and slightly less demanding working conditions (− 0.17 vs. − 0.05) than do single job holders. Restricting the sample to dual job holders, one sees that these workers’ <b>second</b> <b>jobs</b> involved a noticeably lower level of skill (− 0.08 vs. 0.21, a 0.3 s.d. difference) and slightly more demanding working conditions (− 0.11 vs. − 0.17).

Subsequent analysis examines how these skill and working condition differences vary with the business cycle. In wage analysis not shown, the coefficient on the SK skill index in a dense Mincerian log wage equation is about 0.20. Using that estimate, the 0.29 difference in the skill index between multiple job holders’ primary and secondary jobs (0.21 vs. − 0.08) suggests a roughly 6  % wage advantage in the primary job (0.2 times 0.29).|$|R

The fatigue literature aptly includes the study of justice administration within the socially and legally relevant contexts of fatigue-impaired police discretion. In this study, the correlation between sleep measurements, fatigue, and police work are examined among three types of law enforcement agencies in a single western jurisdiction. Independent samples of municipal police (N= 25), sheriff's deputies (N= 25), and highway patrol (N= 25) officers are selected to identify mean differences for sleep, age and sleep, law enforcement experience and sleep, <b>second</b> <b>jobs,</b> hours worked, police accidents and other variables. The findings unequivocally support the notion that law enforcement officers do not get enough recommended sleep, according to the PSQ Index and officer self reports. Other findings indicate that municipal police, compared to sheriff deputies or highway patrol officers are more careful about excessive work hours, work fewer <b>second</b> <b>jobs,</b> and get more sleep. Highway patrol officers consistently placed second to municipal police among these variables while the sample of county sheriff's was the most overworked as well as the most under slept.
