Such a system allows acoustic frequency strain signals to be detected over large distances and in harsh environments.|$|E
50|$|Distributed {{acoustic}} sensing {{relies on}} light which is Rayleigh backscattered from small {{variations in the}} refractive index of the fiber. The backscattered light has the same frequency as the transmitted light. There {{are a number of}} other distributed fiber sensing techniques that rely on different scattering mechanisms and can be used to measure other parameters.Brillouin scatter occurs due to the interaction between the light and acoustic phonons travelling in the fiber. As the light is scattered by a moving phonon, its frequency is shifted by the Doppler effect by around 10 GHz. Light is generated at both at above (anti-Stokes shift) and below (Stokes shift) the original optical frequency. The intensity and frequency shifts of the two components are dependent on both temperature and strain and by measuring the shifts, absolute values of the two parameters can be calculated using a distributed temperature and <b>strain</b> <b>sensing</b> (DTSS) system. Brillouin scatter is much weaker than Rayleigh scatter and so the reflections from a number of pulses must be summed together to enable the measurements to be made. Therefore, the maximum frequency at which changes can be measured using Brillouin scatter is typically a few tens of Hz.Raman scatter occurs when light is scattered in interaction with molecular vibrations in the fiber. As with Brillouin scattering, both Stokes and anti-Stokes components are produced and these are shifted from the wavelength of the incident light by several tens of nanometers. By measuring the ratio in intensity between the Stokes and anti-Stokes components, an absolute value of temperature can be measured by a distributed temperature sensing (DTS) system. The larger wavelength shifts compared to Brillouin scatter mean that it is easier to separate the scattered Raman light from the un-shifted Rayleigh scattered component. However the intensity of the Raman scatter is even lower than the Brillouin scatter and so it is normally necessary to average for many seconds or even minutes in order to get reasonable results. Therefore, Raman-based systems are only suitable for measuring slowly varying temperatures.|$|E

A mixture of carbon and glass fibre {{was used in}} the core, which was surrounded by a braided cover of polyester fibres. Three compositions of core with different carbon fibre/glass fibre weight ratios (23 / 77, 47 / 53, and 100 / 0) were studied to find out the optimum composition for both strain sensitivity and mechanical performance.
