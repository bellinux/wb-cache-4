5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> distinct discipline that owes to {{the convergence of}} sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E

Parvin's The Gospel According to the Simpsons: Leader's Guide for Group <b>Study</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> group study guide companion to Pinsky's The Gospel According to the Simpsons. In the section pertaining to [...] "Lisa the Skeptic", a skeptic is defined as: [...] "a person who doubts, questions, or suspends judgment on ideas generally accepted by others". The study group is asked to debate the episode in the context of skepticism as related to other unexplained phenomena, including UFOs, the Loch Ness Monster, the Abominable Snowman, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, near-death experiences, reincarnation, mediumship, psychics, and fortune-telling. In Pinsky's book itself, he noted that Lisa faced the difficult task of confronting religious hysteria and blind faith, and also attempted to reconcile science within her own belief system. He also wrote that when Lisa asks Stephen Jay Gould to estimate the age of the skeleton, the issue is never raised of why angels or other spiritual entities would even leave skeletons behind in the first place.|$|E

2500|$|Recent {{scientific}} assessments {{find that}} most of the warming of the Earth's surface over the past 50 years has been caused by human activities (see also the section on scientific literature and opinion). This conclusion rests on multiple lines of evidence.

2500|$|The {{importance}} {{of education and}} <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fundamental theme of the Analects. For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and a good teacher is someone older who {{is familiar with the}} ways of the past and the practices of antiquity (Analects 7.22). Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection (Analects 2.15). When teaching he is never cited in the Analects as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through asking direct questions, citing passages from the classics, and using analogies (Analects 7.8). He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. (Analects 3.8) ...|$|E

This is a case, Shach said, in which, halachically, one must [...] "be killed, rather than transgress". This position was expressed in large ads placed in all three of Israel's daily newspapers on May 22, 1998. Shach is quoted as saying that, [...] "Any yeshiva student who cheats the authorities and uses the exemption from service for anything other than real engagement in Torah <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> 'rodef' (someone who threatens the lives of others)", and that [...] "those who are not learning jeopardize the position of those who are learning as they should".|$|E

2500|$|Mixed Feelings {{is based}} on Cvetkovich's PhD dissertation, which she {{completed}} at Cornell University in 1988. It grew out of Cvetkovich's “own mixed feelings about a feminist politics of affect,” [...] and argues {{that the effects of}} affect are not always liberating; rather, affect can “call attention to and obscure complex social relations, and can both inspire and displace social action.” Thus, Cvetkovich's <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> nuanced exploration of affect and politics. In looking at the figure of “the transgressive and/or suffering woman…Cvetkovich traces the construction of affect as both natural and particularly female, and as therefore potentially transgressive and requiring regulation and control.” While Cvetkovich interrogates the way Marxist, feminist, Foucauldian, and psychoanalytic theories have engaged with affect, she also draws upon these approaches in her study. Important to Cvetkovich's argument is the idea that affect should not be viewed as natural, but instead as historical.|$|E
