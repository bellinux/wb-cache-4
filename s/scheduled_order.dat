40|$|The chapter {{describes}} the modeling of a {{material handling system}} with the production of individual units in a <b>scheduled</b> <b>order.</b> The units represent the agents in the model and are transported in the system which is abstracted as a directed graph. Since the hindrances of units on their path to the destination can lead to inefficiencies in the production, the blockages of units are to be reduced. Therefore, the units operate in the system by means of local interactions in the conveying elements and indirect interactions based on a measure of possible hindrances. If most of the units behave cooperatively ("socially"), the blockings in the system are reduced. A simulation based on the model shows the collective behavior of the units in the system. The transport processes in the simulation can {{be compared with the}} processes in a real plant, which gives conclusions about the consequencies for the production based on the superordinate planning.

40|$|The Critical Chain Scheduling and Buffer Management (CC/BM) {{methodology}} {{has proven}} to be a favorable approach to schedule resource-constrained projects and to offer a valuable control tool for monitoring projects under uncertainty. The previous studies on CC/BM seem to have neglected the cost performance, which might render its wider applications to the modern economic activities that are mostly performed in a project way. This paper presents an improved CC/BM framework that allows additional resource allocation/reallocation to bring forward activity starting times based on cost and schedule stability criteria. In the planning phase, the decision is made concerning the regular resource availability period in order to minimize the expected resource costs. In the execution phase, a <b>scheduled</b> <b>order</b> repair method for rescheduling along with two reactive resource allocation procedures as the corrective action whenever delays are beyond a certain buffer threshold are presented and examined in order to exhibit a comprehensive project schedule/cost control system that is adaptive to the CC/BM management logic.

"May 2011 "Given the rising cost of energy, this research studies the effect of energy cost on logistics decisions by analyzing the effect on inventory ordering policies for production systems with constant production rates but small, underlying possibilities for undesirable circumstances to threaten the production schedules. Rather than fulfilling any emergency demand with a more expensive and energy cost sensitive emergency order, the proposed model extends the classic EOQ model to provide multiple, more cost effective, options to fulfill the emergency demand. Under explicit energy cost considerations, the objective of this model is to determine optimal sizes for <b>scheduled</b> <b>order</b> quantity, safety stock, and inventory cycle length that minimize the expected cost per unit time of a product. In order to investigate the effect of energy cost on inventory decisions as well as investigate the environments in which the proposed inventory model is most cost effective, the proposed inventory model is analyzed and compared to the traditional EOQ model while many of the model parameters are varied. The results of this analysis suggest that the environments most significantly affected by energy cost and most receptive to the proposed inventory model consist of high levels of {{at least one of the}} following key parameters: product weight, regular demand, or emergency demand...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} global economy the {{manufacturing}} industry {{is faced with}} the challenges {{that need to be}} overcome in order to remain competitive and avoid outsourcing. One of the challenges is the efficient development of the control logic for the distributed control systems that are often used to control the manufacturing equipment in the industry. Formal methods are mathematical frameworks that might be useful for overcoming that challenge. The control logic is often developed using the IEC 61131 standard that is focused on programming languages for non-distributed control systems. However, the new IEC 61499 standard provides the communication support as well as the programming units, i. e. function blocks, that are aimed at the control logic development for the distributed control systems. In the thesis, it is shown that the unclear specification of the function block <b>scheduling</b> <b>order</b> in the IEC 61499 might result in the control logic not being portable across IEC 61499 implementations. Therefore, the block <b>scheduling</b> <b>order</b> has to be considered during the control logic development. As a consequence, the developers might lose the focus on the high-level control logic that may result in the time-consuming development. The thesis presents contributions that may help the automatic formal model generation of the IEC 61499 control logic, assuming different block <b>scheduling</b> <b>orders.</b> The generated formal models may be used for verification of the control logic behavior using the algorithms of the framework called supervisory control theory (SCT). A synthesis algorithm from the SCT is used in the thesis for calculation of all deadlock free block <b>scheduling</b> <b>orders</b> from the automatically generated formal models. The contributions may help developers to concentrate on the high-level control logic since {{they may be able to}} use the formal methods to reduce the possible impact that the block <b>scheduling</b> <b>orders,</b> used in different IEC 61499 implementations, might have on the correctness of their control logic. Therefore, the developers may receive some benefits of the formal methods for the efficient development of the IEC 61499 control logic for the distributed control systems...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{scheduler}} that improves cluster utilization and job completion times by packing tasks having multi-resource requirements and inter-dependencies. While {{the problem is}} algorithmically very hard, we achieve near-optimality on the job DAGs that appear in production clusters at a large enterprise and in benchmarks such as TPC-DS. A key insight is that carefully handling the long-running tasks and those with tough-to-pack resource needs will produce good-enough schedules. However, which subset of tasks to treat carefully is not clear (and intractable to discover). Hence, we offer a search procedure that evaluates various possibilities and outputs a preferred <b>schedule</b> <b>order</b> over tasks. An online component enforces the <b>schedule</b> <b>orders</b> desired by the various jobs running on the cluster.
