Objects as small as bacteria operate a low Reynolds number and cylindrical forms are more efficient than the flat, paddle-like, forms appropriate at human-size scale.|$|E
5|$|The Lebaudy Patrie was a <b>semi-rigid</b> airship {{built for}} the French army in Moisson, France, by sugar {{producers}} Lebaudy Frères. Designed by Henri Julliot, Lebaudy's chief engineer, the Patrie was completed in November 1906 and {{handed over to the}} military the following month. The Patrie bears the distinction of being the first airship ordered for military service by the French army.|$|E
5|$|To enable spacewalks, Salyut 6 was {{equipped}} with an inward-opening EVA hatch {{on the side of}} the forward transfer compartment, which could be used as an airlock in a similar way to the system used on Salyut 4. This compartment contained two new <b>semi-rigid</b> spacesuits which allowed much greater flexibility than earlier suits, and could be donned within five minutes in case of an emergency. Finally, the station offered considerable improvements in living conditions over previous outposts, with machinery being soundproofed, the crews being provided with designated 'cots' for sleeping and the equipping of the station with a shower and extensive gymnasium.|$|E
5|$|From 1927 to 1942, Kasuga {{was used}} as a {{training}} vessel for navigators and engineers. On 27 July 1928 she rescued the crew of the <b>semi-rigid</b> airship N3 after it exploded in heavy weather during fleet maneuvers. In January–February 1934, Kasuga ferried 40 scientists to Truk to observe a total solar eclipse on 14 February. She was hulked and disarmed in July 1942 and used as a floating barracks {{for the rest of the}} Pacific War. Kasuga capsized at her mooring at Yokosuka on 18 July 1945 during an air raid by United States Navy aircraft from TF-38. Her wreck was salvaged in August 1948 and broken up for scrap by the Uraga Dock Company.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a <b>semi-rigid</b> airship {{required}} that the pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Prevented from {{cutting the}} French line ahead of Achille, HMS Brunswick turned {{and tried to}} cross aft of her, between Achille and Vengeur. Seeing the manoeuvre, Renaudin also {{accelerated}} to close this new gap, and Brunswick and Vengeur collided, the anchor of Brunswick becoming entangled in the rigging of Vengeur. Vengeur fired an entire broadside at point-blank range, but was then unable to fire her main batteries again, the ships being so close as to prevent French gunners from ramming ammunition into their guns; in contrast, British gunners used rammers with <b>semi-rigid</b> rope handles instead of wooden handles, {{and were able to}} reload and maintain a sustained fire, riddling Vengeur with holes. The fight went on for four hours, until Brunswick, after shattering the rudder of Vengeur to prevent her from manoeuvring, separated at 12:45. Her fire also opened a large hole in the hull of Vengeur.|$|E

25|$|The ship {{carries a}} {{complement}} of several smaller working boats on board. The largest is the container barge Gros Ventre ("Fat Belly"); others include a small utility boat, a <b>semi-rigid</b> rubber raft, and a zodiac. Naturally the vessel also carries the required types of life boats.|$|E
25|$|The Bell 407 is a four-blade, single-engine, civil utility helicopter; a {{derivative}} of the Bell 206L-4 LongRanger. The 407 uses the four-blade, soft-in-plane design rotor with composite hub {{developed for the}} United States Army's OH-58D Kiowa Warrior instead of the two-blade, <b>semi-rigid,</b> teetering rotor of the 206L-4.|$|E
25|$|A bag is a non-rigid or <b>semi-rigid</b> {{container}} {{usually made}} of paper {{which is used}} to hold items or packages. In 1868, Margaret E. Knight while living in Springfield, Massachusetts invented a machine that folded and glued paper to form the brown paper bags familiar to what shoppers know and use today.|$|E
25|$|The {{appropriate}} surgical {{management of}} an alar lobule defect {{depends upon the}} dimensions (length, width, depth) of the wound. Anatomically, the nasal skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a <b>semi-rigid</b> aesthetic subunit that forms the graceful curve of the alar rim, and provides unobstructed airflow through the nostrils, the anterior nares.|$|E
25|$|The Mini-500 has a {{tubular steel}} {{fuselage}} with a foam and glass-fibre structure cabin. It has a two-bladed <b>semi-rigid</b> rotor and a conventional two-blade tail rotor. The first Mini-500 flew in 1992 {{and the company}} delivered the first production factory-assembled helicopter in July 1994. Production of kits ceased in 1999 and the company claimed that more than 500 had been sold.|$|E
25|$|The Lebaudy République (later {{known as}} La République) was a <b>semi-rigid</b> airship {{built for the}} French army in Moisson, France, by sugar {{manufacturers}} Lebaudy Frères. She was a sister ship of the Patrie, the main {{differences between the two}} being in the dimensions of the gasbag (or 'envelope') and the ballonet. Although she was operationally successful, the République crashed in 1909 due to a mechanical failure, killing all four crew members.|$|E
25|$|Coelophysis had narrow hips, forelimbs {{adapted for}} grasping, and narrow feet. Its neck and tail {{were long and}} slender. The pelvis and hindlimbs of C. bauri are also slight {{variations}} on the theropod body plan. It has the open acetabulum and straight ankle hinge that define the Dinosauria. The hindlimb ended in a three-toed foot (pes), with a raised hallux. The tail had an unusual structure within its interlocking prezygapophysis of its vertebrae, which formed a <b>semi-rigid</b> lattice, apparently to stop the tail from moving up and down.|$|E
25|$|On modern yachts, {{standing}} rigging is often {{stainless steel wire}}, stainless steel rod or synthetic fiber. <b>Semi-rigid</b> stainless steel wire {{is by far the}} most common as it combines extreme strength, relative ease of assembling and rigging with reliability. Unlike rigid stainless steel rod, it is comparatively easy to recognize wear and stress as individual strains (normally 19) break often near a swage fitting, and can be inspected while standing. Solid rod stainless steel is more aerodynamic so is often used in extreme racing yachts but it is difficult to see stress as this requires x-raying. Great care must be used when swaging fittings onto stainless steel rod as this can start minute cracking. Rod-type stays fail suddenly, often where the rod bends around a spreader. Bending can induce unseen stress fractures.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's dynamic {{components}} include the engine, transmission, rotor mast, main rotor blades, tail rotor driveshaft, and the 42-degree and 90-degree gearboxes. The transmission is of a planetary type {{and reduces the}} engine's output to 324 rpm at the main rotor. The two-bladed, <b>semi-rigid</b> rotor design, with pre-coned and underslung blades, is a development of early Bell model designs, such as the Bell 47 with which it shares common design features, including a dampened stabilizer bar. The two-bladed system reduces storage space required for the aircraft, but {{at a cost of}} higher vibration levels. The two-bladed design is also responsible for the characteristic 'Huey thump' when the aircraft is in flight, which is particularly evident during descent and in turning flight. The tail rotor is driven from the main transmission, via the two directional gearboxes which provide a tail rotor speed approximately six times that of the main rotor to increase tail rotor effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|<b>Semi-rigid</b> {{airships}} {{were considered}} {{more suitable for}} military use because, unlike rigid airships, they could be deflated, stored and transported by land or by sea. The Patrie was a <b>semi-rigid</b> airship manufactured by the French sugar magnates Paul and Pierre Lebaudy and designed by their chief engineer, Henri Julliot. She was the second Lebaudy airship, and [...] "surpassed her predecessor in both size and method of construction". The company's first airship, simply known as the Lebaudy, and dubbed by the French public [...] "Le Jaune" [...] ("The Yellow (One)") because of the yellow colour of the lead chromate paint on its cloth exterior, was considered the most successful airship then in operation.|$|E
500|$|In an indoor–outdoor {{thermometer}} {{based on}} a conventional liquid-in-glass thermometer, the stem of the outdoor thermometer {{is connected to the}} bulb by a long, flexible or <b>semi-rigid</b> capillary. [...] The temperature scale is marked on the stem as usual. [...] However, the temperature that is actually measured is the temperature at the bulb.|$|E
500|$|The cost of {{construction}} aggregate in Afghanistan is high (around $250 to $650 per cubic metre) because {{of security and}} transport costs, therefore Foley attempted to minimise its use. [...] A series of trials using various foundation systems was carried out at Camp Bastion to assess the capacity of a geosynthetic cell system called Neoweb. [...] Neoweb is supplied flat but unfolds to form a hollow honeycomb structure that can be backfilled with aggregate and overlain with a wearing course. [...] The specification of Neoweb allowed a 75percent reduction in aggregate and a two-thirds cost saving compared to traditional road-building methods. [...] The Neoweb layer acts as a <b>semi-rigid</b> slab foundation and is designed to allow the surfacing layer to hold together under heavy vehicles and in harsh weather. [...] The foundation also {{makes it harder for}} insurgents to plant IEDs under or in the road.|$|E

2500|$|British Army Dirigible No 1, christened Nulli Secundus (Latin: [...] "Second to none") was a <b>Semi-rigid</b> airship. First flown on 10 September 1907, it was Britain's first powered {{military}} aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|Rigid {{barriers}} such as {{concrete and}} <b>semi-rigid</b> barriers such as steel guardrail, exhibit impact deflections of 0 to 4ft, respectively. [...] Flexible {{systems such as}} cable barriers deflect between 8 and 12ft upon impact.|$|E
2500|$|... were {{modified}} {{as needed}} in order to account for liquids whose molecules are known to be [...] "associated" [...] in the liquid state at ordinary temperatures. When various molecules combine together to form an associated molecule, they enclose within a <b>semi-rigid</b> system a certain amount of space which before was available as free space for mobile molecules. Thus, increase in viscosity upon cooling due to the tendency of most substances to become associated on cooling.|$|E
2500|$|PET in {{its natural}} state is a colorless, semi-crystalline resin. Based on how it is processed, PET can be <b>semi-rigid</b> to rigid, {{and it is very}} lightweight. It makes a good gas and fair {{moisture}} barrier, as well as a good barrier to alcohol (requires additional [...] "barrier" [...] treatment) and solvents. It is strong and impact-resistant. PET becomes white when exposed to chloroform and also certain other chemicals such as toluene.|$|E
2500|$|Bell {{participated in}} a joint Bell-Government {{integrated}} test team during the engineering manufacturing development (EMD) phase of the H-1 program. The AH-1Z program progressed slowly from 1996 to 2003 largely as a research and development operation. [...] The existing two-blade <b>semi-rigid,</b> teetering rotor system is being replaced with a four-blade, hingeless, bearingless rotor system. The four-blade configuration provides improvements in flight characteristics including increased flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate of climb, payload and reduced rotor vibration level.|$|E
2500|$|The Lebaudy Morning Post was a French <b>semi-rigid</b> airship {{built for}} the British Army in Moisson, France, by [...] {{manufacturers}} Lebaudy Frères. The airship was commissioned by the newspaper The Morning Post, who created a fund to purchase the airship and present it to the British Army. The airship's envelope was damaged on the delivery flight {{and then it was}} destroyed on a subsequent trial flight after repair. [...] At the time of construction it was the largest airship that had been built in France.|$|E

2500|$|The {{existing}} two-bladed <b>semi-rigid,</b> teetering {{rotor system}} is being {{replaced with a}} four-bladed, hingeless, bearingless composite rotor system. The improvement in flight characteristics provided by the four-bladed configuration has led to increases in flight envelope, maximum speed, vertical rate-of-climb, payload and [...] reduced rotor vibration. The rotor system has 75% fewer parts than that of four-bladed articulated systems, and the improved yokes allow for weight saving with {{the elimination of all}} bearings, hinges, and vibration absorbers in the rotor hub. The blades are made of carbon fiber-based composites, which have an increased ballistic survivability, and there is a semiautomatic folding system for stowage aboard Amphibious assault ships. Both helicopters will receive an upgraded, four-blade tail rotor and drive system.|$|E
2500|$|The Hawk 4 had a steel {{rotor mast}} and engine {{mountings}} but was mostly aluminium elsewhere, including the rotor, rotor head and propeller. The fuselage was an aluminium semi-monocoque. [...] Some components, {{such as the}} nosecone, engine cowling and cabin door were formed from composite materials. [...] The rotor was a <b>semi-rigid</b> or teetering design with a swash plate, rotating at up to 270 rpm. [...] Yaw was jointly controlled by the balanced rudders on the endplate fins and the all-moving inboard rudders. [...] It had a fixed, tricycle undercarriage with mainwheels mounted at {{the tips of the}} stub wings. [...] Two rows of seats accommodated the pilot and up to three passengers; alternatively, the rear seats could be folded to provide baggage space.|$|E
2500|$|In 1956 DuPont {{introduced}} polyether polyols, specifically poly(tetramethylene ether) glycol, and BASF and Dow Chemical {{started selling}} polyalkylene glycols in 1957. Polyether polyols were cheaper, easier to handle and more water-resistant than polyester polyols, and became more popular. Union Carbide and Mobay, a U.S. Monsanto/Bayer joint venture, also began making polyurethane chemicals. In 1960 more than 45,000 {{metric tons of}} flexible polyurethane foams were produced. The availability of chlorofluoroalkane blowing agents, inexpensive polyether polyols, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) allowed [...] polyurethane rigid foams {{to be used as}} high-performance insulation materials. In 1967, urethane-modified polyisocyanurate rigid foams were introduced, offering even better thermal stability and flammability resistance. During the 1960s, automotive interior safety components, such as instrument and door panels, were produced by back-filling thermoplastic skins with <b>semi-rigid</b> foam.|$|E
2500|$|Foot-launched {{aircraft}} {{had been}} flown by Lilienthal {{and at the}} meetings at Wasserkuppe in the 1920s. However the innovation that led to modern hang gliders was in 1951 when Francis Rogallo and Gertrude Rogallo applied for a patent for a fully flexible wing with a stiffening structure. [...] The American space agency NASA began testing in various flexible and <b>semi-rigid</b> configurations of this Rogallo wing in 1957 {{in order to use}} it as a recovery system for the Gemini space capsules. Charles Richards and Paul Bikle developed the concept producing a wing that was simple to build which was capable of slow flight and as gentle landing. Between 1960 and 1962 Barry Hill Palmer used this concept to make foot-launched hang gliders, followed in 1963 by Mike Burns who built a kite-hang glider called Skiplane. In 1963, John W. Dickenson began commercial production.|$|E
2500|$|... {{the nasal}} skin – A tight {{envelope}} that proceeds inferiorly from the glabella (the smooth prominence between the eyebrows), which then becomes thinner and progressively inelastic (less distensible). The {{skin of the}} mid-third of the nose covers the cartilaginous dorsum and the upper lateral cartilages and is relatively elastic, but, at the (far) distal-third of the nose, the skin adheres tightly to the alar cartilages, and is little distensible. The skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a <b>semi-rigid</b> anatomic unit that maintains the graceful curve of the alar rim, and the patency (openness) of the nostrils (anterior nares). To preserve this nasal shape and patency, {{the replacement of the}} alar lobule must include a supporting cartilage graft—despite the alar lobule not originally containing cartilage; because of its many sebaceous glands, the nasal skin usually is of a smooth (oiled) texture. Moreover, regarding scarrification, when compared to the skin of other facial areas, the skin of the nose generates fine-line scars that usually are inconspicuous, which allows the surgeon to strategically hide the surgical scars.|$|E
2500|$|The {{envelope}} {{of the experimental}} prototype had a volume of [...] of hydrogen gas, but production models used a [...] {{envelope of}} similar shape that provided a typical gross lift of , a net lift of [...] and a disposable lift of [...] with full fuel tanks and a crew of two on board. Each of the SS versions used similar envelopes that were composed of four layers: two of rubber-proofed fabric {{with a layer of}} rubber between them, and a further rubber layer on the inner, or gas surface. The external surface had five coats of dope applied to it to protect it from the elements and to render the envelope completely gastight. The first two coats were of [...] "Delta dope" [...] (a flexible dope used {{for the first time in}} 1913 on the British Army <b>semi-rigid</b> airship Delta), followed by two of aluminium dope and finally one of aluminium varnish. To stiffen the nose of the envelope and to prevent it blowing in, 24 canes were arranged radially from its centre and covered with an aluminium cap.|$|E
2500|$|In Germany Graf (Count) Ferdinand von Zeppelin {{pioneered the}} {{construction}} of large rigid airships: his first design of 1900-01 had only limited success and his second was not constructed until 1906, but his efforts became an enormous source of patriotic pride for the German people: {{so much so that}} when his fourth airship LZ4 was wrecked in a storm a public collection raised more than six million marks to enable him to carry on his work. [...] Using Zeppelins, the world's first airline, DELAG, was established in Germany in 1910, operating pleasure cruises rather than a scheduled transport service: by the outbreak of war in 1914 1588 flights had been made carrying 10,197 fare-paying passengers. [...] The military threat posed by these large airships, greatly superior in carrying power and endurance to heavier-than air machines of the time, caused considerable concern in other countries, especially Britain. [...] Germany was alone in constructing rigid airships, and airship development elsewhere concentrated on non-rigid and <b>semi-rigid</b> designs. [...] The only British attempt to construct a large rigid aiship, HMANo.1, broke its back before making a single flight and was abandoned, and the single French-built rigid was not much more successful.|$|E
2500|$|Externally, Columbia was {{the first}} orbiter in the fleet whose surface was mostly covered with High & Low Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI/LRSI) tiles as its main thermal {{protection}} system (TPS), with white silicone rubber-painted Nomex – known as Felt Reusable Surface Insulation (FRSI) blankets – in some areas on the wings, fuselage and payload bay doors. FRSI once covered almost 25% of the orbiter; the first upgrade resulted in its removal from many areas, and in later flights it was only used on the upper section of the payload bay doors and inboard sections of the upper wing surfaces. The upgrade also involved replacing many of the white LRSI tiles on the upper surfaces with Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) blankets (also known as Fibrous Insulation Blankets, or FIBs) {{that had been used}} on Discovery and Atlantis. Originally, Columbia had 32,000 tiles – the upgrade reduced this to 24,300. The AFRSI blankets consisted of layers of pure silica felt sandwiched between a layer of silica fabric on the outside and S-Glass fabric on the inside, stitched together using pure silica thread in a 1-inch grid, then coated with a high-purity silica coating. The blankets were <b>semi-rigid</b> and could be made as large as 30" [...] by 30". Each blanket replaced as many as 25 tiles and was bonded directly to the orbiter. The direct application of the blankets to the orbiter resulted in weight reduction, improved durability, reduced fabrication and installation cost, and reduced installation schedule time. All of this work was performed during Columbia's first retrofitting and the post-Challenger stand-down.|$|E
