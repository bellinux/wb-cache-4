50|$|With {{increasing}} turbine entry temperature, it {{is important}} to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical phenomena occurring during creep deformation of single crystal superalloys under such extreme condition (i.e. high temperature and high stress). The creep deformation behavior of superalloy single crystal is strongly temperature, stress, orientation and alloy dependent. For a <b>single-crystal</b> <b>superalloy,</b> there are 3 different mode of creep deformation under regimes of different temperature and stress: Rafting, Tertiary and Primary. At low temperature (~750 °C), SX alloys exhibits mostly primary creep behavior. Matan et al. concluded that the extent of primary creep deformation depends strongly on the angle between the tensile axis and the <001>/<011> symmetry boundary. At temperature above 850 °C, tertiary creep dominates and promotes strain softening behavior. When temperature exceeds 1000 °C, the rafting effect is prevalent where cubic particles transform into flat shapes under tensile stress The rafts would also form perpendicular to the tensile axis, since γ phase was transported out of the vertical channels and into the horizontal ones. After conducting unaxial creep deformation of <001> orientated CMSX-4 single crystal superalloy at 1105 °C and 100 MPa, Reed et al. has established that rafting is beneficial to creep life since it delays evolution of creep strain. In addition, rafting would occur quickly and suppress the accumulation of creep strain until a critical strain is reached.|$|E

An extension of Schmid's law is combined with the Bodner-Partom equations to model the inelastic tension/compression asymmetry and orientation-dependence in octahedral slip.

The level of porosity was found not to affect any of the tensile properties, while the gamma/gamma-prime eutectic strongly influenced ductility. Eliminating the gamma/gamma-prime eutectic increased ductility which was attributed to the cleavage fracture of this constituent. It is proposed that such cleavage of the gamma/gamma-prime eutectic is initiated by the stress created from impinging slip bands, promoting shear localization, and final fracture along 111 slip planes. The precise nature of this fracture process is discussed, with emphasis {{on the role of the}} gamma/gamma-prime microstructure.

40|$|Superalloys are a {{group of}} {{materials}} {{that are used in}} high temperature applications, for example gas turbines and aero engines. Gas turbines are most commonly used for power generation, and it is only the very critical components which are exposed to the most severe conditions within the turbine, which are made from superalloy material. Today, energy consumption {{in many parts of the}} world is very high and is tending to increase. This implies that all power generating sources, including gas turbines, must aim for higher efficiency. For the gas turbine industry, it is a continuous challenge to develop more energy-efficient turbines. One way to do this is to increase the temperature within the hot stage of the turbine. However, increased temperature in the hot stage also challenges the materials that are used there. Today’s materials are already pushed to the limit, i. e. they cannot be exposed to the temperatures which are required to further increase the turbine efficiency. To solve this problem, research which later can lead to better superalloys that can withstand even higher temperatures, has to be conducted within the area of superalloys. The aim of this licentiate thesis is to increase our knowledge about  deformation and damage mechanisms that occur in the microstructure in superalloys when they are subjected to high temperatures and loads. This knowledge can later be used when developing new superalloys. In addition, increased knowledge of what is happening within the material when it is exposed to those severe conditions, will facilitate the development of material models. Material models are used for FEM simulations, when trying to predict life times in gas turbine components during the design process. This licentiate thesis is based on results from thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) testing of Ni-based <b>single-crystal</b> <b>superalloys.</b> Results show that the deformation within the microstructure during TMF is localized to several deformation bands.

40|$|International audienceIt {{is shown}} {{experimentally}} that during load free annealing and creep under low applied stresses the matrix dislocation loops frequently cross glide. The periodicity {{length of the}} zigzag dislocations deposited in the interfaces is {{equal to that of}} the γ/γ'-microstructure. Initially the zigzag dislocations move in the (001) interface by a combination of glide and climb but then they stop near the γ'-edges and align along 〈 001 〉. Reactions of such dislocations lead to the formation of square interfacial networks consisting of 〈 001 〉 oriented edge dislocations. The complex dislocation movement is explained by the inhomogeneity of the misfit stresses between γ- and γ'-lattices. The tensile components of the stress tensor drive the dislocation through the channel, while the shear components near the γ'-edges cause the zigzag movement and the 〈 001 〉 alignment.
