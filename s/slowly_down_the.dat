5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, owners Absolute Leisure sold Tuxedo Princess {{to foreign}} investors. She was renamed Prince in 2008 and {{moved from the}} Tyne to Greece. Towed from her mooring on 27 July 2008, she was guided <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Tyne at low tide by two tugs. She passed under the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, which had been {{designed}} to accommodate this move when installed in November 2000. Due to fog at the coast, she was moored overnight at Northumbria Quay, North Shields and left the next day, with an ocean-going tug towing her to Greece.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan {{began moving}} aggressively in September. He {{defeated}} Early in the Third Battle of Winchester on September 19 and the Battle of Fisher's Hill on September 21–22. With Early damaged and pinned down, the Valley lay {{open to the}} Union. Coupled with Sherman's capture of Atlanta and Adm. David Farragut's victory at Mobile Bay, Lincoln's re-election seemed assured. Sheridan pulled back <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Valley and conducted a scorched earth campaign that presaged Sherman's March to the Sea in November. The goal was to deny the Confederacy the means of feeding its armies in Virginia, and Sheridan's army burned crops, barns, mills, and factories.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|The {{guns were}} still {{operable}} so Brooke had his men return the pirates' fire. No hits were made but near hits forced the pirates {{to leave their}} wounded and abandon ship without fighting. Brooke then decided on rescuing the survivors {{though most of the}} Sulus took their weapons into the water and continued to fight. The captain also had his men refloat the steamer which was done somewhat easily. Few pirates were recovered according to McDougall and when they saved all that could be, the Rainbow and the Jolly Bachelor continued on <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> coast. During this time one of the pirates said that there were three more prahus nearby which were waiting for the three already engaged to rejoin them. After an hour the weather was very calm and a lookout at the masthead spotted the three enemy ships to the starboard, lining up to bear their bow guns on the approaching steamers. However, when the wind picked up again the pirates changed their tactics and hoisted sail to move their ships into broadside position. As the Sarawakians neared the pirates they opened up with their swivels but Brooke waited until his ships were 250 yards away before he gave his men the order to return the fire.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Farrell, who {{had served}} for many years as Michigan's track coach and the trainer of the {{football}} team, died {{four days before the}} Ohio State game.

2500|$|As his {{procession}} {{came along}} the Place de la Concorde on Saturday 26 August, it came under machine gun fire by Vichy militia and fifth columnists who {{were unable to}} give themselves up. Later, on entering the Notre Dame cathedral to be received {{as head of the}} provisional government by the Committee of Liberation, loud shots broke out again, and Leclerc and Koenig tried to hustle him through the door, but de Gaulle shook off their hands and never faltered. While the battle began outside, he walked <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> aisle. Before he had gone far a machine pistol fired down from above, at least two more joined in, and from below the FFI and police fired back. A BBC correspondent who was present reported; ...|$|E
