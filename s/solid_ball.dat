25|$|A cricket ball is a hard, <b>solid</b> <b>ball</b> {{used to play}} cricket. A cricket ball {{consists}} of cork covered by leather, and manufacture is regulated by cricket law at first-class level. The manipulation of a cricket ball, through employment of its various physical properties, is a staple component of bowling and dismissing batsmen. Movement in the air, and off the ground, {{is influenced by the}} condition of the ball, the efforts of the bowler and the pitch, while working on the cricket ball to obtain optimum condition is a key role of the fielding side. The cricket ball is the principal manner through which the batsman scores runs, by manipulating the ball into a position where it would be safe to take a run, or by directing the ball through or over the boundary.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} is to develop {{mathematical}} models of the treatment methods using loose <b>solid</b> <b>balls.</b> Analysis of treatment with the use of loose <b>solid</b> <b>balls</b> behaviour is carried out for modelling. The operating factors such as geometrical parameters of a nozzle, distance to the treated surface, and pressure of compressed air and outlet factors such as level of strengthening, depth of hardened layer are determined. It is proposed to put into basis of the mathematical models the energy conception that permit for unification and simplification of mathematical description of the processes. The level of strengthening, and depth of hardened layer are estimated for the plain surfaces by means of created mathematical models. Design/methodology/approach: The main methods used for the theoretical research are mathematical modelling, integral calculus, fundamentals of analytic geometry, theory of probability, hydraulics of multiphase flow. The main methods used for the experimental investigations were conducted by receiving diagrams of surface roughness, microhardness of the oblique slices of the treated samples, speckle interferograms of the surfaces treated using loose <b>solid</b> <b>balls.</b> Findings: A method of mathematical modelling for treatment with the use of loose <b>solid</b> <b>balls</b> is developed based on the energy conception. The mathematical model is created and allows calculating the characteristics of surface quality depending on the technological modes of treatment. Research limitations/implications: It is planned to develop and improve the methods of mathematical modelling of the treatment using loose <b>solid</b> <b>balls</b> in future research by extending them for the curvilinear treated surfaces, which are characterised by a movement relative to the nozzle. Practical implications: have the applied software, elaborated on the basis of the models, that allows providing for automation of calculations of the characteristics of surface quality depending on the technological modes of the treatment. Originality/value: It is pioneered to receive functional dependences between depth of a hardening layer, changing microhardness, degree of hardening and the parameters of equipment, blast of loose <b>solid</b> <b>balls,</b> and working medium. The created functional dependences take the distribution of characteristics of working medium into account (mass and velocity) all along the cross-sections of the blast...|$|R

25|$|Another {{argument}} against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem counterintuitive. One example is the Banach–Tarski paradox which {{says that it is}} possible to decompose the 3-dimensional <b>solid</b> unit <b>ball</b> into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two <b>solid</b> <b>balls</b> each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are non-measurable sets.|$|R
2500|$|A simple {{application}} of dimensional analysis to mathematics is in computing {{the form of}} the volume of an n-ball (the <b>solid</b> <b>ball</b> in n dimensions), or the area of its surface, the n-sphere: being an n-dimensional figure, the volume scales as [...] while the surface area, being -dimensional, scales as [...] Thus the volume of the n-ball in terms of the radius is [...] for some constant [...] Determining the constant takes more involved mathematics, but the form can be deduced and checked by dimensional analysis alone.|$|E
2500|$|The Banach–Tarski {{paradox is}} a theorem in {{set-theoretic}} geometry, which states the following: Given a <b>solid</b> <b>ball</b> in 3‑dimensional space, {{there exists a}} decomposition of the ball into {{a finite number of}} disjoint subsets, which can then be put back together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball. Indeed, [...] the reassembly process involves only moving the pieces around and rotating them, without changing their shape. However, the pieces themselves are not [...] "solids" [...] in the usual sense, but infinite scatterings of points. [...] The reconstruction can work with as few as five pieces.|$|E

2500|$|The single s-orbitals (...) {{are shaped}} like spheres. For [...] it is roughly a <b>solid</b> <b>ball</b> (it is most dense {{at the center}} and fades {{exponentially}} outwardly), but for [...] or more, each single s-orbital is composed of spherically symmetric surfaces which are nested shells (i.e., the [...] "wave-structure" [...] is radial, following a sinusoidal radial component as well). See illustration of a cross-section of these nested shells, at right. The s-orbitals for all [...] numbers are the only orbitals with an anti-node (a region of high wave function density) {{at the center of}} the nucleus. All other orbitals (p, d, f, etc.) have angular momentum, and thus avoid the nucleus (having a wave node at the nucleus). Recently, there has been an effort to experimentally image the 1s and 2p orbitials in a SrTiO3 crystal using scanning transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. Because the imaging was conducted using an electron beam, Coulombic beam-orbital interaction that is often termed as the impact parameter effect is included in the final outcome (see the figure at right).|$|E
2500|$|Two famous {{statements}} in set theory are the {{axiom of choice}} and the continuum hypothesis. The axiom of choice, first stated by Zermelo (1904), was proved independent of ZF by Fraenkel (1922), but {{has come to be}} widely accepted by mathematicians. [...] It states that given a collection of nonempty sets there is a single set C that contains exactly one element from each set in the collection. The set C is said to [...] "choose" [...] one element from each set in the collection. While the ability to make such a choice is considered obvious by some, since each set in the collection is nonempty, the lack of a general, concrete rule by which the choice can be made renders the axiom nonconstructive. Stefan Banach and Alfred Tarski (1924) showed that the axiom of choice can be used to decompose a <b>solid</b> <b>ball</b> into a finite number of pieces which can then be rearranged, with no scaling, to make two solid balls of the original size. This theorem, known as the Banach–Tarski paradox, is one of many counterintuitive results of the axiom of choice.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the ball}} is older {{and there is an}} {{asymmetry}} in roughness the seam no longer causes the pressure difference, and can actually reduce the swing of the ball. Air turbulence is no longer used to create separation point differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the rough side of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface. [...] These irregularities act {{in the same manner as}} the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the rough side of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the rough side, due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than <b>solid</b> <b>ball.</b> This lowers the static pressure relative to the shiny side, which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the rough side of the ball, the separation point on the rough side will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the turbulent air, thereby creating more lift and faster air flow. [...] This is why a new ball will swing more than an old ball. If the seam is used to create the turbulent air on the rough side, the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences.|$|E

40|$|It is {{theoretically}} revealed that, {{in classical}} physics of spacetimes with wormholes, there are analogs of wave function reduction events, quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiment. Within the suggested approach, wormholes are specified by a typical microscopic radius of their mouths, and this causes the size effect in operation of wormhole-based time machines (closed timelike curves; CTCs). For geometric reasons, classical <b>solid</b> <b>balls</b> in a spacetime with a wormhole {{are divided into}} the two categories: small and large balls whose traverse through wormholes is permitted and forbidden, respectively. Evolutions of small balls on CTCs can be self-inconsistent (or, in other terms, inconsistent with conventional causality), in which case there is an uncertainty in their behaviors. In contrast, evolutions of large <b>solid</b> <b>balls</b> are always unambiguous. In the situation where small balls can be absorbed by large balls, uncertain behaviors of small balls transform into unambiguous evolutions of large balls in the logical way analogous {{to that of a}} quantum measurement - wave function reduction - event. Also, within the suggested approach operating with classical balls in spacetimes with wormholes, analogs of quantum entanglement and EPR experiment are defined and theoretically described.

By these means the men were enabled to walk about erect when off duty, without fear of annoyance from sharpshooters. The enemy used in their defence explosive musket-balls, no doubt thinking that, bursting over our men in the trenches, they would do some execution; but I do not remember a single case where a man was injured by a piece of one of these shells.

[Footnote 25: As it is {{possible}} this book may pass {{into the hands of}} others than Americans, it maybe well to say that a sleigh-bell is a small hollow ball, made of bell-metal, having a hole in it that passes round half of its circumference, and containing a small <b>solid</b> <b>ball,</b> of a size not to escape. These bells are fastened to leathern straps, which commonly pass round the necks of the horses. In the time of Guert Ten Eyck, most of the bells were attached to small plates, that were buckled to various parts of the harness; but, as this caused a motion annoying to the animals, Mr. Littlepage evidently wishes his readers to understand that his friend, Ten Eyck, was too knowing to have recourse to the practice. Even the straps are coming into disuse, the opinion beginning to obtain that sleigh-bells are a nuisance, instead of an advantage. Twenty years since, the laws of most large towns rendered them necessary, under the pretence of preventing accidents by apprising the footman of the approach of a sleigh; but more horses are now driven, in the state of New York, without than with bells, in winter.|$|E

40|$|The tensile {{strength}} of water increases when solid particles are filtered out, {{and it becomes}} greater the smaller the remaining particles are. Natural particles are of random shape, making parametric studies {{on the relationship between}} {{tensile strength}} and particle characteristics difficult. In this investigation, using degased tap water from which natural particles larger than about 1 (m were filtered out, the tensile strength was measured before and after seeding with almost spherical <b>solid</b> <b>balls</b> of diameters from 3 (m up to 76 (m. The smallest balls, though hydrophobic and notably larger than the remaining natural nuclei, had no measurable influence on the tensile strength. Seeding with balls at least a factor of ten to forty larger than the largest remaining natural nuclei reduced the tensile strength by only between 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 of that measured for the unseeded filtered water. On this basis it is concluded that a greater tensile strength is connected to the almost spherical <b>solid</b> <b>balls</b> than that connected to natural particles of the same size.
