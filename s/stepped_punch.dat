FE and experimental analysis has been conducted to study {{the performance of the}} polymers that were used as the pressurising medium and to examine process design and component-quality issues. A testing method which uses a compound cylinder was also introduced to test the polymers under nearly confined conditions. Both material testing and forming experiment results showed that several polymers may function well as the pressurising medium for the configuration examined. The process can be effected by using a <b>stepped</b> <b>punch,</b> rather than using two punches (which need to be controlled independently), if the compressibility of the pressurising material can be compensated for sufficiently...|$|E

This research adopted a <b>step</b> <b>punching</b> method to form a radial microgroove structure {{on the surface of}} a copper plate. The scanning electron microscopy analysis indicates that when the pressed metal is in the deformation range, it will flow under extrusion and is subject to the reaction force from the metal outside the deformation range, so a micro-finned structure nearby the punching tool is formed. And the deformation area of the formed microgroove is higher than the workpiece’s primitive surface. The relationships of the punching interference length Li with θc, ac, and αpt are analyzed; and the influence of forming parameters on the groove surface morphology as well as the relationships among these parameters are discussed.

Head cold forging is a widely common production process which can achieve economical processes and less energy consumption.

This paper proposes the collaborative die design and analysis by combining engineering methods and industrial experts to correct problems and to validate a new and complex design. DEFORM is used to investigate suitable parameters by guidance from the expert. One of the classical problem in the head cold forging is to make a small long complex stud.

40|$|Sequential {{sheet metal}} forming {{processes}} can result in the accumulation of work hardening and damage effects in the workpiece material. The mechanical strength of the final component depends on the “evolution” of these two characteristics in the different production <b>steps.</b> The <b>punching</b> process, which is usually {{in the beginning of}} the production chain, has an important impact on the stress, strain and damage states in the punched zones. It is essential that the influence of these mechanical fields be taken into account in the simulation of the forming sequence. In order to evaluate the evolution of each phenomenon, and in particular damage accumulation in the forming process, it is essential to characterize the punching process. The objective of this work is to understand and identify the physical damage mechanisms that occur during the punching operation and to establish relevant numerical models to predict the fracture location. The effect of the punch–die clearance on mechanical fields distribution is also discussed in this work...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{measurement}} {{system for a}} punching test for small holes in rigid copper clad laminates is presented. Copper clad laminate is a main raw material for consumer electronics, information and telecommunications devices. The process parameters such as blank temperature, blank thickness and material specifications {{are closely related to}} the characteristics of the punching forces and displacements in copper clad laminates. The proposed system consists of small-scale force transducer, displacement transducer and data acquisition system, with which the punching forces can be measured in each <b>punch</b> <b>steps.</b> A small <b>punch</b> with outer diameter 2 mm is directly connected to the force transducer to measure the pushing and pulling forces during the hole-punching process. Bushings and guide pins are used inside the die configuration in order to ensure path straightness when the punch moves into the die cavity. The experimental results show that the increase of punch and die clearances decreases the punching forces. The same result is obtained with increase of blank temperatures. In the final part of the paper, a computer-aided analysis package DEFORM 2 D is used to understand the deformation and crack initiation of the blank in the small hole-punching process. The analytical maximum punching force agrees with experimental result. The research results are a useful database when designing requirements of punch and ejecting force during manufacture...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{comprises}} {{an experimental}} study for a complex geometry part obtained by incremental forming. Due {{to the process}} complexity (the presence of forces on three directions—a vertical one and two in the blank's plane), a three axes CNC milling machine, capable of describing the complex paths covered by the punch for obtaining the truncated cone-shaped parts, has been chosen. To obtain a truncated cone, three different trajectories were selected: in first and second variants after each vertical press having a constant <b>step,</b> the <b>punch</b> covers a circular path. The differences show that the following circular trajectory can start {{at the same point}} or can be shifted at an angle of 90 ° from the previous press point.

40|$|Abstract. Grain {{refinement}} {{process can}} improve {{not only the}} strength, but also the forming characteristics of metals. In this paper, the free form forging process, which is broadly used in metal working factory, is considered to develop a multi-forging process, which can be served as a grain refinement process. Thereby, a bulk metal is plastically deformed repeatedly according {{to the principle of}} thermomechanical process for grain refinement. For each forging or deformation <b>step,</b> a flat <b>punch</b> is traveled onto the pre-heated material, so that the material height is to be halved. And the forged metal should then be folded or stacked after cutting and so prepared for the next deformation step, that the material will have the same height as in the previous step. However, before folding or stacking, the bulk metal must be quenched in water to hold the microstructure in the deformed metal. After folding or stacking, the material will be heated again to the forging temperature. In this paper, the commercial finite element code DEFORMTM is used to simulate such a grain refinement process in a plane strain state, in which a nickel alloy 718, 50 mm both in width and in thickness, is heated to 1000 °C and forged with a punch at 1000 °C. For the input data, especially for recrystallization processes, some stated in literatures are applied in this study. The simulation results show that the quenched grains with an average size of 22 µm can be achieved just after one forging step on th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{deep drawing}} process, the blank holder {{plays a key}} role in {{adjustment}} of metal flow into the die cavity. Moreover, the quality of drawn parts is extremely affected by this flow. There are two methods of treating the blank holder in deep drawing and its simulation. One is blank holder force (BHF) and the other is blank holder gap (BHG), defined as the fixed distance between the blank holder and the die surface. In previous studies, a large number of experimental techniques have been used to study BHF; however, the amount of theoretical and numerical simulation work to study BHG is insufficient. In the present study, the concept of BHG profile, i. e., variation of BHG over punch stroke is introduced and it is shown that a properly selected BHG profile can improve the section thickness of formed part and result in the drawing of deeper parts. Here, two methods for the opti-mization of BHG profile are devised, i. e., the local optimiza-tion and the global optimization methods. In the first ap-proach, the best BHG in each <b>punch</b> <b>step</b> is determined and finally, the local optimized BHG profile is achieved. In the second method, however, the empirical model for the predic-tion of final minimum section thickness in terms of BHG profile is obtained using design of experiments and neural networks. In the next stage, the proposed model is implanted into a simulated annealing optimization procedure to identify a proper BHG profile that can produce the desired blank thickness. Afterward, the BHG profile approach is applied to a variety of initial thicknesses, blank diameters, and materials in order to examine the robustness of method. In this paper, ABAQUS finite element package is used to gather finite element (FE) data and several experiments are performed to verify the FE results. Keywords Deep drawing process.
