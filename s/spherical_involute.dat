40|$|For {{straight}} or {{spiral bevel}} gears of nominal <b>spherical</b> <b>involute</b> design, the resultant total force vector transmitted by the gear mesh, {{in the absence of}} friction, lies in the plane of tooth contact. This force vector can be characterized by three scalar components, two orthogonal force components lying in the plane of contact and the resultant moment taken about the nominal center of the zone of contact. Equations for these three generalized force components are derived. The equations are expressed in terms of tooth pair/gear body stiffnesses, bearing/bearing support flexibility influence coefficients, the shaft input torque, deviations of the tooth running surfaces from perfect <b>spherical</b> <b>involute</b> surfaces, and bearing centerline offsets from the positions occupied by the base cone axes of the perfect involute bevel gear counterparts to the actual gears under consideration. Inertial forces arising from transverse and axial vibrations of the gear bodies are assumed to be negligible in comparison with the bearing support reaction forces...|$|E

Then the solid model of the spiral bevel gear is built through the functions of transferring the model’s file format, multi-section sweep and solid fill. Finally, the analysis to the performance of the bevel gear transmission is conducted. In the environment of the assembly design, the solid model of the gearwheel and the pinion are inserted respectively, and then the assembly is accomplished by applying the constraints. And in the environment of kinematics, the meshing simulation of the bevel gear pair is accomplished by applying angle drive.

Conjugate (pure involute) theoretical surfaces are developed from the input design parameters. The surfaces are modified to suit the actual application (automotive differential). The unloaded (or low load) tooth contact analysis of modified surfaces is performed to obtain the prediction of the contact pattern.

40|$|International audienceThe {{design of}} {{spiral bevel gears}} is still very complex because tooth {{geometry}} and thus kinematics performance depend on the manufacturing process {{of this type of}} gear. The cutting process is dominated by two major manufacturers: Gleason and Klingelnberg. The shape of the teeth surfaces are governed by a large number of programmed machine settings, so they cannot be optimized intuitively. Due to the progress made during the last decade by CNC machines and CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) softwares, it is now possible to manufacture spiral bevel gears with quite good quality on a 5 -axis milling machine. In a previous study, the authors presented a numerical model for calculating the quasi-static load sharing of spiral bevel gears. Two kinds of geometries were developed: a simplified Gleason type, and a geometry based on classical <b>spherical</b> <b>involutes</b> combined with a logarithmic spiral. After being generated using a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software, these two geometries were manufactured with a 5 -axis milling machine controlled by CAM software. A metrological study showed that manufacturing by a 5 -axis milling machine can be an alternative to conventional cutting methods. The aim of the present paper is to validate the numerical model. To reach this goal, a test bench was designed to measure the loaded transmission error and visualize the contact patterns. The test bench is integrated inside a numerical 3 -axis milling machine: the pinion is mounted on the spindle, while the base of the bench is clamped on its plate. Thus assembly errors can be imposed easily and accurately. Measured and simulated transmission errors are then compared for different axis misalignments cases...|$|R

With the central projection method, processing devices and cutters of involute straight bevel gear can also be designed which has no concern with modulus. The results show that the establishment of simulation database and processing cutters can greatly facilitate the design and processing of straight bevel gear, greatly reduce the design and finishing costs, and is also helpful to teaching training of gear...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{definition of}} the transmission error of parallel-axis gear pairs is reviewed and shown to be unsuitable for characterizing the deviation from conjugate action of bevel gear pairs for vibration excitation characterization purposes. This situation is rectified by generalizing {{the concept of the}} transmission error of parallel-axis gears to a three-component transmission error for spiral bevel gears of nominal <b>spherical</b> <b>involute</b> design. A general relationship is derived which expresses the contributions to the three-component transmission error from each gear of a meshing spiral bevel pair as a linear transformation of the six coordinates that describe the deviation of the shaft centerline position of each gear of the pair from the position of its rigid perfect involute counterpart...|$|E

Based on the gear geometry theory and the normal meshing motion equation of gear pairs, changes of meshing points and angles are analyzed {{and the effect of}} axial modification on meshing movement of gear pairs is discussed. After that, a method of drawing <b>spherical</b> <b>involute</b> with the aid of SolidWorks software is achieved, by which the accuracy of solid modeling of spur bevel gear is improved. After solid modeling, bevel gear analysis is carried out by ANSYS/LS-DYNA software so that the contact stress and acceleration changes of driven wheel during the meshing process which was used to guide the modification of spur bevel gear can be calculated. The simulation results show that the stress distribution of gear surface is controlled by tooth modification. The load concentration, agglutination and pitting of the gear can be avoided effectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Involute {{straight}} {{bevel gear}} pair often appears the phenomenons of meshing interference, impact and "end contact " {{in the course of}} meshing. Usually, symmetrical crowning is adopted to improve above phenomenons, however, due to the influence of complicated tooth loads and other complicated factors, the symmetrical crowned gear may not reach a good modification effect. In this paper, we adopt target variable curvature crowning according to the specific conditions of bevel gears in order to obtain good modification effect, nevertheless, because of the complexity of the variable curvature crowning, the conventional method of using space <b>spherical</b> <b>involute</b> stretch and sweep standard gear model to remove tooth surface materials has been unable to meet the accurate requirements of the variable curvature crowned model, at the same time, this method can not realize parametric modeling of modification bevel gear. Therefore, this paper puts forward an easy to realize parametric modeling method of accurate variable curvature crowning for involute {{straight bevel gear}} based on ANSYS/LS-DYNA, Imageware, Matlab and Solidworks. This method can realize the accurate modeling for variable curvature crowned involute straight bevel gear and ensure the accuracy of modification gears and follow-up finite element simulation, meanwhile, it provides theoretical basis for parametric modeling of variable curvature crowned involute straight bevel gear. Finally, the superiority of variable curvature crowning is tested through numerical simulation under specific conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The tooth {{flanks of}} bevel gears with {{involute}} teeth are still cut using approximations such as Tredgold’s and octoid curves, while {{the geometry of}} the exact <b>spherical</b> <b>involute</b> is well known. The modeling of the tooth flanks of gears with skew axes, however, still represents a challenge to geometers. Hence, {{there is a need}} to develop algorithms for the geometric modeling of these gears. As a matter of fact, the modeling of gears with skew axes and involute teeth is still an open question, as it is not even known whether it makes sense to speak of such tooth geometries. This paper is a contribution along these lines, as pertaining to gears with skew axes and cycloid teeth. To this end, the authors follow and extend results reported by Martin Disteli at the turn of the 20 th century concerning the general synthesis of gears with skew axes. The main goal is to shed light on the geometry of the tooth flanks of gears with skew axes. The dualization of the tooth profiles of spherical cycloidal gears leads to ruled surfaces as conjugate tooth flanks such that at any instant the contact points are located on a straight line. A main result reported herein is Theorem 5, which is original. All results are proven by means of a consistent use of dual vectors representing directed lines and rigid-body twists...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSimilar to the {{essential}} components of many mechanical systems, the geometrical {{properties of the}} teeth of spiral bevel gears greatly influence the kinematic and dynamic behaviors of mechanical systems. Logarithmic spiral bevel gears show a unique advantage in transmission due to their constant spiral angle property. However, a mathematical model suitable for accurate digital modeling, differential geometrical characteristics, and related contact analysis methods for tooth surfaces have not been deeply investigated, since such gears are not convenient in traditional cutting manufacturing in the gear industry. Accurate mathematical modeling of the tooth surface geometry for logarithmic spiral bevel gears is developed in this study, based on the basic gearing kinematics and <b>spherical</b> <b>involute</b> geometry along with the tangent planes geometry; actually, the tooth surface is a parametric surface defined on a parallelogrammic domain. Equivalence proof of the tooth surface geometry is then given in order to greatly simplify the mathematical model. As major factors affecting the lubrication, surface fatigue, contact stress, wear, and manufacturability of gear teeth, the differential geometrical characteristics of the tooth surface are summarized using classical fundamental forms. By using the geometrical properties mentioned, manufactura-bility (and its limitation in logarithmic spiral bevel gears) is analyzed using precision forging and multi-axis freeform milling, rather than classical cradle-type machine tool based milling or hobbing. Geometry and manufacturability analysis results show that logarithmic spiral gears have many application advantages, but many urgent issues such as contact tooth analysis for precision plastic forming and multi-axis freeform milling {{also need to be}} solved in a further study...|$|E
