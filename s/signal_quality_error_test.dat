An analytical model is developed {{to evaluate the}} deterioration of DCT output <b>signal</b> <b>quality,</b> including <b>error</b> vector magnitude, adjacent channel power ratio, and spectral regrowth. Additionally, an integrated approach for PA linearization and anti-LO pulling is designed based on an open-loop digital-predistortion method and the pro-posed analog feedback compensation mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that a quadrature-modulation-based DCT that incorporates the proposed approaches can significantly improve the LO spectral purity, while achieving a high linearity and efficiency performance simultaneously. These attributes are highly desired for third-generation systems such as cdma 2000 1 x and W-CDMA.

Regression analysis failed to show a clear correlation between dose level and estimated resistance for either estimator except for neosynephrine, revealing the limitations of current SQI methods in ensuring signal fidelity.

40|$|BACKGROUND:: Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning is {{a significant}} problem in most countries, and a reliable method of quick diagnosis would greatly improve patient care. Until the recent introduction of a multiwavelength "pulse CO-oximeter" (Masimo Rainbow SET Radical- 7), obtaining carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels in blood required blood sampling and laboratory analysis. In this study, we sought to determine whether hypoxemia, which can accompany carbon monoxide poisoning, interferes with the accurate detection of COHb. METHODS:: Twelve healthy, nonsmoking, adult volunteers were fitted with 2 standard pulse-oximeter finger probes and 2 Rainbow probes for COHb detection. A radial arterial catheter was placed for blood sampling during 3 interventions: (1) increasing hypoxemia in incremental steps with arterial oxygen saturations (SaO 2) of 100 % to 80 %; (2) normoxia with incremental increases in %COHb to 12 %; and (3) elevated COHb combined with hypoxemia with SaO 2 of 100 % to 80 %. Pulse-oximeter (SpCO) readings were compared with simultaneous arterial blood values at the various increments of hypoxemia and carboxyhemoglobinemia (≈ 25 samples per subject). Pulse CO-oximeter performance was analyzed by calculating the mean bias (SpCO - %COHb), standard deviation of the bias (precision), and the root-mean-square error (Arms). RESULTS:: The Radical- 7 accurately detected hypoxemia with both normal and elevated levels of COHb (bias mean ± SD: 0. 44 % ± 1. 69 % at %COHb < 4 %, and - 0. 29 % ± 1. 64 % at %COHb ≥ 4 %, P < 0. 0001, and Arms 1. 74 % vs 1. 67 %). COHb was accurately detected during normoxia and moderate hypoxia (bias mean ± SD: - 0. 98 ± 2. 6 at SaO 2 ≥ 95 %, and - 0. 7 ± 4. 0 at SaO 2 < 95 %, P = 0. 60, and Arms 2. 8 % vs 4. 0 %), but when SaO 2 decreased below approximately 85 %, the pulse CO-oximeter always gave low <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> <b>errors</b> and did not report SpCO values. CONCLUSIONS:: In healthy volunteers, the Radical- 7 pulse CO-oximeter accurately detects hypoxemia with both low and elevated COHb levels, and accurately detects COHb, but only reads SpCO when SaO 2 is more than approximately 85 %. © 2013 International Anesthesia Research Society...|$|R
30|$|To {{facilitate}} the presentation, except for special {{behaviors such as}} paging and handover, we only take the general communication process as an example to qualitatively analyze the reliability relationship between C-plane and U-plane. In terms of theoretical analysis based on <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> of air interface, the analysis procedures and results of uplink and downlink are the same. Hence, for simplicity, the following analysis is just {{on the basis of}} downlink. In the general communication process of C/U-plane decoupled architecture, PDSCH served by the small cell carries user date and PDCCH provided by the macro transmits corresponding control information such as transmission format to help receiver correctly decode the data on PDSCH. For PDCCH, its symbol error rate (SER) is directly caused by its poorly received <b>signal</b> <b>quality.</b> Nevertheless, these <b>errors</b> of PDCCH will badly affect the decoding correctness of data on PDSCH [13]. As a consequence for PDSCH, its errors result from two aspects, some of which are caused by its own poor <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> and others are induced from the errors of PDCCH. In practice, if SER of PDCCH exceeds some threshold, then no matter how well the <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> of PDSCH is, the receiver cannot correctly decode the data on PDSCH. Based on this, a more appropriate indicator named unreliability factor (URF) which can highlight the importance of C-plane is proposed to evaluate the transmission reliability of C/U-plane decoupled architecture.|$|R

The diffracted beam intensity depends on the radio frequency (RF) power applied to the device while the output angle depends on the material but is also proportional to the laser wavelength and to the RF drive frequency.

30|$|The {{available}} bandwidth in the wireless link {{depends on the}} <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> and the modulation scheme. If the received <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> is below the minimum <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> threshold of the modulation scheme, then the receiver could not successfully decode the received information. Therefore, less sophisticated modulation scheme that requires lower <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> should be adopted to decode the received information. Then, the {{available bandwidth}} on this wireless link could be reduced. For example, in IEEE 802.11 b, the effective bandwidth could be 1, 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps [6], which depends on the <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> of the receiver. In general, when the transmission power at the transmitter is fixed, the shorter {{the distance between the}} transmitter and the receiver, the better the <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> there would be, and more sophisticated modulating scheme (e.g., 64 -QAM) could be used to achieve higher data throughput. On the other hand, in the case of long distance between transmitter and receiver, the <b>signal</b> <b>quality</b> is poor so that only ordinary modulating scheme (e.g., QPSK) could be used. Then, the effective bandwidth might fail to meet the traffic demands of the OD pair. This kind of MPB with bandwidth-aware problem (denoted as MPBBA) is different from traditional MPB problem. With considering the bandwidth requirement and power consumption simultaneously, MPBBA problem is more challenging than the MPB problem.|$|R
