50|$|A siphon {{spillway}} in a dam {{is usually not}} technically a siphon as it is generally used to drain elevated water levels. However, a {{siphon spillway}} operates as an actual siphon if it raises the flow higher than {{the surface of the}} source reservoir, as sometimes is the case when used in irrigation. In operation, a siphon spillway is considered to be 'pipe flow' or 'closed duct flow'. A normal spillway flow is pressurized by the height of the reservoir above the spillway whereas a <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> is governed by the difference in height of the inlet and outlet. Some designs make use of an automatic system that uses the flow of water in a spiral vortex to remove the air above to prime the siphon. Such a design includes the volute siphon.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} how to {{calculate}} the equilibrium path of a thin magnetic flux tube in a stratified, nonmagnetic atmosphere when the flux tube contains a steady <b>siphon</b> <b>flow.</b> The equilbrium path of a static thin flux tube in an infinite stratified atmosphere generally {{takes the form of}} a symmetric arch of finite width, with the flux tube becoming vertical at either end of the arch. A <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> within the flux tube increases the curvature of the arched equilibrium path in order that the net magnetic tension force can balance the inertial force of the flow, which tries to straighten the flux tube. Thus, a <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> reduces the width of the arched equilibrium path, with faster flows producing narrower arches. The effect of the <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> on the equilibrium path is generally greater for flux tubes of weaker magnetic field strength. Examples of the equilibrium are shown for both isothemal and adiabatic <b>siphon</b> <b>flows</b> in thin flux tubes in an isothermal external atmosphere...|$|R

40|$|The arched {{equilibrium}} {{path of a}} thin {{magnetic flux}} tube in a plane-stratified, nonmagnetic atmosphere is calculated for {{cases in which the}} flux tube contains a steady <b>siphon</b> <b>flow.</b> The large scale mechanical equilibrium of the flux tube involves a balance among the magnetic buoyancy force, the net magnetic tension force due to the curvature of the flux tube axis, and the inertial (centrifugal) force due to the <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> along curved streamlines. The ends of the flux tube are assumed to be pinned down by some other external force. Both isothermal and adiabatic <b>siphon</b> <b>flows</b> are considered for flux tubes in an isothermal external atmosphere. For the isothermal case, {{in the absence of a}} <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> the equilibrium path reduces to the static arch calculated by Parker (1975, 1979). The presence of a <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> causes the flux tube arch to bend more sharply, so that magnetic tension can overcome the additional straightening effect of the inertial force, and reduces the maximum width of the arch. The curvature of the arch increases as the <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> speed increases. For a critical <b>siphon</b> <b>flow,</b> with supercritical flow in the downstream leg, the arch is asymmetric, with greater curvature in the downstream leg of the arch. Adiabatic flow have qualitatively similar effects, except that adiabatic cooling reduces the buoyancy of the flux tube and thus leads to significantly wider arches. In some cases the cooling is strong enough to create negative buoyancy along sections of the flux tube, requiring upward curvature of the flux tube path along these sections and sometimes leading to unusual equilibrium paths of periodic, sinusoidal form...|$|R

40|$|Steady <b>siphon</b> <b>flows</b> in arched {{isolated}} {{magnetic flux}} tubes {{in the solar}} atmosphere are calculated here including radiative transfer between the flux tube and its surrounding and variable ionization of the flowing gas.

Critical <b>siphon</b> <b>flows</b> with adiabatic tube shocks in the downstream leg are calculated, illustrating the radiative relaxation of the temperature jump downstream of the shock. For flows in arched flux tubes reaching up to the temperature minimum, where the opacity is low, the gas inside the flux tube is much cooler than the surrounding atmosphere {{at the top of the}} arch.

In this Letter, we derive an expression for the standing kink mode frequency due to <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> in coronal loops, valid for both low and high speed regimes. It is found that <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> introduces a linear spatially dependent phase shift along coronal loops and asymmetric eigenfunctions. We demonstrate how this theory {{can be used to}} determine the kink and flow speed of oscillating coronal loops with reference to an observational case study.

The effects of making the interior of the flux tube hotter or colder than the surrounding atmosphere at the upstream footpoint of the arch is considered. In this case, is it found that the adiabatic flows are qualitatively similar to the isothermal flows, with adiabatic cooling producing quantitative differences.

40|$|The {{prominent}} blue {{shifts of}} Ne viii {{associated with the}} junctions of the magnetic network in the quiet Sun are still not well understood. By comparing the coronal magnetic-field structures as obtained by a potential-field reconstruction with the conspicuous blue-shift patches on the dopplergram of Ne viii as observed in an equatorial quiet-Sun region, we find {{that most of the}} regions with significant upflow are associated with the funnel-like legs of magnetic loops and co-spatial with increments of the line width. These quasi-steady upflows can be regarded as the signatures of mass supply to coronal loops. By using the square-root of the line intensity as a proxy for the plasma density, the mass flux of the upflow in each funnel can be estimated. We find that the mass flux is anti-correlated with the funnel’s expansion factor as determined from the extrapolated magnetic field. One of the loop systems is associated with a coronal bright point, which was observed by several instruments and exhibited various morphologies in different wavelengths and viewing directions. A remarkable agreement between its magnetic structure and the associated EUV emission pattern was found, suggesting an almost potential-field nature of the coronal magnetic field. We also report the direct detection of a small-scale <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> by both STEREO satellites. However, this transient <b>siphon</b> <b>flow</b> occurred in a weak mixed-polarity-field region, which was outside the adjacent magnetic funnel, and thus it is perhaps not related to plasma upflow in the funnel. Based on these observations, we suggest that at upper-TR (transition region) temperatures the dominant flows in quiet-Sun coronal loops are long-lasting upflows rather than <b>siphon</b> <b>flows.</b> We also discuss the implications of our results for coronal heating and unresolved magnetic structures...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} orphan penumbrae, which are photospheric filamentary structures observed in active regions near polarity inversion lines that resemble the penumbra of regular sunspots but are not connected to any umbra. We use Hinode data from the Solar Optical Telescope to determine the properties of orphan penumbrae. Spectropolarimetric data are employed to obtain the vector magnetic field and line-of-sight velocities in the photosphere. Magnetograms are used to study the overall evolution of these structures, and G-band and Ca II H filtergrams are to {{investigate the}}ir brightness and apparent horizontal motions. Orphan penumbrae form between regions of opposite polarity in places with horizontal magnetic fields. Their magnetic configuration is that of Ω-shaped flux ropes. In the two cases studied here, the opposite-polarity regions approach each other with time and the whole structure submerges as the penumbral filaments disappear. Orphan penumbrae {{are very similar to}} regular penumbrae, including the existence of strong gas flows. Therefore, they could have a similar origin. The main difference between them is the absence of a "background" magnetic field in orphan penumbrae. This could explain most of the observed differences.

40|$|Received date, {{accepted}} date We {{report on}} the first Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) study of cool transition region loops. This class of loops has received little attention in the literature, mainly due to instrumental lim-itations. A cluster of such loops was observed on the solar disk in active region NOAA 11934, in the Si iv 1402. 8 Å spectral raster and 1400 Å slit-jaw (SJ) images. We divide the loops into three groups and study their dynamics and interaction. The first group comprises relatively stable loops, with 382 – 626 km cross-sections. Observed Doppler velocities are suggestive of <b>siphon</b> <b>flows,</b> gradually changing from − 10 km s− 1 at one end to 20 km s− 1 {{at the other end}} of the loops. Nonthermal velocities from 15 km s− 1 to 25 km s− 1 were determined. These physical properties suggest that these loops are impulsively heated by magnetic reconnection occurring at the blue-shifted footpoints where magnetic cancellation with a rate of 1015 Mx s− 1 is found. The released magnetic energy is redistributed by the <b>siphon</b> <b>flows.</b> The second group corresponds to two footpoints rooted in mixed-magnetic-polarity regions, where magnetic cancel-lation occurred at a rate of 1015 Mx s− 1 and line profiles with enhanced wings of up to 200 km s− 1 were observed.
