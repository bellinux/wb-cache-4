50|$|Phytoplasma-infected {{sugarcane}} plants show {{a proliferation}} of tillers, which give it typical grassy appearance, hence the name grassy shoot disease. The leaves of infected plants do not produce chlorophyll, and therefore appear white or creamy yellow. The leaf veins turn white first as the phytoplasma resides in leaf phloem tissue. Symptoms at the early stage of the plant life cycle include leaf chlorosis, mainly at the central leaf whorl. Infected plants {{do not have the}} capacity to produce food in the absence of chlorophyll, which results in no cane formation. These symptoms can be seen prominently in the <b>stubble</b> <b>crop.</b> The eye or lateral buds sprout before the normal time on growing cane.

The species composition of fungi colonizing the stem base and roots of spring wheat was determined. The split-plot design of the experiment set up on rendzina soil included plough tillage and conservation tillage with autumn and spring disking of catch crops. The experiment used four methods for regeneration of the spring wheat monoculture stand using the following: undersown red clover and Westerwolds ryegrass crops as well as lacy phacelia and white mustard <b>stubble</b> <b>crops.</b> Plots without catch crops were the control treatment. Red clover and Westerwolds ryegrass catch crops as well as lacy phacelia and white mustard <b>stubble</b> <b>crops</b> had a significant effect on the decrease in the stem base and root infection index of spring wheat compared to the control without catch crops. The disease indices in the tillage treatments under evaluation did not differ significantly from one another.

In the experiment, successive spring barley crops were grown one after the other (in continuous monoculture). The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the effect of stubble crops used on the size and structure of barley yield. The three-year study showed an increasing trend in grain yield of spring barley grown after the mixture of legumes, lacy phacelia, and white mustard compared to its size in the treatment with no cover crop.

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare variability of ten bean genotypes to optimal (25 °C) and higher (30 °C) temperatures in combination with optimal (80 %) and reduced (40 %) field water capacity (FWC), from the point of growth (root and shoot length and fresh matter accumulation) and thermodynamic parameters of free energy (calculated parameter after drying at 60 °C, 105 °C and 130 °C) during the early seedlings stage. Significant and positive correlation between root length and fresh matter with free energy at symplast and chemically bound water occurred under temperature stress (i. e. 30 °C). Root growth and elongation were affected by drought stress, i. e. under a combination of high temperature (30 °C) and water deficit (40 % FWC). Based on higher energy consumption, the ability of shoot to continue a growth in stressful conditions could be possible to achieve, as was confirm through significant and positive correlation between evaluated growth parameters in shoot and free energy of free water. It could be concluded that most of the examined dry bean accessions expressed some sensitivity to stress applied.

Aims: Through the experience realised at ARDS Turda we follow the behavior of native varieties grȃu autumn, compared ȋn varieties of foreign origin, to make recommendations on their pretability to different systems of culture and levels of fertilization. Materials and Method: The experiment realized at the ARDS Turda, includes two ways to work the soil, a classic conventional system (with autumn ploughing, land preparation, sowing and fertilized) in parallel with the conservative ("no-tillage” with <b>stubble</b> <b>crop</b> directly into the preemergent plant). Experimental factors: A - soil tillage system; B - winter wheat variety; C - fertilization. Results: Of the eight winter wheat varieties, in the experiment is remarkable the variety Capo    that registered highest values of the gluten content {{at the level of}} fertilization c 2, c 3 and c 4 at cultivation in both work systems (classic and “no tillage”). At most varieties, the highest protein content is at the c 2 level of fertilization, except Capo and Exotic that react the best at c 3 level of fertilization, in the system "no tillage". Conclusion: The winter wheat  indigenous Andrada, Dumbrava, Arieşan and line T- 29 - 04 and cultivar Renan (Limagrain) reacts most favorable in  gluten content at level of  fertilization c 2 (at sowing 250 kg/ ha NPK 20 : 20 : 0 + resumption spring vegetation ȋn 214 kg/ ha ammonium nitrate).

Moreover, the content of 0 -dihydroxyphenols in the soil was compared in the last year of the study. The soil used to prepare the solutions came from a field experiment established on medium heavy mixed rendzina soil. Spring wheat, cv.

Germination energy of the seeds watered with the soil extracts from the ploughed plots was significantly higher than this trait in the seeds watered with the extracts from the conservation tillage treatments with spring disking of the catch crops. Germination energy and capacity of spring wheat in the control treatment watered with distilled water were significantly higher compared to the other treatments under evaluation. Spring wheat watered with the aqueous extract prepared from the soil obtained from the plough tillage treatment produced a significantly longer first leaf compared to the treatments in which both conservation tillage methods had been used.

40|$|In the {{semiarid}} Canadian prairies, {{water is}} the most limiting and nitrogen (N) the second most limiting factor influencing spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. The efficiency of water-and nitrogen use needs to be assessed {{in order to maintain}} this production system. The effects of cropping frequency and N fertilization on trends in soil water distribution and water use were quantified for an 18 -yr (1967 - 1984) field experiment conducted on a medium textured Orthic Brown Chernozem (Aridic Haploboroll) in southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada. Soil water contents were measured eight times each year and plant samples were taken at five phenological growth stages. The treatments studied were continuous wheat (Cont W), summer fallow - wheat, F-(W) and summer fallow - wheat - wheat, F-W-(W) each receiving recommended rates of N and phosphorus (P) fertilizer, and (F) -W-W and (Cont W) each receiving only P fertilizer, with the examined rotation phase shown in parentheses. Soil water conserved under fallow during the summer months averaged 25 mm in the root zone, and was related to the initial water content of the soil, the amount of precipitation received, its distribution over time, and potential evapotranspiration. Under a wheat crop grown on fallow, soil water contents between spring and the five-leaf stage remained relatively constant at about 250 mm, but those under a <b>stubble</b> <b>crop,</b> with 40 mm lower spring soil water reserves, increased slightly until about the three-leaf stage. During the period of expansive crop growth (from the five-leaf to the soft dough stage) soil water was rapidly lost from all cropped phases at rates of 1. 87 mm. day– 1 for F-(W) (N+P), 1. 23 mm. day– 1 for Cont W (N+P) and 1. 17 mm. day– 1 for Cont W (+P). The initial loss was from the 0 - 0. 3 m depth, but during {{the latter half of the}} growing season from deeper depths, although rarely from the 0. 9 - 1. 2 m depth. In very dry years (e. g., 1973, with 87 mm precipitation between spring and fall) summer fallow treatments lost water. In wet years with poor precipitation distribution (e. g., 1970, with 287 mm precipitation between spring and fall but 142 mm of this in one week between the three- and five-leaf stage) even cropped treatments showed evidence of leaching. The above-ground biomass water use efficiency for Cont W was 19. 2 and 16. 7 kg. ha– 1 . mm– 1 , respectively, for crops receiving (N+P) and P fertilizer only. Grain yield water use efficiency (8. 91 kg. ha– 1 . mm– 1 ) was not significantly influenced by cropping frequency nor N fertilizer.

In this paper we apply a structural econometric model to household data from Morocco to estimate the implicit value of <b>crop</b> <b>stubble.</b> We use a sample splitting technique to investigate differences in the value of this resource and find that it is significantly higher for smaller farmers, who therefore face an even larger barrier to technology adoption.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{production}} capabilities of <b>stubble</b> catch <b>crops</b> and their effect on yield of subsequent of spring barley. The field experiment was conducted on clayey-loamy fluvizem in the maize-growing region from 2006 to 2013. Experiments involved altogether ten different catch crops. Vegetation intercropping was established after the harvest of winter wheat in two periods (immediately after harvest crop and in mid-September). Spring barely was sown after these catch crops. Nitrogen fertilization was omitted to highlight the effect of catch crops on all variants in 2010. Analysis {{of the amount of}} fresh matter and dry matter <b>stubble</b> catch <b>crops</b> was conducted in the years 2006 - 2013 and the vegetation index NDVI was evaluated in the final year of monitoring. Another part belonged to classify the yield of spring barley grown after catch crops. A negative relationship between the yield of catch crop and that of spring barley was observed in the variant without nitrogen fertilization. Growing of catch crops on yield of spring barley had a positive impact in case of application of nitrogen...|$|R
50|$|Stubble-mulching {{refers to}} leaving the <b>stubble</b> (agriculture) or <b>crop</b> residue {{essentially}} {{in place on}} the land as a surface cover during a fallow period. Stubble-mulching can prevent erosion from wind or water and conserve soil moisture.|$|R
50|$|Its {{habitat is}} forested areas at a {{particular}} altitude on a mountain side {{and they have a}} certain predilection for humid areas. Coniferous woodland, especially Spruce, is favoured for breeding. It builds its nest in a tree, laying 2-6 eggs. The British range of this once local breeder has expanded greatly due to an increase in commercial conifer plantations. The siskin also breeds in mixed woodland; while in winter they prefer <b>stubble</b> and <b>crops</b> and areas containing trees with seeds.|$|R
50|$|Cultural {{controls}} include plowing <b>stubble</b> after harvesting <b>crops,</b> {{as well as}} ensuring no re-growth {{of plant}} material for winter, fallowing fields, rotation with an alternate crop, cleaning machinery before use in an un-infested field, sampling two weeks after planting to catch mite populations at low levels, and avoidance of second-cropping.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWinter wheat is {{one kind}} of {{important}} crop in China. It’s planting area is one key element to explain yield change. To obtain winter wheat planting area {{as soon as possible}} can provide scientific reference for our country’s making related policy. Basing on the cropping system in Shandong province, winter wheat is divided into two kinds “winter wheat sowed by machine-maize” and “people broadcast winter wheat-rice”. Using MODIS data, NDVI characters of winter wheat, garlic, greenhouse vegetable, from sowing till overwintering stage were analyzed. Together with NDVI characters of former <b>stubble</b> <b>crops</b> in middle September, extracting requirements were set up for winter wheat planting area which was sowed by machine this year. In view of the spectrum similarity between rice wheat and greenhouse vegetable from sowing stage till overwintering stage, rice wheat planting area of former year was extracted relying on the character of biomass rapid growth at jointing stage. Because of the “people broadcast winter wheat-rice” cropping system is very fixed in Shandong province, then the rice wheat planting area of former year can take the place of the rice wheat planting area this year. Two kinds of winter wheat area were merged, and tested by 284 groups of located spots data, the accuracy reached 94. 01 %. The result showed that it is feasible to extract winter wheat area before overwintering stage, and the time is 4 months earlier than using jointing stage NDVI...|$|R
50|$|This {{is still}} being {{investigated}} as of writing, but the current majority of analysis sources are hinting towards colder weather, stagnant winds trapping the various sources of smoke. Primary sources of smoke being those from the burning of <b>crop</b> <b>stubbles,</b> lit garbage and road dust.

40|$|By a pot experiment, {{two kinds}} of <b>crop</b> <b>stubble</b> (wheat, soybean) were added into {{continuous}} cropping soil of cucumber according to different quantity (0. 5 %, 1 % and 2 %), the effects {{of different kinds of}} stubble and quantity on the continuous cropping soil and growth of cucumber were investigated. The results showed that {{two kinds of}} <b>crop</b> <b>stubble</b> significantly decreased soil bulk density, and increased total porosity of soil. Each of all treatments significantly decreased the accumulation of salinity in soil within the entire growth period of cucumber. 2 % wheat stubble treatment had the biggest drop in soil EC in the later period of cucumber growth. Soybean stubble treatment had the lesser effect on soil EC. Wheat and soybean stubble promoted the growth of cucumber, increased the yield of cucumber, and improved the quality of cucumber. 2 % of wheat stubble treatment had a biggest increase in cucumber yield, which increased the yield by 34. 23 % compared with the control...|$|R
