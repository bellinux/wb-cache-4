This subtask of syntactic parsing is explored here for biomedical scientific literature. In particular, the intuition that sentences containing coordinating conjunctions can often be rephrased as two or more smaller sentences derived from the coordination structure is exploited.

The asymptotic behavior of the nonperturbative pion wave function ψ(,̨ x) at x→ 0, 1, →̨∞ and 4. The large order behavior of perturbative series. The analysis is based on such general methods as dispersion relations, duality and PCAC. We use the steepest descent method (also known as semiclassical, or instanton calculus), introduced by Lipatov, in order to calculate the n-th moment of the ψ(,̨ x) with result k⃗_^ 2 n∼ n!. This information is converted into the fixing of the asymptotic behavior of wf at large. This behavior {{it turns out to}} be Gaussian commonly used in the phenomenological analyses.

In addition, ROSE is sentence-based, as opposed to document-based, allowing it to be used in a wider range of settings. Results show that ROSE performs well on many tasks, such as ranking <b>system</b> <b>and</b> syntactic <b>constituents,</b> with results competitive to BLEU. Moreover, this still holds when ROSE is trained on human judgements of translations into a different language compared with that use in testing. ...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW Biological organisms which {{possess a}} {{neurological}} system exhibit {{varying degrees of}} what can be termed rational behavior. One can hypothesize that rational behavior and thought processes in general arise {{as a consequence of the}} intrinsic rational nature of the neurological <b>system</b> <b>and</b> its <b>constituent</b> neurons. A similar statement may be made of the immunological system [1]. The concept of rational behavior can be made quantitative. In particular, one possible characterization of rational behavior is as follows (1) A physical entity (observer) must exist which has the capacity for both measurement and the generation of outputs (participation). Outputs represent decisions on the part of the observer which will be seen to be rational. (2) The establishment of the quantities measurable by the observer is achieved through learning. Learning characterizes the change in knowledge state of an observer in response to new information and is driven by the directed dive...|$|R

The authors argue the case of co-management. Drawing on examples and insights from a comparative research project in South Asia, four basic types of legal pluralism and co-management are distinguished. The authors conclude that co-management is a process that brings legal <b>systems,</b> <b>and</b> their <b>constituent</b> organizations <b>and</b> groups, together within a single framework.

On the basis of an analysis of the principle of succession, the role of waste, and the concept of diversity, the article highlights some of the key misconceptions that have resulted from the superficial engagement with the science of ecology. It is argued that industrial ecology should not be seen as a metaphor for industrial development; industrial ecology is the ecology of industry and should be studied as such. There are manifold general principles of ecology that underpin our understanding of the world; however, the physical manifestation and causal effects of these principles are particular to the <b>system</b> <b>and</b> its <b>constituent</b> elements under analysis.
