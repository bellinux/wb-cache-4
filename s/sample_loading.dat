40|$|Abstract: Considering {{the special}} load {{characteristics}} of the wheel loader, this paper focus on compiling the load spectrum of the transmission of the wheel loader using the nonparametric statistical extrapolation method (NSEM). In this process, {{the determination of the}} kernel function shape is the critical issue, which has been discussed in detail. Before extrapolating the <b>sample</b> <b>load</b> spectrum, the signal denoising of the field-tested time-history load signals is performed. After that, the <b>sample</b> <b>load</b> cycles are obtained using the rainflow counting method and the corresponding kernel function shape is determined. Then the NSEM of rainflow matrix is proposed, by which the whole-life load spectrum is estimated. The proposed extrapolation method can well realize the estimation of the load cycles that do not appear in <b>sample</b> <b>load</b> cycles but may exist in the whole-life load history...|$|R

50|$|In {{biological}} data analysis, normalization is {{an important}} procedure used to remove both biological and non-biological sources of experimental variability. For accurate, reproducible quantitative analysis of proteins via western blotting, normalization accounts for differences arising from cell culture conditions, inconsistent sample preparation, uneven protein transfer and unequal <b>sample</b> <b>loading</b> across gel lanes. Traditionally for western blots, normalization involves comparing the relative abundance of the protein of interest to that of an unrelated control protein such as a housekeeping protein, to ensure that visually assessed changes in protein levels represent true biological variation and not experimental artifacts.|$|E

However, no sample library import facilities were offered, so existing ASR/TS owners couldn't use their sample files on the new machine. A drum machine with pro-quality mixable preset patterns, benefited from the unusually large internal drum sounds library (approx. 700 samples) and was integrated with the sequencer, {{but it was impossible}} to create patterns inside the machine. Instead, a program that allowed a user to create drum patterns on PC was developed, thus allowing the user to create numerous rhythms that could be loaded onto disk and work within the fluid drum machine and all aspects of the keyboard.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: A hybrid microchip/capillary {{electrophoresis}} (CE) {{system was}} developed to allow unbiased and lossless <b>sample</b> <b>loading</b> and high-throughput repeated injections. This new hybrid CE system consists of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) microchip sample injector featuring a pneumatic microvalve that separates a sample introduction channel from a short <b>sample</b> <b>loading</b> channel, and a fused-silica capillary separation column that connects seamlessly to the <b>sample</b> <b>loading</b> channel. The sample introduction channel is pressurized such that when the pneumatic microvalve opens briefly, a variable-volume sample plug is introduced into the loading channel. A high voltage for CE separation is continuously applied across the loading channel and the fused-silica capillary separation column. Analytes are rapidly separated in the fused-silica capillary, and following separation, high-sensitivity MS detection is accomplished via a sheathless CE/ESI-MS interface. The performance evaluation of the complete CE...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMass spectrometric {{analysis}} of peptides {{with a total}} <b>sample</b> <b>loading</b> of several {{tens of thousands of}} molecules (i. e., low zeptomoles) is demonstrated. At this low level of <b>sample</b> <b>loading,</b> it becomes important to consider several very unique technical and fundamental aspects that are not obvious in compatible experiments with a higher amount of <b>sample</b> <b>loading.</b> We demonstrate that prudent matrix preparation allows analysis of peptides from solutions with picomolar concentrations in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Using microspot MALDI we demonstrate the introduction and detection of 25, 000 molecules of Substance P in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. A method based on probability theory is presented to estimate the minimum number of ions required for generating a statistically significant isotope peak pattern of peptide ions. It is found that the low boundary of ionization efficiency is 1 – 2 % for Substance P. In addition, comparison of macro- and microspot sample deposition techniques for Substance P shows that under the experimental conditions used, a minimum of ∼ 5 analyte molecules per μm 2 are necessary to generate useful signals. Implications of these results on further mass spectrometric developments towards even more sensitive detection are discussed...|$|E
