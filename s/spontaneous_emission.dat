5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission,</b> an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{relativistic}} Dirac equation {{has problems}} for elements {{with more than}} 137 protons. For such elements, the wave function of the Dirac ground state is oscillatory rather than bound, {{and there is no}} gap between the positive and negative energy spectra, as in the Klein paradox. More accurate calculations taking into account the effects of the finite size of the nucleus indicate that the binding energy first exceeds the limit for elements with more than 173 protons. For heavier elements, if the innermost orbital (1s) is not filled, the electric field of the nucleus will pull an electron out of the vacuum, resulting in the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission</b> of a positron; however, this does not happen if the innermost orbital is filled, so that element 173 is not necessarily the end of the periodic table.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we present a}} large-deviation {{analysis}} for the counting statistics of atomic <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions</b> continuously detected in finite-bandwidth non-Markovian environment. We show that the statistics of the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions</b> depends on the response time of the detector, which can result in big differences such as dynamical phase transition. This feature excludes the idea of regarding the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions</b> as detection-free objective events. Possible experiment is briefly discussed {{in connection with the}} state-of-the-art optical cavity set-up. Comment: 5 Pages, 3 figure...|$|R

25|$|In {{nanoscale}} photonic resonators {{with high}} Q, the {{effective mode volume}} Vmode is inherently very small resulting in high F and β, and terms 2 and 3 in equation 1 are no longer negligible. Consequently nanocavities are fundamentally better suited to efficiently produce <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission</b> and amplified <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission</b> light modulated at frequencies much higher than 20GHz without negative thermal effects.|$|E

25|$|Emission {{indicates}} that radiative energy is {{released by the}} material. A material's blackbody spectrum is a <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission</b> spectrum determined by its temperature; this feature {{can be measured in}} the infrared by instruments such as the Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (AERI). Emission can also be induced by other sources of energy such as flames or sparks or electromagnetic radiation in the case of fluorescence.|$|E
25|$|To achieve optimum noise {{performance}} DFAs are {{operated under}} {{a significant amount}} of gain compression (10dB typically), since that reduces the rate of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission,</b> thereby reducing ASE. Another advantage of operating the DFA in the gain saturation region is that small fluctuations in the input signal power are reduced in the output amplified signal: smaller input signal powers experience larger (less saturated) gain, while larger input powers see less gain.|$|E
25|$|If we {{continuously}} pump electrons, we will excite an appreciable {{number of}} them into level 3, such that N3 > 0. To have a medium suitable for laser operation, {{it is necessary that}} these excited atoms quickly decay to level 2. The energy released in this transition may be emitted as a photon (<b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission),</b> however in practice the 3→2 transition (labeled R in the diagram) is usually radiationless, with the energy being transferred to vibrational motion (heat) of the host material surrounding the atoms, without the generation of a photon.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{analyses}} {{supporting the}} assumption that <b>spontaneous</b> otoacoustic <b>emissions</b> (SOAEs) {{can be described as}} self-sustained oscillations (requiring a power source) are reviewed and extended. Spectral and statistical properties of <b>spontaneous</b> otoacoustic <b>emissions</b> are examined and shown to be consistent with this assumption. Several alternative models of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions</b> (noise-driven saturating memoryless nonlinearity, noise-driven nonlinear-stiffness oscillator) are examined. Although some of these models are able to produce the types of statistical distributions of amplitude and displacement similar to those observed in the experimental data, this similarity is destroyed upon narrow-band filtering...|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{presented}} for estimating cochlear tuning starting from measurements {{of either the}} transient evoked otoacoustic emission latency or the <b>spontaneous</b> otoacoustic <b>emission</b> minimal spacing. This method could be useful in obtaining indirect information about the tuning curve, particularly for subjects that, like neonates, cannot be studied with psycho-acoustical techniques. Theoretical models of the acoustic transmission along the cochlea based on the transmission line formalism predict a relation between the otoacoustic emission latency and the frequency. This relation depends on the tuning curve, i. e., the frequency dependence of the quality factor of the cochlear resonances. On the other hand, models for the generation of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions</b> based {{on the concept of}} coherent scattering from cochlear random inhomogeneities imply an independent relation between the, tuning curve and the minimal frequency spacing between <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions.</b> In this study, experimental measurements of the otoacoustic, emission latency and of the minimal spacing between <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions</b> are presented. Theoretical relations are derived, which connect these two measured quantities and the tuning curve. The typically longer latency of neonates implies a higher degree of tuning at high levels of stimulation. (C) 2003 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
25|$|A nanophotonic {{resonator}} or nanocavity is {{an optical}} cavity {{which is on}} the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers in size. Optical cavities are a major component of all lasers, they are responsible for providing amplification of a light source via positive feedback, a process known as amplified <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission</b> or ASE. Nanophotonic resonators offer inherently higher light energy confinement than ordinary cavities, which means stronger light-material interactions, and therefore lower lasing threshold provided the quality factor of the resonator is high. Nanophotonic resonators can be made with photonic crystals, silicon, diamond, or metals such as gold.|$|E
25|$|Where τr0 is the {{intrinsic}} carrier radiative lifetime of the bulk material, a is the differential gain, vg {{is the group}} velocity, τp = Q/ωL is the photon lifetime, ωL is the lasing frequency, β is the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission</b> coupling factor which is enhanced by the Purcell effect, and 1 /τtotal = F/τr0 +1/τnr where τnr is the non-radiative lifetime. In the case of minimal Purcell effect in a classical cavity with small F = Q/Vmode, only the first term of equation 1 is considered, {{and the only way}} to increase modulation frequency is to increase photon density P0 by increasing the pumping power. However, thermal effects practically limit the modulation frequency to around 20GHz, making this approach is inefficient.|$|E
25|$|An {{external}} {{electromagnetic field}} at a frequency {{associated with a}} transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom without being absorbed. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts like a small electric dipole, and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the electron's entering this transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is increased beyond that of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission.</b> A transition from the higher to a lower energy state produces an additional photon with the same phase and direction as the incident photon; this {{is the process of}} stimulated emission.|$|E
40|$|The {{role of the}} ear is {{to detect}} sound. Many ears, however, can also {{generate}} sounds and transmit them into the environment. These sounds, known as <b>spontaneous</b> otoacoustic <b>emissions,</b> are the most striking proof {{of the existence of}} an active process within the ear. This active process originates in hair cells, the sensory receptors of the inner ear; by augmenting the energy contained in sound, it improves both the sensitivity and the frequency selectivity of hearing. Under certain conditions, the active process generates spontaneous oscillations, which then produce <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions.</b> Little is known about the process by which the spontaneous oscillations of a collection of hair cells within the ear are transformed into a particular sound that can be measured externally. Here, we suggest that interactions between tonotopically arranged hair cells {{play a critical role in}} the formation of <b>spontaneous</b> otoacoustic <b>emissions.</b> We have created a model based on the basilar papilla of the tokay gecko, a species notable both for the unusual anatomy of its inner ear and for the prominence of its <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions.</b> In this model, the papilla is represented by a tonotopic array of nonlinear van der Pol oscillators, with connections along the array mediated by either viscous or elastic elements. We find that a model incorporating elastic interactions, but not one incorporating viscous interactions, reproduces the appearance of <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions.</b> The model also suggests a prominent role for disorder along the length of the papilla. Finally, the model explains what may be the most distinctive feature of spontaneous emissions: the repulsion of spectral peaks within the emission by pure-tone external stimuli. To test our model, we also recorded <b>spontaneous</b> otoacoustic <b>emissions</b> from the tokay gecko. Previous recordings of emissions have primarily focused on the behavior of single peaks within the emission spectrum. We chose instead to focus on the relationships between multiple emission peaks. Upon applying single-frequency tones at a range of amplitudes and frequencies into the ears of geckos we have observed novel behaviors previously predicted by our model. We conclude that interactions along the basilar papilla, mediated by elastic elements, play an important role in the formation of <b>spontaneous</b> otoacoustic <b>emissions...</b>|$|R
40|$|We quantitatively {{compute the}} rate and {{spectrum}} of <b>spontaneous</b> photon <b>emissions,</b> {{caused by the}} vacuum decaying when an external magnetic field is introduced. The spectrum of <b>spontaneous</b> photon <b>emissions</b> shows the energy-momentum-dependency in the low-energy region and in the high energy region, is respectively similar to the Rayleigh-Jeans part and the Wien part of the spectrum of the black-body radiation. However, the energy-momentum of <b>spontaneous</b> photon <b>emissions</b> is quantized, analogous to the Wigner spectrum. This provides quantitative results for experimental testes.

25|$|The {{critical}} {{detail of}} stimulated emission {{is that the}} induced photon has the same frequency and phase as the incident photon. In other words, the two photons are coherent. It is this property that allows optical amplification, {{and the production of}} a laser system. During the operation of a laser, all three light-matter interactions described above are taking place. Initially, atoms are energized from the ground state to the excited state by a process called pumping, described below. Some of these atoms decay via <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission,</b> releasing incoherent light as photons of frequency, ν. These photons are fed back into the laser medium, usually by an optical resonator. Some of these photons are absorbed by the atoms in the ground state, and the photons are lost to the laser process. However, some photons cause stimulated emission in excited-state atoms, releasing another coherent photon. In effect, this results in optical amplification.|$|E
25|$|By {{balancing}} and {{stimulated emission}} with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission,</b> {{it is possible}} to construct a relation between excitation temperature and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines—indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 104 and 105 cm−3 in dark clouds. Mapping of NH3 gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 pc and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.|$|E
25|$|For high-intensity {{continuous}} wave (CW) lasers, SRS {{can be used}} to produce broad bandwidth spectra. This process can also be seen as a special case of four-wave mixing, wherein the frequencies of the two incident photons are equal and the emitted spectra are found in two bands separated from the incident light by the phonon energies. The initial Raman spectrum is built up with <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emission</b> and is amplified later on. At high pumping levels in long fibers, higher-order Raman spectra can be generated by using the Raman spectrum as a new starting point, thereby building a chain of new spectra with decreasing amplitude. The disadvantage of intrinsic noise due to the initial spontaneous process can be overcome by seeding a spectrum at the beginning, or even using a feedback loop as in a resonator to stabilize the process. Since this technology easily fits into the fast evolving fiber laser field and there is demand for transversal coherent high-intensity light sources (i.e., broadband telecommunication, imaging applications), Raman amplification and spectrum generation might be widely used in the near-future.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} known for some time that the ear canal {{impedance}} is nonlinear at low levels. This was first shown by Kemp (Kemp 1978) who demonstrated nonlinear reflectance to low level acoustic clicks in the ear canal. When Kemp reviewed these nonlinear effects (Kemp 1979; Kemp 1980), he speculated that it is active (i. e., more energy coming out of the cochlea than going in). We have measured this power ratio and have found that the power transfer function of the eardrum is less than one. This has been shown by measuring the real part of the canal impedance at low levels where the nonlinearity is well developed. An alternative, but equivalent measure, is the power reflectance (Voss and Allen 1994), which we find is always less than 1, even near <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions.</b> In this talk we compare the measured cochlear power flow to the hearing thresholds and the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>emissions,</b> as a function of frequency.
