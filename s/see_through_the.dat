5|$|The {{third and}} {{smallest}} group {{are those who}} <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> illusion; they are usually dubbed dangerous or mad. The Red Dress genetic lines interbreed obsessively {{to make sure their}} bloodlines are not weakened by the second or third levels of consciousness, because consciousness can rewrite the software.|$|E
5|$|Black {{doubts that}} Winston is the killer, and while Hollis {{stays in the}} hotel, he visits the production's climactic shoot, set during a {{performance}} by the band Kiss. As he looks around him, the sheriff's body is thrown down from the rafters; as the pandemonium settles, Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted—the killer is after Hollis. Racing back to her hotel, Black discover Hollis fending off a chainsaw-wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis disables the chainsaw; the actor then explains that he lacked Black's insight and had to commit the crimes in order to <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> eyes of a killer.|$|E
5|$|Fauxlivia and Lincoln track Dr. Silva's location, an {{abandoned}} building, and separate. Dr. Silva locks Lincoln {{in a cold}} storage room, while Fauxlivia falls through a weakened floor and passes out. She is woken by Dr. Silva, but finds herself secured to a chair. Dr. Silva explains to Fauxlivia {{that he wants to}} <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> end of his research, needing only one more human host for a final gestation cycle to birth the queen beetle from which the beetle species, and his cure, can be sustained. Fauxlivia feels pains in her body when Dr. Silva implies the last cycle has begun, believing herself to be the host.|$|E

5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of each event is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E
5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able to <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith {{in a similar manner}} to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E

25|$|As a {{historical}} pattern, Vatican approval {{seems to have}} followed general acceptance of a vision by well over a century in most cases. According to Father Salvatore M. Perrella of the Mariunum Pontifical Institute in Rome, of the 295 reported apparitions studied by the Holy <b>See</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> centuries only 12 have been approved, the latest being in May 2008.|$|E

25|$|On {{his return}} Robertson wrote Haig an equivocal letter (27 September) stating that he {{stuck to his}} advice to {{concentrate}} effort on the Western Front rather than Palestine out of instinct and lack of any alternative than from any convincing argument. He also wrote that “Germany may be much nearer {{the end of her}} staying power than available evidence shows” but that given French and Italian weakness it was “not an easy business to <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> problem”.|$|E
25|$|With Europe facing World War I, {{whoever was}} {{selected}} would face {{the difficulty of}} leading the Holy <b>See</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> war to end all wars, in which Catholic Belgium and France were attacked by Protestant Germany, which was supported by Catholic Austria while the Protestant United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (including Catholic Ireland) and Russian Orthodox Russia sided with France. Critics wondered whether the Holy See should remain neutral or whether it should assume a position of moral leadership by casting public judgments on the behaviour of the various combatants.|$|E
25|$|A louvred door has {{fixed or}} movable wooden fins (often called slats or louvers) which permit open {{ventilation}} while preserving privacy and preventing {{the passage of}} light to the interior. Being relatively weak structures, they are most commonly used for wardrobes and drying rooms, where security is of less importance than good ventilation, although a very similar structure is commonly used to form window shutters. Double louvred doors were introduced into Seagate, built in Florida in 1929 by Gwendolyn and Powel Crosley, that provided the desired circulation of air with an added degree of privacy {{in that it is}} impossible to <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> fins in any direction.|$|E

25|$|According to Father Salvatore M. Perrella of the Marianum Pontifical Institute in Rome (who {{has also}} served as an expert for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith), of the 295 {{reported}} apparitions studied by the Holy <b>See</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> centuries only 12 had been approved as of May 2008 (the latest at that time being the May 2008 approval of the 17th- and 18th-century apparitions of Our Lady of Laus). Other apparitions continue to be approved at the local level, e.g. the December, 2010 local approval of the 19th-century apparitions of Our Lady of Good Help, the first recognized apparition in the United States.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|Cal {{exhibits}} many masculine characteristics {{when he is}} a child. He writes, [...] "I {{began to}} exude some kind of masculinity, in the way I tossed up and caught my eraser, for instance." [...] In another incident, Cal discusses how his penchants were masculine. While his female classmates are {{turned off by the}} blood in the Iliad, Cal is [...] "thrilled to [...] the stabbings and beheadings, the gouging out of eyes, the juicy eviscerations." [...] Cal ponders his gender identity and how males and females associate with each other, reflecting, [...] "Did I <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> male tricks because I was destined to scheme that way myself? Or do girls <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tricks, too, and just pretend not to notice?" ...|$|E

500|$|As he {{was leaving}} his post in 1975, further {{criticism}} was directed at Morton for his overseeing the partial dismantling of the Interior Department.

500|$|The {{nostrils}} are not {{divided by}} a septum, but rather are perforate; {{from the side}} one can <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> beak. The wings are broad but relatively short. The bases of the primary feathers are white, producing a white patch {{on the underside of}} the wing's edge, which is visible in flight. The tail is short and square, barely reaching past the edge of the folded wings. The subspecies differ in size according to Bergmann's Rule, and the amount of white underwing coloration also varies.|$|E
500|$|The firemen {{made their}} way up an {{enclosed}} staircase with Serial 502 behind them. Dozens of rioters suddenly appeared {{at the top of}} the stairs, blowing whistles and throwing bottles. Pengelly ordered the officers and firefighters to retreat. They were forced to run backwards down the unlit narrow staircase, fearful of tripping over the fire hoses, which had been flat before but were now full of water. PC Richard Coombes, armed with just a short truncheon, said the noise – [...] "Kill the pigs!" [...] – was deafening, and he could hardly <b>see</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> scratched Perspex visor on his helmet.|$|E
