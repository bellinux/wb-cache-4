5|$|Some obstetricians {{argue that}} not {{offering}} screening for Down syndrome is unethical. As it is a medically reasonable procedure, per informed consent, people <b>should</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be given information about it.

When results from testing become available, it is also considered unethical not to give the results to the person in question.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on June 28, 2011, the PHP Group {{implemented}} a timeline {{for the release}} of new versions of PHP. Under this system, at least one release should occur every month. Once per year, a minor release should occur which may include new features. Every minor release <b>should</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year release process for every minor release. No new features, unless small and self-contained, are to be introduced into a minor release during the three-year release process.|$|E
5|$|Kluge {{welcomed the}} decision, {{as he was}} already in the process of {{withdrawing}} units of the 9th Army from the northern side of the Kursk salient to deal with Soviet attacks on his flank. But Manstein was greatly disappointed. He argued that his forces were now on the verge of achieving a major breakthrough on the southern side of the salient. As he saw it, with his III Panzer Corps about to link up with the II SS-Panzer Corps at Prokhorovka, and with the XXIV Panzer Corps available as his operational reserve, they would be halting the offensive just at the moment when victory was in hand. With an eye toward the west, Hitler was unwilling to continue the offensive. Manstein persisted, proposing that his forces <b>should</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> destroy the Soviet reserves in the southern Kursk salient before Citadel was finally terminated, so that the Soviet fighting capacity in the sector would be depleted {{for the rest of the}} summer. Hitler agreed to continue offensive operations in the southern salient until Manstein's goal was achieved.|$|E

Deputy Chief Judge Sinfield objects, regarding the expense as an unnecessary burden on the city's budget, but Francisco overrules him, reasoning that the mutant expulsions <b>should</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be done with some humanity. Francisco's relative leniency towards the mutants—in {{spite of the fact that}} he supports forcing them to choose between mandatory sterilisation or exile—begins to cost him the support of the hardliners, such as Sinfield, who put him in office in the first place.|$|E
25|$|If a firstborn {{attending}} a siyum does {{not hear the}} completion of the tractate, or if he does not understand what he hears, or if he is in the shiva period of mourning and is thus forbidden from listening to the Torah material being taught, some authorities rule that subsequent eating would not qualify as a seudat mitzvah and he would therefore be forbidden to break his fast (Ben Ish Chai 1:96:25; Rabbi Shlomo Yosef Elyashiv, Siddur Pesach K'hilchaso, p.168; Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Chazon Ovadiah, p.99). Other authorities allow a firstborn to break his fast under such circumstances (Minchas Yitzchak 9:45; Teshuvos V'hanhagos 1:300, 2:210 in the name of Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael Kanievsky). The Minchas Yitzchak (ibid.) suggests that a firstborn in such a position <b>should</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> try to contribute to the siyum in some way, such as by sponsoring or helping to prepare the meal.|$|E

500|$|In her {{analysis}} of Yangzhou storytelling, Børdahl {{noted that the}} aforementioned tale about Zhou and Wu Song uses different forms of dialogue for both characters.

It was also the subject of a New York Times editorial and investigated on CBS News by Walter Cronkite. Washington was fined $10,000, and suspended for 60 days, missing 26 games; then the longest suspension for an on-court incident in NBA history. The Rockets were furious.

500|$|Twelve {{days after}} {{the opening of the}} L, Liverpool surgeon Thomas Weatherill wrote to The Lancet {{questioning}} the official version of Huskisson's death and calling the behaviour of the doctors who had attended Eccles vicarage [...] "unscientific, inefficient and imbecilic". He had spoken to eyewitnesses, and concluded that Huskisson's weakness and spasms following the accident were caused by blood loss, not internal injury, and that amputation would have stemmed the blood loss and saved Huskisson's life. He went on to claim that those eyewitnesses he had spoken to had seen Huskisson bleeding heavily, but that no effort had been made to stem the bleeding other than Lord Wilton's makeshift tourniquet of handkerchiefs. He argued that those doctors attending <b>should</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> have made an attempt at amputation {{when it became clear that}} other measures were not working.|$|E
500|$|Despite all {{the glowing}} reviews, FreeSpace 2 sold poorly. The April 2000 issue of PC Gamer stated that only 26,983 copies {{had been sold}} {{in the first six}} months of its release.

[...] He, however, stated that as the team had stayed within budget by sticking to schedule, Volition <b>should</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be breaking even with the estimated final sales of the game. In NowGamer's interview with Jim Boone, a producer at Volition, he stated that this could have been due to joysticks' being sold poorly because they were [...] "going out of fashion" [...] because more modern first-person shooters, such as Quake, were [...] "very much about the mouse and [...] keyboard". He went further on to state [...] "Before that, when we did Descent for example, it was perfectly common for people to have joysticks – we sold a lot of copies of Descent. It was around that time [...] the more modern FPS with mouse and keyboard came out, as opposed to just keyboard like Wolfenstein [...] or something.".|$|E
500|$|Flight Unlimited was a {{commercial}} success. It debuted in twelfth {{place on a}} June 1995 sales chart compiled by NPD Group, while Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1 took first place. The game went on to sell more than 300,000 copies by 1997, and more than 780,000 by 2002. According to Constantine von Hoffman of the Boston Herald, Flight Unlimited successfully competed with Microsoft Flight Simulator. PC Gamers Lee Buchanan wrote that it [...] "soars above the pack of flight simulations", and he considered it to be [...] "the most fun [...] had in a computerized cockpit". Frank Vizard of Popular Mechanics hailed it as [...] "the new top gun of flight simulators", and Doug Bailey of The Boston Globe considered {{it to be the}} [...] "first real serious challenge to Microsoft's dominance of the genre".
