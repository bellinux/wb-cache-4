5|$|She was {{the second}} ship to be named for Johnston Blakeley, {{the first was a}} torpedo boat {{commissioned}} in 1904. A subsequent USS Blakely would be commissioned, this one a Knox-class frigate. This third <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> also be named for Charles Adams Blakely.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the speed of a normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E
5|$|Low, {{like other}} pirates of the time, tried to intimidate his victims into {{surrendering}} {{by threatening to}} kill or torture them. The crew of the targeted <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> hinder the officers from defending the ship, so afraid were they of reprisals. One failed torture session led to one of Low's crew members accidentally cutting him in the mouth. Botched surgery left Low scarred.|$|E
50|$|Numerous voyages {{would follow}} during the {{following}} century. Between 1598 and 1640, red seal <b>ships</b> <b>would</b> ply the Pacific for Asian trade, and embassies on Japanese-built Western-style <b>ships</b> <b>would</b> {{be sent to the}} Americas, in the persons of Tanaka Shōsuke (1610) and Hasekura Tsunenaga (1614).|$|R

5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of stokers {{to do it}} by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This meant that the boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> have much greater range.|$|E
5|$|On 4 May, Magdalena was {{declared}} to {{be a total}} loss, making her the sixth ship built by Harland and Wolff to be lost on her maiden voyage. Her insurers paid out £2,295,000 to Royal Mail Lines by cheque on 16 May. At the time, this was the biggest payout for a marine casualty in the United Kingdom. It was decided that a replacement <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> not be built.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Chaoyong was advertised by its designer, British naval {{architect}} Sir George Wightwick Rendel, {{as an example}} of a low-cost cruiser able to withstand larger ironclad warships. The design was later seen as an intermediate concept between his flat-iron gunboats and the protected cruiser. In theory, the <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> rely on its small size and higher speed, along with a higher muzzle velocity main battery to attack larger, less maneuverable ships.|$|E

5|$|The torpedo {{struck the}} after {{portion of the}} {{starboard}} side of the Houston, blowing 20 men overboard and spreading gasoline fires in the waters around the cruiser. Initially unsure whether the <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> hold together, the captain ordered the evacuation of 300 crew members while the ship's condition was ascertained. In {{the end it was}} determined she would stay afloat. Towing continued as before, slowly moving the task group towards the Navy base at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|Approval for the mission, codenamed Operation Chariot, {{was given}} on 3 March 1942. Using a French <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> involve using the Free French forces and {{increase}} the number of people aware of the raid. Consequently, it was decided the navy would have to provide a ship of their own. The RAF complained that the raid would draw heavily on their resources; the number of aircraft assigned by RAF Bomber Command was reduced time and time again before the day of the raid. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill further complicated matters when he ordered that bombing should only take place if targets were clearly identified.|$|E
5|$|British Waterways {{introduced}} a similar system in September 1974. Called BACAT, for Barges Aboard Catamaran, the system consisted of trains of barges, which were pushed by a tug, and {{which would be}} loaded between the twin hulls of a custom-built delivery ship. The <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> then transport them across the North Sea to continental waterways, without their contents having to be transshipped. The concept failed after 18 months, as the dock workers at Hull blacklisted the entire British Waterways fleet, because {{they believed that the}} system would threaten their jobs. Most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges.|$|E

50|$|Oliver Heywood had lineage {{that has}} been {{traced back to the}} 1700s; an ancestry that has {{tarnished}} the Heywood legacy. Heywood family fortunes had ties to the Trans-Atlantic Slave trade. In the 1700s, members of the Heywood family had made their home in Liverpool and owned a shipping company. The Heywoods would transport goods made in Manchester, England to West Africa to trade for African slaves. From West Africa, the Heywood <b>ships</b> <b>would</b> take them to Barbados in the Caribbean. In Barbados, the Heywood <b>ships</b> <b>would</b> then trade the African slaves for sugar and cotton. The <b>ships</b> <b>would</b> then bring the sugar and cotton back to Liverpool.|$|R
5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the Navy set up twenty-one large winches on the island to turn the Oklahoma upright {{so it could be}} re-floated and patched before being scrapped. Coral was piled between the ship and the island so the <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> roll upright, instead of sliding toward the shore. Despite {{recovery}} efforts and patching, the Oklahoma sank during a mid-Pacific storm while it was being towed to the scrapyard. Nevada, California, West Virginia and the minelayer USS Oglala were re-floated and salvaged by the Navy. The entire salvage operation took 20,000 man-hours underwater and 5,000 dives to recover human remains, weapons, ammunition and artifacts of historic or military importance.|$|E
5|$|Following {{decommissioning}} in 1997, {{the ship}} was earmarked for preservation as a museum ship in Mumbai. Lack of funding prevented progress on the ship's conversion to a museum and it was speculated that the <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> {{be made into a}} training ship. In 2001, {{the ship was}} opened to the public by the Indian Navy, but the Government of Maharashtra was unable to find a partner to operate the museum on a permanent, long-term basis and the museum was closed after it was deemed unsafe for the public in 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 Nansen {{had driven}} his ship Fram into the Arctic pack ice off the {{northern}} Siberian coast and {{allowed it to}} drift in the ice towards Greenland, hoping that this route would cross the North Pole. In the event, the drift did not approach the pole, and an attempt by Nansen and Hjalmar Johansen to reach it on foot was likewise unsuccessful. Nevertheless, Nansen's strategy became the basis of Amundsen's own Arctic plans. He reasoned that if he entered the Arctic Ocean via the Bering Strait, well {{to the east of}} Nansen's starting point, his <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> achieve a more northerly drift and pass near or through the pole.|$|E

When the weapons were clean and the Malagasy were ordered to return them, they attacked the ship's crew, and {{took control of the}} ship. A truce ensued, the terms of which were that if the Malagasy would spare the lives of the remaining crew the <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> be sailed back to Madagascar, but taking advantage of the Malagasy's lack of navigational skills, the crew instead set sail for the coast of southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|Several {{times in}} 1912, amidst an {{outbreak}} of bubonic plague in the Caribbean, Havana operated in violation of Cuban and U.S. quarantine rules. In July 1912, the liner prepared to depart Cuba without an inspection and fumigation, but faced the prospect of seven days quarantine in Havana before the <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to depart. However, a compromise was worked out by the United States Marine Hospital Service which allowed Havana to depart after a one-day delay. In September of the same year, another inspection gaffe resulted in government prosecution of the Ward Line.|$|E
5|$|The German {{aircraft}} carrier I was a planned {{conversion of the}} transport ship Europa during World War II. The loss of the battleship Bismarck and near torpedoing of her sistership Tirpitz in May 1941 and March 1942, respectively, spurred the Kriegsmarine to acquire {{aircraft carrier}}s. Europa {{was one of several}} vessels selected for conversion into auxiliary aircraft carriers.

5|$|The {{first such}} battlecruisers were the Dutch Design 1047, {{designed}} to protect their colonies in the East Indies {{in the face of}} Japanese aggression. Never officially assigned names, these ships were designed with German and Italian assistance. While they broadly resembled the German Scharnhorst class and had the same main battery, they would have been more lightly armoured and only protected against eight-inch gunfire. Although the design was mostly completed, work on the vessels never commenced as the Germans overran the Netherlands in May 1940. The first <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> have been laid down in June of that year.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion that}} the <b>ship</b> <b>would</b> have nailed her flag and never surrendered, as Barère claimed, is never {{accounted}} {{in any of the}} reports. Though Jean François Renaudin never explicitly states that he surrendered, he does mention that he had his flag flown half-mast in distress when he was surrounded by British ships, indicating that he was requesting assistance from the enemy. Griffiths observes that Vengeur was dismasted to the point that there would have been nothing on which to nail a flag anyway, and James makes mentions of Vengeur hoisting the Union Jack in submission.|$|E
