5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make {{free-machining}} steels and free-machining {{aluminium alloys}} for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on <b>solidification</b> in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, <b>solidification</b> or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|E
5|$|Holes {{and windows}} require special {{consideration}} when die casting because the perimeters {{of these features}} will grip to the die steel during <b>solidification.</b> To counteract this affect, generous draft should be added to hole and window features.|$|E
5|$|Liquid or solid xenon {{nanoparticles}} can {{be formed}} {{at room temperature}} by implanting Xe+ ions into a solid matrix. Many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid Xe. This results in compression of the implanted Xe to pressures that may be sufficient for its liquefaction or <b>solidification.</b>|$|E
5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional <b>solidification</b> with the fast cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable {{metal that}} has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on <b>solidification.</b> Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals are {{primarily}} found as lithophiles (rock-loving) or chalcophiles (ore-loving). Lithophile heavy metals are mainly f-block elements {{and the more}} reactive of the d-block elements. They have a strong affinity for oxygen and mostly exist as relatively low density silicate minerals. Chalcophile heavy metals are mainly the less reactive d-block elements, and period 4–6 p-block metals and metalloids. They are usually found in (insoluble) sulfide minerals. Being denser than the lithophiles, hence sinking lower into the crust {{at the time of}} its <b>solidification,</b> the chalcophiles tend to be less abundant than the lithophiles.|$|E
5|$|In 1735 Brandt {{proposed}} {{to make the}} presence or absence of malleability the principle of this classification. On that basis he separated mercury from the metals. The same view was adopted by Vogel (1755, Institutiones Chemiæ) and Buffon (1785, Histoire Naturelle des Minéraux). In the interim, Braun had observed the <b>solidification</b> of mercury by cold in 1759–60. This was confirmed by Hutchins and Cavendish in 1783. The malleability of mercury then became known, and it was included amongst the metals.|$|E
5|$|Vincent {{was chosen}} as the game's protagonist due to the scope for {{expanding}} his backstory, which was left very vague in Final Fantasy VII. The fact that his main weapon was a gun also worked into the team's desire to create a more action-oriented game. Prior to the <b>solidification</b> of the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, the development team originally considered using other gunfighter characters from the Final Fantasy series, such as Final Fantasy VIIs Barret Wallace, Final Fantasy VIIIs Irvine Kinneas or Final Fantasy X-2s Yuna. However, after the release of Before Crisis and Advent Children, and with the expansion of the Final Fantasy VII mythos, they settled on Vincent.|$|E
5|$|The {{main effect}} of the aid package was to fuel a rapid {{expansion}} in the urban middle and upper class, while life remained mostly unchanged for South Vietnam's rural majority. This served to increase anti-government resentment among peasants, while solidifying urban support for the Saigon government. US officials {{were aware of the}} failure of the program to propel economic development, but did not try and divert the spending to investment as they regarded the <b>solidification</b> of urban support for the government to be very important. They also used the dependence of the urban class on the CIP to achieve political changes in South Vietnam. In 1963, when the US sought to pressure the government of Ngo Dinh Diem after the alliance began to falter, they cut off funding as a gesture to the urban civil servant and military officer class that they disapproved of Diem. Following the South Vietnamese leader's overthrow and assassination in a US-backed coup, the CIP resumed.|$|E
5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and <b>solidification</b> of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Robert Lee of GM {{invented the}} Fe14Nd2B {{permanent}} magnet, fabricated by rapid <b>solidification.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of total <b>solidification</b> is the solidus of the alloy, the temperature at which all components are molten is the liquidus.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the new candle is such that the {{brightness}} of the full radiator at the temperature of <b>solidification</b> of platinum is 60new candles per square centimetre.|$|E
25|$|<b>Solidification</b> {{involves}} {{the addition of}} reagents to a contaminated material to impart physical/dimensional stability to contain contaminants in a solid product and reduce access by external agents (e.g. air, rainfall).|$|E
25|$|Zeng Qinghong, CPC Secretariat Secretary, Vice-President, ranked 5th in Politburo Standing Committee, {{is out of}} the 17th Central Committee, likely due to age. Zeng's {{departure}} also {{signals the}} <b>solidification</b> of Hu Jintao's power.|$|E
25|$|A {{long-lasting}} {{consequence of}} the Confederation wars was the <b>solidification</b> of hostilities between the Boer and British inhabitants of southern Africa. These were later to feed into the far larger Second Boer War.|$|E
25|$|In metallurgy, the {{partition}} coefficient {{is an important}} factor in determining how different impurities are distributed between molten and solidified metal. It is a critical parameter for purification using zone melting, and determines how effectively an impurity can be removed using directional <b>solidification,</b> described by the Scheil equation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Solidification</b> and {{stabilization}} {{work has}} a reasonably good track record {{but also a}} set of serious deficiencies related to durability of solutions and potential long-term effects. In addition CO2 emissions due {{to the use of}} cement are also becoming a major obstacle to its widespread use in solidification/stabilization projects.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{porosity}} {{can sometimes}} be difficult to distinguish from microshrinkage because microshrinkage cavities can contain gases as well. In general, microporosities will form if the casting is not properly risered or if a material with a wide <b>solidification</b> range is cast. If neither of these are the case then most likely the porosity is due to gas formation.|$|E
25|$|For {{pressure}} {{experiments that}} exceed 10 GPa, noble gases are preferred. The extended hydrostaticity greatly reduces the pressure gradient in samples at high pressure. Noble gases, such as helium, neon, and argon are optically transparent, thermally insulating, have small X-ray scattering factors and have good hydrostaticity at high pressures. Even after <b>solidification,</b> noble gases provide quasihydrostatic environments.|$|E
25|$|The {{solid-state}} {{nature of}} FSW leads to several advantages over fusion welding methods as {{problems associated with}} cooling from the liquid phase are avoided. Issues such as porosity, solute redistribution, <b>solidification</b> cracking and liquation cracking do not arise during FSW. In general, FSW {{has been found to}} produce a low concentration of defects and is very tolerant of variations in parameters and materials.|$|E
25|$|Yemen was stable {{during the}} Rashidun Caliphate. Yemeni tribes {{played a pivotal role}} in the Islamic {{expansion}} of Egypt, Iraq, Persia, the Levant, Anatolia, North Africa, Sicily, and Andalusia. Yemeni tribes who settled in Syria, contributed significantly to the <b>solidification</b> of Umayyad rule, especially during the reign of Marwan I. Powerful Yemenite tribes such as Kindah were on his side during the Battle of Marj Rahit.|$|E
25|$|The main use {{of calcium}} sulfate {{is to produce}} plaster of Paris and stucco. These {{applications}} exploit the fact that calcium sulfate which has been powdered and calcined forms a moldable paste upon hydration and hardens as crystalline calcium sulfate dihydrate. It is also convenient that calcium sulfate is poorly soluble in water and does not readily dissolve in contact with water after its <b>solidification.</b>|$|E
25|$|A crystal or {{crystalline}} solid is a {{solid material}} whose constituents (such as atoms, molecules, or ions) are arranged in a highly ordered microscopic structure, forming a crystal lattice that extends in all directions. In addition, macroscopic single crystals are usually identifiable by their geometrical shape, consisting of flat faces with specific, characteristic orientations. The scientific study of crystals and crystal formation is known as crystallography. The process of crystal formation via mechanisms of crystal growth is called crystallization or <b>solidification.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{casting process}} is {{advantageous}} for very complex castings, that would regularly require cores. It is also dimensionally accurate, requires no draft, {{and has no}} parting lines so no flash is formed. As compared to investment casting, it is cheaper {{because it is a}} simpler process and the foam is cheaper than the wax. Risers are not usually required {{due to the nature of}} the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal into the mold cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional <b>solidification.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ling Tong (189–217), {{courtesy}} name Gongji, was {{a military}} general serving under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty. He started his service under Sun Quan {{when he was still}} a teenager and, throughout his entire life, had been contributing to the foundation and <b>solidification</b> of the state of Eastern Wu, which Sun Quan established in 229. He fought in numerous battles for his lord, including those against Huang Zu, Liu Bei and the Shanyue tribes, but {{is best known for his}} performance in the campaigns against Sun Quan's rival Cao Cao, in which he displayed great skill in extremely adverse situations.|$|E
25|$|The Urdu {{language}} {{emerged as}} a distinct register of Hindustani well before the Partition of India. It is distinguished most by its extensive Persian influences (Persian having been the official language of the Mughal government and the most prominent lingua franca of the Indian subcontinent for several centuries before the <b>solidification</b> of British colonial rule during the 19th century). The standard Urdu script is {{a modified version of}} the Perso-Arabic script and has its origins in 13th century Iran. It is closely related to the development of the Nastaliq style of Perso-Arabic script. Urdu script in its extended form is known as Shahmukhi script and is used for writing other Indo-Aryan languages of North Indian subcontinent like Punjabi and Saraiki as well.|$|E
25|$|The corium {{undergoes}} degradation. The Elephant's Foot, {{hard and}} strong shortly after its formation, is now cracked enough that a glue-treated wad easily separated its top 1–2 centimeter layer. The structure's shape itself is changed as the material slides down and settles. The corium temperature is now just slightly different from ambient, {{the material is}} therefore subject to both day-night temperature cycling and weathering by water. The heterogeneous nature of corium and different thermal expansion coefficients of the components causes material deterioration with thermal cycling. Large amounts of residual stresses were introduced during <b>solidification</b> due to the uncontrolled cooling rate. The water, seeping into pores and microcracks and freezing there, the same process that creates potholes on roads, accelerates cracking.|$|E
25|$|Metals {{are almost}} always polycrystalline, though there are {{exceptions}} like amorphous metal and single-crystal metals. The latter are grown synthetically. (A microscopically-small piece of metal may naturally form into a single crystal, but larger pieces generally do not.) Ionic compound materials are usually crystalline or polycrystalline. In practice, large salt crystals can be created by <b>solidification</b> of a molten fluid, or by crystallization out of a solution. Covalently bonded solids (sometimes called covalent network solids) are also very common, notable examples being diamond and quartz. Weak van der Waals forces also help hold together certain crystals, such as crystalline molecular solids, {{as well as the}} interlayer bonding in graphite. Polymer materials generally will form crystalline regions, but the lengths of the molecules usually prevent complete crystallization—and sometimes polymers are completely amorphous.|$|E
25|$|The mantle differs {{substantially}} {{from the}} crust in its mechanical properties as the direct {{consequence of the}} difference in composition (expressed as different mineralogy). The distinction between crust and mantle is based on chemistry, rock types, rheology and seismic characteristics. The crust is a <b>solidification</b> product of mantle derived melts, expressed as various degrees of partial melting products during geologic time. Partial melting of mantle material is believed to cause incompatible elements to separate from the mantle, with less dense material floating upward through pore spaces, cracks, or fissures, that would subsequently cool and solidify at the surface. Typical mantle rocks have a higher magnesium to iron ratio and a smaller proportion of silicon and aluminium than the crust. This behavior is also predicted by experiments that partly melt rocks thought to be representative of Earth's mantle.|$|E
25|$|A superhydrophobic {{surface is}} a low energy, {{generally}} rough surface on which water has a contact angle of >150°. Nonpolar materials such as hydrocarbons traditionally have relatively low surface energies, however this property alone {{is not sufficient to}} achieve superhydrophobicity. Superhydrophobic surfaces can be created in a number of ways, however most of the synthesis strategies are inspired by natural designs. The Cassie-Baxter model provides and explanation for superhydropbicity—air trapped in microgrooves of a rough surface create a “composite” surface consisting of air and the tops of microprotrusions. This structure is maintained as the scale of the features decreases, thus many approaches to the synthesis of superhydrophobic surfaces have focused on the fractal contribution. Wax <b>solidification,</b> lithography, vapor deposition, template methods, polymer reconfirmation, sublimation, plasma, electrospinning, sol-gel processing, electrochemical methods, hydrothermal synthesis, layer-by-layer deposition, and one-pot reactions are approaches to the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces that have been suggested.|$|E
25|$|The Chief {{is part of}} a {{medium-sized}} pluton of a granitic rock (granodiorite) that was initially formed in the early Cretaceous (approximately 100 million years ago) by the slow cooling and <b>solidification</b> of molten magma deep {{below the surface of the}} Earth. Exhumation of the granite body probably occurred mostly by erosion of overlying rocks over tens of millions of years, with glacial erosion processes dominating exhumation over the last 2.5 million years. Once exposed at the surface, the original granite body was shaped by glacial erosion, which is responsible for the tall steep walls that define the Chief, as well as the excavation of Howe Sound, a fjord. Classic hallmarks of glacial erosion are ubiquitous, especially polished, striated surfaces. Polish and striations observable at the very summit of the formation require that, at the peak of glaciation, the entire formation was buried under a substantial thickness of ice.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of {{morphology}} and physical characteristics, tektites have traditionally been divided into four groups. The tektites which have been found on land have traditionally been subdivided into three groups: (1) splash-form (normal) tektites, (2) aerodynamically shaped tektites, and (3) Muong Nong-type (layered) tektites. Splash-form and aerodynamically shaped tektites are only differentiated on {{the basis of}} their appearance and some of their physical characteristics. Splash-form tektites are centimeter-sized tektites that are shaped like spheres, ellipsoids, teardrops, dumbbells, and other forms characteristic of isolated molten bodies. They are regarded as having formed from the <b>solidification</b> of rotating liquids, and not atmospheric ablation. Aerodynamically shaped tektites, which are mainly part of the Australasian strewn field, are splash-form tektites (buttons) which display a secondary ring or flange. The secondary ring or flange is argued as having been produced during the high-speed reentry and ablation of a solidified splash-form tektite into the atmosphere. Muong Nong tektites are typically larger, greater than 10nbsp&cm in size and 24nbsp&kg in weight, irregular, and layered tektites. They have a chunky, blocky appearance, exhibit a layered structure with abundant vesicles, and contain mineral inclusions, such as zircon, baddeleyite, chromite, rutile, corundum, cristobalite and coesite.|$|E
25|$|Solidifying: Solidifiers are {{composed}} of tiny, floating, dry ice pellets, and hydrophobic polymers that both adsorb and absorb. They clean up oil spills by changing the physical state of spilled oil from liquid to a solid, semi-solid or a rubber-like material that floats on water. Solidifiers are insoluble in water, therefore {{the removal of the}} solidified oil is easy and the oil will not leach out. Solidifiers have been proven to be relatively non-toxic to aquatic and wild life and have been proven to suppress harmful vapors commonly associated with hydrocarbons such as Benzene, Xylene, Methyl Ethyl, Acetone and Naphtha. The reaction time for <b>solidification</b> of oil is controlled by the surface area or size of the polymer or dry pellets as well as the viscosity and thickness of the oil layer. Some solidifier product manufactures claim the solidified oil can be thawed and used if frozen with dry ice or disposed of in landfills, recycled as an additive in asphalt or rubber products, or burned as a low ash fuel. A solidifier called C.I.Agent (manufactured by C.I.Agent Solutions of Louisville, Kentucky) is being used by BP in granular form, as well as in Marine and Sheen Booms at Dauphin Island and Fort Morgan, Alabama, to aid in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill cleanup.|$|E

500|$|When {{filling a}} new or {{unfamiliar}} mould {{for the first}} time, where shot size for that mould is unknown, a technician/tool setter may perform a trial run before a full production run. They start with a small shot weight and fills gradually until the mould is 95 to 99% full. Once this is achieved, {{a small amount of}} holding pressure will be applied and holding time increased until gate freeze off (<b>solidification</b> time) has occurred. Gate freeze off time can be determined by increasing the hold time, and then weighing the part. When the weight of the part does not change, it is then known that the gate has frozen and no more material is injected into the part. Gate <b>solidification</b> time is important, as this determines cycle time and the quality and consistency of the product, which itself is an important issue in the economics of the production process. [...] Holding pressure is increased until the parts are free of sinks and part weight has been achieved.|$|E
