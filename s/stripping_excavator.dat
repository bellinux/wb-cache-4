The mechanisms of landfall processes in coal stripping operating deposits with loose overburden rocks have been found out; the dependences of the capacity of dragline excavators on the parameters of safety components in the overburden operation flow charts have been established; the laws of changing the directions of stripping and mining basin-shape coal deposits have been determined. The results have been introduced in the strippings in PrimoryeAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s {{with the}} demand for coal at a peak high and more coal {{companies}} turning to the cheaper method of <b>strip</b> mining, <b>excavator</b> manufacturers started offering a new super class of power shovels, commonly called giant stripping shovels. Most were built between the 1950s and the 1970s. The world's first giant stripping shovel for the coal fields was the Marion 5760. Unofficially known to its crew and eastern Ohio residences alike as The Mountaineer, it was erected in 1955/56 near Cadiz, Ohio off of Interstate I-70. Larger models followed the successful 5760, culminating in the mid 60s with the gigantic 15,000 ton Marion 6360, nicknamed The Captain.|$|R
