50|$|A {{gap between}} {{the inner and outer}} Van Allen belts, {{sometimes}} called safe zone or safe slot, is caused by the Very Low Frequency (VLF) waves which scatter particles in pitch angle which results in the gain of particles to the atmosphere. <b>Solar</b> <b>outbursts</b> can pump particles into the gap but they drain again in a matter of days. The radio waves were originally thought to be generated by turbulence in the radiation belts, but recent work by James L. Green of the Goddard Space Flight Center comparing maps of lightning activity collected by the Microlab 1 spacecraft with data on radio waves in the radiation-belt gap from the IMAGE spacecraft suggests that they are actually generated by lightning within Earth's atmosphere. The radio waves they generate strike the ionosphere at the correct angle to pass through only at high latitudes, where the lower ends of the gap approach the upper atmosphere. These results are still under scientific debate.|$|R

The experience thus gained was turned to public account in the compilation of ‘Information and Suggestions addressed to Persons who may be able to place themselves within the Shadow of the Total Eclipse of the Sun on September 7, 1858,’ a brochure printed and circulated by the lords of the admiralty in May 1858.

His account of an observation memorable in the history of solar physics is contained in the ‘Monthly Notices’ for November 1859 (xx. 13). A visit to the continent in 1856 gave him the opportunity of drawing up a valuable report on the condition of a number of German observatories (Monthly Notices, xvii. 43), and of visiting Schwabe at Dessau, to whose merits he drew explicit attention, and to whom, in the following year, he had the pleasure of transmitting the Astronomical Society's gold medal. He fulfilled with great diligence the duties of secretary to that body, 1857-62, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 7 June 1860.|$|E
40|$|Consideration of the {{evolution}} of thermonuclear runaways in the hydrogen-rich envelopes of 0. 5 solar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. The larger radii of these stars, compared with the 1. 00 solar mass white dwarfs, results in a lesser degree of degeneracy at the same depth in the star. Four models of luminosity with. 00355 solar luminosity, differing only in the initial abundances of C- 12, N- 14, and O- 16, are presented. The degree of enhancement required to produce mass ejection, and thereby a nova-type outburst, is greater than for the 1. 00 solar mass model. Nevertheless, {{the evolution}} of the 0. 5 solar mass model that ejected material is very {{similar to that of the}} 1. 00 solar mass models, and it also ejects significant amounts of C- 13, N- 15, and O- 17 into the interstellar medium.

For a nuclear fission reactor to exist {{at the center of}} the Earth, all of the following conditions must be met: (1) There must originally have been a substantial quantity of uranium within Earth's core; (2) There must be a natural mechanism for concentrating the uranium; (3) The isotopic composition of the uranium at the onset of fission must be appropriate to sustain a nuclear fission chain reaction; (4) The reactor must be able to breed a sufficient quantity of fissile nuclides to permit operation over the lifetime of Earth to the present; (5) There must be a natural mechanism for the removal of fission products; (6) There must be a natural mechanism for removing heat from the reactor; (7) There must be a natural mechanism to regulate reactor power level, and; (8) The location of the reactor or must be such as to provide containment and prevent meltdown. Herndon's georeactor alone is shown to meet those conditions. Georeactor existence evidence based upon helium measurements and upon antineutrino measurements is described.

40|$|The thermal {{response}} of the underlying white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable to the periodic deposition of mass by a dwarf nova accretion event is simulated with a quasi-static stellar evolution code incorporating time variable accretion. After accretion at rates typical of dwarf nova outbursts (approx. 10 (exp - 7) to 10 (exp - 8) /yr) for outburst durations of days to 2 weeks, the radial infall is shut off {{and the evolution of}} the white dwarf is followed during dwarf nova quiescence. The matter is assumed to accrete softly with the same entropy as the white dwarf outer layers. In some sequences accretion is resumed and shut off repeatedly at intervals of months to simulate the thermal evolution of the white dwarf in typical dwarf novae such as SS Cygni and U Geminorum, between successive dwarf nova outbursts. Thermal timescales for white dwarf cooling following a given dwarf nova outburst depend upon the accretion rate, outburst duration, and white dwarf mass; they are nominally in the range 0. 2 - 0. 8 years for parameters typical of dwarf novae (white dwarf masses in the range 1. 2 - 0. 6 <b>solar</b> mass, <b>outburst</b> accretion rates in the range 1 x 10 (exp - 7) - 10 (exp - 8) <b>solar</b> mass/yr, <b>outburst</b> durations in the range 7 - 14, days and quiescent intervals of 30 - 300 days).

40|$|An active Sun and {{increased}} comet bombardment {{triggered by a}} Galactic cosmic ray volley {{may have led to}} the extinction of the mammoth about 13 thousand years ago according to research conducted by astrophysicist Paul LaViolette of the Starburst Foundation. LaViolette first presented evidence for his theory in his 1983 Ph. D. dissertation which he worked on at Portland State University in Oregon. Astronomical evidence he had gathered indicated that every 10, 000 years or so intense volleys of cosmic ray electrons are unleashed from outbursts of our Galaxy's core and make their way to us traveling at close to the speed of light. Further he reasoned that one such "Galactic superwave " had bombarded our solar system {{near the end of the}} ice age causing large quantities of cometary dust to enter the solar system along with an increased influx of meteors and comets. He proposed that this triggered a sequence of events including the occurrence of super-sized <b>solar</b> flare <b>outbursts</b> that led to the extinction of the large mammals 13 thousand years ago.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of {{a new class of}} novae are identified and explained. This class consists of those objects that have been observed to eject material rich in oxygen, neon, magnesium, and aluminum at high velocities. We propose that for this class of novae the outburst is occurring not on a carbon-oxygen white dwarf but on an oxygen-neon-magnesium white dwarf which has evolved from a star which had a main sequence mass of approx. 8 solar masses to approx. 12 <b>solar</b> masses. An <b>outburst</b> was simulated by evolving 1. 25 solar mass white dwarfs accreting hydrogen rich material at various rates. The effective enrichment of the envelope by ONeMg material from the core is simulated by enhancing oxygen in the accreted layers. The resulting evolutionary sequences can eject the entire accreted envelope plus core material at high velocities. They can also become super-Eddington at maximum bolometric luminosity. The expected frequency of such events (approx. 1 / 4) is in good agreement with the observed numbers of these novae...|$|R
40|$|Photometric and spectroscopic {{observations}} of the symbiotic binary AX Persei are presented. This system contains a red giant that fills its tidal lobe and transfers material into an accretion disk surrounding a low-mass main-sequence star. The stellar masses - 1 solar mass for the red giant and about 0. 4 solar mass for the companion - suggest AX Per is poised to enter a common envelope phase of evolution. The disk luminosity increases from L(disk) about 100 solar luminosity in quiescence to L(disk) about 5700 <b>solar</b> luminosity in <b>outburst</b> for a distance of d = 2. 5 kpc. Except for visual maximum, high ionization permitted emission lines - such as He II - imply an EUV luminosity comparable to the disk luminosity.

40|$|International audienceThe Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) on the MAVEN {{spacecraft}} has detected {{two distinct}} types of auroral emission on Mars. First, we report {{the discovery of}} a low altitude, diffuse aurora spanning much of Mars’ northern hemisphere coincident with a <b>solar</b> energetic particle <b>outburst.</b> IUVS observed northerly latitudes during late December 2014, detecting auroral emission in virtually all nightside observations for ~ 5 days spanning virtually all geographic longitudes. The vertical profile showed emission down to ~ 70 km altitude (1 microbar), deeper than confirmed at any other planet. The onset and duration of emission coincide with the observed arrival of solar energetic particles up to 200 keV precipitating directly and deeply into the atmosphere. Preliminary modeling of the precipitation, energy deposition and spectral line emission yields good matches to the observations. These observations represent a new class of planetary auroras produced in the Martian middle atmosphere. Given minimal magnetic fields over most of the planet, Mars is likely to exhibit aurora more globally than Earth. Second, we confirm the existence of small patches of discrete aurora near crustal magnetic fields in Mars' southern hemisphere, as observed previously by SPICAM on Mars Express (Bertaux et al., Nature, 435, 790 - 794 (2005)). IUVS observed southern latitudes in July and August 2015, detecting discrete auroral emission in ~ 1 % of suitable observations. Limb scans resolved both vertically and along-slit indicate this type of auroral emission was patchy on the scale of ~ 40 km, and located at higher altitudes ~ 140 km. The higher altitudes imply a lower energy of precipitating particles. The mix of spectral emissions also differed signficiantly from the diffuse aurora, indicating different excitation and quenching processes. We will discuss the observed properties of the aurora and associated charged particle precipitation, as well as the broader implications of this high-energy deposition into Mars' atmopshere...|$|R
40|$|Thesis Summary: ‘Cometary Charge Exchange Emission’ The {{interaction}} of the solar wind with the planets, moons and the interstellar medium is of key importance for understanding the evolution of our solar system. The interaction with Earth’s atmosphere {{is best known for}} the northern light. In case of Mars, the interaction with the solar wind might have lead to the erosion of its atmosphere. Solar wind-atmosphere interactions can be studied particularly well in cometary atmospheres, because in that case the solar wind flow is not attenuated by a planetary magnetic field and interacts directly with its atmosphere, the coma. The size of the cometary atmosphere (in the order of 104 - 105 km) allows remote tracking of the ions as they penetrate into the comet’s atmosphere, offering a unique window on the cometary atmosphere, the solar wind and the {{interaction of}} these two plasmas. When solar wind ions fly through an atmosphere they are neutralized via charge exchange reactions with the neutral gaseous species. These reactions depend strongly on target species and collision velocity. The resulting X-ray and Far-UV emission can therefore be regarded as a fingerprint of the underlying reaction, with many diagnostic qualities. To explore the diagnostics of this emission, I performed experimental studies of charge exchange reactions typical for cometary and planetary atmospheres by means of a technique called ‘Photon Emission Spectroscopy’. Here, ions fly through a neutral gas jet. The velocity of the ions can be controlled via ion optics. The light emitted after electron capture is observed via a Far Ultraviolet spectrometer and this allows for the measurement of state-to-state charge transfer cross sections and the resulting emission cross sections. Among the typical experiments performed were collisions between solar wind ions (He 2 +, O 6 - 7 +, N 7 +, etc) and target gasses relevant for cometary- and planetary atmospheres, such as H 2 O, CO 2, CO and CH 4, all at velocities typical for the solar wind (200 - 1500 km/s). These experiments were the first comprehensive study that was fully designed for its astronomical application. It showed that for velocities typical for the solar wind multiple electron capture, a process that thus far had not been accounted for, becomes the most important reaction channel in some comet-wind interactions. Based upon the charge exchange cross sections measured in the lab, I have developed an astrophysical model that calculates cometary Far UV spectra. This model was used to analyze existing observations by the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer of the helium emission lines of comets Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake. By combining the model with solar wind data from the instruments on board ACE and Ulysses, we were able to analyze the observations of these two comets in terms of solar wind and coma characteristics. In particular the case of Hale-Bopp was of great interest, as our results indicate severe post–bow shock cooling of the solar wind in this extraordinary large comet. As such, our studies were the first remote, quantitative observations ever of local plasma conditions like temperature and density in the interaction zone, which were thus far only accessible by in situ exploration. The model was then further expanded to calculate the much more complex cometary X-ray emission, involving charge exchange of solar wind C, N, and O ions with cometary H, O, and H 2 O species. Modern X-ray observatories, such as Chandra and XMM provide the observer with spatial, temporal and spectral data. Our charge exchange model was used to analyze several cometary observations, most notably the Chandra observations of comet Tempel 1 when it was hit with the 375 kg impactor of the Deep Impact mission. The nearly 30 day time span of our observations sampled several severe changes in the <b>solar</b> wind and <b>outbursts</b> in the comet's activity, which we could clearly identify in the observed X-ray light curve, emission morphology and spectra. Last but not least, the model was also used to develop observational strategies and it served as the basis for successful proposals to observe comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 (SW 3) with XMM, Chandra and SWIFT. SW 3 is a unique comet, because both of its orbit and because of its state. In 1995, SW 3 suddenly broke into three pieces and during its extremely close encounter (< 0. 07 AU) in 2006, some of these cores fragmented even further. The comet’s extremely close encounter in May 2006 provided an unprecedented spatial resolution of up to 300 km in the areas around the nucleus. As charge exchange emission is excellent for tracing thin gas, this allowed for an unprecedented study of the {{interaction of the}} solar wind with the neutral coma, the macroscopic structure of the magneto-hydrodynamic flow, and the microscopic physical processes. Even more, these observations allow for a direct comparison with independent, simultaneous in situ measurements of solar wind conditions measured by near-Earth satellites like SOHO and ACE. This study provides a test bed for our insight in such interactions not only for the solar-wind-coma case but also in the wider context of physical processes in wind-environment collisions. Thus, my thesis studies have focussed on all aspects relevant for X-ray emission from comets: experimental studies of state-to-state charge exchange cross sections, observations of X-ray emission from comets using all X-ray satellites (Chandra, XMM, and Swift), and theoretical modelling of the interaction of solar wind ions with cometary gasses and the resulting X-ray emission spectrum. Together, this has greatly improved our understanding of the interaction of the solar wind with solar system objects and in more general, of physical processes in wind-environment collisions. The thorough understanding of cometary charge exchange emission has {{opened the door to the}} direct observation of more complex solar wind interactions such as those with Mars and Venus...|$|R
