5|$|In {{memory of}} Henry II, Catherine decided {{to add a}} new chapel to the {{basilica}} of Saint Denis, where the kings of France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois rotunda, she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> {{in the context of}} its planned setting. The plan was to integrate the tomb's effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.|$|E

25|$|David Brondos {{has argued}} that Paul sees Jesus as just a part in a wider {{narrative}} in which the Church is working to transform lives of individuals and the world, and that Paul's participatory language <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> in an ethical sense (humans living Christ-like lives) rather than mystically as Sanders thought.|$|E

25|$|Paraphrases of {{his work}} in later writers {{demonstrate}} his method of interpreting these behavioral strictures. For instance, “Do not step over a yoke” <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> as meaning “Do not transgress justice.” These interpretations indicate that the prohibitions held arcane significance for those willing to ponder them and learn, that the symbola are also enigmata (αἰνίγματα).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of Islam, fatwās were {{pronounced}} by distinguished scholars to provide guidance to other scholars, judges and citizens on how subtle points of Islamic law <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood,</b> interpreted or applied.

25|$|With this {{described}} binary logic, the West generally constructs the Orient subconsciously as its alter ego. Therefore, {{descriptions of}} the Orient by the Occident lack material attributes, grounded within land. This inventive, or imaginative interpretation subscribes female characteristics to the Orient and plays into fantasies that are inherent within the West's alter ego. It <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> that this process draws creativity, amounting an entire domain and discourse.|$|E
25|$|These interpreters {{also argue}} that the {{description}} in 2 Samuel 1:26 of the “love” (Hebrew: “ahava”) between David and Jonathan that {{is greater than the}} “love of women” <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> in light of the two earlier mentions of “love” (ahava) between David and Jonathan where it is described not as love for a romantic partner but love for self (“he loved him as his own soul,” 1 Sam 18:3; 20:17).|$|E
25|$|The City of Jerusalem, which <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> as {{covering}} the area {{defined in the}} resolution of the General Assembly of 29 November, should be treated separately and should be placed under effective United Nations control with maximum feasible local autonomy for its Arab and Jewish communities with full safeguards {{for the protection of the}} Holy Places and sites and free access to them and for religious freedom.|$|E

25|$|Brăileanu's one {{daughter}} {{was married to}} his assistant Leon Țopa (1912–1996). Late in his life, Țopa was interviewed by Dungaciu, arguing that Brăileanu <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> as a sociologist, beyond his political commitments. Brăileanu's nephew Virgil Procopovici survived both his jailing under Antonescu and a renewed communist imprisonment from 1948, and, in 1999, reemerged as a legatee of the Iron Guard, republishing Guardist literature that he had kept hidden for the previous 50 years.|$|E
25|$|In Dumézil's opinion Farreus <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> {{as related}} to the rite of the confarreatio the most sacred form of marriage, the name of {{which is due to}} the spelt cake eaten by the spouses, rather than surmising an {{agricultural}} quality of the god: the epithet means the god was the guarantor {{of the effects of the}} ceremony, to which the presence of his flamen is necessary and that he can interrupt with a clap of thunder.|$|E
25|$|Much of what {{witchcraft}} represents in Africa {{has been}} susceptible to misunderstandings and confusion, thanks {{in no small}} part to a tendency among western scholars since the time of the now largely discredited Margaret Murray to approach the subject through a comparative lens vis-a-vis European witchcraft. Okeja argues that witchcraft in Africa today plays a very different social role than in Europe of the past—or present—and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> through an African rather than post-colonial Western lens.|$|E

50|$|The Scout {{program is}} {{designed}} to develop a high degree of self-reliance, initiative, courage, helpfulness, integrity, sportsmanship, and resourcefulness.

25|$|The {{evidence}} in the ancient sources does not make clear how {{the relation between the}} two principles <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood.</b> They do, however, consistently accord the One a higher status than the Indefinite Dyad and consider only the One as absolutely transcendent. This implies a monistic interpretation of the two principles and fits with assertions in the dialogues that suggest a monistic philosophy. Plato's Meno says that everything in nature is related, and the Republic states that there is an origin (archḗ) for all things, which can be grasped by reason.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, the International Astronomical Union {{organized}} a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN states {{that in the}} case of multiple stars the name <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> to be attributed to the brightest component by visual brightness. The WGSN approved the name Proxima Centauri for Alpha Centauri C on 21 August 2016 and the name Rigil Kentaurus for Alpha Centauri A on 6 November 2016. They are now both so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.|$|E
25|$|They {{believe the}} Book of Revelation {{provides}} {{insight into the}} early Eucharist, {{saying that it is}} the new Temple worship in the New Heaven and Earth. The idea of the Eucharist as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet is also explored by British Methodist Geoffrey Wainwright in his book Eucharist and Eschatology (Oxford University Press, 1980). According to Pope Benedict XVI some of the images of Revelation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> {{in the context of the}} dramatic suffering and persecution of the churches of Asia in the 1st century.|$|E
30|$|Minority {{religions}} <b>should</b> not <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> {{in terms}} of doctrines only but also as ethno-religious groups and can be accommodated in a principled yet pragmatic way by drawing on Western Europe’s moderate political secularism as state-religion connexions, rather than naïve ideas of separation or neutrality.|$|R
50|$|Distinguishing {{the central}} and east German prehistoric groups (Hutburg, Walternienburg-Bernburg, Salzmünde und Schöningen) from one another is {{notoriously}} difficult with dramatic differences from author to author.
