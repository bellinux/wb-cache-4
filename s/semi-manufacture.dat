5|$|In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock {{maker in}} Handsworth, invented {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process for making {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been available. At around the same time Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial <b>semi-manufacture.</b> Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, Britannia metal, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Purpose – Most {{existing}} classifications {{of business}} services {{have taken the}} perspective of the supplier as opposed to that of the buyer. To address this imbalance, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to propose a classification of business services based on how the buying company applies the service with respect to its own business processes. Design/methodology/approach – The paper considers some specific aspects of the process of buying and exchanging business services, focusing on the everyday production and consumption of services as opposed to the initial purchasing and negotiation phases. Findings – Earlier literature has developed similar, albeit less elaborate classifications, but does not provide detailed insight into how such classifications are related to differentiated buyer-supplier interaction. This classification distinguishes between four business service applications; as a component, <b>semi-manufacture,</b> instrument or consumable. For each of these four types of services, interaction has to achieve different objectives and consequently they differ with regards to required organizational resources in terms of required capabilities and buyer-supplier interfaces. Research limitations/implications – Primarily conceptual and exploratory in nature, this paper is intended as a review of existing literature and possible starting point for further empirical validation and theoretical refinement. The paper contends that the differences in application have a significant impact on interaction patterns, but this is not to say that other variables have no impact on buyer-supplier interaction patterns. Subsequent research should seek to control for those other possible sources of variation. Practical implications – The overall implication of this classification is that for different services, the buying company should assess how they are applied. Subsequently, it is relevant for firms to consider what functional aspects are crucial and who are likely to become, or who should be involved and to what extent, in the purchasing decision process and in the interactions that take place after the decision has been made...|$|E

40|$|We {{have carried}} out an {{empirical}} study of long-term change in European cookery to test if {{the development of}} this cultural phenomenon matches a general hypothesis about cultural evolution: that human cultural change is characterized by cumulativity. Data from seven cookery books, evenly spaced across time, the oldest one written in medieval times (~ 1200) and the most recent one dating from late modernity (1999), were compared. Ten recipes from each of the categories “poultry recipes”, “fish recipes” and “meat recipes” were arbitrarily selected from each cookery book by selecting the first ten recipes in each category, and the numbers (per recipe) of steps, separate partial processes, methods, ingredients, <b>semi-manufactured</b> ingredients, compound <b>semi-manufactured</b> ingredients (defined as <b>semi-manufactured</b> ingredients containing no less than two raw products), and self-made <b>semi-manufactured</b> ingredients were counted. Regression analyses were used to quantitatively compare the cookery from different ages. We found {{a significant increase in the}} numbers (per recipe) of steps, separate partial processes, methods, ingredients and <b>semi-manufactured</b> ingredients. These significant increases enabled us to identify the development of cookery as an example of the general trend of cumulativity in long-term cultural evolution. The number of self-made <b>semi-manufactured</b> ingredients per recipe, however, may have decreased somewhat over time, something which may reflect the cumulative characteristics of cultural evolution at the level of society, considering the accumulation of knowledge that is required to industrialize food production...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{conducted}} in the year 2008 to assess the determinants of exports in Pakistan during 1970 - 2006 using econometric techniques. Time series data ranging from 1970 to 2006 on total exports, primary commodities exports, <b>semi-manufactures</b> and exports of manufactured goods has been taken from Economic Survey of Pakistan (Statistical Supplement, 2006 - 07). Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test {{has been used for}} checking the stationarity of the data. Furthermore, the Johenson Co-integration test (likelihood ratio statistic) has been used to detect the long-term relationship among the series. The method of ordinary least square has been used to assess the determinants of exports in Pakistan. The results indicate that 1 % increase in the exports of primary commodities brings 0. 97 % increase in total exports in Pakistan. Similarly, 1 % increase in the exports of <b>semi-manufactures</b> leads to increase total exports by 0. 99 %. On similar pattern, 1 % increase in the exports of manufactured goods leads to increase total exports by 1 %. The coefficients of all the explanatory variables are statistically significant at both 5 % and 1 % level of significance. It is recommended to increase the exports of primary goods, <b>semi-manufactures</b> and manufactured goods so as make balance of trade favorable. ...|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{we explore}} the {{patterns}} and determinants of {{the prices of}} raw material and intermediate inputs (MIIs) to UK manufacturing {{as measured by the}} net (n) and gross (g) producer price indexes of materials and fuels (PIMF). Despite the importance of MII in total manufacturing costs their prices have been little studied. It is shown that these prices are Granger independent of the demand for such inputs and thus a simple cost based model of price determination is constructed. This model forecasts that MII prices are functions of world prices for oil, commodities and <b>semi-manufactured</b> products intermediated by exchange rates and duties, domestic factor prices and a trend reflecting domestic technical change, changes in mark ups and change in weights. By the means of an error correction representation it is found that PIMFn and PIMFg, in the long and short-run, are more sensitive to overseas-determined prices (of oil, commodities and <b>semi-manufactured</b> products) than domestically determined prices (labour, capital and the trend). It may be argued that to some considerable degree therefore the prices of material and intermediate inputs in UK manufacturing will not be particularly sensitive to policy actions. ...|$|R
