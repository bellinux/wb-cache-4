The location of that famous city, according to tradition founded by Ascanius and the metropolis of the Latins for 418 years, is <b>still</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> Some scholars have argued that it has not yet been identified because the Ancients themselves did not know exactly where it was located and the reason for their ignorance was that Alba had never been a real city.
