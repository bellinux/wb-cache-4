The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies.

5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the <b>spatial</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemical}} bond between atoms occurs {{as a result}} of electromagnetic interactions, as described by the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different <b>spatial</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E

Two methods, developed by Morishita and Ono {{in the field of}} mathematical ecology, were used in analyzing the <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> Cracks. The following results were obtained. The <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> cracks are influenced by both stress amplitude and stress cycling. In the high stress amplitude region, the distributions are nearly random, while in the low stress amplitude region, the distributions have clumps indicating nonrandom distribution. This result was common to both fatigue in air and corrosion fatigue. With increasing stress cycling, the <b>spatial</b> <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> cracks approach random distributions in the high stress amplitude region, while in the low stress amplitude region, the distributions show a strong tendency to have two kinds of clumps whose sizes are 1 / 4 mm^ 2 and 8 mm^ 2...|$|R

One of the primary applications here is the further elaboration of timbre spatialisation in the frequency domain to account for distance cues incorporating loudness attenuation, reverb, and filtration.

25|$|Unlike {{other types}} of {{radiation}} used in diffraction studies of materials, such as X-rays and neutrons, electrons are charged particles and interact with matter through the Coulomb forces. This means that the incident electrons feel the influence of both the positively charged atomic nuclei and the surrounding electrons. In comparison, X-rays interact with the <b>spatial</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the valence electrons, while neutrons are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the strong nuclear forces. In addition, the magnetic moment of neutrons is non-zero, and they are therefore also scattered by magnetic fields. Because of these different forms of interaction, {{the three types of}} radiation are suitable for different studies.|$|E
25|$|Sellayah {{and colleagues}} have {{postulated}} an 'Out of Africa' theory {{to explain the}} evolutionary origins of obesity. The theory cites diverse ethnic based differences in obesity susceptibility in western civilizations to contend that, neither the thrifty or drifty gene hypotheses can explain {{the demographics of the}} modern obesity crisis. Although the arguments against these patterns arising due to 'drift' are unclear. Sellayah et al. argue that ethnic groups whose ancestors were adapted to hot climates have low metabolic rates due to lack of thermogenic capacity, whereas those groups whose ancestors were cold-adapted were endowed with greater thermogenic capacity and higher metabolic rates. Sellayah and colleagues provide evidence of thermogenic capacity, metabolic rates and obesity prevalence in various indigenous populations in support of their argument. Contrasting this analysis however a study of the <b>spatial</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> obesity across the mainland USA showed that once the effects of poverty and race were accounted for there was no association between ambient temperature and obesity rates.|$|E
