50|$|<b>International</b> direct <b>dialing</b> (IDD) or <b>{{international}}</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>dialling</b> (ISD) is placing {{an international}} telephone call that is dialed directly by a telephone subscriber, {{rather than by}} an telephone operator. The term <b>international</b> <b>subscriber</b> <b>dialling</b> {{was used in the}} United Kingdom and Australia until the terminology was changed to <b>international</b> direct <b>dialling.</b> Since the late 20th century, most <b>international</b> calls are <b>dialed</b> directly.|$|R

5000|$|DDD was {{the term}} used when the North American Numbering Plan was {{implemented}} in the 1950s. In the United Kingdom {{and other parts of}} the Commonwealth of Nations, the equivalent terms are or were [...] "STD", for subscriber trunk dialing, and [...] "ISD" [...] for <b>international</b> <b>subscriber</b> trunk <b>dialing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 1976 {{also saw}} the {{introduction}} of <b>International</b> <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Dialling</b> (ISD) enabling local subscribers to dial direct to over 250 million telephones in 26 countries. However, ISD was not available from coin boxes until July 1982 when POA boxes were replaced with Post Office CT22B type electronic payphones. In 1979 the Board introduced a Motorola single channel radio paging system, which was upgraded to a two channel system. It is now operated by the Jersey Airport Department of Electronics.|$|R
50|$|The {{continued}} {{operation of the}} system presented a number of problems. With the growth of <b>subscriber</b> <b>dialled</b> <b>international</b> calls from abroad and the incompatible allocation of letters to numbers on foreign dials, {{there was an increase}} in the number of dialling errors. In London the number of three letter codes that could be used to represent exchanges had been exhausted. Significant changes were planned to the way calls in and out of the London telephone area were to be handled that required exchange codes to be grouped together into sectors and it was not possible to implement these changes without a transition to all-figure dialling. The General Post Office produced a pamphlet All-Figure Telephone Numbers in 1965 which summarised the problems.|$|R
5000|$|Until the Transit System was {{introduced}} in 1971, directly dialled call routings could only involve one intermediate GSC due to transmission requirements, all other calls requiring an operator assisted routing. GSC's were initially based on the Strowger step-by-step system as adopted by the British Post Office for the United Kingdom telephone network. Subsequent developments permitted the use of Crossbar switches designated as TXK1 which offered enhancements such as 2nd attempt routing; a facility not available on Strowger systems. Each of the 639 charging areas was associated or coterminous with one of 230 Group Switching Centres which contained register-translators (Also referred to as GRACE - Group Routing And Charging Equipment) required for local subscribers to originate self dialled trunk calls. During the introduction of <b>International</b> Direct <b>Dialling</b> (IDD), initially referred to as <b>International</b> <b>Subscriber</b> <b>Dialling</b> (ISD) within the UK, Group Switching Centres were equipped with international call timers and international register-translators to route calls to the relevant international exchange for onward routing abroad.|$|R

50|$|Country {{codes are}} {{necessary}} only when dialing telephone numbers {{in other countries}} than the originating telephone. These are dialed before the national telephone number. By convention, international telephone numbers are indicated by prefixing the country code with a plus sign (+), which is meant {{to indicate that the}} <b>subscriber</b> must <b>dial</b> the <b>international</b> <b>dialing</b> prefix in the country from which the call is placed. For example, the <b>international</b> <b>dialing</b> prefix or access code in all NANP countries is 011, while it is 00 in most European countries. On GSM networks, + is an actual keypad code that may be recognized automatically by the network carrier in place of the international access code.|$|R
