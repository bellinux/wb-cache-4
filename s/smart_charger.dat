40|$|As the Dutch {{electric}} vehicle (EV) fleet continues to expand, {{so will the}} amount of charging sessions increase. This expanding demand for energy will add on to the already existing strain on the grid, primarily during peak hours on workdays {{in the early morning}} and evening. This growing energy demand requires new methods to handle the charging of EVs, to distribute the available energy in the most effective way. Therefore, a large number of ‘smart charging’ initiatives have recently been developed, whereby the charging session of the EV is based on the conditions of the energy grid. However, the term <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> is used for a variety of <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> initiatives, often involving different optimization strategies and charging processes. For most practitioners, as well as academics, it is hard to distinguish the large range of <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> initiatives initiated in recent years, how they differentiate from each other and how they contribute to a <b>smarter</b> <b>charging</b> infrastructure. This paper has the objective to provide an overview of <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> initiatives in the Netherlands and develop a categorization of <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> initiatives regarding objectives, proposed measures and intended contributions. We will do so by looking at initiatives that focus on <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> at a household level, investigating the <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> possibilities for EV owners who either make use of a private or (semi-) public charging point.

30|$|However, <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> {{only works}} if the BEV user is fully {{integrated}} into the process. The algorithms of <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> systems require the user’s specific charging flexibility to schedule an optimal charging process. A BEV user can, for example, provide temporal charging flexibility if she is willing to postpone charging of the BEV in time. Since <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> systems usually cannot decide how flexible the user is (when and how far she wants to drive), the user must manually enter her charging flexibility into the <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} estimating the impact of plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) charging on overhead distribution transformers, based on detailed travel demand data and under several different schemes for mitigating overloads by shifting PEV <b>charging</b> times (<b>smart</b> <b>charging).</b> The paper also presents a new <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> algorithm that manages PEV charging based on estimated transformer temperatures. We simulated the varied behavior of drivers from the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey, and transformer temperatures based an IEEE standard dynamic thermal model. Results are shown for Monte Carlo simulation of a 25 kVA overhead dis-tribution transformer, with ambient temperature data from hot and cold climate locations, for uncontrolled and several smart-charging scenarios. These results illustrate the substantial impact of ambient temperatures on distribution transformer aging, and indicate that temperature-based <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> can dramatically reduce both the mean and variance in transformer aging without substantially reducing {{the frequency with which}} PEVs obtain a full charge. Finally, the results indicate that simple <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> schemes, such as delaying charging until after midnight can actually increase, rather than decrease, transformer aging.

30|$|However, the {{collected}} KPI values are forwarded to controller components, that are located at CSs. The responsibility of theses controllers is {{to indicate the}} present status of the low voltage grid and to choose appropriate actions in order to mitigate stress on the power grid arising from emerging power quality issues. As depicted in Fig.  1, power quality estimation is performed by a component called PQ-Indicator (In this paper, we use PQ as an abbreviation of the Power Quality), which responds to triggered events from Kafka. For example in case of voltage fluctuations, which refer to degradation of the power quality, it gradually estimates the power quality and asks the so-called <b>Smart</b> <b>Charger</b> (SC) to decreases/increases the charging rate in order to counteract the voltage fluctuation and, hence, improve the power quality. This power quality indication, called ’PQ-Indic’, is defined {{within the range of}} [− 1, 1]. Within this normalized range, (- 1) corresponds to either a complete shutdown of the charging process or a reduction to the minimum required power {{in order to be able}} to control the EV later. In contrast, the value (+ 1) represents the maximum power capacity of the CS. The <b>Smart</b> <b>Charger</b> applies a smooth or drastic change on the used charging power capacity depending on value the PQ-Indic. The reason behind separating power quality indication and control logic is due to different interests of the involved parties. From the Charging Service Provider (CSP) perspective, the PQ-Indicator is a black box, which is configured by the DSO depending on the characteristics of each low voltage grid individually, e.g. applying different thresholds for voltage boundaries. In contrast, the CSP configures the <b>Smart</b> <b>Charger</b> according to its business model.|$|E

30|$|In this work, a smart {{charging}} architecture {{based on}} real-time data stream for triggering {{events in the}} grid is presented. It {{is intended to be}} a scalable, decentralized architecture, and it targets the fairness among the different running charging processes as well. The traffic light model is applied to use the introduced grid flexibility to the e-mobility sector in a convenient way. The <b>Smart</b> <b>Charger</b> shows the ability to drastically increase the quality of power with regard to the voltage level and load at the transformer by controlling the active power used by the charging stations. In the future, other control strategies for voltage control can be investigated, for example power factor correction, stationary batteries and OLTC mechanism of the transformers. However, considering further factors of power quality beyond the voltage such as harmonics and unbalance of load {{can be seen as a}} promising direction even so existing hardware does not support this functionalities. Furthermore, the mathematical stability analysis of the proposed architecture is missing and placed on the top of to-do list in the future. Finally, the fairness among the charging processes should be investigated more deeply, e.g. optimizing it by a centralized component which has a global view on the grid and instructs the local <b>Smart</b> <b>Charger</b> to react in a way to improve the power quality in the grid in total.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel modeling {{framework for the}} analysis of Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) charging in unbalanced, residential, distribution systems. A Smart Distribu-tion Power Flow (SDPF) framework is proposed to determine the controlled or <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> schedules and hence address the short-comings of uncontrolled charging. The effect of peak-demand constraint imposed by the Local Distribution Company (LDC) is also studied within the SDPF framework for the <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> scenarios. Uncontrolled versus <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> schemes are compared for various scenarios, from both the customer’s and the LDC’s perspective. Various objective functions, such as energy drawn by the LDC, total feeder losses, total cost of energy drawn by LDC and total cost of PEV charging are considered. Studies are carried out considering two sample systems i. e., the IEEE 13 -node test feeder and a real distribution feeder. Analyses are also presented considering a probabilistic representation of the initial state of charge (SOC) and start time of charging for various scenarios {{to take into account the}} difference in customers’ driving patterns. The results show that uncontrolled charging of PEVs results in increased peak demand, low node voltage levels, and increased feeder current magnitudes. On the other hand, the SDPF framework provides very satisfactory operating schedules for the overall system including <b>smart</b> PEV <b>charging.</b> Index Terms—Plug-in electric vehicles, Uncontrolled <b>charging,</b> <b>smart</b> <b>charging,</b> unbalanced distribution system, optimal feeder operation...|$|R
30|$|The {{objective}} of this section is to evaluate the <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> algorithm and the reaction of EVs on control commands. The evaluation is carried out using pure (co)-simulation and PHIL. The <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> algorithm is evaluated based on the achieved improvement of the power quality in a simulated grid. Furthermore, we compare the charging process of a simulated EV with a real and an emulated EV in order to study the reaction of EVs on the control signals from the algorithm.|$|R
30|$|The {{goal of the}} PQ-Indicator is to {{estimate}} the grid status based on different KPI values at different MPs in the grid. Furthermore, {{the output of the}} PQ-Indicator is used by the <b>Smart</b> <b>Charger</b> in order to decide about suitable actions of the charging station based on real-time measured KPI values. Since most low voltage networks are built as 3 -phase systems, the PQ-Indicator estimates the status of each phase individually. In this regard, the grid status estimation process is equal for each phase and the output is a normalized value within the range [− 1, 1] called PQ-Indic.|$|E
30|$|The low-red {{state is}} {{considered}} as the start state, since the charging operation will start slowly and it adapts a conservative approach concerning the grid stability. The {{transition to the}} end state occurs whenever the driver unplugs the vehicle or the battery is fully charged (equals SoC = 100). If the desired SoCend (defined by the end user) is reached, the FSM transits to the charging standby state (gray state). Within this state the <b>Smart</b> <b>Charger</b> can react on critical grid situations using the still plugged EV, only in case the ’PQ-Indic’ value is positive red-colored, hence requires increase of charging power capacity.|$|E
30|$|The {{transitions}} in the FSM are labeled by two parts: Event and Guard. In the proposed FSM {{we have three}} kinds of events that can trigger the state transition: Input of a new PQ-Indic value, unplugging of the vehicle and changing of the SoC of the battery. Each state transition can have a prerequisite, which is modeled by the logical condition of a guard. If the condition of a guard does not match, the FSM remains in the last state. Finally, each state transition can have an action which specifies {{the output of the}} <b>Smart</b> <b>Charger.</b> In our case, the action defines the new charging power of the ongoing charging process.|$|E

The analysis presented demonstrates that <b>smart</b> <b>charging</b> that involves charging before departure, less frequent charging and limited vehicle-to-grid can prolong battery life compared with providing the same EV charge in an uncontrolled way.

40|$|Abstract—Measuring and attesting to the {{operational}} integrity and security posture of a mobile device is challenging. Today, smart phones and tablet computers lack {{a number of}} traditional security features that have emerged for commodity laptops and desktops. In addition to restricted power, mobile devices generally don’t have a hardware root-of-trust and currently lack ubiquitous virtualization capability, which limits some of today’s approaches to security. Even as these security mechanisms reemerge for mobile devices, no single one {{is expected to be}} a “silver bullet. ” We believe that the need to recharge these mobile devices can be exploited with the introduction of a hygienic <b>smart</b> <b>charger</b> concept. The charger is used to measure, attest, and remediate the integrity of hosted mobile devices via the Universal Serial Bus (USB), while the mobile device re-charges.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{harmonic current}} compensation {{of the constant}} DC-capacitor voltage-control (CDCVC) -based strategy of smart chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) in single-phase three-wire distribution feeders (SPTWDFs) under nonlinear load conditions. The basic principle of the CDCVC-based harmonics compensation strategy under nonlinear load conditions is discussed in detail. The instantaneous power flowing into the three-leg pulse-width modulated (PWM) rectifier, which performs as a <b>smart</b> <b>charger,</b> shows that the CDCVC-based strategy achieves balanced and sinusoidal source currents with a unity power factor. The CDCVC-based harmonics compensation strategy does not require any calculation blocks of fundamental reactive, unbalanced active, and harmonic currents. Thus, the authors propose a simplified algorithm to compensate for reactive, unbalanced active, and harmonic currents. A digital computer simulation is implemented to confirm the validity and high practicability of the CDCVC-based harmonics compensation strategy using PSIM software. Simulation results demonstrate that balanced and sinusoidal source currents with a unity power factor in SPTWDFs are obtained on the secondary side of the pole-mounted distribution transformer (PMDT) during both the battery-charging and discharging operations in EVs, compensating for the reactive, unbalanced active, and harmonic currents...|$|E
