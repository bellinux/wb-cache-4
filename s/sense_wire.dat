40|$|Introduction The central {{tracking}} detector of the KLOE experiment {{will be a}} large cylindrical drift chamber, 4 m {{in diameter}} and 3. 3 m in length, with almost square cells arranged in circular layers of alternate stereo angles. It has been fully described in the Addendum to the KLOE Technical Proposal [1]. Some prototypes of this large chamber were studied in the past. The first prototype (prototype 0) was a cylindrical chamber with 42 quasi hexagonal cells about 4 m long. Results are reported in [2]. In 1993 two small prototypes were tested at P. S. I. (Zurich). They had 25 cells instrumented out of 49. The almost square cells (2 x 2 cm 2) were realized with a different structure: 3 field wires for each <b>sense</b> <b>wire</b> in prototype 0. 1 (Rfs= 3 :l), 2 field wires for each <b>sense</b> <b>wire</b> in prototype 0. 2 (Rfs= 2 :l).

50|$|A new drift chamber, DR2, {{was built}} to replace the {{original}} drift chamber. The new drift chamber had the same outer radius as the original one {{so that it could}} be installed before the rest of the CLEO II upgrades were ready. DR2 was a 51 layer detector, with a 000+000- axial/stereo layer arrangement. DR2 had only one layer of field wires between each layer of <b>sense</b> <b>wires,</b> allowing many more layers to fit in the allotted space. The axial <b>sense</b> <b>wires</b> had a half-cell stagger to help resolve the left-right ambiguity of the original drift chamber. The inner and outer field layers of the chamber were cathode strips to make measurements of the longitudinal coordinate of tracks. DR2 was also designed to make dE/dx measurements in addition to tracking measurements.|$|R
50|$|The UA1 was a {{huge and}} complex {{detector}} for its day. It {{was designed as a}} general-purpose detector.The detector was a 6-chamber cylindrical assembly 5.8 m long and 2.3 m in diameter, the largest imaging drift chamber of its day. It recorded the tracks of charged particles curving in a 0.7 Tesla magnetic field, measuring their momentum, the sign of their electric charge and their rate of energy loss (dE/dx). Atoms in the argon-ethane gas mixture filling the chambers were ionised by the passage of charged particles. The electrons which were released drifted along an electric field shaped by field wires and were collected on <b>sense</b> <b>wires.</b> The geometrical arrangement of the 17000 field <b>wires</b> and 6125 <b>sense</b> <b>wires</b> allowed a spectacular 3-D interactive display of reconstructed physics events to be produced.|$|R
50|$|Outside of {{the silicon}} {{detector}}, the central outer tracker works {{in much the}} manner as the silicon detector as it {{is also used to}} track the paths of charged particles and is also located within a magnetic field. The COT, however, is not made of silicon. Silicon is tremendously expensive and is not practical to purchase in extreme quantities. COT is a gas chamber filled {{with tens of thousands of}} gold wires arranged in layers and argon gas. Two types of wires are used in the COT: <b>sense</b> <b>wires</b> and field <b>wires.</b> <b>Sense</b> <b>wires</b> are thinner and attract the electrons that are released by the argon gas as it is ionized. The field wires are thicker than the <b>sense</b> <b>wires</b> and attract the positive ions formed from the release of electrons. There are 96 layers of wire and each wire is placed approximately 3.86 mm apart from one another. As in the silicon detector, when a charged particle passes through the chamber it ionizes the gas. This signal is then carried to a nearby wire, which is then carried to the computers for read-out. The COT is approximately 3.1 m long and extends from r = 40 cm to r = 137 cm. Although the COT is not nearly as precise as the silicon detector, the COT has a hit position resolution of 140 μm and a momentum resolution of 0.0015 (GeV/c)−1.|$|R
