5|$|Into Temptation {{is also a}} {{story of}} {{redemption}}, both for Linda, who is seeking redemption {{for a life of}} sin and prostitution, and for Father John, who is seeking redemption for his failure to help Linda and his own doubts about religion and priesthood. At the start of the film, Father John appears to be questioning his duty to the church and its dwindling congregation; this is especially demonstrated when he appears bored during confession and does crossword puzzles to pass the time. Such struggles are not uncommon in priesthood. But after he resists the church boundaries and attempts to help Linda, his faith in the congregation and belief in the profession are restored, and he returns to the church a stronger and more content priest. The film demonstrates the power of compassion and individual kindness, particularly in the way that John's simple act of defending Linda during her childhood was such a profound moment in her life. The film also advocates repentance, and the extent of Linda's victimization can be interpreted as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> catastrophic an unrepentant life can be.|$|E

For his expansionist policy, however, he had to reorganize the army to include, albeit in a subordinate position of light infantry, all {{ethnic groups in the}} kingdom.

25|$|In 1366, so {{that the}} English Crown could assert its {{authority}} over the settlers, a parliament was assembled in Kilkenny and the Statute of Kilkenny was enacted. The statute decreed that intermarriage between English settlers and Irish natives was forbidden. It also forbade the settlers using the Irish language and adopting Irish modes of dress or other customs, as such practices were already common. The adoption of Gaelic Brehon property law, in particular, undermined the feudal nature of the Lordship. The Act was never implemented successfully, even in the Pale itself, and was a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Ireland was withdrawing from English cultural norms.|$|E

He abstained against attempts by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to exclude Sinn Féin from office in July 2000 and October 2001. In April 2001, he provoked a direct political attack from the DUP over him being the only Unionist to vote against a motion condemning the display of lilies commemorating the 1916 Easter Uprising at Parliament Buildings.

The last edition of the Green Book included significant changes that reflected the post-Civil Rights Act outlook. The title was changed to Traveler's Green Book: International Edition – no longer just for the Negro, or the motorist – as its publishers sought to widen its appeal.

Despite this he was offered a few engagements and had been voted the most recognisable Englishman among Americans in a poll which also featured Laurence Olivier, Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde-White. As a result, he secured a lucrative advertising contract with the Ford Motor Company. Derek Jarman offered Terry-Thomas a role in his 1979 film The Tempest, but the actor was forced to pull out because of his deteriorating health.|$|E

30|$|It is also {{important}} to think of the coordination of the frames. Indeed, we think of structures and symbols most meaningfully together as a pair. The structures are the visible <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> a culture works, but the symbols determine how the structures are actually enacted. As such, the two are inextricably linked. Similarly, people and power are related as a pair.

This is not to imply that the frames are not related in other ways, only that we see these pairings as particularly salient.

2500|$|Dieppe was in {{many ways}} a victory for German propaganda. The Third Reich largely {{described}} the Dieppe raid as a military joke, noting the amount of time needed to design such an attack, combined with the incredible losses suffered by the Allies, pointed only to incompetence. The propaganda value of German material regarding the raid was enhanced by the fact that British official information was slow in being published. [...] This meant that Allied media were forced to carry announcements from German sources. These attempts were made to rally the morale of the German people despite the growing intensity of the Allied strategic bombing campaign on German cities, and large daily casualties on the Eastern Front. Marshal Philippe Pétain of France wrote Adolf Hitler a public letter congratulating him on the Wehrmacht's recent victory in repulsing this latest act of [...] "British aggression" [...] against France as Pétain dubbed the Dieppe raid. Pétain's only regret was that French forces had played no role in halting the attack and he suggested that staff talks begin between Germany and Vichy France to allow the French to play their part in defending their homeland. Hitler had no interest in allowing the return of French forces to the Atlantic coast where they had been barred ever since the armistice of 22 June 1940, so nothing came of Pétain's suggestion of Franco-German staff talks against the Allies, but his letter was given much media attention in both Germany and France as a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the French people allegedly appreciated Germany's efforts to defend them from les Anglo-Saxons. Pétain's letter was later to become a prime exhibit for the prosecution at his trial for high treason in 1945.

2500|$|The accord over Transnistria's administration, {{signed in}} Tighina, also placed areas between the Dniester and the Dnieper under Romanian {{military}} occupation, while granting control over all resources to Germany. In September 1941, Antonescu ordered Romanian forces to take Odessa, a prize he badly wanted {{for reasons of}} prestige. Russians had traditionally been seen in Romania as brutal aggressors, and for Romanian forces to take a major Soviet city {{and one of the}} largest Black Sea ports like Odessa would be a <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> far Romania had been [...] "regenerated" [...] under Antonescu's leadership. Much to Antonescu's intense fury, the Red Army were able to halt the Romanian offensive on Odessa and 24 September 1941 Antonescu had to reluctantly ask for the help of the Wehrmacht with the drive on Odessa. On 16 October 1941 Odessa fell to the German-Romanian forces. The Romanian losses had been so heavy that the area around Odessa was known to the Romanian Army as the Vale of Tears. Antonescu's anti-Semitism was sharpened by the Odessa fighting as he was convinced that the only reason why the Red Army had fought so fiercely around Odessa was that the average Russian soldier had been terrorized by bloodthirsty Jewish commissars into fighting hard. When Wilhelm Filderman wrote a letter to Antonescu complaining about the murder of Jews in Odessa, Antonescu wrote back: [...] "Your Jews, who have become Soviet commissars, are driving Soviet soldiers in the Odessa region into a futile bloodbath, through horrendous terror techniques as the Russian prisoners themselves have admitted, simply to cause us heavy losses". Antonescu ended his letter with the claim that Russian Jewish commissars had savagely tortured Romanian POWs and that the entire Jewish community of Romania, Filderman included were morally responsible for all of the losses and sufferings of the Romanians around Odessa. [...] In the fall of 1941, Antonescu planned to deport all of the Jews of the Regat, southern Bukovina and southern Transylvania into Transnistria as the prelude to killing them, but this operation was vetoed by Germany, who complained that Antonescu had not finished killing the Jews of Transistria yet. This veto was largely motivated by bureaucratic politics, namely if Antonescu exterminated all of the Jews of Romania himself, there would be nothing for the SS and the Auswärtiges Amt to do. Killinger informed Antonescu that Germany would reduce its supplies of arms if Antonescu went ahead with his plans to deport the Jews of the Regat into Transnistria and told him he would be better off deporting the Jews to the death camps in Poland that the Germans were already busy building. Since Romania had almost no arms industry of its own and was almost entirely dependent upon weapons from Germany to fight the war, Antonescu had little choice, but to comply with Killinger's request.|$|E
