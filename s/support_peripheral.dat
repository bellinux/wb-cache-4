In the tradition of these spaces, upstairs <b>supports</b> <b>peripheral</b> awareness between non-colocated spaces but is follow-ing a different approach. upstairs is not built to tear down the physical borders, it is meant to weaken them. Instead of creating a large single space we use the metaphor of wall-diffused noises as they are known from neighbours living upstairs or next door. When sharing a space, we are subconsciously aware of other people’s activities, mainly because of their interaction with the environment.

Notably, peripheral distortion in supporting awareness may cause problematic interactions with and through the virtual world; and extended representations of actions may still allow problems in re-assembling the composition of others' actions. We discuss the potential for: designing representations for distorted peripheral perception; and explicitly displaying the course of action in objectfocused interaction...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{capacity}} of Schwann cells to <b>support</b> <b>peripheral</b> nerve regeneration, functional recovery after nerve injuries is frequently poor, especially for proximal injuries that require regenerating axons to grow over long distances to reinnervate distal targets. Nerve transfers, where small fascicles from an adjacent intact nerve are coapted to the nerve stump of a nearby denervated muscle, allow for functional return but {{at the expense of}} reduced numbers of innervating nerves. A 1 -hour period of 20 Hz electrical nerve stimulation via electrodes proximal to an injury site accelerates axon outgrowth to hasten target reinnervation in rats and humans, even after delayed surgery. A novel strategy of enticing donor axons from an otherwise intact nerve to grow through small nerve grafts (cross-bridges) into a denervated nerve stump, promotes improved axon regeneration after delayed nerve repair. The efficacy of this technique has been demonstrated in a rat model and is now in clinical use in patients undergoing cross-face nerve grafting for facial paralysis. In conclusion, brief electrical stimulation, combined with the surgical technique of promoting the regeneration of some donor axons to ′protect′ chronically denervated Schwann cells, improves nerve regeneration and, in turn, functional outcomes in the management of peripheral nerve injuries...|$|E

This study surveys postoperative residual curarization and critical respiratory events in the recovery room, {{as well as the}} clinical approach to PORC of anesthesiologists in our institution. MethodsThis observational study included 415 patients who received general anesthesia with intermediate-acting NMBDs. Anesthesia was maintained by non-participating anesthesiologists who were blinded to the study. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed upon arrival in the recovery room. A CRE was defined as requiring airway <b>support,</b> <b>peripheral</b> oxygen saturation 20 breaths/min, accessory muscle usage, difficulty with swallowing or speaking, and requiring reintubation. The clinical approach of our anesthesiologists toward reversal agents was examined using an 8 -question mini-survey shortly after the study. ResultsThe incidence of PORC was 43 % (n= 179) for TOFR < 0. 9, and 15 % (n= 61) for TOFR < 0. 7. The incidence of TOFR < 0. 9 was significantly higher in women, in those with ASA physical status 3, and with anesthesia of short duration (p< 0. 05). In addition, 66 % (n= 272) of the 415 patients arriving at the recovery room had received neostigmine. A TOFR < 0. 9 was found in 46 % (n= 126) of the patients receiving neostigmine.

40|$|Context:Although decidual natural killer (NK) cell {{accumulation}} and vascular remodeling {{are critical}} {{steps to ensure}} successful pregnancy, the molecular mechanisms controlling these events are poorly defined. Objective:Herein we analyzed whether chemerin, a recently identified chemoattractant involved in many pathophysiological processes, could be expressed in the uterine compartment and could regulate events relevant for the good outcome of pregnancy. Design:Chemerin expression in human primary culture of stromal (ST) cells, extravillous trophoblast cells, and decidual endothelial cells (DEC) was analyzed by RT-PCR, ELISA, and Western blot. Migration through ST or DEC of peripheral blood and decidual (d) NK cells from pregnant women was performed using a transwell assay. A DEC capillary-like tube formation assay {{was used to evaluate}} endothelial morphogenesis. Results:Chemerin is differentially expressed by decidual cells during early pregnancy being present at high levels in ST and extravillous trophoblast cells but not in DEC. Notably, ST cells from pregnant women exhibit and release higher levels of chemerin as compared with ST cells from menopausal or fertile nonpregnant women. Chemerin can <b>support</b> <b>peripheral</b> blood NK cell migration through both DEC and ST cells. Although dNK cells exhibit lower chemerin receptor (CMKLR 1) expression than their blood counterpart, CMKLR 1 engagement on dNK cells resulted in both ERK activation and migration through decidual ST cells. Interestingly, DEC also express CMKLR 1 and undergo ERK activation and capillary-like tube structure formation upon exposure to chemerin. Conclusions:Our data indicate that chemerin is up-regulated during decidualization and might contribute to NK cell accumulation and vascular remodeling during early pregnancy...|$|E
