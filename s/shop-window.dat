25|$|The Rupert Bear Museum {{was opened}} in 2003 with a £500,000 Heritage Lottery Fund grant. The creator of Rupert Bear, Mary Tourtel, {{grew up and}} {{attended}} art school in Canterbury, and a 1921 first-edition Rupert annual {{is one of the}} exhibits. The Rupert Bear Museum involves activities for children on the themes of play, entertainment and education. It includes the Bagpuss and Clangers display with items from the original television shows, such as the Emily <b>shop-window</b> from the opening scene of Bagpuss, because its creators Peter Firmin and Oliver Postgate filmed the programmes at Firmin's house near Canterbury.|$|E
2500|$|... "Plain Language from Truthful James" [...] (or [...] "The Heathen Chinee") {{was very}} popular among general readers. One New York {{newspaper}} {{reported on the}} frenzy over the poem: [...] "Strolling down Broadway... we saw a crowd of men and boys, {{of high and low}} degree, swarming about a <b>shop-window,</b> pushing, laughing, and struggling... Elbowing our way through the crowd, we discovered an illustrated copy of Bret Harte's poem 'The Heathen Chinee.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, he left Žetva and, {{together}} with Verica Todorović, formed the band Rani Mraz (Early Frost). The band had its début at the 1978 music festival in Opatija {{with the song}} [...] "Moja prva ljubav" [...] ("My First Love"). Rani Mraz had unsteady lineup, but managed to gain huge popularity with Balašević's pop rock-oriented songs released on 7" [...] singles. During 1978, former Suncokret members Biljana Krstić and Bora Đorđević joined the band (forming the most famous Rani Mraz lineup), and together they recorded [...] "Računajte na nas" [...] ("Count on Us"), written by Balašević, a song which celebrated the youth's adoption of the communist revolution. The song became popular with both the communist authorities and the people, becoming an anthem of the Yugoslav youth. After just few months of cooperation, Verica Todorović and Bora Đorđević left the band (Đorđević forming his famous hard rock band Riblja Čorba), so Biljana Krstić and Balašević recorded Rani Mraz's first album Mojoj mami umesto maturske slike u izlogu (To my Mom instead of Prom Photo in the <b>Shop-Window)</b> {{with the help of}} studio musicians.|$|E
60|$|Towards the afternoon, on the seventeenth, I {{went out}} alone {{to get a}} breath of fresh air, and a look at the <b>shop-windows.</b> I don't care who or what she may be--high or low; {{handsome}} or ugly; young or old--it always relieves a woman's mind to look at the <b>shop-windows.</b>|$|R

50|$|SMD LED modules {{are widely}} used, in LED lamps, for backlighting, home illumination, <b>shop-windows,</b> advertising, {{automobile}} interior lighting, Christmas lights, and numerous lighting applications.|$|R
60|$|Turning {{from his}} companions while they conversed, {{he looked into}} a <b>shop-window.</b>|$|E
60|$|Strange fancies held him. He {{stood for}} an hour at a time looking at his face in a <b>shop-window.</b>|$|E
60|$|So Hepzibah {{put forth}} her lank arm, and, taking the effigy from the <b>shop-window,</b> {{delivered}} {{it to her}} first customer.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the boys}} began {{examining}} their stock, finding beautiful things, {{such as they}} had admired from outside <b>shop-windows,</b> but never believed they should really own.|$|R
60|$|In a subdued tone, as he sauntered {{along the}} crowded street, which {{by that time}} was blazing with gas-light in the <b>shop-windows</b> and oil-lamps on the hucksters' barrows.|$|R
50|$|Colin meets Chloé {{and they}} {{walk along the}} streets. Terrified by the absurd <b>shop-windows</b> {{they went to the}} forest where {{surrounded}} by the pink cloud they are invisible for other people.|$|R
60|$|Nello {{had been}} {{thrumming}} the lute as he half {{sat on the}} board against the <b>shop-window,</b> and kept an outlook towards the piazza.|$|E
6000|$|... "Into {{innocent}} British homes?" [...] Maud {{tried to}} remember. [...] "I believe I brought three--seeing {{them in a}} <b>shop-window</b> as I passed through town. It never rains but it pours! But I've already read two." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Elder thundered his answer, {{while the}} others nodded, solemnly and in tune, like a <b>shop-window</b> of {{flexible}} toys, comic mandarins and judges and ducks and clowns, set quivering by a breeze from the open door: ...|$|E
60|$|The rigid, sombre, ugly cathedral was {{settling}} {{under the}} gloom of the coming night, {{as they entered the}} narrow town, the golden lights showed like slabs of revelation, in the <b>shop-windows.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And so, because I {{preferred}} {{to ride a}} mile with him to see something real that had happened, and tried to be useful instead of looking in <b>shop-windows</b> in Main Street or promenading before the hotel"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Trimblett’s a terror," [...] {{he said in}} {{a serene}} voice, turning to Hartley. [...] "I don’t know what it’s like walking down the High Street looking into <b>shop-windows</b> with a fretful porcupine; but I can make a pretty good guess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Gerald. [...] "How {{funny that}} is, Lionel. But I'll tell you what, {{we will get}} Walter to take us out, and we shall be sure to see {{something}} famous, in some <b>shop-window</b> or other." ...|$|E
60|$|Anon, {{there was}} an encounter, just at the door-step, betwixt two laboring men, as their rough voices denoted them to be. After some slight talk about their own affairs, one of them chanced to notice the <b>shop-window,</b> and {{directed}} the other's attention to it.|$|E
60|$|The boarding-master {{leaned against}} the <b>shop-window</b> and {{regarded}} him dumbly. There was a twinkle in the shipbroker's eyes which irritated him almost beyond endurance, and in the doorway Mr. Kybird--his face mottled with the intensity of his emotions--stood an unwelcome and frantic witness of his shame.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Arnold, you greatly underrate the {{existing}} {{resources of the}} trade in hair! Look into the <b>shop-windows.</b> When you next go to London pray look into the show-windows. In the mean time, {{what do you think}} of my niece's figure?" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was quite}} dark without, {{except in the}} {{immediate}} neighbourhood of the feeble street-lamps, and before a few <b>shop-windows</b> which had been hardily kept open {{in spite of the}} obvious unlikelihood of any chance customer traversing the muddy thoroughfares at that hour.|$|R
60|$|The lamps {{had been}} lighted {{for some time}} next night, and the <b>shop-windows</b> were pouring forth their bright rays, making the streets appear as light as day, when Willie {{found himself in the}} small disreputable street near London Bridge in which Cattley the clown dwelt.|$|R
60|$|Saton {{descended the}} stairs quickly. On the {{threshold}} of the door he paused, with the apparent object of lighting a cigarette. His eyes travelled up and down the street. Looking into a <b>shop-window</b> a few yards away, was the man whom he had found with Violet.|$|E
60|$|She {{pointed to}} the name of Pratt over a <b>shop-window</b> {{in a house that}} had once seen better days, but which looked so forlorn, that Mr. Kendal would not look the slatternly maid in the face while so absurd a {{question}} was asked as whether Mr. O'More lived there.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take {{it as you}} like, Cousin Jaffrey," [...] muttered {{the maiden}} lady, as she drew back, after {{cautiously}} thrusting out her head, and looking {{up and down the}} street,--"Take it as you like! You have seen my little <b>shop-window.</b> Well!--what have you to say?--is not the Pyncheon House my own, while I'm alive?" ...|$|E
60|$|Arrived at Paris, {{and resting}} there three days, Mr Dorrit strolled {{much about the}} streets alone, looking in at the <b>shop-windows,</b> and {{particularly}} the jewellers' windows. Ultimately, {{he went into the}} most famous jeweller's, and said he wanted to buy a little gift for a lady.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{rectangular}} two-stored building with gable roof and pointed pediment at abutting ends. It has {{two rows of}} merchant cells formed by massive arcades from two lengthwise faces. Shallow rectangular niches in walls contain doors and <b>shop-windows</b> and they are opposite to intervals between arch pillars.|$|R
50|$|Subsequently, Pascale {{became the}} head fabric buyer for women's {{ready-to-wear}} at Hermès, {{which lead to}} her becoming a press attaché and thence head of advertising and public relations. These assignments were followed by her creating a department of exhibitions. Subsequently, she set up and directed the <b>shop-windows</b> department.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Myself?' Johnnie looked up, bewildered, {{but with}} a sudden thought, 'Oh! I know, Aunt Theodora, won't it buy that pretty work-basket to give mamma on her birthday? She said she could not afford it. And Helen wanted the great donkey in the <b>shop-window.</b> Oh! I can get Helen the great donkey; thank you, Aunt Nesbit!' ...|$|E
60|$|Christened 'The Little Rifle,' and {{displayed}} outside a <b>shop-window,</b> {{it would make}} the fortune of any retail business in Holborn. When he had shown himself and talked a little while, he withdrew with his pocket-instrument, and went bobbing down the cabin, among men of six feet high and upwards, like a light-house walking among lamp-posts.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} he was grown angry, and said he, [...] "I have no engagement," [...] and he put his back to the <b>shop-window.</b> Each of us was doggedly {{determined}} to tire the other out, and we must have looked ridiculous. We also felt it, for ten minutes afterward, our passions having died away, we shook hands cordially and agreed to call hansoms.|$|E
60|$|But she was not. She had no sailor lover. What she was {{thinking}} of was that at about this time they would be lighting up the <b>shop-windows</b> in London, and that of all the deadly, depressing spots she had ever visited this village of Millbourne was the deadliest.|$|R
60|$|It is evening now. The snow {{is still}} on the ground; but it looks ruddy and warm in the streets, because of the blaze of light from the <b>shop-windows,</b> and it looks colder than it did on the house-tops, by reason of the moon which sails in the wintry sky.|$|R
60|$|Gorman {{tried to}} {{extinguish}} the light, {{but it was}} a fire that would not be put out. He cursed the <b>shop-windows</b> and the lamps for shining so brightly on him; he cursed the few people whose curiosity induced them to pause and look back at him, and he cursed himself for being such a fool.|$|R
