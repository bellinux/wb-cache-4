40|$|The {{capacity}} to reach {{every person in}} a community {{is one of the}} major goals for emergency preparedness and response. The goal of emergency health communication is to rapidly get the right information to the entire population so that they are able to make the right choices for their health and safety. To do this, a community must know what subgroups make up its population, where the people in these groups live and work, and how they best receive information. Although knowing this type of information might seem obvious, many jurisdictions have not yet begun the process to define or locate their at-risk populations. To maintain consistency with the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA), this workbook uses the term "at-risk populations" to describe individuals or groups whose needs are not fully addressed by traditional service providers or who feel they cannot comfortably or safely use the standard resources offered during preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. These groups include people who are physically or mentally disabled (e. g., blind, deaf, hard-of-hearing, have learning disabilities, mental illness or mobility limitations), people with limited English language <b>skills,</b> <b>geographically</b> or culturally isolated people, homeless people, senior citizens, and children. Regardless of terminology, trust plays a critical role in reaching at-risk populations. Reaching people through trusted channels has shown to be much more effective than through mainstream channels. For some people, trusted information comes more readily from within their communities than from external sources. This document describes a process that will help planners to define, locate, and reach at-risk populations in an emergency. Additional tools are included to provide resources for more inclusive communication planning that will offer time-saving assistance for state, local, tribal, and territorial public health and emergency management planners in their efforts to reach at-risk populations in day-to-day communication and during emergency situations. If you follow the process outlined in this document, you will begin to develop a Community Outreach Information Network (COIN) [...] a grassroots network of people and trusted leaders who can help with emergency response planning and delivering information to at-risk populations in emergencies. Building a strong network of individuals who are invested in their community's well-being, who are prepared and willing to help, and who have the ability to respond in an emergency is just the start. You must also include network members in your emergency preparedness planning, test the capacity of your COIN to disseminate information through preparedness exercises, and make changes to your preparedness plans based on the evaluation of those exercises.

40|$|The rise of {{distributed}} collaborative environments {{has brought}} about new opportunities for bringing together the experience and <b>skills</b> of <b>geographically</b> dispersed employees towards joint goals. However, {{the extent to which}} collaborative technologies can be used to mobilise distributed knowledge and skills remains illusive. The Intellectual Bandwidth model posits that an organization’s potential to create value is determined by its intellectual assets and collaboration capabilities. While this is a powerful assertion, and has been demonstrated theoretically, the link between the mobilisation of intellectual resources through collaborative technologies has yet to be linked in practise. This paper investigates the use of collaborative technologies in a distributed organization and provides insight into the processes that enable intellectual bandwidth to be mobilised. Its contribution lies in uncovering the missing links between collaboration and the use of knowledge resources to create value. 1...|$|R
40|$|Notions of <b>skill</b> are <b>geographically</b> and {{historically}} specific; migration regimes, professional regulations and national policies influence possibilities of effective validation of migrant knowledge abroad. Migration scholars convincingly demonstrate how migrants actively circumvent national requirements {{to fit into}} the dominant culture of the society of residence while preserving their own identities. Yet, without exception, social inequalities research exclusively addresses the integration of migrants into the receiving context, taking skills as a fixed attribute migrants simply ‘bring with them’. I argue that the context of origin of migrants for skill acquisition and validation during the migration process needs to be considered as well. The way skills are defined, acquired and valorised in the country of origin has an influence on how migrants mobilise them in the receiving society and on how they perceive their chances for negotiating strong positions in the labour market of the host country. The article draws on a study of Polish migrants to the UK with secondary and tertiary educational certificates who work in routine or semi-routine occupations. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} and compare multi-objective and weighted single objective approaches {{to a real}} world workforce scheduling problem. For this difficult problem we consider the trade off in solution quality versus population diversity, for different sets of fixed objective weights. Our real-world workforce scheduling problem consists of assigning resources with the appropriate <b>skills</b> to <b>geographically</b> dispersed task locations while satisfying time window constraints. The problem is NP-Hard and contains the Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) as a sub problem. We investigate a genetic algorithm and serial schedule generation scheme together with various multi-objective approaches. We show that multi-objective genetic algorithms can create solutions whose fitness is within 2 % of genetic algorithms using weighted sum objectives even though the multi-objective approaches know nothing of the weights. The result is highly significant for complex real-world problems where objective weights are seldom known in advance since it suggests that a multi-objective approach can generate a solution close to the user preferred one without having knowledge of user preferences. ...|$|R
40|$|Almost all survey {{interviews}} are now {{conducted using}} {{some type of}} computer-assisted interviewing (CAI) software. However, unless CAI instrument design and usability are considered, even the most carefully worded questions can yield questionable data. Ample evidence exists that usability is enhanced when user needs are considered early and continuously throughout the software development process. In the development of complex computer-assisted interviewing instruments, this means bringing interviewers into the development process as soon as possible. But developing complex CAI applications poses special demands, because interviewers are often highly diverse in computer <b>skills</b> and <b>geographically</b> scattered, which makes obtaining their input more challenging. This paper discusses different approaches {{that have been used}} to address instrument design and to incorporate user-centered design principles into the development of complex computer assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) instruments. Examples from the Consumer Expenditure Quarterly Interview and the Commodity & Services Pricing survey will be cited. Besides describing possible approaches {{that could be used to}} encourage user-centered design, this paper will also present evaluation instruments and methods that have been used to quantify the success of usability-design efforts...|$|R
40|$|A {{framework}} for web-based collaborative teaching has been created. This framework is implemented as an ecological modeling course ([URL] {{but should be}} flexible enough to apply to other disciplines. I have developed a series of tools to facilitate interactive communication between students and instructors, and among students taking the course. The course content consists of reading materials that describe the theory of systems analysis and modeling, guidelines on how models can be built, and numerous examples and illustrations. The interactive part includes exercises that can be discussed with and evaluated by the instructor, and provides a means to mimic class discussions. To what extent this approach can replace conventional in-class tutoring {{has yet to be}} tested, but the preliminary applications show great promise. I offer this course format as a framework and a prototype for collaborative "open-source" approaches to education, in which the web provides the means to communicate knowledge and <b>skills</b> asynchronously between <b>geographically</b> dispersed educators and students...|$|R
40|$|Examining committee: Richard Margerum, chair, Michael HibbardThe {{national}} trail {{system is}} a network of scenic, historic, and recreation trails that crisscross the United States. These trails provide recreational, educational, and economic benefits to the American people. The national trail system continues to expand in size and complexity, yet little research explores how these trails are built. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to inform the development of new national trails through an examination of the Anza Trail—a long distance national trail in the early stages of development. This paper provides a systematic look at the challenges and keys to success in recreational trail building at a multi-state scale. 18 interviews were conducted in three states with a variety of public and private representatives who collectively held over 190 years of experience in long distance trail building. The paper describes how paid practitioners and volunteers are responding to challenges involving the scale of the effort, its limited popularity, and scarce resources. The paper concludes with recommendations for government agencies and nonprofits involved with national trails. First, a handful of committed volunteers can have a powerful influence on a trail building effort, even at a multi-state scale. But, federal agencies should make proactive investments in nonprofit “friends groups” from the outset to ensure progress is sustainable. Second, federal trail managers can most effectively support trail building efforts when they possess collaborative leadership <b>skills</b> and <b>geographically</b> position themselves to serve the largest possible span of trail supporters. Third, “momentum” is an important concept in these volunteer-driven efforts. Long periods of inaction, especially during the planning phase, can cause enthusiasm and support to dissolve. Finally, decisions about how to begin the implementation phase have far reaching consequences. One effective trail building strategy is to follow the path of least resistance by making maximum use of the “assets” already on the ground...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project examines {{whether the new}} 4 -year curriculum is for local student development {{in the future and}} internationalization is the primary espouse of the reform. 8 in-depth interviews were conducted in five local universities. Student development is framed from a multi-functional mindset in which students get exposed to all kinds of possibilities, expand their intellectual thinking and capabilities as well as become self-reflective. There are changes in student demographics, workplace environment, social convergence and intercultural tolerance. The urge of graduates with global mindset, higher-order thinking and multiple <b>skill</b> sets is <b>geographically</b> indivisible. In elaborating on the findings, internationalization is one of the factors leading to student all-roundedness, the centrality of the curriculum reform. Realizing that there was learning experience re-conceptualization, participants evaluated the reform tended to be structural and administrative. There is little spared time for university teachers’ inspirations on students inside or even outside classrooms. But governmental and institutional foci are still put on more research than teaching in which participants were disheartened. A structural change could help little. In a long run, a revolution on the university teaching to wholly facilitate student development is vitally essential. To inspire students to be self-reflective and have sustainable growth, university teaching staff needs time for inspiring works and interdisciplinary co-operations. Too many research and administrative burdens hinders teaching practices, even though teachers are passionate. It is time for the government, UGC, universities and individual professors to put all small pieces together and make the current reform in a more holistic way. published_or_final_versionEducationMasterMaster of Educatio...|$|R
