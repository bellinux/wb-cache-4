40|$|To {{improve the}} comfort of {{hospital}} patients, we have developed a new open-type magnetically shielded room (MSR) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), constructed by stacking square cylinders composed of magnetic material {{on the inside and}} a conductive material on the outside. The magnetic cylinder shields against leakage of the magnetic field from the MRI, while the conductive outer cylinder prevents intrusion of the electromagnetic field from outside by waveguide attenuation. First, the optimal design of the magnetic cylinder was determined, using 3 -D magnetic field analysis with a simple cubic MSR. Second, the validity of the analysis and the practical realization of the designed MSR were investigated using a small experimental model. Finally, from a design perspective and the standpoint of saving space, the optimal combination of electromagnetically <b>shielded</b> <b>glass</b> and conductive cylinders made of aluminum was studied by measuring the electromagnetic shielding effect. As the optimal design of an open-type MSR for an MRI, we have adopted a combination of single-layered electromagnetically <b>shielded</b> <b>glass</b> together with stacked cylinders. These cylinders are made of a square cylinder, 144 × 144 mm and 300 mm long, made of silicon steel (thickness t = 1 mm) and divided into three parts along the axial direction, placed inside a second square cylinder made of aluminum, 150 × 150 mm and 300 mm long (t = mm). This MSR construction technique creates an open, spacious feeling inside the facility and can be easily fabricated at low cost...|$|E

The samples were investigated under 662 keV gamma ray and the results were compared with theoretical calculations. The values of the mass attenuation coefficient (μm), the atomic cross section (σe) and the effective atomic number (Zeff) were found to increase with an increase of the Bi 2 O 3 concentration and were in good agreement with the theoretical calculations. The best results for the half-value layer (HVL) were observed in the sample with 35 wt% of Bi 2 O 3 concentration, better than the values of barite concrete.

40|$|Abstract. Lead {{glass that}} shows a high {{refractive}} index is the best known and most popular for radiation <b>shielding</b> <b>glass.</b> Due to the toxic of lead compounds on the human organisms {{as well as the}} environmental issues, lead free glass was fabricated by using some heavy elements such as barium and bismuth to replace lead. In this study, colorless lead free glass samples were prepared from 40 wt % local quartz sand and various concentration of BaCO 3 (20 - 40 wt%) as the main compositions in order to study radiation <b>shielding</b> property. The <b>glass</b> mixtures were melted conventionally using electric furnace at the maximum temperature of 1250 °C with 4 hr dwelling time. The gamma attenuation characteristics were studied for the photon energy of 662 keV from Cs- 137. Density and refractive index were also determined. It was found that a variation of prepared glass samples can be produced both in terms of clarity and radiation shielding properties. The attenuation coefficients were linearly increased as the increase of BaCO 3 content. The density and refractive index were also increased. The linear and mass attenuation coefficients of the glass sample containing 40 wt % BaCO 3 were 0. 234 cm- 1 and 0. 0726 c...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{research}} on electromagnetic (EM) shielding has been advanced for various applications. Recently, {{researchers have been}} interested in nano-sized particles to modify electromagnetic properties of a base material. In this research, glass fiber–epoxy–nanoparticle composites (GFR nanocomposites) are fabricated using four types of nanoparticles, and their properties in electromagnetic shielding are compared. Carbon black (CB), multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), silver nanoflake (SNF), and silver nanopowder (SNP) are used as the added particles. For the visual observation of the nanocomposites, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) are used. The characteristics of EM shielding of the composites are measured using HP 8719 ES S-parameter Vector Network Analyzer System for the frequency range between 8 and 12 GHz. Composites using MWCNT and CB show outstanding shielding effect of 17 and 43 dB, respectively, but silver nanoparticles do not show significant EM shielding. In addition, change of EM shielding characteristics by the ion implantation process is observed. After ion implantation, the EM shielding of the composites containing silver is increased in the frequency range.
