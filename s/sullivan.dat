5|$|In {{reaction}} to the ordered hit, <b>Sullivan</b> begins robbing banks that hold Capone’s money, hoping to trade it for Connor. <b>Sullivan</b> is impeded when the mob withdraws its money, so he visits Rooney's accountant Alexander Rance at his hotel. The encounter is a set-up, with Rance stalling <b>Sullivan</b> until Maguire enters with a shotgun. In the ensuing crossfire, Rance is killed, Maguire is injured by flying glass shards, and <b>Sullivan</b> escapes with the ledgers; as <b>Sullivan</b> flees, Maguire shoots him in his left arm.|$|E
5|$|Later one night, cloaked by {{darkness}} and rain, <b>Sullivan</b> dispatches Rooney's entire entourage with his Thompson submachine gun and walks directly up to Rooney. As Rooney mutters {{that he is}} glad his killer is <b>Sullivan,</b> a reluctant <b>Sullivan</b> pulls the trigger. Seeing no further reason to protect Connor, Nitti reveals his location, after making <b>Sullivan</b> promise to end the feud. <b>Sullivan</b> goes to the hotel where Connor is hiding and kills him.|$|E

5|$|In 1866, <b>Sullivan</b> {{composed}} a one-act comic opera, Cox and Box, {{which is still}} widely performed. His most successful orchestral work, the Overture di Ballo, premiered in 1870. Sullivan's talent and native charm earned him many friends in musical and social circles, including Queen Victoria's son Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. In 1871, <b>Sullivan</b> wrote his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, Thespis. <b>Sullivan</b> then produced his Festival Te Deum (1872), an oratorio, The Light of the World (1873), and incidental music for West End productions of several Shakespeare plays. He also had conducting and academic appointments. In 1875, producer Richard D'Oyly Carte reunited Gilbert and <b>Sullivan</b> to create a one-act piece, Trial by Jury, which was a surprise hit. Their 1878 opera H.M.S. Pinafore became an international sensation, as did The Pirates of Penzance (1879) and Patience (1881). <b>Sullivan</b> never married but had a long love affair with an American socialite, Fanny Ronalds. After {{the death of his}} brother Fred in 1877, <b>Sullivan</b> supported Fred's large family financially {{for the rest of his}} life, effectively adopting his nephew Bertie.|$|E

5|$|Star Trek {{has been}} blended with Gilbert and <b>Sullivan</b> at least twice. The North Toronto Players {{presented}} a Star Trek adaptation of Gilbert & <b>Sullivan</b> entitled H.M.S.

Pinafore {{that sets the}} operetta {{in the world of}} Star Trek has played in Los Angeles and was attended by series luminaries Nichelle Nichols, D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold. A similar blend of Gilbert and <b>Sullivan</b> and Star Trek was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009. The show was entitled Star Drek: The Generation After That. It presented an original story with Gilbert and <b>Sullivan</b> melodies.|$|E
5|$|The film also explores father-son relationships, {{not only}} between Michael <b>Sullivan</b> and his son, but between <b>Sullivan</b> and his boss, John Rooney, and between Rooney and Connor. <b>Sullivan</b> {{simultaneously}} idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son {{feels the same}} about his own father. Rooney's son, Connor, has none of Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with <b>Sullivan,</b> which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.|$|E

Meanwhile, Halsey Powell managed {{to achieve a}} steady course at five knots; and, with The <b>Sullivans,</b> she retired toward Ulithi. However, their troubles were not yet over. At 10:46 on the following day, 21 March, The <b>Sullivans</b> picked up a plane, closing from 15 mi. Visually identified as a twin-engined [...] "Frances," [...] the aircraft was taken under fire at 10000 yd by The <b>Sullivans</b> 5 inch battery.

50|$|While {{underway}} and sailing for Composite Unit Training Exercise 01-2 The <b>Sullivans</b> {{received word}} of the September 11 attacks. The <b>Sullivans,</b> {{as part of the}} Kennedy Battle Group, took part in Operation Noble Eagle. The destroyer provided air-space security along the mid-Atlantic seaboard.

5|$|The overtures {{from the}} Gilbert and <b>Sullivan</b> operas remain popular, {{and there are}} many {{recordings}} of them. Most of them are structured as a potpourri of tunes from the operas. They are generally well-orchestrated, but not all of them were composed by <b>Sullivan.</b> However, even those delegated to his assistants were based on an outline he provided, and in many cases incorporated his suggestions or corrections. <b>Sullivan</b> invariably conducted them (as well as the entire operas) on opening night, and they were included in the published scores approved by <b>Sullivan.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Sullivans</b> soon closed Halsey Powell {{to render}} {{emergency}} assistance. She {{slowed to a}} stop 11 minutes later and lowered her motor whaleboat to transfer her medical officer and a pharmacists mate to Halsey Powell, when another kamikaze {{came out of the}} skies, apparently bent on crashing into The <b>Sullivans.</b> At 16:10, the destroyers radar picked up the [...] "Zeke" [...] on its approach; and, as soon as the motor whaler was clear of the water, The <b>Sullivans</b> leapt ahead with all engines thrusting at flank speed.|$|R
5|$|While {{all four}} boroughs were formed after <b>Sullivan</b> County was established, {{seven of the}} nine townships were formed while still part of Lycoming County. The first of these was Shrewsbury Township, which {{encompassed}} all of modern <b>Sullivan</b> County when it was formed in 1803. Elkland Township was formed from Shrewsbury in 1804, as were Cherry (1824), Davidson (1833), and Forks Townships (1833). Plunketts Creek Township was formed from Franklin and Davidson Townships in 1838, and Fox Township was formed from Elkland in 1839. When <b>Sullivan</b> County was formed in 1847, both Shrewsbury and Plunketts Creek Townships were split, with each county having a township of that name. Plunketts Creek Township in <b>Sullivan</b> County {{changed its name to}} Hillsgrove Township in 1856. <b>Sullivan</b> County has no former townships, and no counties have been formed from it.|$|E
5|$|A primetime {{entertainment}} special {{was taped}} 27 January 2014 at the Ed <b>Sullivan</b> Theater with a 9 February 2014 CBS airing.

The show, titled , featured 22 classic Beatles songs as performed by various artists, which included original Beatles McCartney and Starr.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the film}} {{historian}} Denis Meikle, Robertson, Mamoulian, and Fleming's films followed a pattern set by Sullivan's play: making Hyde's evil sexual and the Jekyll-Hyde transformation central to the performance. Meikle viewed this as a deterioration of Stevenson's original narrative initiated by <b>Sullivan.</b> Later adaptations diverged from the model established by <b>Sullivan</b> and the early films; some returned to Stevenson's novella, and others spun new variations from aspects of earlier versions.|$|E
5000|$|While {{undergoing}} tender repairs alongside , The <b>Sullivans</b> formed {{part of a}} nest of destroyers {{blown away}} from the tender during a heavy storm that lashed the anchorage.

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and <b>Sullivan</b> were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and <b>Sullivan</b> would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and <b>Sullivan</b> create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
