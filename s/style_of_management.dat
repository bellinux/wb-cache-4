In subsequent seasons, following injuries to several attacking players, he adopted a more conservative 4–1–4–1 formation, in which the team's strong defensive line, further protected by Desailly, a former centre-back who was converted to a holding midfielder by Capello, provided the foundation for much of the team's success, and also gave the wingers and more creative, offensive-minded midfielders licence to attack. In the final season of his first spell at the club, Capello often rotated several of the team's attacking players {{in order to get the}} best out of each them without offsetting the balance within the team; he also abandoned the club's trademark 4–4–2 formation for a 4–3–2–1 formation at times, featuring an attacking trident that allowed the team's two offensive playmakers, Baggio and Savićević, to play alongside each other, behind the club's main striker Weah.|$|E

And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding it so difficult to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} if significant differences existed between the engagement <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> students and practicing managers. The term "engagement" is used to refer to the processes by which organizational members establish an effective relationship with important human systems of the organization i. e., superiors, peers, subordinates, political systems, and network). A secondary {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if significant differences existed between independent variables of students and managers and their engagement styles. The five student variables and six manager variables examined in this study were: Students - sex, year in college, years of fulltime employment, employment status, and age; Managers - sex, years of fulltime employment, age, number of employees in unit, type of position, and level within the organization. Development of an instrument to provide a reliable and valid measurement <b>of</b> the engagement <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> students and managers was viewed as the tertiary purpose of this study. Two methods were used to calculate the instrument's reliability. The first method involved a test-retest, while the second estimate of reliability represented internal consistency based on coefficient alpha. The construct of the instrument was validated by factor analysis. The 12 variables were intercorrelated with the final solution rotated to orthogonal simple structure using the varimax procedure. The results revealed that significant differences did exist between the engagement <b>styles</b> <b>of</b> <b>management</b> students and managers. Undergraduate management students engaged in passive and noncollaborative behaviors, while the practicing managers engaged in proactive and collaborative behaviors. The engagement <b>style</b> <b>of</b> the graduate students (fulltime and parttime) was proactive and noncollaborative and their scores fell between the undergraduate students and managers and closer to the middle of each scale. The independent variables had no significant impact on the engagement <b>style</b> <b>of</b> managers. However, year in college, years of fulltime employment, and age did have a significant impact on the engagement <b>style</b> <b>of</b> students. These results suggested that the years of fulltime employment represent a stable period in the formation <b>of</b> the engagement <b>style</b> <b>of</b> managers, while the college period represents a developmental stage and thus a unique opportunity for potential intervention...|$|R
