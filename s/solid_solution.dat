40|$|The binary {{antimonide}} compounds of the skutterudite {{family have}} a good potential for thermoelectric applications as recent results at JPL have shown. However, the room temperature thermal conductivity of these materials is about 10 Wm(sup - 1) K(sup - 1) with an 80 % contribution from the lattice. To achieve maximum ZT values, the lattice thermal conductivity needs to be lowered. Because the lattice thermal conductivity of <b>solid</b> <b>solutions</b> can substantially decrease due to the addition of point defect phonon scattering (all state-of-the-art thermoelectric materials are <b>solid</b> <b>solutions),</b> {{a study of the}} formation of <b>solid</b> <b>solutions</b> between the antimonide skutterudite compounds is of interest.

Experimental results showed that <b>solid</b> <b>solutions</b> were successfully formed {{in a wide range of}} compositions.

25|$|The {{intermetallics}} form distinct phases, usually as inclusions in a ductile <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> matrix, {{but also}} can form the matrix itself with metal inclusions or form crystalline matter with different intermetallics. Intermetallics are often hard and brittle. Finely distributed intermetallics in a ductile matrix yield a hard alloy while coarse structure gives a softer alloy.

40|$|The {{structural}} and luminescence properties of Lu x Y 1 − x BO 3 <b>solid</b> <b>solutions</b> doped with Ce 3 + or Eu+ 3 have been investigated. It {{has been found}} that the <b>solid</b> <b>solutions</b> crystallize in the vaterite phase with a lutetium concentration x < 0. 5. For a higher lutetium concentration x, the <b>solid</b> <b>solutions</b> contain an additional calcite phase with a content less than 5 wt %. The luminescence spectra are characterized by intensive impurity emission under excitation with the synchrotron radiation in the X-ray and ultraviolet spectral ranges. It has been shown that, as the lutetium concentration x in the Lu x Y 1 − x BO 3 : Ce 3 + <b>solid</b> <b>solutions</b> increases, the emission intensity smoothly decreases, which is associated with a gradual shift of the Ce 3 + 5 d(1) level toward the bottom of the conduction band, as well as with a decrease in the band gap. It has been established that, in the Lu x Y 1 − x BO 3 : Eu 3 + <b>solid</b> <b>solutions</b> with intermediate concentrations x, the efficiency of energy transfer to luminescence centers increases. This effect is explained by the limited spatial separation of electrons and holes in the <b>solid</b> <b>solutions.</b> It has been demonstrated that the calcite phase adversely affects the luminescence properties of the <b>solid</b> <b>solutions...</b>|$|R

25|$|Represented by a {{chemical}} formula. Minerals are chemical compounds, {{and as such}} they can be described by fixed or a variable formula. Many mineral groups and species are composed of a solid solution; pure substances are not usually found because of contamination or chemical substitution.

25|$|The {{magnetic}} {{structure of}} a-hematite {{was the subject}} of considerable discussion and debate in the 1950s because it appeared to be ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of around 1000 K, but with an extremely tiny magnetic moment (0.002 µB). Adding to the surprise was a transition with a decrease in temperature at around 260 K to a phase with no net magnetic moment. It was shown that the system is essentially antiferromagnetic, but that the low symmetry of the cation sites allows spin–orbit coupling to cause canting of the moments when they are in the plane perpendicular to the c axis. The disappearance of the moment with a decrease in temperature at 260 K is caused by a change in the anisotropy which causes the moments to align along the c axis. In this configuration, spin canting does not reduce the energy. The magnetic properties of bulk hematite differ from their nanoscale counterparts. For example, the Morin transition temperature of hematite decreases with a decrease in the particle size. The suppression of this transition has also been observed in some of the hematite nanoparticles, and the presence of impurities, water molecules and defects in the crystals were attributed to the absence of a Morin transition. Hematite is part of a complex <b>solid</b> <b>solution</b> oxyhydroxide system having various contents of water, hydroxyl groups and vacancy substitutions that affect the mineral's magnetic and crystal chemical properties. Two other end-members are referred to as protohematite and hydrohematite.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescence in {{minerals}} {{is caused}} by a wide range of activators. In some cases, the concentration of the activator must be restricted to below a certain level, to prevent quenching of the fluorescent emission. Furthermore, the mineral must be free of impurities such as iron or copper, to prevent quenching of possible fluorescence. Divalent manganese, in concentrations of up to several percent, is responsible for the red or orange fluorescence of calcite, the green fluorescence of willemite, the yellow fluorescence of esperite, and the orange fluorescence of wollastonite and clinohedrite. Hexavalent uranium, {{in the form of the}} uranyl cation, fluoresces at all concentrations in a yellow green, and is the cause of fluorescence of minerals such as autunite or andersonite, and, at low concentration, is the cause of the fluorescence of such materials as some samples of hyalite opal. Trivalent chromium at low concentration is the source of the red fluorescence of ruby. Divalent europium is the source of the blue fluorescence, when seen in the mineral fluorite. Trivalent lanthanides such as terbium and dysprosium are the principal activators of the creamy yellow fluorescence exhibited by the yttrofluorite variety of the mineral fluorite, and contribute to the orange fluorescence of zircon. Powellite (calcium molybdate) and scheelite (calcium tungstate) fluoresce intrinsically in yellow and blue, respectively. When present together in <b>solid</b> <b>solution,</b> energy is transferred from the higher-energy tungsten to the lower-energy molybdenum, such that fairly low levels of molybdenum are sufficient to cause a yellow emission for scheelite, instead of blue. Low-iron sphalerite (zinc sulfide), fluoresces and phosphoresces in a range of colors, influenced by the presence of various trace impurities.|$|E
