40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} inferring a genetic network from noisy data. This is done under the Temporal Boolean Network Model. Due to the hardness of the problem, we propose an heuristic approach based on the combined utilization of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and other existing algorithms. The main features of this approach are the heuristic seeding of the initial population, the utilization of a <b>specialized</b> <b>recombination</b> operator, {{and the use of}} a majority-voting procedure in order to build a consensus solution. Experimental results provide support for the potential usefulness of this approach...|$|E
40|$|SummaryNeisseria gonorrhoeae is an obligate human {{pathogen}} that can escape immune surveillance through antigenic variation of surface {{structures such as}} pili. A G-quadruplex-forming (G 4) sequence (5 ′-G 3 TG 3 TTG 3 TG 3) located upstream of the N.  gonorrhoeae pilin expression locus (pilE) is necessary for initiation of pilin antigenic variation, a recombination-based, high-frequency, diversity-generation system. We have determined NMR-based structures of the all parallel-stranded monomeric and  5 ′ end-stacked dimeric pilE G-quadruplexes in monovalent cation-containing solutions. We demonstrate that the three-layered all parallel-stranded monomeric pilE G-quadruplex containing single-residue double-chain reversal loops, which can be modeled without steric clashes into the 3 nt DNA-binding site of RecA, binds and promotes E.  coli RecA-mediated strand exchange in vitro. We discuss how interactions between RecA and monomeric pilE G-quadruplex could facilitate the <b>specialized</b> <b>recombination</b> reactions leading to pilin diversification...|$|E
40|$|The Swi 5 -Mei 5 {{complex and}} its homologues are {{involved}} in <b>specialized</b> <b>recombination</b> pathways in budding and fission yeasts. Although the fission yeast homologue Swi 5 -Sfr 1 is critical for homologous recombination repair, the budding yeast counterpart Sae 3 -Mei 5 is meiosis-specific, interacts with Dmc 1, and promotes assembly of Dmc 1 on meiotic chromosomes. Here, we identify and characterize the human SWI 5 -MEI 5 (C 9 orf 119 -C 10 orf 78) complex. We showed that SWI 5 and MEI 5 form a stable complex in vitro and in vivo. The C-terminal Swi 5 domain of SWI 5 and the middle coiled-coil region of MEI 5 dictate this conserved interaction. In addition, SWI 5 -MEI 5 directly interacts with RAD 51 in vitro. Depletion of SWI 5 or MEI 5 in human cells causes defects in homologous recombination repair. Finally, SWI 5 - or MEI 5 -depleted cells display enhanced sensitivity to ionizing radiation, consistent {{with the role of}} this complex in HR repair. Our results suggest that human SWI 5 -MEI 5 has an evolutionarily conserved function in homologous recombination repair...|$|E

A new problem dependent recombination operator, called best inherited levels recombination (BIL), is introduced. A comparison of its performance {{is carried out}} with respect to four classical recombination operators. A complete study {{of the influence of}} the recombination operators on the genetic search, including the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the search process, is presented. The results show that the use of our <b>specialized</b> BIL <b>recombination</b> outperforms the others more generic on all problem instances for all the metrics tested...|$|R
40|$|Retroviruses {{synthesize}} {{a double}} stranded DNA copy of their RNA genome after infection of a permissive cell and subsequent integration of this DNA copy into the host genome {{is necessary for}} normal viral replication. Integration occurs by a <b>specialized</b> DNA <b>recombination</b> reaction, mediated by the viral IN protein. Because this reaction has no known cellular counterpart, it is a particularly attractive target {{in the search for}} specific inhibitors with low toxicity that may serve as therapeutic antiviral agents. We present a simple assay system that is suitable for screening potential inhibitors of HIV DNA integration. Only short oligonucleotides matching one end of HIV DNA and purified HIV IN protein are required as substrates. Furthermore, since each step of the assay can be carried out in the wells of microtiter plates, large numbers of reactions can be processed simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|The term memetic {{algorithms}} (MAs) {{was introduced}} in the late 1980 s to denote a family of metaheuristics that have as central theme the hybridization of different algorithmic approaches for a given problem. Special emphasis was given to the use of a population-based approach in which a set of cooperating and competing agents was engaged in periods of individual improvement of the solutions while they interact sporadically. Another main objective theme was to introduce problem and instance-dependent knowledge as a way of speeding up the search process. Initialty, hybridizations included Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), Simulated Annealing and its variants, and Tabu Search. Today, a number of hybridizations inciude other metaheuristics as well as exact algorithms, in complete anytime memetic algorithms. These methods not only prove optimality, but can also deliver high-quality soiutions early on in the process. MAs exploit problem knowledge by incorporating preexisting heuristics, preprocessing data reduction rules, approximation and fixed-parameter tractable algorithms, local search techniques, <b>specialized</b> <b>recombination</b> operators, truncated exact methods, and so on. Also, an important factor is the use of adequate representations of the problem being tackled. This results in highly efficient optimization tools. We provide a brief abstracted overview of MA applications in combinatorial optimization in Section 27. 3. We will finish with a brief summary of the current research trends in MAs, with special mention to those which we believe will {{play a major role in}} the near future...|$|E
40|$|DNA ends are {{generated}} during double-strand-break repair and recombination. A p 70 -p 86 heterodimer, Ku, {{accounts for the}} DNA end binding activity in eukaryotic cell extracts. When one or both subunits of Ku are missing, mammalian cells are deficient in double-strand-break repair and in <b>specialized</b> <b>recombination,</b> such as V(D) J recombination. Little is known of which regions of Ku 70 and Ku 86 bind to each other to form the heterodimeric complex or of which regions are important for DNA end binding. We have done genetic and biochemical studies to examine the domains within the two subunits important for protein assembly and for DNA end binding. We found that the C-terminal 20 -kDa region of Ku 70 and the C-terminal 32 -kDa region of Ku 86 are important for subunit-subunit interaction. For DNA binding, full-length individual subunits are inactive, indicating that heterodimer assembly precedes DNA binding. DNA end binding activity by the heterodimer requires the C-terminal 40 -kDa region of Ku 70 and the C-terminal 45 -kDa region of Ku 86. Leucine zipper-like motifs in both subunits that have been suggested as the Ku 70 -Ku 86 interaction domains {{do not appear to}} be the sites of such interaction because these are dispensable for both assembly and DNA end binding. On the basis of these studies, we have organized Ku 70 into nine sequence regions conserved between Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, mice, and humans; only the C-terminal three regions are essential for assembly (amino acids [aa] 439 to 609), and the C-terminal four regions appear to be essential for DNA end binding (aa 254 to 609). Within the minimal active fragment of Ku 86 necessary for subunit interaction (aa 449 to 732) and DNA binding (aa 334 to 732), a proline-rich region is the only defined motif...|$|E
40|$|The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) {{deals with}} the {{assignment}} {{of a set of}} transportation orders to a fleet of vehicles, and the sequencing of stops for each vehicle to minimize transportation costs. In this paper we study the Capacitated VRP (CVRP), which is mainly characterized by using vehicles of the same capacity. Taking a basic GA to solve the CVRP, we propose a new problem dependent recombination operator, called Best Route Better Adjustment recombination (BRBAX). A comparison of its performance is carried out with respect to other two classical recombination operators. Also we conduct a study of different mutations {{in order to determine the}} best combination of genetic operators for this problem. The results show that the use of our <b>specialized</b> BRBAX <b>recombination</b> outperforms the others more generic on all problem instances used in this work for all the metrics tested.

40|$|Neisseria gonorrhoeae pilin {{undergoes}} high-frequency {{changes in}} primary {{amino acid sequence}} that aid in the avoidance of the host immune response and alter pilus expression. The pilin amino acid changes reflect nucleotide changes in the expressed gene, pilE, which result from nonreciprocal recombination reactions with numerous silent loci, pilS. A series of mini-transposon insertions affecting pilin antigenic variation were localized to three genes in one region of the Gc chromosome. Mutational analysis with complementation showed that a Gc gene with sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli rdgC gene is involved in pilus-dependent colony phase variation and in pilin antigenic variation. Furthermore, we show that the Gc rdgC homologue is transcriptionally linked in an operon with a gene encoding a predicted GTPase. The inability to disrupt expression of this gene suggests it is an essential gene (engA, essential neisserial GTPase). While some of the transposon mutations in rdgC and insertions in the 5 '-untranslated portion of engA showed a growth defect, all transposon insertions investigated conferred an aberrant cellular morphology. Complementation analysis showed that the growth deficiencies are due to the interruption of RdgC expression and not that of EngA. The requirement of RdgC for efficient pilin variation suggests a role for this protein in <b>specialized</b> DNA <b>recombination</b> reactions...|$|R
40|$|The RAD 1 and RAD 10 {{genes of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{are two of}} at least seven genes which {{are known to be}} {{required}} for damage-specific recognition and/or damage-specific incision of DNA during nucleotide excision repair. RAD 1 and RAD 10 are also involved in a <b>specialized</b> mitotic <b>recombination</b> pathway. We have previously reported the purification of the RAD 10 protein to homogeneity (L. Bardwell, H. Burtscher, W. A. Weiss, C. M. Nicolet, and E. C. Friedberg, Biochemistry 29 : 3119 - 3126, 1990). In the present studies we show that the RAD 1 protein, produced by in vitro transcription and translation of the cloned gene, specifically coimmunoprecipitates with the RAD 10 protein translated in vitro or purified from yeast. Conversely, in vitro-translated RAD 10 protein specifically coimmunoprecipitates with the RAD 1 protein. The sites of this stable and specific interaction have been mapped to the C-terminal regions of both polypeptides. This portion of RAD 10 protein is evolutionarily conserved. These results are the first biochemical evidence of a specific association between any eukaryotic proteins genetically identified as belonging to a recombination or DNA repair pathway and suggest that the RAD 1 and RAD 10 proteins act at the same or consecutive biochemical steps in both nucleotide excision repair and mitotic recombination...|$|R
40|$|Many separate-sexed organisms {{have sex}} {{chromosomes}} controlling sex determination. Sex chromosomes often have reduced <b>recombination,</b> <b>specialized</b> (frequently sex-specific) gene content, dosage compensation and heteromorphic size. Research on sex determination and sex chromosome evolution has {{increased over the}} past decade and is today a very active field. However, some areas within the field have not received as much attention as others. We therefore believe that a historic overviewof key findings and empirical discoveries will put current thinking into context and help us better understand where to go next. Here, we present a timeline of important conceptual and analytical models, as well as empirical studies that have advanced the field and changed our understanding of the evolution of sex chromosomes. Finally, we highlight gaps in our knowledge so far and propose some specific areas within the field that we recommend a greater focus on in the future, including the role of ecology in sex chromosome evolution and newmultilocus models of sex chromosome divergence...|$|R
40|$|A {{subset of}} human cancer cells uses a <b>specialized,</b> {{aberrant}} <b>recombination</b> pathway known as ALT to maintain telomeres, which in these cells {{are characterized by}} complex aberrations including length heterogeneity, high levels of unpaired C-strand, and accumulation of extra-chromosomal telomere repeats (ECTR). These phenotypes have not been recapitulated in any standard budding or fission yeast mutant. We found that eliminating Ku 70 or Ku 80 in the yeast-like fungus Ustilago maydis results initially in all the characteristic telomere aberrations of ALT cancer cells, including C-circles, a highly specific marker of ALT. Subsequently the ku mutants experience permanent G 2 cell cycle arrest, accompanied by loss of telomere repeats from chromosome ends and even more drastic accumulation of very short ECTRs (vsECTRs). The deletion of atr 1 or chk 1 rescued the lethality of the ku mutant, and "trapped" the telomere aberrations in the early ALT-like stage. Telomere abnormalities are telomerase-independent, but dramatically suppressed by deletion of mre 11 or blm, suggesting major roles for these factors in the induction of the ALT pathway. In contrast, removal of other DNA damage response and repair factors such as Rad 51 has disparate effects on the ALT phenotypes, suggesting that these factors process ALT intermediates or products. Notably, the antagonism of Ku and Mre 11 in the induction of ALT is reminiscent of their roles in DSB resection, in which Blm is also known to play a key role. We suggest that an aberrant resection reaction may constitute an early trigger for ALT telomeres, and that the outcomes of ALT are distinct from DSB because of the unique telomere nucleoprotein structure...|$|R
40|$|The Factor for Inversion Stimulation (FIS) is a dimeric DNA binding protein {{found in}} enteric {{bacteria}} that {{is involved in}} various cellular processes, including stimulation of certain <b>specialized</b> DNA <b>recombination</b> events and transcription regulation {{of a large number}} of genes. The intracellular FIS concentration, when cells are grown in rich media, varies dramatically during the early logarithmic growth phase. Its broad range of concentrations could potentially affect the nature of its quaternary structure, which in turn, could affect its ability to function in vivo. Thus, we examined the stability of FIS homodimers under a wide range of concentrations relevant to in vivo expression levels. Its urea-induced equilibrium denaturation was monitored by far- and near-UV circular dichroism (CD), tyrosine fluorescence, and tyrosine fluorescence anisotropy. The denaturation transitions obtained were concentration-dependent and showed similar midpoints (Cm) and m values, suggesting a two-state denaturation process involving the native dimer and unfolded monomers (N 2 ↔ 2 U). The ΔGH 2 O for the unfolding of FIS determined from global and individual curve fitting was 14. 2 kcal/mole. At concentrations < 9 μM, the FIS dimer began to dissociate, as noted by the change in CD signal and size-exclusion high-pressure liquid chromatography retention times and peak width. The estimated dimer dissociation constant based on the CD and size-exclusion chromatography data is in the micromolar range, resulting in a ΔGH 2 O of at least 5 kcal/mole less than that calculated from the urea denaturation data. This discrepancy suggests a deviation from a two-state denaturation model, perhaps due to a marginally stable monomeric intermediate. These observations have implications for the stability and function of FIS in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Homologous {{recombination}} (HR) is a conserved pathway for {{repair of}} DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and stalled or collapsed replication forks, and depends upon {{recognition of a}} homologous template on a sister chromatid or alternate parental copy. Non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) results from erroneous recognition of a similar but non-homologous template {{and can lead to}} lethal chromosomal deletions or rearrangements. To avoid errors, NAHR is actively suppressed by cellular mechanisms that disrupt heteroduplex recombination intermediates. Using a <b>specialized</b> type of <b>recombination</b> pathway single-strand annealing (SSA) as a model in yeast, I found that rejection of heteroduplex HR intermediate induces a RAD 9 -dependent cell cycle delay in the G 2 stage of the cell cycle. Strains lacking the RAD 9 gene, and consequently a damage-induced G 2 delay, less frequently allowed SSA between divergent sequences than identical ones. However, non-allelic SSA could be restored to wild-type levels if a G 2 delay was induced by nocodazole treatment. These results indicate that that cell cycle delay induced by the Rad 9 -dependent DNA damage response can passively promote recombination between non-allelic sequences despite the potential for creating deleterious genome rearrangements.

40|$|Fis {{is a small}} DNA-binding and -bending {{protein in}} Escherichia coli that is {{involved}} in several different biological processes, including stimulation of <b>specialized</b> DNA <b>recombination</b> events and regulation of gene expression. fis protein and mRNA levels rapidly increase during early logarithmic growth phase {{in response to a}} nutritional upshift but become virtually undetectable during late logarithmic and stationary phases. We present evidence that the growth phase-dependent fis expression pattern is not determined by changes in mRNA stability, arguing in favor of regulation at the level of transcription. DNA deletion analysis of the fis promoter (fis P) region indicated that DNA sequences from - 166 to - 81, - 36 to - 26, and + 107 to + 366 relative to the transcription start site are required for maximum expression. A DNA sequence resembling the integration host factor (IHF) binding site centered approximately at - 114 showed DNase I cleavage protection by IHF. In ihf cells, maximum cellular levels of fis mRNA were decreased more than 3 -fold and transcription from fis P on a plasmid was decreased about 3. 8 -fold compared to those in cells expressing wild-type IHF. In addition, a mutation in the ihf binding site resulted in a 76 and 61 % reduction in transcription from fis P on a plasmid in {{the presence or absence of}} Fis, respectively. Insertions of 5 or 10 bp between this ihf site and fis P suggest that IHF functions in a position-dependent manner. We conclude that IHF plays a role in stimulating transcription from fis P by interacting with a site centered approximately at - 114 relative to the start of transcription. We also showed that although the fis P region contains six Fis binding sites, Fis site II (centered at - 42) played a predominant role in autoregulation, Fis sites I and III (centered at + 26 and - 83, respectively) seemingly played smaller roles, and no role in negative autoregulation could be attributed to Fis sites IV, V, and VI (located upstream of site III). The fis P region from - 36 to + 7, which is not directly regulated by either IHF or Fis, retained the characteristic fis regulation pattern in response to a nutritional upshift...|$|R

Secondly, following identification of the Msh 2 -Msh 6 heterodimer and Sgs 1 helicase as essential factors for unwinding of a heteroduplex intermediate during SSA (Sugawara et al., 2004; Goldfarb and Alani, 2005), our lab determined that these proteins interact through a direct physical interaction, similarly to mammalian homologs (Pedrazzi et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2004; Saydam et al., 2007). Next I asked whether other proteins that interact with iii Msh 6 and Sgs 1 contribute to heteroduplex rejection, including the topoisomerase Top 3 -Rmi 1 which is known to stimulate Sgs 1 activity (Cejka et al., 2010; Niu et al., 2010) and the replication clamp PCNA which enhances the activity of Msh 6 in the mismatch repair pathway. I found that Top 3 -Rmi 1 contributes to heteroduplex rejection, but appears to do so mainly by stabilizing Sgs 1. Additionally, I show that PCNA is dispensible for heteroduplex rejection; three mutants of the catalytic subunit pol 30 and a msh 6 mutant lacking the Pol 30 interaction domain rejected SSA heteroduplexes to the same extent as wild-type. Finally, two of the pol 30 mutants displayed a reduction in SSA efficiency, revealing an unexpected role for PCNA in SSA. i...|$|R
