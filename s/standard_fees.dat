50|$|Many {{forms of}} social {{insurance}} schemes control their costs by using the bargaining power of their community they represent to control costs {{in the health care}} delivery system. For example, by negotiating drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies negotiating <b>standard</b> <b>fees</b> with the medical profession, or reducing unnecessary health care costs. Social schemes sometimes feature contributions related to earnings as part of a scheme to deliver universal health care, {{which may or may not}} also involve the use of commercial and non-commercial insurers. Essentially the more wealthy pay proportionately more into the scheme to cover the needs of the relatively poor who therefore contribute proportionately less. There are usually caps on the contributions of the wealthy and minimum payments that must be made by the insured (often in the form of a minimum contribution, similar to a deductible in commercial insurance models).|$|E

50|$|Black Jack is a Japanese {{comic book}} series created by Tezuka Osamu {{that is about}} the worlds {{greatest}} surgeon, who chooses to remain unlicensed. This allows Black Jack to charge extortionate amounts of money instead of the <b>standard</b> <b>fees</b> agreed upon by the Japanese Medical Association. It also lets him perform extremely dangerous, often medically implausible or impossible operations, that are not legally allowed. Black Jack is often viewed as the Japanese equivalent to Batman, in his willingness to routinely break laws to save lives {{for which he is}} frequently imprisoned by the police. It is notable that Black Jack actually completed his college medical education and carries a drivers license, though he encourages other unlicensed doctors who have no such formal training. Like many of Osamus works, Black Jack is extraordinarily critical of the medical establishment, and is notable for raising Japanese public awareness of medical corruption.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{members from}} PFA Uttarakhand {{including}} Gauri Maulekhi went to Kedarnath {{to get a}} first-hand account of the situation, the only members from any animal organization to have visited the area during the initial days of the calamity.PFA Uttarakhand member secretary Gauri Maulekhi exposed with first-hand information collected from the affected areas how the State Government, district administration and Animal Husbandry Department had entirely ignored the animals affected in the region the apathy of the Government towards the stranded working animals which amounts to crores of rupees invested by locals.People for Animals, Uttarakhand member secretary Gauri Maulekhi worked with volunteers, locals and the Army to rescue about 2,000 stranded animals.Maulekhi said, [...] "Even after stranded people have been rescued, the authorities have left thousands of animals {{to fend for themselves}} on isolated pockets in the mountains surrounded by deadly landslides or treacherous currents. The Uttarakhand High Court in April this year had set a cap of 4,500 mules in Kedarnath area, but corrupt officials allowed over 10,000 mules between Gaurikund and Kedarnath {{on the day of the}} calamity. No Government veterinarian was available in the affected areas till July 3. [...] " [...] she said. People for Animals Uttarakhand revealed how the government was charging the <b>standard</b> <b>fees</b> even during the calamity.|$|E
40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{issues related}} to the traditional and new health care systems in China. The driving force behind the traditional health care system was an uncontrollable increase in costs paid by the government. The new health care system requires both the individual and enterprises (private and state-owned) to contribute to their plan by establishing individual and hospital accounts, which appear to be effective in controlling medical care expenses. One unintended result is that the new system suppresses the demand of part-time workers (lowincome group) for hospital services. Policymakers, in revising urban health care plans, should seriously consider varying the upfront <b>standard</b> <b>fees</b> (deduction) borne by patients because low-income groups {{may not be able to}} afford them. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{asks whether}} lawyers respond to {{financial}} incentives {{in ways that}} are consistent with predictions from contract theory. It uses data collected from before/after the introduction of <b>standard</b> <b>fees</b> for legal aid lawyers in England and Wales. For some inputs (not all), these substituted fixed price contracts for retrospective fee-for-service remuneration. We consider the effects of these new contracts on case-level inputs and examine the extent of substitution across inputs remunerated by fixed prices and fee-for-service. We find that lawyers' responses were consistent with theory: (i) high-powered incentives for cost-reduction lowered inputs that may have been difficult to monitor, and (ii) substitution across inputs took place in line with multitask agency. Our results have implications for legal aid expenditure control, and current policies on personal injury litigation, as well as providing empirical evidence on the effects of remuneration contracts.

40|$|Abstract Background Reduction of {{maternal}} mortality ratio by two-thirds by 2015 {{is an international}} development goal with unrestricted access to high quality emergency obstetric care services promoted towards the attainment of that goal. The objective of this qualitative study {{was to assess the}} availability and quality of emergency obstetric care services in Gambia's main referral hospital. Methods From weekend admissions a group of 30 women treated for different acute obstetric conditions including five main diagnostic groups: hemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, dystocia, sepsis and anemia were purposively selected. In-depth interviews with the women were carried out at their homes within two weeks of discharge. Results Substantial difficulties in obtaining emergency obstetric care were uncovered. Health system inadequacies including lack of blood for transfusion, shortage of essential medicines especially antihypertensive drugs considerably hindered timely and adequate treatment for obstetric emergencies. Such inadequacies also inflated the treatment costs to between 5 and 18 times more than <b>standard</b> <b>fees.</b> Blood transfusion and hypertensive treatment were associated with the largest costs. Conclusion The deficiencies in the availability of life-saving interventions identified are manifestations of inadequate funding for maternal health services. Substantial increase in funding for maternal health services is therefore warranted towards effective implementation of emergency obstetric care package in The Gambia. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to UK government policy mandating {{the construction of}} ‘zero carbon’ homes by 2016 there have been {{significant changes in the}} way dwellings are being designed and built. Recent years have seen a rapid uptake in the adoption of the German Passivhaus standard as a template for ultra-low energy and zero carbon buildings in the UK. Despite genuine motivations to mitigate climate change and fuel poverty {{there is a lack of}} research investigating the long-term performance of Passivhaus buildings in a rapidly changing UK climate. This paper sets out to investigate whether Passivhaus dwellings will be able to provide high standards of thermal comfort in the future or whether they are inherently vulnerable to overheating risks. Scenario modelling using probabilistic data derived from the UKCP 09 weather generator (WG) in conjunction with dynamic simulation and global sensitivity analysis techniques are used to assess the future performance of a range of typical Passivhaus dwellings relative to an identical Fabric Energy Efficiency <b>Standard</b> (<b>FEES)</b> compliant dwelling over its notional future lifespan. The emphasis of this study is to understand what impact climate change will pose to overheating risks for Passivhaus dwellings relative to the de facto (i. e. FEES) alternative, and which design factors play a dominant role in contributing to this risk. The results show that optimization of a small number of design inputs, including glazing ratios and external shading devices, can play a significant role in mitigating future overheating risks...|$|E

The operation typically placed {{a large number of}} low-level bets, sets of around €100 (US$130) each using different credit cards. Money was also moved and laundered using Islamic hawala financing networks. A <b>standard</b> <b>fee</b> for the European match fixers was €200,000 ($260k). Perumal's allegations against Tan were first made public in a 28 July 2011, article in the German magazine Stern.|$|R
