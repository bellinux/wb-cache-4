500|$|In July 2011, Lindelof {{said that}} the film would rely upon {{practical}} effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that [...] "you can pretty much do anything you want" [...] with digital technology, and, [...] "Doug Trumbull {{once said to me}} 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. Even though we have remarkable digital capabilities I still <b>say</b> <b>do</b> it live. It's cheaper." [...] Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that {{it would be possible to}} film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the Alien films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-Avatar technology.|$|E
500|$|Various music journalists, {{critical}} theorists, {{and authors}} have deemed Madonna {{the most influential}} female recording artist of all time. She topped VH1's [...] "100 Greatest Women in Music" [...] list and The Daily Telegraphs [...] "20 Greatest Female Artists" [...] list. Author Carol Clerk wrote that [...] "during her career, Madonna has transcended the term 'pop star' to become a global cultural icon." [...] Rolling Stone of Spain wrote that [...] "She became the first viral Master of Pop in history, years before the Internet was massively used. Madonna was everywhere; in the almighty music television channels, 'radio formulas', magazine covers and even in bookshops. A pop dialectic, never seen since The Beatles's reign, which allowed her to keep {{on the edge of}} tendency and commerciality." [...] Laura Barcella and Jessica Valenti in the book Madonna and Me: Women Writers on the Queen of Pop (2012) wrote that [...] "really, Madonna changed everything the musical landscape, the '80s look du jour, and most significantly, what a mainstream female pop star could (and couldn't) <b>say,</b> <b>do,</b> or accomplish in the public eye." [...] William Langley from The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Madonna has changed the world's social history, has done more things as more different people than anyone else is ever likely to." [...] Alan McGee from The Guardian felt that Madonna is a post-modern art, the likes of which we will never see again. He further asserted that Madonna and Michael Jackson invented the terms Queen and King of Pop.|$|E
2500|$|The Watch Tower Society has {{attracted}} criticism for disfellowshipping members who decide they cannot conscientiously agree {{with all the}} denomination's teachings and practices. Sociologist Andrew Holden says that because the group provides no valid reason for leaving, those who do choose to leave are regarded as traitors. According to Raymond Franz, those who decide they cannot accept Watch Tower teachings and practices often live in a climate of fear, feeling they must constantly be on guard about what they <b>say,</b> <b>do</b> and read. He says those who do express any disagreement, even in a private conversation with friends, risk investigation and trial by a judicial committee as apostates or heretics and classed as [...] "wicked".|$|E

2500|$|Treen {{declared}} that Duke [...] "simply is not believable. He is an opportunist {{who will say}} {{whatever is necessary to}} gain him votes[...] [...] [...]To my Republican friends, therefore, I <b>say</b> <b>do</b> not be persuaded in favor of Duke simply because he has adopted the Republican label…. Duke affiliated with the Republican Party for one reason and one reason only: pure political opportunism. It is my judgment that David Duke must be defeated. He can't be defeated by voters staying at home out of disaffection for both candidates for governor.… There are but two names on the ballot: David Duke and Edwin Edwards. To defeat David Duke, one must vote for Edwin Edwards. That's what I will do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stone caused {{controversy}} at the 2007 BRIT Awards ceremony on 14 February 2007 while {{presenting the}} award for British Male Solo Artist (won by James Morrison). Speaking in an American accent, she circled the podium and gave a speech about Robbie Williams, {{who had been the}} target of earlier jokes made by host Russell Brand. Williams had been reported as going into rehabilitation that same week. As her speech continued, she made remarks about Brand, implying that he was heading for rehabilitation himself (while singing a passage of Amy Winehouse's hit [...] "Rehab"). In response to the British media's reaction, Stone responded, [...] "At the end of the day, I don't give a fuck if people have a problem with my accent. That's all I can say about it. The words I <b>say</b> <b>do</b> not change. If the way that it sounds is skew-wiff and you don't like it, don't listen. I'm not being a cruel person by sounding a different way. And I can't help it. I've been [...] since I was, like, 14." [...] Stone later claimed that her record label cancelled all her upcoming press appearances to publicise her upcoming third album {{as a result of the}} backlash.|$|E
2500|$|Brigham Young {{taught that}} if women [...] "should {{stand behind the}} counter, study law or physic , or become good book-keepers {{and be able to}} do the {{business}} in any counting house, and this to enlarge their sphere of usefulness for the benefit of society at large." [...] Many women in Brigham Young's time worked; in 1874, Utah had a respectable class of literate and professional women and a visitor noted that no profession was closed to women. After the church officially ended polygamy, church members adopted a more mainstream Victorian view towards women's work, which confined women's roles to the home. By 1920, the church's ideals for women mirrored society's until the 1960s and 70s, when some Church leaders strongly advised against (presumably married) women working outside the home. Spencer W. Kimball said, [...] "Numerous divorces can be traced directly to the day when the wife left the home and went out into the world into employment." [...] Gordon B. Hinckley made allowances for single mothers and other women in similar circumstances: [...] "I recognize [...] that there are some women (it has become very many, in fact) who have to work to provide for the needs of their families. To you I <b>say,</b> <b>do</b> the very best you can." [...] A 1986 Ensign article emphasized that husband and wife share the responsibility of providing for their children's temporal needs, and that each family would prayerfully decide if a mother would go to work. Mormon women were to reject the secular values of individuality and devote themselves to the eternal women's roles of marriage, motherhood, and submissiveness.|$|E
