5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|We {{abuse the}} Holocaust {{when it becomes}} a cudgel against others who have their claims of suffering. The Shoah must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality....The Shoah has become our instant raison d'etre, the {{short-cut}} answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> not marry out of the faith? Why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> join a synagogue? Why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> support Israel? Why <b>should</b> <b>I</b> be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' That answer will not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler {{is a far cry}} from living 'yes' to Judaism.|$|E

25|$|During World War I {{the army}} and navy mothers, or <b>should</b> <b>I</b> say the war mothers, had {{canteens}} at our own depot.

25|$|I {{have nowhere}} in any thing I may have written {{declared}} {{myself to be}} a Republican; nor <b>should</b> <b>I</b> think it worth while to be a martyr and a confessor to any form or mode of government.

25|$|Esme {{worked as}} a {{secretary}} and {{was working in the}} field of magazine publishing at the time when she started MRG. She raised her eldest son on her own without ever being married, which was an unusual thing to do at the time. In 1958 she wrote a semi-autobiographical book called Why <b>Should</b> <b>I</b> be Dismayed under the pseudonym of Ann Bruce, which describes her life from being in the A.T.S in occupied Germany to being a single parent and living in the conservative post second world war era.|$|E

500|$|An aria for tenor, [...] (I am now {{eighty years}} old, why shall Your servant burden himself any more?) is complimented by a hymn, sung {{simultaneously}} by the soprano, [...] (<b>Should</b> <b>I</b> upon this earth carry my life farther).
