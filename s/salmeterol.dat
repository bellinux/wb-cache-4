2500|$|There is no {{compelling}} evidence that salbutamol and other β2 agonists can increase performance in healthy athletes. In spite of this, salbutamol required [...] "a declaration of Use {{in accordance with}} the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions" [...] under the 2010 WADA prohibited list. This requirement was relaxed when the 2011 list was published to permit the use of [...] "salbutamol (maximum 1600 micrograms over 24 hours) and <b>salmeterol</b> when taken by inhalation {{in accordance with the}} manufacturers’ recommended therapeutic regimen." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationship}} between the art and science of molecular graphics {{is shown in the}} exhibitions sponsored by the Molecular Graphics Society. Some exhibits are created with molecular graphics programs alone, while others are collages, or involve physical materials. An example from Mike Hann (1994), inspired by Magritte's painting Ceci n'est pas une pipe, uses an image of a <b>salmeterol</b> molecule. [...] "Ceci n'est pas une molecule," [...] writes Mike Hann, [...] "serves to remind us that all of the graphics images presented here are not molecules, not even pictures of molecules, but pictures of icons which we believe represent some aspects of the molecule's properties." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the decline in lung function observed in chronic bronchitis may be slowed with smoking cessation. Chronic bronchitis is treated symptomatically and may be treated in a nonpharmacologic manner or with pharmacologic therapeutic agents. Typical nonpharmacologic approaches to the management of COPD including bronchitis may include: pulmonary rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation. Inflammation and edema of the respiratory epithelium may be reduced with inhaled corticosteroids. Wheezing and shortness of breath can be treated by reducing bronchospasm (reversible narrowing of smaller bronchi due to constriction of the smooth muscle) [...] with bronchodilators such as inhaled long acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (e.g., <b>salmeterol)</b> and inhaled anticholinergics such as ipratropium bromide or tiotropium bromide. Mucolytics may have a small therapeutic effect on acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Supplemental oxygen is used to treat hypoxemia (too little oxygen in the blood) and {{has been shown to}} reduce mortality in chronic bronchitis patients. Oxygen supplementation can result in decreased respiratory drive, leading to increased blood levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and subsequent respiratory acidosis.|$|E
50|$|The FDA assigns a Category C to <b>salmeterol</b> in {{pregnancy}}. <b>Salmeterol</b> {{use during}} pregnancy must be decided {{based on the}} risks versus benefits to the mother. There are no well-controlled studies with <b>salmeterol</b> in pregnant women. Some animal studies showed developmental malformation when the mother was given several clinical doses orally. In rats, <b>salmeterol</b> xinafoate is excreted in the milk. However, {{since there are no}} data to show excretion of <b>salmeterol</b> in a mother's breast milk, a decision on whether to continue or discontinue therapy should be decided based on the important benefits it provides to the mother. Pregnant and lactating women should consult their doctors before using <b>salmeterol.</b>|$|E
50|$|The primary {{noticeable}} {{difference of}} <b>salmeterol</b> from salbutamol, and other short-acting β2 adrenoreceptor agonists (SABAs), is its duration of action. <b>Salmeterol</b> lasts approximately 12 hours {{in comparison with}} the salbutamol, which last about 4 - 6 hours.|$|E
5000|$|Salbutamol, levosalbutamol, formoterol, <b>salmeterol,</b> {{clenbuterol}} etc.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Salmeterol</b> — a long-acting β2 {{adrenoreceptor}} agonist (LABA) with {{a similar}} backbone.|$|E
50|$|Inhaled <b>salmeterol</b> {{works like}} other β2 agonists, causing {{bronchodilation}} by relaxing the smooth muscle in the airway {{so as to}} treat the exacerbation of asthma. The long duration of action occurs by the molecules initially diffusing into the plasma membrane of the lung cells, and then slowly being released back outside the cell where they can {{come into contact with}} the β2 adrenoreceptors, with the long carbon chain forming an anchor in the membrane. Interestingly, <b>salmeterol</b> binding to the β2 adrenoreceptor does not induce desensitization or internalization of receptors which may also contribute to its long therapeutic duration of action. Formoterol has been demonstrated to have a faster onset of action than <b>salmeterol</b> {{as a result of a}} lower lipophilicity, and has also been demonstrated to be more potent - a 12 µg dose of formoterol has been demonstrated to be equivalent to a 50 µg dose of <b>salmeterol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|At {{the current}} time, {{available}} long-acting β2 agonists include <b>salmeterol,</b> formoterol, bambuterol, and sustained-release oral salbutamol.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{vasodilation}} properties, {{the common}} {{side effects of}} <b>salmeterol</b> are dizziness, sinus infection, and migraine headaches. In most cases, <b>salmeterol</b> side effects are minor and either don't require treatment or can easily be treated. Certain side effects, however, should be reported to a healthcare provider immediately. Some of these more serious side effects include a very fast heart rate, high blood pressure, and worsening breathing problems.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{combination}} preparation containing fluticasone propionate and <b>salmeterol</b> xinafoate (a long-acting bronchodilator). It is approved for children over 12 years old.|$|E
50|$|<b>Salmeterol</b> has an aryl {{alkyl group}} with a chain length of 11 atoms from the amine. This {{bulkiness}} makes the compound more lipophilic and it also makes it selective to β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{long acting}} β2-agonist <b>salmeterol</b> can be {{synthesised}} from phenethyl alcohol. Dibromohexane {{is used to}} link the phenethyl alcohol with the salicyl alcohol ethylamine. Figure 7 shows the main steps for the synthesis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Salmeterol,</b> first marketed and {{manufactured}} by Glaxo (now GlaxoSmithKline, GSK) in the 1980s, was released as Serevent in 1990. The product is marketed by GSK under the Allen & Hanburys brand in the UK.|$|E
50|$|Fluticasone, a corticosteroid, is the {{anti-inflammatory}} {{component of}} the combination, while <b>salmeterol,</b> a long acting beta-adrenoceptor agonist (LABA), treats constriction of the airways. Together, they help prevent symptoms of coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.|$|E
50|$|When used {{regularly}} {{every day}} as prescribed, inhaled <b>salmeterol</b> decreases the number and severity of asthma attacks. However, like all LABA medications, {{it is not for}} use in relieving an asthma attack that has already started.|$|E
50|$|Short-acting {{beta-agonists}} like salbutamol or terbutaline or long-acting beta-agonists like <b>salmeterol</b> and formoterol dilate airways which {{relieve the}} symptoms thus reducing {{the severity of}} the reaction. Some patients also use it just before work to avoid a drop in the FEV1.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to alkalosis, other factors can cause transient shifting of potassium into cells, presumably by {{stimulation of the}} Na+/K+ pump. These hormones and medications include insulin, epinephrine, and other beta agonists (e.g. salbutamol or <b>salmeterol),</b> and xanthines (e.g. theophylline).|$|E
50|$|Currently {{available}} long-acting β2 {{adrenergic receptor}} agonists include <b>salmeterol</b> (inhaled or sustained-release oral), formoterol, bambuterol and some others. Combinations of inhaled steroids and these long-acting bronchodilators {{are becoming more}} widespread; the most common combination currently in use is fluticasone/salmeterol (brand names Seretide (UK) and Advair (U.S.)).|$|E
5000|$|Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor {{agonists}} (LABA) such as <b>salmeterol</b> and formoterol {{can improve}} asthma control, {{at least in}} adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids. In children this benefit is uncertain. When used without steroids they {{increase the risk of}} severe side-effects and even with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.|$|E
50|$|Two {{theories}} {{explain the}} long time {{of action for}} LABAs. The first explained the long action {{in terms of a}} putative “exosite” or “exoceptor” distinct from the β2-adrenoreceptor that long aliphatic tail of <b>salmeterol</b> binds to with high affinity. This allows the active saligenin head to angle on and off the receptor to activate it repeatedly. Formoterol does not have a long side chain like <b>salmeterol</b> to bind to the “exosite”, so this theory has been questioned. In 1994 Anderson. et al. introduced the plasmalemma diffusion microkinetic theory, explaining what happens to the β2- agonist in the cell membrane lipid bilayer and in the aqueous biophase closest to the binding site of the β2-adrenoceptor. It is postulated that the plasmalemma lipid bilayer of airway smooth muscles acts as a depot for β2-adrenoceptor agonists. β2-adrenoceptor agonists remain available to interact with the β2-adrenoceptor active site after having partitioned into the lipid bilayer.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{medication}} used is a beta agonist taken about 20 minutes before exercise. Some physicians prescribe inhaled anti-inflammatory mists such as corticosteroids or leukotriene antagonists, and mast cell stabilizers have also proven effective. A randomized crossover study compared oral montelukast with inhaled <b>salmeterol,</b> both given {{two hours before}} exercise. Both drugs had similar benefit but montelukast lasted 24 hours.|$|E
50|$|Beta-2 agonist is a {{drug that}} opens the {{bronchial}} airways and often helps build muscle. Agonist {{is often referred to}} as a drug that stimulates natural processes in the body and beta-2 to a cell receptor. They are clinically used to help asthma patients. Yet, the abuse of beta-3 agonists can be used as an enhancer. Examples of beta-2 agonists are: bambuterol, formoterol, salbutamol, and <b>salmeterol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1951 {{he joined}} the {{pharmaceutical}} company Glaxo Laboratories, moving to Smith Kline and French in 1953. In 1961 he became {{director of research at}} Allen and Hanburys, a subsidiary of Glaxo, and served as Glaxo's research and development director from 1978 until his official retirement in 1987. [...] Jack was known for heading a group which developed salbutamol, ranitidine, beclometasone, <b>salmeterol,</b> fluticasone propionate, ondansetron and sumatriptan.|$|E
50|$|When {{combined}} with inhaled steroids, β adrenoceptor agonists can improve symptoms. In children this benefit is uncertain {{and they may}} be potentially harmful. They should not be used without an accompanying steroid due to an increased risk of severe symptoms, including exacerbation in both children and adults. At least with formoterol, an increased risk appears to be present even when steroids are used and this risk has not been ruled out for <b>salmeterol.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Whilst {{the use of}} {{inhaled steroids}} and long acting beta-adrenoceptor {{agonists}} (LABA) are recommended in asthma guidelines for the resulting improved symptom control, concerns have been raised that <b>salmeterol</b> may increase the small risks of asthma deaths and this additional risk is not reduced with the additional use of inhaled steroids. [...] Other side effects from this drug combination may include increased blood pressure, change in heart rate, an irregular heartbeat, increased risk of osteoporosis, cataracts, and glaucoma.|$|E
5000|$|Wolkowitz et al. (2001) {{presented}} a 10-year-old male patient, with no prior psychiatric history, who showed significant declines in academic performance that began during a 5-week course of glucocorticoid treatment for acute asthma flare. The medications included prednisone, and methylprednisolone, plus albuterol, beclomethasone, dexamethasone, cromolyn, <b>salmeterol</b> and clarithromycin. Within days of beginning the glucocorticoid treatment, however, the patient {{began to show}} symptoms that included major depression, irritability, muscle weakness, and hallucinations ("stars" [...] or [...] "spots"). The patient had a fraternal twin brother, and the two previously performed in parallel academically, but following the steroid treatment the patient exhibited poor memory, attention, concentration, insomnia, and avoidance of eye contact. As a result, he began to fall behind his twin brother in academic, developmental, and social areas. Three years later, while still taking buspirone, albuterol, fluticasone and <b>salmeterol</b> inhalers, loratadine and theophylline, the boy showed gradual improvement, but MRI brain scans revealed that the patient's hippocampal volume was 19.5% smaller than that of his twin. His teachers reported continued deficits in memory function, new learning efficiency, verbal reasoning skills, organizational skills, attention, and concentration, deficits which were confirmed by neuropsychological testing.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} preparation fluticasone/salmeterol is a formulation containing fluticasone propionate and <b>salmeterol</b> xinafoate, used in {{the management}} of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Patent protection in the US expired in 2010, and European patent protection expired in 2013. However, the availability of a generic form of Advair in the United States may be significantly delayed because the Food and Drug Administration has not determined a standard for the bioequivalence of inhaled steroids in multi-dose inhalers or dry powder inhalers.|$|E
50|$|Stereoselective {{synthesis}} of terbutalin and salbutamol acetal {{can be done}} from O-protected-(R)-cyanohydrins. F. Effenberg, et al. describe {{a way for the}} synthesis. The main complications are to perform the deprotection step without racemization and to form a pure salt. A Ritter reaction can be used for an N-tertiary butylation. In this experiment deacetylation of (R)-salbutamol acetal was unsuccessful so it {{can not be used to}} obtain pure (R)-salbutamol. Figure 6 shows the main steps in the {{synthesis of}} <b>salmeterol</b> and terbutalin.|$|E

50|$|Pedro Cuatrecasas {{is known}} for the {{invention}} and development of affinity chromatography, a process utilized within the Aethlon HemopurifierTM. He {{was involved in the}} discovery, development and marketing registration of more than forty medicines. Some of those medicines include: zidovudine (AZT, AIDS), acyclovir (Zovirax, anti-herpes), permethrin (Rid, head and body lice), bupropion (Wellbutrin, antidepressant), colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf, infant acute respiratory distress), remifentanil (Ultiva, analgesic/anesthetic), sumatriptan (Imigran, migraine), <b>salmeterol</b> (Serement, asthma), tacrine (Cognex, Alzheimers), gabapentin (Neurontin, epilepsy and neuropathic pain), troglitazone (Rezulin, diabetes), and atorvastatin (Lipitor, cholesterol lowering).|$|E
50|$|While {{the use of}} inhaled LABAs {{are still}} {{recommended}} in asthma guidelines for the resulting improved symptom control, further concerns have been raised, by a large meta-analysis of the pooled results from 19 trials with 33,826 participants, that <b>salmeterol</b> may increase the small risks of asthma deaths, and this additional risk is not reduced with the additional use of inhaled steroids (e.g., as with the combination product fluticasone/salmeterol).This seems to occur because although LABAs relieve asthma symptoms, they also promote bronchial inflammation and sensitivity without warning.|$|E
