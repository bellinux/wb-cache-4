25|$|China {{has adopted}} a variety of {{measures}} to promote its foreign economic relations, maximizing the role of imports, exports, and foreign capital in economic development. Foreign trade organizations were reorganized, and control of imports and exports was relaxed or strengthened depending on the balance of trade {{and the level of}} foreign exchange reserves. Heavy purchases of foreign plants and equipment resulted in import restraint from 1980 to 1983. Because of the expansion of exports in the mid-1980s, a large foreign reserve surplus, and the decentralized management of foreign trade, imports surged. Huge, uncontrolled purchases of consumer goods led to trade deficits in 1984 and 1985, resulting in the introduction of an import and export licensing system, stricter controls on foreign exchange expenditures, and the devaluation of the yuan {{in order to reduce the}} trade deficit and ensure that machinery, equipment, and <b>semi-finished</b> <b>goods,</b> rather than consumer goods, were imported.

25|$|The modern, private {{enterprise}} economy of Belgium has capitalised on its central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. The first country to undergo an industrial revolution {{on the continent}} of Europe in the early 19th century, Belgium developed an excellent transportation infrastructure of ports, canals, railways, and highways to integrate its industry with that of its neighbors. Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flanders in the north, around Brussels and in the two biggest Walloon cities, Liège and Charleroi, along the sillon industriel. Belgium imports raw materials and <b>semi-finished</b> <b>goods</b> that are further processed and re-exported. Except for its coal, which is no longer economical to exploit, Belgium has few natural resources other than fertile soils. Nonetheless, most traditional industrial sectors are represented in the economy, including steel, textiles, refining, chemicals, food processing, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, electronics, and machinery fabrication. Despite the heavy industrial component, services account for 74.9% of GDP, while agriculture accounts for only 1% of GDP.|$|E

40|$|For the {{production}} of polymer based technical products, consumer goods, and packages forming technologies such as thermoforming processes are used commonly. The heat required for the thermoforming process is usually conveyed by radiation or contact heaters into the polymer sheet.

This paper provides an overview to an approach of WTD optimization. It is realized via a locally defined inhomogeneous heating of the <b>semi-finished</b> <b>good</b> related to the temperature dependent forming behavior of polymers. A new patented method for heating sheets through contact with ceramic thick-film-based resistor heaters will be presented.

Such agricultural activities in their present state do not add value to its products, thus unable to generate adequate revenue in the LDCs. This accounts for the underdevelopment and poverty of these nations.

This pertains to numerous interlinked processes, whose management is often linked to social system, international linkages, development of industry, market and market specifics. In modern times, the management of these processes is increasingly bound to globalization of production and market, moving of production to countries with cheaper labour force, environmental protection. The present Slovenian economy depends to a large extent on economies and corporate relations of the European Union and the world. Such inter-connectedness demands frequent transportation of <b>semi-finished</b> and finished <b>goods.</b> By providing timely delivery of goods, transportation consequently enables inter-organizational linkages and individual production, economic, market and other processes.

50|$|The Physiocrats {{are at the}} {{beginning}} of the anti-mercantilist movement. Quesnay’s argument against industry and international trade as alternatives to his doctrine is twofold. First, industry produces no gain in wealth; therefore, redirecting labor from agriculture to industry will in effect decrease the nation’s overall wealth. Additionally, population expands to fill available land and food supply; therefore, population must go down if the use of land does not produce food. Second, the basic premise of the Mercantilists is that a country must export more than it imports to gain wealth, but that assumes it has more of a tradeable resource than it needs for internal consumption. France did not have a colony with the ability to produce finished or <b>semi-finished</b> <b>goods</b> like England (i.e. India) or Holland (i.e. North America, Africa, South America). Its main colonial presence was in the Caribbean, southern North America, and southeast Asia, and like France, the colonies had agricultural-based economies. The only good which France had in enough excess to export was food; therefore, international trade based on industrial production would not yield as much wealth.|$|E
50|$|Cold-formed steel (CFS) is {{the common}} term for {{products}} made by rolling or pressing steel into <b>semi-finished</b> or finished <b>goods</b> at relatively low temperatures (cold working). Cold-formed steel goods are created by the working of steel billet, bar, or sheet using stamping, rolling (including roll forming), or presses to deform it into a usable product. Cold-worked steel products, such as cold-rolled steel (CRS) bar stock and sheet, are commonly used {{in all areas of}} manufacturing of durable goods, such as appliances or automobiles, but the phrase cold-formed steel is most prevalently used to describe construction materials. The use of cold-formed steel construction materials has become more and more popular since its initial introduction of codified standards in 1946. In the construction industry both structural and non-structural elements are created from thin gauges of sheet steel. These building materials encompass columns, beams, joists, studs, floor decking, built-up sections and other components. Cold-formed steel construction materials differ from other steel construction materials known as hot-rolled steel (see structural steel). The manufacturing of cold-formed steel products occurs at room temperature using rolling or pressing. The strength of elements used for design is usually governed by buckling. The construction practices are more similar to timber framing using screws to assemble stud frames.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Parts, which {{dimensions}} do {{not exceed}} the micro range are gaining more importance in today´s goods due to miniaturization and function compaction of products. Thus, fabrication methods for these special, very small parts attract notice because whole processes or at least process parameters cannot be transferred into micro range. Nevertheless, this {{does not necessarily mean}} that size-effects are always detrimental, as there are some processes which can only be carried out in micro range such as the laser-based micro upsetting process. The basic characteristics of this process are presented in this paper such as its self-aligning capability. Due to the fact that the maximum achievable upset ratio in single stage upsetting decreases with decreasing sample size, the material accumulation represents a very <b>good</b> <b>semi-finished</b> product (preform) being formed in a succeeding upsetting process. A temperature- and time controlled forming unit has been developed and is directly adapted to the laser system which is required to generate the preform. Thus, either a pre-defined temperature of the preform or the down time gives the initial signal to start the forming process. In this paper, a mathematical model is very briefly discussed to determine the process window for forming preforms at certain well defined temperatures regarding size-effects...|$|R
40|$|Ports are the {{backbone}} of the economy of countries endowed with shorelines and they spearhead foreign trade through the importation and exportation of goods to and from their domestic markets. The newly constructed Port of Ngqura will be the outlet for exports of <b>semi-finished</b> and finished <b>goods</b> produced in the Coega IDZ and will also receive raw material to be processed. Its position {{at the center of the}} world’s main trade routes, equidistant from American, European and the Pacific Rim regions makes the Coega IDZ the ideal location for any manufacturer adding value to raw materials, components and producing goods bound for the world markets. Traditionally the ports have been developed and operated by the government enterprises. Recently all these are changing in many countries all over the world, with more private participation in the development and operations of the ports. This evolution has entrusted Port Authorities in taking control over port planning, broad regulation of shipping and port operations, applying conventions, laws and rules. South Africa is no exception to these winds of change, hence the adoption of the new port bill in managing all ports in the country. The Port of Ngqura will then serve as a benchmark for all other ports, with a new management structure which will help the port to be efficient. The study addresses the model for the efficient strategic management of the Port of Ngqura. The model looks into placing the Port of Ngqura ahead of its competitors through efficiency in port management and operations. Efficient ports are catalysts, facilitators and attractors of international sea borne trade. Competitive efficiency is achieved by employing the best suited port equipments, facilities and technology to cater for customer’s needs and requirements. A successful port must be able to constantly adopt new roles in order to cope with the ever changing market environment...|$|R

Previous research was mainly focused on the level of <b>semi-finished</b> and/or finished <b>good</b> inventory under a base-stock policy. The control of WIP inventory was not considered. DPD may also improve response times under pull inventory control schemes, in which the amount of WIP is controlled directly. These systems can be modeled as closed queueing networks in which a fixed number of kanbans circulate as customers among each set of one or more processing stages.;In this study, we first developed models to analyze the performance of simple kanban and CONstant-WIP (CONWIP) controlled systems and set the number of kanbans to achieve a specified performance level. The models help us better understand the behavior of pull systems. The performance evaluation method uses nonlinear programming (NLP) models to bound the throughput for fixed number of kanbans or minimize the number of kanbans necessary to achieve a specified throughput. The model shows how random supplies and demands prevent equilibrium from occurring in a single-stage kanbans system.;We studied a model for a system of two products with unlimited supply and demand using three CONWIP loops to represent the common processes and the differentiated processes for each product. The same system after DPD has more common processes and fewer differentiated processes. The NLP model can determine numbers of kanbans for each loop to achieve specified throughput targets. Because the throughput bounds are not as tight as desired, we developed a heuristic algorithm that starts from the NLP solution and adjusts the kanbans using simulation to evaluate the performance. A comparison of the result of the heuristic algorithm for the systems with and without DPD indicates that DPD reduces the amount of WIP necessary to achieve a specified throughput. Furthermore, we show how models of systems with similar structure can be generalized...|$|R

Within Lean there is a great focus on identifying and eliminating waste. One of the seven wastes that Lean thinking strives to eliminate is the keeping of unnecessary inventory. The purpose ofthis study is to discover areas of improvement in a production flow and to give suggestions on these through finding and eliminating waste in the production environment. The production flow has been mapped using value stream mapping and has been analyzed accordingly. The specific production flow that has been mapped is located to a plant in the southern parts of Sweden and is operating within the plastic industry. At this plant, a specific product family has been mapped from raw material to shipment. In parallel with the empirical work literature studies have been conducted. The literature studies have sought to create a theoretical support for the result of the study. The current state at the factory has been mapped to create an understanding for the authors and the reader but also to give the study credibility with the company.  At the company observations and interviews have been conducted, mainly within two areas; the extrusion and the conversion into sheets. In addition to this thorough observations and calculations of inventory levels have been made, mainly in the <b>semi-finished</b> <b>goods</b> inventory. As the current state has been mapped thoroughly an analysis of the value stream has been conducted. Two areas have been focused upon in the analysis; the <b>semi-finished</b> <b>goods</b> inventory and the sheeting process. The observations and the analysis have shown disorganization in the inventory which causes materialto be forgotten and obsolete. In the sheeting process the analysis has shown that the lack of work instructions leads to variations in the cycle time and to variations in the mode of work. The inconsistency in the way work is conducted makes it difficult to obtain a common standard on quality. The analysis has resulted in an action plan which will lead to improvements in the production flow. In connection to this a future state map has been developed illustrating the desired state. The points of action are focused on the <b>semi-finished</b> <b>goods</b> inventory and the sheeting process. The major changes are the implementation of a FIFO-lane to increase the structure in the inventory and the development of work instructions for the sheeting process.
