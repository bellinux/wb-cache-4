40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether <b>syntactic</b> structure <b>analysis</b> (SSA) can predict survival outcome and chemotherapeutic response in ovarian carcinoma. <b>Syntactic</b> structure <b>analysis</b> parameters, blindly determined in archived hematoxylin and eosin sections of 132, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I to IV serous ovarian tumors, and clinicopathologic parameters were evaluated as to their univariate and multivariate prognostic value and ability to predict chemotherapy response as measured by changes in CA 125 levels. Univariate analysis revealed FIGO stage, tumor grade, preoperative CA 125, presence of ascites, extent of disease residuum, and the SSA parameters minimum spanning tree (min MST), maximum MST (max MST), percent connectivity to 1, and 2 nearest neighbors to be significant predictors of overall survival and disease-free survival. Tumor grade, FIGO stage, extent of disease residuum, presence of ascites, and percent connectivity to 2 nearest neighbors were found to be significant predictors of chemotherapy response. Multivariate analysis revealed extent of disease residuum to be a significant predictor for overall survival (P <= 0. 01) and prediction of chemotherapy response (P = 0. 05). International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage was a significant predictor for disease-free survival (P <= 0. 01). <b>Syntactic</b> structure <b>analysis</b> parameters did not retain independent significance. <b>Syntactic</b> structure <b>analysis</b> features can predict survival outcome and chemotherapy response in ovarian carcinoma but, with multivariate analysis, are overshadowed by FIGO stage and residual disease. ...|$|R
25|$|For example, {{there are}} many {{families}} of graphs that are close enough analogues of formal languages {{that the concept of}} a calculus is quite easily and naturally extended to them. Indeed, many species of graphs arise as parse graphs in the <b>syntactic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the corresponding families of text structures. The exigencies of practical computation on formal languages frequently demand that text strings be converted into pointer structure renditions of parse graphs, simply as a matter of checking whether strings are well-formed formulas or not. Once this is done, {{there are many}} advantages to be gained from developing the graphical analogue of the calculus on strings. The mapping from strings to parse graphs is called parsing and the inverse mapping from parse graphs to strings is achieved by an operation that is called traversing the graph.|$|E
500|$|Latin uses {{morphology}} {{to express}} the distinction between subject and object, whereas English uses word order. Another example of how syntactic rules contribute to meaning is the rule of inverse word order in questions, which exists in many languages. This rule explains why when in English, the phrase [...] "John is talking to Lucy" [...] is turned into a question, it becomes [...] "Who is John talking to?", and not [...] "John is talking to who?". The latter example {{may be used as}} a way of placing special emphasis on [...] "who", thereby slightly altering the meaning of the question. Syntax also includes the rules for how complex sentences are structured by grouping words together in units, called phrases, that can occupy different places in a larger syntactic structure. Sentences can be described as consisting of phrases connected in a tree structure, connecting the phrases to each other at different levels. To the right is a graphic representation of the <b>syntactic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the English sentence [...] "the cat sat on the mat". The sentence is analyzed as being constituted by a noun phrase, a verb, and a prepositional phrase; the prepositional phrase is further divided into a preposition and a noun phrase, and the noun phrases consist of an article and a noun.|$|E

2500|$|In <b>syntactic</b> <b>analysis,</b> a {{constituent}} {{is a word}} {{or a group of}} words that function(s) as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. [...] The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with phrase structure grammars, although dependency grammars also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using constituency tests. These tests manipulate some portion of a sentence and based on the result, clues are delivered about the immediate constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are phrases. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a head lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits {{one or more of the}} behaviors discussed below.|$|E
2500|$|A modular view of {{sentence}} processing {{assumes that}} each factor involved in sentence processing is computed {{in its own}} module, which has limited means of communication with the other modules. For example, <b>syntactic</b> <b>analysis</b> creation takes place without input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information, which are processed separately. A common assumption of modular accounts is a feed-forward architecture in which the output of one processing step is {{passed on to the}} next step without feedback mechanisms that would allow the output of the first module to be corrected. Syntactic processing is usually taken to be the most basic analysis step, which feeds into semantic processing and the inclusion of other information. A separate mental module parses sentences and lexical access happens first. Then, one syntactic hypothesis is considered at a time. There is no initial influence of meaning, or semantic. [...] Sentence processing is supported by a temporo-frontal network. Within the network, temporal regions subserve aspects of identification and frontal regions the building of syntactic and semantic relations. Temporal analyses of brain activation within this network support syntax-first models because they reveal that building of syntactic structure precedes semantic processes and that these interact only during a later stage.|$|E

2500|$|A modular view of {{sentence}} processing {{assumes that}} the stages involved in reading a sentence function independently in separate modules. These modulates have limited interaction with one another. For example, one influential theory of sentence processing, the garden-path theory, states that <b>syntactic</b> <b>analysis</b> takes place first. Under this theory as the reader is reading a sentence, he or she creates the simplest structure possible {{in order to minimize}} effort and cognitive load. This is done without any input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information. Hence, in the sentence [...] "The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable," [...] by the time the reader gets to the word [...] "examined" [...] he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parse. This commitment is made {{despite the fact that it}} results in an implausible situation; we know from experience that evidence can rarely if ever examine something. Under this [...] "syntax first" [...] theory, semantic information is processed at a later stage. It is only later that the reader will recognize that he or she needs to revise the initial parse into one in which [...] "the evidence" [...] is being examined. In this example, readers typically recognize their misparse by the time they reach [...] "by the lawyer" [...] and must go back and re-parse the sentence. This reanalysis is costly and contributes to slower reading times.|$|E

Similarity between concepts is predicted based on their level of hierarchy and their logical definition. Semantic similarities between concepts are evaluated by putting more emphasis on the logical operators used in defining concepts with less reference to concepts <b>syntactic</b> similarities <b>analysis.</b> The obtained result shows that a pure structural comparison based mainly on logical operators used in defining Ontologies concepts provides a better approximation than a comparison combining the logical and <b>syntactic</b> similarities <b>analysis</b> evaluated based on the edit distance function...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the "interlanguage" characteristics in Chinese-American college writers' texts. Also, the study sought to determine the connections between their "interlanguage" characteristics at the syntactic and discourse levels and their cultural values and linguistic backgrounds. The population of the study consisted of 3 randomly selected Chinese-American students who have taken freshman writing classes at UCLA. The methods employed in this case study were context-sensitive textual analysis and qualitative techniques. In the context-sensitive analysis, twenty-four academic papers by these students were analyzed from four angles [...] error <b>analysis,</b> <b>syntactic</b> fluency <b>analysis,</b> cohesive ties <b>analysis,</b> <b>syntactic</b> construction <b>analysis,</b> and discourse organization pattern analysis. In the use of qualitative techniques, twenty-seven interviews were carried out, two recordings of family dinner and party were analyzed, and answers to questionnaires were studied. Findings support the hypothesis of the study [...] there are characteristic features in the texts by Chinese-American writers, and these characteristics at both syntactic and discourse levels have correlations to their linguistic background and cultural values. At the discourse level, the essay organization in these students' essays tends to follow an indirect pattern as Kaplan has claimed in his 1966 's study. At the syntactic level, thekinds of errors occurring in these students' texts are the same as ESL Chinese students' errors, which supports the research findings by Zhu Hong, Hu, and other ESL researchers. Thus, the study has made two-fold connections [...] between Chinese-American college writers' texts and their cultural and contextual backgrounds and between ESL studies and composition studies. The implications of the research findings for the teaching of basic writing and future research in the field are discussed in the last chapter to enhance Chinese-American students' as well as their writing teachers' awareness of their writing characteristics and of connections between their cultural values and linguistic background.

METHODS: Haematoxylin and eosin stained sections from corporal and antral biopsy specimens (n = 139) from normal patients and from patients with nonatrophic gastritis and atrophic gastritis of grades 1, 2, and 3 (Sydney system) were assessed by image analysis system (Prodit 5. 2) and 11 syntactic structure features were derived. These included both line and connectivity features. RESULTS: <b>Syntactic</b> structure <b>analysis</b> was correlated with the semiquantitative grading system of gastric atrophy. The study showed significant reductions {{in the number of}} points and the length of MST in both body and antrum. The standard deviation of the length of MST was significantly increased in all grades of atrophy. The connectivity to two glands was the highest and most affected by the increased grade of atrophy. The reciprocal values of the Wiener, Randic, and Balaban indices showed significant changes in the volume of gland, abnormality in the shape of glands, and changes in irregularity and branching of the glands in both types of gastric mucosa. There was a complete separation in the MST, connectivity, and index values between low grade and high grade gastric atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Gastric atrophy was characterised by loss of the gland, variation in the volume, reduction in the neighbourhood, irregularity in spacing, and abnormality {{in the shape of the}} glands. (2) <b>Syntactic</b> structure <b>analysis</b> significantly differentiated minor changes in gastric gland (low grade atrophy) from high grade atrophy of clinical significance.
