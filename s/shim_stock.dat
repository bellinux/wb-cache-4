An analytical model was derived to describe the transformation of 3 D cylindrical features to 2 D through-cut features. Conventional hydrostatic designs and theory were adapted for use in 3 DWN bearings. A proof-of-concept was designed, constructed, and tested. Although contact between the shaft and bore was observed during testing, the fluid film stiffness matched theory within 1. 6 % after accounting for the contact stiffness. The mean bore diameter was measured to be within 0. 03 % of the mandrel diameter with errors that lie within 5 [sigma] of the tolerable error range {{in the front of the}} bearing and 2 [sigma] in the rear.

The level of torque required to drive the "chip" through the gear mesh was measured. From the data gathered, chip size sufficient to jam the mechanism can be determined. INTRODUCTION In some space mechanisms the loading can be so high that there is some possibility that a gear chip might be liberated while in operation of the mechanism [1 - 5]. Also, due to the closely packed nature of some space mechanisms and the fact that a space grease is used for lubrication, chips that are released can then be introduced to other gear meshes within this mechanism. In this instance, it is desirable to know the consequences of a gear chip entering in between meshing gear teeth. To help provide some understanding, a series of bench-top experiments was conducted to engage chips of simulated and gear material fragments into a meshing gear pair. One purpose of the experiments was to determine the relationship of chip size to the torque required to rotate the gear set through the mesh cycle. The second purpose was to determine the condition of the gear chip material after engagement by the meshing gears, primarily to determine if the chip would break into pieces and to observe the motion of the chip as the engagement was completed.

40|$|Hearing loss is {{a common}} chronic {{condition}} among older adults. The most common form is sensorineural hearing loss, which is caused by damage to the hair cells of the inner ear. Physicians have little ability to reliably access the complex anatomy of the inner ear and thus are unable to cure the most common forms of hearing loss. Two generations of an image-guided robotic system for targeted, atraumatic needle access to the cochlea of the inner ear were developed. Both systems utilize a custom scanning end-effector that sweeps a single-element ultrasound transducer through a circular arc to construct a two-dimensional scan of the chambers of the cochlea. 150 �m O. D. stainless steel micro-needles were developed that mount alongside the ultrasound transducer. Image-guided needle placement was achieved by selecting a point on an ultrasound image and carrying {{out a series of}} global moves of the linear base stages of the robotic system to place the needle tip at the selected point.

40|$|Introduction: One of {{the limits}} to {{characterization}} of tissues at the microscopic level is the substantial {{costs associated with the}} instrumentation required for such investigations. The use of strain gages for displacement or force measurements can be adapted to this microscopic scale provided the gages are incorporated into a transducer consisting of a curved geometry. Materials and Methods: Uniaxial strain gages 13 mm (L) × 6 mm (W) were secured to 0. 2 -mm thick brass <b>shim</b> <b>stock</b> fabricated to yield a 12. 5 -mm diameter semicircle with mounting tabs on either end. The terminal ends of the strain gage mounting pads were connected to an adjustable strain gage amplifier with adjustable gain and offset. For displacement calibration, the transducer was secured to the jaws of a digital caliper. Caliper displacement was set to ± 0. 25 mm increments from 0 to a maximum of ± 1. 5 mm. In this configuration, positive represents tension. Amplifier Gains were set to 500, 1000, and 5000 to observe nonlinearity. For each of three displacement calibration runs, output voltage from the transducer was recorded at each distance with the mean output at absolute distances averaged across each of three runs for each of six transducers. Using the same transducers, a mass balance was used to identify the unique individual mass associated with a total of 10 masses to within ± 10 μg. The masses were sequentially secured to the transducer and the respective output voltage recorded. Amplifier Gains were set to 500, 1000 and 5000. For each of three force calibration runs, output voltage from the transducer was recorded with respect to the force generated by the suspended masses. The mean output across each of three runs for each of six transducers was subjected to linear regression. Results and Discussion: All transducers displayed good linearity when calibrated for displacement with regression R 2 values of 0. 9994, 0. 9967, and 0. 9941 for amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. Further, in displacement mode, the transducers provided a mean output of 0. 66, 1. 01, and 3. 86 V/mm at amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. In force mode, regression R 2 in excess of 0. 9995 were observed over all amplifier gain settings examined. When employed as force transducers, the devices provided mean outputs of 0. 60, 1. 15, and 5. 85 V/N at amplifier gains of 500, 1000, and 5000, respectively. The response of these devices to either applied displacement or force permits the use of a single device type to be used as either a displacement or force transducer. The electrical output in either mode at modest amplification gains of 5000 combined with excellent linearity affords the use of these devices for studies where characterization of tissues requires mN and μm level resolution. Conclusions: A transducer employing a strain gage had been configured so as to function as either a displacement or force measuring instrument. The resulting device displays high linearity and electrical output even at modest amplifier gains...|$|E
40|$|Fundamental Studies of Tin Whiskering in Micro{{electronics}} Finishes Abstract 	Common electronics materials, such as tin, copper, steel, and brass, are ambient reactive under {{common use}} conditions, {{and as such}} are prone to corrosion. During the early 1940 s, reports of failures due to electrical shorting of components caused by `whisker' (i. e., filamentary surface protrusion) growth on many surface types - including the aforementioned metals - began to emerge. Lead alloying of tin (3 - 10 % by weight, typically in the eutectic proportion) eliminated whiskering risk for decades, until the July 2006 adoption of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive was issued by the European Union. This directive, which has since been adopted by California and parts of China, severely restricted the use of lead (< 1000 ppm) in all electrical and electronics equipment being placed on the EU market, imposing the need for developing reliable new "lead-free" alternatives to SnPb. In spite of the abundance of modern-day anecdotes chronicling whisker-related failures in satellites, nuclear power stations, missiles, pacemakers, and spacecraft navigation equipment, pure tin finishes are still increasingly being employed today, and the root cause(s) of tin whiskering remains elusive. 	 This work describes a series of structured experiments exploring the fundamental relationships between the incidence of tin whiskering (as dependent variable) and numerous independent variables. These variables included deposition method (electroplating, electroless plating, template-based electrochemical synthesis, and various physical vapor deposition techniques, including resistive evaporation, electron beam evaporation, and sputtering), the inclusion of microparticles and organic contamination, the effects of sample geometry, and nanostructuring. Key findings pertain to correlations between sample geometry and whisker propensity, and also to the stress evolution across a series of 4 "-diameter silicon wafers of varying thicknesses {{with respect to the}} degree of post-metallization whiskering. Regarding sample geometry, it was found that smaller, thinner substrates displayed a more rapid onset of whiskering immediately following metallization. Changes in wafer-level stress were not found to correlate with whiskering morphology (number, density, length) after 6 weeks of aging. This result points either to the irrelevance of macrostress in the substrate/film composite, or to a difference in whiskering mechanism for rigid substrates (whose stress gradient over time is significant) when compared with thinner, flexible susbtrates (whose stress is less variable with time). Organic contamination was found to have no appreciable effect when explicitly introduced. Furthermore, electron-beam evaporated films whiskered more readily than films deposited via electroplating from baths containing organic "brighteners. " Beyond such findings, novel in themselves, our work is also unique in that we emphasize the "clean" deposition of tin (with chromium adhesion layers and copper underlayers) by vacuum-based physical vapor deposition, to circumvent the question of contamination entirely. By employing silicon substrates exclusively, we have distinguished ourselves from other works (which, for example, use copper coupons fabricated from rolled <b>shim</b> <b>stock)</b> because we have better sample-to-sample consistency in terms of material properties, machinability, and orientation...|$|E
30|$|Fourar et al. (1993) {{conducted}} air–water flow {{experiments in}} three horizontal rough-walled fractures. In {{one of the}} models, the two surfaces (plates) were in contact whereas in the other two, the surfaces were separated using a spacer (gasket). The surface roughness was established by applying a 0.3 -mm-thick layer of epoxy cement and gluing a layer of 1  mm in diameter glass beads on both glass plates. The water saturation was calculated using the volume balance method. They found that the experimental relative permeability to air and water is not linearly dependent on the saturation. The best data fit to the experimental data was obtained by the homogenous single-phase model (HSPM). The HSPM approximates two-phase flow by a single-phase approximation where the single-phase effective properties are determined from {{the properties of the}} two phases. Similar to flow in pipes, a correlation between the friction factor and average Reynolds number was used to predict the pressure drop in each model configuration. Persoff and Pruess (1995) evaluated the flow of gas and water through a natural rough-walled rock fracture and three transparent epoxy resin replica models. Relative permeability measurements indicated phase interference between the two phases. This was counter to the view (which is adapted in some reservoir engineering and numerical simulation applications) that relative permeability of each phase is equal to its saturation, that is, the relative permeability curves are straight with no immobile phase saturations. Diomampo (2001) conducted a study on the relative permeability of nitrogen–water system in a rough-walled fracture. A smooth-walled model was roughened by inserting a wire mesh between glass (top) and aluminum (bottom) plates. Similar to the smooth-walled fracture, each phase traveled through the fracture in a localized continuous flow path, however, the stability of the path heavily depended on the nitrogen–water flow rate ratio. At low gas–water ratios, invading water blocked the gas path, leaving behind discontinuous gas bubbles. In contrast to this, more stable and wide flow paths of gas were formed at high gas–water flow rate ratios. The data fit obtained using the homogeneous single-phase model did not provide a satisfactory representation of nitrogen–water flow in the fracture. However, she observed similar flow structures on both the smooth- and rough-walled fractures, which differ from the flow structures suggested by Fourar and Bories (1995). Chen and Horne (2004), and Chen (2005) found that the flow structures of gas and water flow in rough-walled fracture is more scattered and tortuous compared to the ones observed with the smooth-walled fracture. Also, they observed phase trapping of gas and water due to fracture aperture variations and to capillary pressure effects. Steam and water flow in smooth-walled fracture demonstrated multiple unstable flow patterns whereas in the nitrogen and water system, each phase tended to form its own flow path with blocking and unblocking by the other phase. Chen and Horne (2006) defined channel tortuosity to quantify the flow paths created by each phase in rough-walled fractures. They found that the magnitude of the flow channel tortuosity increases when the heterogeneity of the fracture increases. Pan (1999) studied oil–water flow in rough-walled fractures. His apparatus consisted of two plates of roughened Plexiglas. The roughness was created by gluing glass beads of known mesh size on both inner faces of the two plates. <b>Shim</b> <b>stock</b> of varying thickness was inserted at the periphery for fracture aperture adjustment. Over all of the conditions of his experimental runs, he observed a dispersed flow regime and found that the relative permeability of oil is a function of oil saturation, viscosity ratio, and flow pattern whereas the relative permeability to water depends mostly on water saturation. The effects of surface roughness on relative permeability to oil and water were more pronounced for smaller fracture aperture and at higher pressure gradient, i.e., the relative permeabilities and flow patterns observed in the rough-walled fracture with larger aperture were similar to the ones observed with the smooth-walled fracture. The results of previous experimental studies of multiphase flow in roughened model fracture demonstrates that the flow structure is complex and that capillary pressure effects and flow path tortuosity affect phase trapping and, consequently, relative permeability, that is, phase flow interference occurs.|$|E
