40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{recommended}} {{approach to}} screening for primary aldosteronism (PA) in at-risk populations {{is to determine}} the ratio of aldosterone concentration (serum (SAC) /plasma (PAC)) to renin measured in plasma as activity (PRA) or concentration (DRC). However, lack of assay <b>standardisation</b> <b>mandates</b> the need for method-specific decision thresholds and clinical validation in the local population. AimThe study objective was to establish method-specific aldosterone: renin ratio (ARR) cut-offs for PA in men and women using the IDS-iSYS® assay system (IDS plc). MethodsA prospective cohort study design was used. PAC and DRC were measured immunochemically in ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma on the IDS-iSYS® instrument. ResultsA total of 437 subjects (218 men, 219 women) were recruited including: healthy normotensive volunteers (n= 266) and women taking the oral contraceptive pill (OCP; n= 15); patients with essential hypertension (EH; n= 128); confirmed PA (n= 16); adrenal cortical carcinoma (ACC; n= 3); Addison's disease (AD; n= 4) and phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL; n= 5). In this population, an ARR cut-off at > 37. 4 pmol/mIU provided 100 % diagnostic sensitivity, 96 % specificity and positive likelihood ratio for PA of 23 : 1. When the ARR decision threshold was stratified according to gender, a cut-off of > 26. 1 pmol/mIU in men and > 113. 6 pmol/mIU in women resulted in diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that decision thresholds for PA should not only be method-specific but also gender-specific. However, given the small number of PA patients (n= 16), particularly women (n= 4), further validation through a prospective study with a larger PA cohort is required before the thresholds presented here could be recommended for routine clinical use...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn-line {{with the}} {{requirements}} of the International Organisation for <b>Standardisation</b> (ISO) that <b>mandated</b> the shift to ISO 9001 : 2008, a merger of the ISO QMS for undergraduate and graduate programmes was implemented at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) in 2009. The merger is expected to benefit UKM as it will optimise utilisation of resources. A year later, a study was conducted to assess staffs’ awareness and acceptance of the QMS and to assess the effectiveness of the merger. The study was carried out using questionnaires with a Likert scale rating. The questionnaires were distributed to all faculties and four categories of staffs were identified as respondents namely academicians with administrative posts, academicians without administrative posts, administrative staffs and support staffs. Results of this preliminary study indicated that all categories of staffs particularly the support staffs concurred that the merger provides positive implications to time management and documentation. Besides, commands and procedures on ISO have become more effective. Results from this study will be used as inputs for further improvement to UKM's quality management system...|$|R
