5|$|Finland {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern Finland was the staging area for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. Southern Finland was <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> responsibility of the Finnish Army. The goal of the Finnish forces was, at first, to recapture Finnish Karelia at Lake Ladoga {{as well as the}} Karelian Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Vyborg.|$|E
5|$|Hugh was {{the nephew}} of {{brothers}} King Stephen of England and Henry of Blois, born as the younger son of Hugh III, lord of Puiset and Agnes, sister of Stephen and Henry. Agnes' parents were Stephen, Count of Blois and Adela, a daughter of King William the Conqueror. His paternal family held a lordship in Northern France. Hugh was born in approximately 1125, for in 1153 with his election as bishop he was <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> canonical age limit for bishops of 28. Henry acquired for Hugh the office of archdeacon in the see of Winchester, sometime before 1139.|$|E

5|$|The Hessians, in {{the center}} {{under the command of}} General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines {{stationed}} at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan. The Hessian brigades did not attack, as they were waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who {{were in the process of}} outflanking the American lines at that time. The Americans were <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four-hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> control of King Abimelech {{as it was in}} the days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back to all of the wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon, {{satellites}} {{revealed that}} Laura {{had developed a}} deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80mi (130km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> influence of an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura {{was on the verge}} of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 40.6°N. Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.|$|E

5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her {{for any length of}} time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to restart the game in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} planned to send the brigade—which had been renamed the 1st Commando Brigade in late 1944—to India, however, {{the effect of the}} German Ardennes Offensive {{prevented}} this and in January 1945, <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> command of Brigadier Derek Mills-Roberts, they crossed the English Channel by sea and landed in the Netherlands from where they were deployed to Asten on the Maas. By the time they arrived the German advance had been largely halted and it was not until 23 January that the brigade was engaged in any large-scale operations. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Lewis, that night No. 6 Commando joined Operation Blackcock. Lewis had taken over from Courtenay-Coade after the latter had experienced complications from the head injury he had suffered in France earlier. As part of Blackcock, the unit advanced over the ice-covered Juliana Canal and took up positions at Maasbracht, in support of No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando's advance on St. Joostburg.|$|E
5|$|No.114 MFCU {{was rapidly}} reduced in size {{following}} {{the end of}} the war. It departed Tarakan for Australia on 3December 1945 with No.78 Wing, arriving at RAAF Station Deniliquin, New South Wales, on the 14th. <b>Still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> wing's control, it relocated to RAAF Station Schofields on 31May and then to RAAF Station Williamtown on 1August, disbanding on 1April 1948. No.114 MFCU was re-established under a newly organised No.78 Wing on 24January 1949—"in name only", however, as it remained non-operational. It began training in late 1955 prior to anticipated reactivation, and was renamed No.114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit (MCRU) on 12March 1956. It relocated to RAAF Dubbo and stood up as an independent unit on 14November.|$|E

5|$|The Frankish {{kingdom in}} {{northern}} Gaul split into kingdoms called Austrasia, Neustria, and Burgundy during the 6th and 7th centuries, {{all of them}} ruled by the Merovingian dynasty, who were descended from Clovis. The 7th century was a tumultuous period of wars between Austrasia and Neustria. Such warfare was exploited by Pippin (d. 640), the Mayor of the Palace for Austrasia who became the power behind the Austrasian throne. Later {{members of his family}} inherited the office, acting as advisers and regents. One of his descendants, Charles Martel (d. 741), won the Battle of Poitiers in 732, halting the advance of Muslim armies across the Pyrenees. Great Britain was divided into small states dominated by the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia, Wessex, and East Anglia, which were descended from the Anglo-Saxon invaders. Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales and Scotland were <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> control of the native Britons and Picts. Ireland was divided into even smaller political units, usually known as tribal kingdoms, under the control of kings. There were perhaps as many as 150 local kings in Ireland, of varying importance.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season a {{new ground}} {{was built for}} Hull City {{across the road from}} the cricket ground. <b>Still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in {{the top half of the}} table. They came close to promotion in the 1909–10 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in the top half of the table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the bottom half in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.|$|E

The foregut, stomach and {{intestine}} run a little below the midline of the body and the anus is {{at the tip of the}} tail. Above the gut and separated from the gut by mesenchyme is the rhynchocoel, a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. The rhynchocoel of class Anopla has an orifice a little to the front of the mouth, but <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> front of the body. In the other class, Enopla, the mouth and the front of the rhynchocoel share an orifice. The rhynchocoel is a coelom, as it is lined by epithelium.|$|E

5|$|The {{peace of}} Amiens {{was a brief}} {{interlude}} in the wars with Revolutionary France, and in 1803 the War of the Third Coalition began. Temeraire had deteriorated substantially during her long period spent laid up, and she was taken into dry dock on 22 May to repair and refit, starting with the replacement of her copper sheathing. Work was delayed when a heavy storm hit Plymouth in January 1804, causing appreciable damage to Temeraire, but was finally completed by February 1804, {{at a cost of}} £16,898. Command was assigned to Captain Eliab Harvey, and he arrived to take up his commission on 1 January 1804. On putting to sea he sailed to join the Channel Fleet, <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> overall command of Admiral Cornwallis.|$|E
5|$|Through {{his social}} {{contacts}} Widmerpool secures {{a job in}} the politico-legal department of the Donners-Brebner industrial conglomerate, a post that brings him into close contact with Sir Magnus Donners, for whom he exhibits a respect bordering on reverence. He develops a talent for intrigue, which irritates Sir Magnus to the extent that Widmerpool is asked to leave the organisation. He joins a City firm of bill-brokers and <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> age of 30, becomes an influential and respected figure in the financial world. By the late 1930s, Widmerpool is advising Donners-Brebner again. Just before the outbreak of war in September 1939, he oversees a scheme on behalf of Donners to corner the Turkish market in chromite and emerges unscathed when the project collapses.|$|E
5|$|With López gone, {{control of}} the CNOC was now fought over by anarchists and Communists. By 1930-1, CNOC had {{been taken over by}} the Communists, with anarchists being turned over to the police, <b>still</b> <b>under</b> <b>the</b> control of Machado. Many of the Spanish anarchists {{involved}} {{decided to go back to}} Spain. Following the new government's passage of a law dictating that at least half of an employer's employees be Cuban-born, a large number of Cuba's Spanish-born anarchists were forced by economic necessity to return to Spain, which greatly diminished the clout of the anarchist movement in Cuba. However, soon the Juventud Libertaria (Libertarian Youth) was founded by a younger generation of anarchists, and by 1936, after the start of the Spanish Civil War, Cuban anarchists had founded the Solidaridad Internacional Antifascista (SIA), to help send money and arms to the CNT and FAI. Many Cuban-born anarchists went to Spain to join the fight, alongside many Spanish-born anarchists exiled from Cuba.|$|E
