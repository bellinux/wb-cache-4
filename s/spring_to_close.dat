25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead valve for exhaust. Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of valve <b>spring)</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the exhaust valve. These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs.|$|E
60|$|The girl saw {{the white}} man leap to one side to escape the furious cut aimed at him by his foe, and then she saw him turn with the agility of a panther and <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> {{quarters}} with the wild man. Byrne's left arm went around the Malay's neck, and with his heavy right fist he rained blow after blow upon the brown face.|$|E
50|$|Because of this cam hold-open, {{the pistol}} does not close when the clip is removed. However, drawing back {{slightly}} on the breechblock will ride {{it over the}} cam, and releasing it will permit the recoil <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the action.|$|E
5000|$|A {{short film}} titled [...] "Jesus Green Pool" [...] was {{produced}} in 2004 by amateur director Chris Cox. The film emphasizes the seasonal nature of the pool by documenting a single summer at the pool; from opening in the <b>Spring,</b> <b>to</b> <b>closing</b> in the Autumn. It was shown at the Cambridge Film Festival {{in the summer of}} 2005. and the full version of the film is available to view freely online.|$|R
50|$|The Post Office Box was a Wheatstone bridge-style {{testing device}} with pegs and <b>spring</b> arms <b>to</b> <b>close</b> {{electrical}} circuits and measure {{properties of the}} circuit under test.|$|R
25|$|Ducati is also {{famous for}} using the {{desmodromic}} valve system championed by engineer and designer Fabio Taglioni, though the firm has also used engines that use valve <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> their valves. In the early days, Ducati reserved the desmodromic valve heads for its higher performance bikes and its race bikes. These valves do not suffer from valve float at high engine speeds, thus a desmodromic engine is capable of far higher revolutions than a similarly configured engine with traditional spring-valve heads.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{are built}} without a door closer. The motor opens {{and closes the}} door through {{reducing}} gears. The operator may or may not include a return <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the door in case of power failure while the door is open.|$|E

50|$|A {{rocker arm}} (in {{the context of}} an {{internal}} combustion engine of automotive, marine, motorcycle and reciprocating aviation types) is an oscillating lever that conveys radial movement from the cam lobe into linear movement at the poppet valve to open it. One end is raised and lowered by a rotating lobe of the camshaft (either directly or via a tappet (lifter) and pushrod) while the other end acts on the valve stem. When the camshaft lobe raises the outside of the arm, the inside presses down on the valve stem, opening the valve. When the outside of the arm is permitted to return due to the camshafts rotation, the inside rises, allowing the valve <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the valve.|$|E

50|$|Pneumatic {{valve springs}} are metal bellows filled with {{compressed}} air {{used as an}} alternative to the metal wire <b>springs</b> used <b>to</b> <b>close</b> valves in high-speed internal combustion engines. This system was introduced in the mid-1980s in Renault turbocharged 1.5 litre Formula One engines.|$|R

40|$|An energy {{absorbing}} airbag system includes {{one or more}} vent valve assemblies for controlling the release of airbag inflation gases to maintain inflation gas pressure within an airbag at a substantially constant pressure during a ride-down of an {{energy absorbing}} event. Each vent valve assembly includes a cantilever spring that is flat in an unstressed condition and that has a free end portion. The cantilever spring is secured to an exterior surface of the airbag housing and flexed to cause the second free end portion of the cantilever spring to be pressed, with a preset force, against a vent port or a closure covering the vent port to seal the vent port until inflation gas pressure within the airbag reaches a preselected value determined by the preset force whereupon the free end portion of the cantilever spring is lifted from the vent port by the inflation gases within the airbag to vent the inflation gases from within the airbag. The resilience of the cantilever spring maintains a substantially constant pressure within the airbag during a ride-down portion of an energy absorbing event by causing the cantilever spring to vent gases through the vent port whenever {{the pressure of the}} inflation gases reaches the preselected value and by causing the cantilever <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the vent port whenever the pressure of the inflation gases falls below the preselected value...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to mechanical friction, considerable force {{is required to}} compress the valve <b>springs</b> used <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the engine's valves. This can amount to an estimated 25% of an engine's total output at idle, reducing overall efficiency. Some approaches to reclaiming this [...] "wasted" [...] energy include: ...|$|R
50|$|Bash valves {{are usually}} held closed by the {{pressure}} of fluid in the reservoir behind them. There may be a light <b>spring</b> <b>to</b> assist <b>closing</b> when the reservoir is empty. For this reason they are used as inlet valves, not exhaust. An exhaust bash valve would have the cylinder pressure and the piston actuation both acting to open it, with nothing <b>to</b> <b>close</b> it.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} IOE layouts used atmospheric {{inlet valves}} which were held {{closed with a}} weak spring and were opened by the pressure differential created when the piston went down on the inlet stroke. This worked well with low-speed early engines and {{had the benefit of}} being very simple and cheap, but the weak <b>spring</b> was unable <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the valve fast enough as the RPM's of engines increased, necessitating stronger springs, which in turn needed direct mechanical action to open, as the atmospheric pressure of 15psi limits the total force available from creating a pressure differential, meaning that a 15-lb spring is the strongest that can be used (for practical purposes, {{it would have to be}} lighter still). When the limits of this system were reached, the design was improved without substantial changes to the head casting by adding a mechanical system to open the inlet valves and stronger <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> them. In both cases, the exhaust valves were in the block and were opened by contact with a camshaft through a tappet or valve lifter and closed by springs.|$|R

50|$|There is {{also the}} storm door and screen door {{variation}} of the door closer: As the name implies, these piston shaped closers are used on storm, security, and screen doors which give the home an extra {{line of defense against}} weather, intruders, and insects. Whereas interior closers typically use hydraulics, storm door closers are more typically pneumatic, using air and <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the door. Storm Door closers generally have a small metal washer on the rod that is used <b>to</b> lock the <b>closer</b> in the open position when moving stuff in or out, but more recent models such as the Touch 'n Hold door closer have a button to actuate the hold open feature to make this process easier.|$|R

50|$|Fire dampers are passive fire {{protection}} products used in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts {{to prevent the spread}} of fire inside the ductwork through fire-resistance rated walls and floors. Fire/smoke dampers are similar to fire dampers in fire resistance rating, and also prevent the spread of smoke inside the ducts. When a rise in temperature occurs, the fire damper closes, usually activated by a thermal element which melts at temperatures higher than ambient but low enough to indicate the presence of a fire, allowing <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the damper blades. Fire dampers can also close following receipt of an electrical signal from a fire alarm system utilising detectors remote from the damper, indicating the sensing of heat or smoke in the building occupied spaces or in the HVAC duct system.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{his return}} to Illinois, he {{accepted}} an offer to join his brothers-in-law, Lemuel and William Bartlett, in an operation in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri. Soon after, however, Cox was appointed United States Deputy Surveyor to subdivide {{a portion of the}} Black Hawk Purchase in the Wisconsin Territory. Cox settled in White Oak <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> be <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> his work. Cox surveyed ten townships in what is now Jackson County, Iowa through the fall of 1837.|$|R
5000|$|Sunday was {{highlighted}} by a midday show near the Moon Tower at Zilker Park, with Shinyribs opening. Notably, fans staged an impromptu takeover {{of their own}} {{in the middle of}} the song [...] "Youuuuu," [...] gathering in front of the stage for a large group photo while the band played. Afterward, many fans went for a swim at the Barton <b>Springs</b> Pool <b>to</b> <b>close</b> out the weekend.|$|R
50|$|For years, town {{leaders have}} become {{increasingly}} confident that Holly <b>Springs</b> is positioned <b>to</b> experience high growth, propelled by the economic engine of Research Triangle Park (RTP). At a distance of 18 mi, Holly <b>Springs</b> is <b>close</b> <b>to</b> RTP.|$|R
50|$|There is a tufa <b>spring</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the tunnel. Water {{containing}} lime {{emerges from}} underground. It flows over rocks and plants {{and they become}} covered with limescale. This is an area for liverworts and mosses.|$|R
30|$|Among {{different}} water resources, only {{hot springs}} show difference in chemical type, while {{rest of the}} water sources have more or less same chemical type. The significant different between <b>springs</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> urban sites and away is their salt content. Typical EC of the springs is <  100 μS/cm, but <b>springs</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> urban centres have slightly more EC about 200 μS/cm and above (T 9 and T 20). Hand pump samples show hydrochemical patterns similar <b>to</b> that of <b>spring</b> water. HP located at high altitude show low TDS while HPs located near urban centre show relatively higher TDS. Only one treated water samples was collected from the study area, which shows low EC similar <b>to</b> <b>spring</b> water.|$|R
50|$|A dashpot is {{a common}} {{component}} in a door <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> prevent it from slamming shut. A <b>spring</b> applies force <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the door, and the dashpot forces fluid to flow through an orifice between reservoirs (the orifice is often adjustable), which slows {{the motion of the}} door.|$|R
50|$|The {{shores of}} the lake are mainly covered in beech woods. At {{the foot of the}} slopes are seepage <b>springs.</b> <b>Close</b> <b>to</b> the lake are alder carrs and marshes. The shore itself is mainly fringed by reeds and quaking bog vegetation.|$|R
5000|$|Increasing {{operational}} {{speed is}} also, theoretically, a simple {{change to the}} engine design. However, at high operating speeds the valves do not completely close before the cam opens them again, a problem called [...] "valve float". Valve float allows gases in the cylinder to escape through the partially open valve, reducing the engine efficiency. Increasing valve <b>spring</b> pressure <b>to</b> <b>close</b> the valves faster led to rapid cam wear and increased friction, reducing overall performance by more than any horsepower gained.|$|R
50|$|Mansfield is {{well known}} in hang gliding circles for its {{favorable}} Summer weather. Manfield is also home to high-power rocketry launch events from <b>Spring</b> <b>to</b> Fall. Its <b>close</b> proximity <b>to</b> the Grand Coulee Dam and Lake Chelan allow for aquatic recreation. In Winter, Mansfield's surrounding land provides opportunities for cross country skiers and snowmobilers.|$|R
5000|$|Below the Precipice Sandstone, the Gorge's {{floor is}} {{formed by the}} {{uppermost}} layer of the Bowen Basin, the Moolayember Formation. The impermeability of this layer allows the water generated by Carnarvon Gorge's <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> remain <b>close</b> <b>to,</b> or above, the surface - a significant interplay {{in terms of the}} availability of water within the Gorge's ecosystems. Carnarvon Creek, whose flow has only been known to stop twice since records commenced, is an incredibly reliable source of water. In times of drought, it turns the Gorge into an oasis which has supported forms of life long since passed from the semi-arid ecosystems surrounding it.|$|R
50|$|The University {{proposed}} in <b>spring</b> 2012 <b>to</b> <b>close</b> {{the press and}} terminate its ten employees in order to end the University's subsidy to the press, estimated by the University administration as $400,000 per year and by outside critics of the closure decision as under $250,000 a year. The decision was reversed in August 2012 after public outcry. As part of the reorganization the Press now reports up to the main Columbia campus rather than the University of Missouri System. A new director was hired in 2013.|$|R
