Contrary to expectation, none of the balloons deflated when the needle point entered the extradural or sub-arachnoid spaces. The balloon pressure varied rhythmically in synchrony with respiration and cardiac pulsations. The final balloon pressure, extradural space pressure and subarachnoid pres-sure were equal. The {{results suggest that the}} extradural pressure is positive and of the same magnitude as the prevailing lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure. Jugular venous compression, ven-tilation with carbon dioxide and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) produce a rapid increase in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. These stimuli also produced a measurable increase in the lumbar extradural pressure. Jugular venous compression increased the mean lumbar extradural pressure by 6. 8 (3 - 10) mm Hg and ventilation with carbon dioxide increased it by 10 (5 - 1 2. 5) mm Hg.

40|$|Background/Aim. Several {{combined}} spinal-epidural (CSE) anesthesia {{techniques have}} been described. This {{study was designed}} to compare the single space (“needle-throughneedle”) technique (SST) and the double distant space technique (DDS) with regards to the time needed for the procedure, patient discomfort during the procedure and patient's preference technique. Methods. This prospective, randomized single-blind study included 156 patients undergoing colorectal surgery under general anesthesia and CSE. All neuraxial blocks were performed before general anesthesia induction. DDS group of patients had thoracic epidural catheter placed at T 6 - 7 or T 7 - 8, followed by subarachnoid injection at the L 2 - 3 interspace. The SST group of patients had a single injection using the needle-through-needle technique (Espocan® needle) at L 2 - 3. The epidural catheter was used for postoperative analgesia for 72 hours. Body habitus, spinal anatomy and spinal landmarks were assessed preoperatively. The number of epidural and <b>spinal</b> <b>punctures,</b> the feeling that the dura is perforated (dural perforation click) and the time needed to perform CSE were also recorded. Complications during epidural catheter placement and perioperative and postoperative epidural catheter function and patient preference for the anesthetic procedure were recorded. Results. Epidural and subarachnoid spaces were successfully identified in all the patients. Duration of CSE procedure, the number of <b>spinal</b> <b>punctures,</b> dural click feeling and the effects of test dose did not differ between the groups. The patients in both groups (90 % of DDS and 87 % of SST) would choose CSE as preferred method in the future. The CSE procedure was painful for 16 % of DDS vs 20 % of SST patients. A significant correlation between time needed for CSE technique performance and body habitus (r = 0. 338, p < 0. 01), spinal landmarks (r = 0. 452, p < 0. 001) and anatomy (r = 0. 265, p < 0. 05) was found in the SST group. There was no correlation between the number of epidural/spinal punctures and epidural bacteriological findings. There was no correlation between the patients’ choice of the CSE technique and the number of <b>spinal</b> <b>punctures,</b> duration of CSE procedure and epidural catheter stay. Conclusion. The two CSE techniques did not differ with regards to the procedure time and patient's preference. Procedure time correlated with body habitus, spinal landmarks and the anatomy in the SST group...|$|R

50|$|In 1918 the American {{neurosurgeon}} Walter Dandy {{introduced the}} technique of ventriculography whereby images of the ventricular system within the brain were obtained by injection of filtered air directly into one or both lateral ventricles of the brain via one or more small trephine holes drilled in the skull under local anaesthesia. Though not usually a painful procedure, ventriculography carried significant risks to the patient under investigation, such as haemorrhage, infection, and dangerous changes in intracranial pressure. Nevertheless, the surgical information given by this method was often remarkably precise and greatly enlarged the capabilities and accuracy of neurosurgical treatment. Dandy also observed that air introduced into the subarachnoid space via lumbar <b>spinal</b> <b>puncture</b> could enter the cerebral ventricles and also demonstrate the cerebrospinal fluid compartments {{around the base of}} the brain and over its surface.

40|$|Background and objective: The line {{joining the}} two iliac crests is classically {{regarded}} as the anatomical landmark determining the inter-vertebral space L 4 -L 5 for the <b>spinal</b> <b>punctures.</b> Its variability has been reported but never related to predictive clinical anatomic factors identifying patients groups {{in which there is}} increased risk of miscalculation of the spinal level. Methods: Two sagittal pelvic anatomical angles, called 'pelvic incidence' and 'pelvic lordosis' were measured on lateral X-rays of the pelvis of 132 normal individuals and 49 spondylolysis patients. The values were compared with the sagittal projection of the intercrestal line on the discovertebral lumbar structures. Results: A strict relation was observed between this projection of the intercrestal line and the sagittal pelvic anatomical angles. The greater the pelvic incidence, the higher the intercrestal line was projected, all the more in patients with spondylolysis with a listhesis or a disc narrowing. Conclusions: The relation between the pelvic sagittal angles and the intercrestal line projection explains the variability described for this anatomical landmark. It implies precautions minimizing neurological risk {{in the case of a}} puncture carried out more cranially than expected, particularly for high values of pelvic incidence occurring in spinal pathologies such as spondylolysis, in the elderly or in the obese patients.

40|$|Background/Objective: Evaluation of {{spinal column}} {{fracture}} or trauma with MRI {{in more than}} two years among 500 patients can change classifications of frac-tures that is important because of intervention ther-apy methods like vertebroplasty and kyfoplasty. As there are changes at Salter harrie fractures, classifica-tion, treatments` way, and management of vertebral body fracture will change. Also MRI can show inter-nal parts ruptures, vessel punctures, and show the size of hematomas. "nPatients and Methods: Fifty patients at two imaging centers have been tested with MRI 1. 5 tesla machines from GE and Siemens with superficial coil, and all of them had vertebral column trauma. We used T 1 and T 2 sagital and in some cases STIR or FAT SAT sagital. "nResults: Among our cases, 147 had fractures, and two cases had <b>spinal</b> <b>punctures.</b> The most common from of fractures were anterior wedging with compression of upper endplate. "nThe maximum fractures were five in a single trauma and mostly there were 2 - 3 fractures in a single trau-ma. Most of the fractures did not appear at X-ray, but they revealed at MRI specially with STIR pulse. "nConclusion: 1) MRI especially STIR pulse is definite and sensitive to compression even in slight among which can be hidden from X-ray and CT. 2) Findings number and form of fractures with MRI, comparing with clinical signs will change classification of verte-bral fractures that leads to the better treatment re-sults. 3) CT is better for vertebral appendix fractures. 4) MRI is better for seeing complications of soft tis-sue. 5) MRI is better for siagnosins of old complica-tions and old fractures...|$|R

Forty-five minutes before the spinal needle puncture 2. 5 g 5 % prilocaine-lidocaine cream was applied on the intervention area of the Group A patients. Ten minutes before the <b>spinal</b> <b>puncture</b> 1 g kg - 1 fentanyl intravenous bolus {{was applied to the}} Group B patients; but no analgesics or local anesthetics were applied to the Group C patients.
