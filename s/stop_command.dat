5000|$|The {{control system}} {{included}} a pneumatic {{system and a}} solid-state electrical sequence controller packaged with spark exciters for the gas generator and the thrust chamber spark plugs, plus interconnecting electrical cabling and pneumatic lines, {{in addition to the}} flight instrumentation system. The pneumatic system consisted of a high-pressure helium gas storage tank, a regulator to reduce the pressure to a usable level, and electrical solenoid control valves to direct the central gas to the various pneumatically controlled valves. The electrical sequence controller was a completely self-contained, solid-state system, requiring only DC power and start and <b>stop</b> <b>command</b> signals. Pre-start status of all critical engine control functions was monitored in order to provide an “engine ready" [...] signal. Upon obtaining “engine ready” and “start” signals, solenoid control valves were energized in a precisely timed sequence to bring the engine through ignition, transition, and into main-stage operation. After shutdown, the system automatically reset for a subsequent restart.|$|E
50|$|The Black Knight {{is capable}} of being used {{off-road}} meaning that it go through any type of terrain such as rocks or water. The vehicle is used in military tests that allows Soldiers {{to figure out the}} major roles of the tank in order to use it in a more advanced military force. Because of its autonomous and semi-autonomous (being able to control itself and be controlled by someone else) components this helps operators plan an efficient plan of attack as well as avoiding obstacles while finding its way from point A to point B. It also consists of three modules: the Robotics Operator, the Mission Commander, and the Safety Officer each serving their own purpose. The Black Knight is basically operated through the Robotics Operator Control Station (ROCS) which is inside an armed vehicle. Meaning that it controls the remote and autonomous operations while the Mission Commander has the task of reading the data and then transferring it to the whole system allowing it to better direct the robotics operator. The Safety Officer controls the remote hand controller which is used when there's an unsafe situation and an emergency <b>stop</b> <b>command</b> is needed. Its main role is to insure the safety of those around the vehicle and after each task, it needs to be remotely parked in a certain location like a garage or onto a truck.|$|E

50|$|Because I²C is {{a shared}} bus, {{there is the}} {{potential}} for any device to have a fault and hang the entire bus. For example, if any device holds the SDA or SCL line low, it prevents the master from sending START or <b>STOP</b> <b>commands</b> to reset the bus. Thus it is common for designs to include a reset signal that provides an external method of resetting the bus devices. However many devices do not have a dedicated reset pin, forcing the designer to put in circuitry to allow devices to be power-cycled if they need to be reset.|$|R

30|$|As {{explained}} in Basics of Amazon EBS–Backed AMIs and Instances and How You’re Charged of[18], a running EBS–backed instance can be {{stopped by the}} consumer {{by means of the}} <b>stop</b> <b>command</b> and drive it to the stopped state. As indicated by t i m e r[*]=[*] 0 operation executed when the subscribed issues a <b>stop</b> <b>command,</b> an instance in stopped state incurs no instance hours. However, though it is not shown in the figure as this is a different issue, Amazon charges for EBS storage and other additional services related to the stopped instance. The consumer can drive an instance from the stopped to the terminated state. Alternatively he can re–launch his instance. In fact, the consumer can launch, stop and launch his instance as many times as he needs to. However, as indicated by the N i n s t H r s++, t i m e r[*]=[*] 0 and starttimer operations over the arrow, every transition from stopped to pending state accrues an instance hour of consumption, irrespectively of the time elapsed between each pair of consecutive launch commands.|$|E
30|$|Short signals at {{the start}} {{and the end of}} the main motion were often misclassified. By {{applying}} majority voting technique, the number of these misclassifications was reduced; 1.0  % of all motions were misclassified as a “neutral” tongue position. However, misclassification as a “neutral” tongue position is less important because the “neutral” tongue position is useful as a <b>stop</b> <b>command</b> when the assistive device is controlled by the developed interface. Misclassification of other motions as a “neutral” tongue position cannot create dangerous situations. It will merely cause the controlled device to stop. Overall, the misclassification errors that might affect the operation of the controlled assistive devices were estimated from the total classification accuracy as about 3.9  %.|$|E

The simulations use a planar generic model of a two-link arm with a torque wheel at the free end.

Results show that this class of torque-wheel can produce an oscillation of 2. 5 cm peak-to-peak in the end point of the arm and that the wheel produces significantly less overshoot when the arm is issued an abrupt <b>stop</b> <b>command</b> from the telerobotic input station...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} to {{new methods}} providing a cost-efficient localization of partial discharges (PD) in gas-insulated switchgears (GIS). A new analogue signal-processing unit minimises necessary equipment for a time-of-flight measurement (time domain) {{by means of}} time-to-digital (TDC) converters. The analogue signal processing unit recognizes {{the beginning of the}} UHF-signal and acquires start and <b>stop</b> <b>commands</b> for the TDC. The TDC measures the time difference (㥀t), which is necessary to localize the PD. Another method uses the interference phenomenon of two superimposed sensor signals in the frequency domain. The signal interference is generated by the time delay (㥀t) between the signals. Two similar sensor signals are required to receive acceptable results for the measurement procedure. Considering the dispersion effects of higher modes in GIS only a certain frequency range is useful for the measurement. At various setups the interferences were measured. Both methods are able to evaluate the time delay between the sensor signals and to localize PD in GIS in a cost-effective way. ...|$|R

30|$|Card write module (CWM): The CWM {{has been}} {{designed}} to write the data block to the SDHC card. The right branch of the flow chart in Fig. 15 describes the write operation. On the way of execution, CU transfers the control to CWM along with the DTM signal to ensure a single block data write or a multiblock data write. In this implementation, both single and multiblock write operation have been taken into consideration. For single block write operation, the controller generates the command with the starting address and then it starts writing 512 bytes of data. For multiblock write, the controller writes the data block until the CMD 12 <b>stop</b> <b>command</b> is being issued. The CRC bits are appended to each data byte for the entire write operation. The card sends back the response pattern in the MISO line of the controller, where “XXX 00101 ” means the data block is accepted, “XXX 01011 ” means the data block is rejected due to the CRC error, and “XXX 01111 ” indicates that the data block is rejected due to the flash program error (in the pattern, “XXX” means do not care bits). The multiple block write improves the throughput as a single command is generated for bulk of data blocks write procedure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Home {{service robots}} have {{attracted}} much attentions to anticipate improved quality of human life. Considering that malfunctions of home service robots can directly threat {{the safety of}} human users, the assurance of robot’s safe operation is a crucial prerequisite for the wide deployment of home service robots. Current practice of robot development, however, often fails to satisfy this requirement. Robot developers tend to concentrate on technical components only and fail to consider how these components will integrate to create the service. This practice frequently causes feature interaction problems. Furthermore, reactive nature of the robot applications adds to further complexity. Traditional testing is unsuccessful with this setting due {{to the difficulty of}} testing embedded systems and uncertainty caused by sensor devices. These situations make formal construction and verification essential to ensure safe operation of home service robots. In this paper, we present our experience of formally constructing and verifying the core of Samsung Home Robot (SHR) with the use of Esterel. First, we reverse-engineered SHR to identify and analyze the core of SHR. Then, we re-implemented the core part in Esterel and verified SHR to satisfy safety properties regarding stopping behaviors through model checking. Through the verification, we detected and solved a feature interaction problem which caused the robot to ignore a <b>stop</b> <b>command.</b> ...|$|E

If you plan to repeatedly use a very large dataset, the fastest way to access it is as a TSP databank-see the OUT and IN commands for further details. The most common usage of READ is to read several variables from an external file in free format, such as: READ (FILE=’FOO.

Use this feature if you like to keep your data separate from your program, but in the same file. Usage: If TSP encounters a simple READ; statement, it transfers to the data section and begins reading data until it reaches an END; statement (or end of file), at which point it returns to the line in the TSP program following the READ; statement. A NOPRINT; command in the data section will stop the data values from echoing. A READ statement followed by a list of series names is the easiest way to read small quantities of data.

40|$|In this study, an {{asynchronous}} wheelchair {{navigation system}} using {{a hybrid of}} EEG signal and EOG artifacts embedded in EEG signals is demonstrated. The EEG signals are recorded at three different locations on the scalp in the occipital and motor cortex regions. First, an EEG signal related to eyelid position is analyzed and used {{to determine whether the}} eyes are closed or open. If the eyes are closed, no wheelchair movement is allowed. If the eyes are open, EOG traces (artifacts) from two other EEG signals are examined to infer the gaze direction of the eyes. A sliding window is utilized to position important cues in the trace signals {{at the center of the}} window for effective classification. The variance of the EEG signal is used to determine the eyelid position by thresholding. Then, features extracted from the EOG traces are used as inputs to a pair of minimum distance classifiers whose outputs reveal the gaze shift performed by the eyes. The wheelchair navigation system is designed to move forward and backward in a total of six different directions. However, the number of distinct gaze direction that can be used as commands to move the wheelchair is only three. Therefore, we model the system as a finite state machine with three modes, each containing three states to overcome this deficiency. The system is equipped with proximity sensor to avoid collision with obstacles. A <b>stop</b> <b>command</b> is also available for safety measures. In a real-time experiment involving 20 participants, the system performed well as it registered a high accuracy of 97. 88 with an average of computational time less than 1 s.
