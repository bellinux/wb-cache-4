Numerical modeling is performed with the ANU/Geoscience Australia tsunami inundation model. Characteristic coastal morphology is represented by simpler generic morphological shapes which can be applied easily in the ANUGA model, such that key non-dimensional parameters (e. g. embayment depth/bay width) can be varied. Modeling is performed with a range of bay shapes, seabed gradient and different incident tsunami wave shapes and <b>wave</b> <b>angles,</b> including <b>sine</b> <b>waves,</b> solitary waves and leading depression N-waves.

50|$|Where power {{inverter}} devices substitute for standard line power, a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> output is desirable because many electrical products are engineered to work best with a <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> AC power source. The standard electric utility provides a <b>sine</b> <b>wave,</b> typically with minor imperfections but sometimes with significant distortion. <b>Sine</b> <b>wave</b> inverters {{with more than}} three steps in the wave output are more complex and have significantly higher cost than a modified <b>sine</b> <b>wave,</b> with only three steps, or square wave (one step) types of the same power handling. Switch-mode power supply (SMPS) devices, such as personal computers or DVD players, function on quality modified <b>sine</b> <b>wave</b> power.
