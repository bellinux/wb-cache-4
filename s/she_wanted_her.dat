25|$|Tsvetaeva's two half-siblings, Valeria and Andrei, {{were the}} {{children}} of Ivan's deceased first wife, Varvara Dmitrievna Ilovaiskaya, daughter of the historian Dmitry Ilovaisky. Tsvetaeva's only full sister, Anastasia, was born in 1894. The children quarrelled frequently and occasionally violently. There was considerable tension between Tsvetaeva's mother and Varvara's children, and Tsvetaeva's father maintained close contact with Varvara's family. Tsvetaeva's father was kind, but deeply wrapped up in his studies and distant from his family. He was also still deeply {{in love with his}} first wife; he would never get over her. Maria Tsvetaeva had had a love affair before her marriage, from which she never recovered. Maria Tsvetaeva disapproved of Marina's poetic inclination; <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> daughter to become a pianist, holding the opinion that her poetry was poor.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1915, Parnok and Tsvetaeva, both of their sisters, and Osip Mandelstam were guests at Maximilian Voloshin's dacha in Koktebel. Parnok did not care for Mandelstam though Tsvetaeva was openly {{friendly}} and would later have an affair with him. By July, the lovers left Koktebel, just before Tsvetaeva's husband's arrived, spending a month on holiday in Sviatye Gory. In January 1916, Tsvetaeva and Mandelstam met at a literary salon in Saint Petersburg, possibly by chance, and recognized each other's talents. The meeting caused a heated quarrel with Parnok. The following month, Mandelstam's attempt to continue the discussion with Tsvetaeva, which had begun in Saint Petersburg, {{proved to be the}} final straw in breaking up she and Parnok's relationship. Tsvetaeva came home from taking Mandelstam to see the sites of Moscow to find Parnok entertaining the actress Lyudmila Vladimirovna Erarskaya. It is unknown exactly when Parnok and Erarskaya met, but theirs would be the longest relationship of the poet's life, lasting for the next sixteen years. In a pique, Tsvetaeva asked Parnok to return her Podruga and her manuscripts. Parnok was outraged, not only that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> gift returned, but that she was trying to conceal the origin of the poems in their affair.|$|E

25|$|In 1905, King Alfonso XIII of Spain made an {{official}} state {{visit to the}} United Kingdom. Victoria Eugenie's uncle, King Edward VII, hosted a dinner in Buckingham Palace, in honour of the Spanish king. Alfonso was seated between Queen Alexandra and Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, King Edward's sister. He noticed Victoria Eugenie and asked who the dinner guest with almost white hair was. Everybody knew that King Alfonso {{was looking for a}} suitable bride and one of the strongest candidates was Princess Patricia of Connaught, daughter of King Edward's brother, the Duke of Connaught. As Princess Patricia seemed not to be impressed by the Spanish monarch, Alfonso indulged his interest in Victoria Eugenie, and so the courtship began. When Alfonso returned to Spain he frequently sent postcards to Victoria Eugenie and spoke of her approvingly. His widowed mother, Queen Maria Cristina, did not like her son's choice, in part because she considered the Battenbergs non-royal because of the obscure origin of Prince Henry's mother, and in part because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> son to marry within her own family, the Habsburgs from Austria. Another obstacle to a marriage was Victoria Eugenie's Protestantism (Alfonso was Roman Catholic; she was Anglican). Another potential problem was haemophilia, the disease that Victoria had transmitted to some of her descendants. Eugenie's brother Leopold was a haemophiliac, so there was a 50% probability that Victoria Eugenie would be a carrier, although the degree of risk was not yet known. Still, if Alfonso married her, their issue could be affected by the disease. Nonetheless, Alfonso was not dissuaded.|$|E

[...] "Remember December" [...] adapts power pop and synthpop genres and diverges from Lovato's usual pop rock sound.

Shot in the summer of 1985, the film co-starred Charlie Sheen and Kerri Green with Ryder playing Rina, one of Lucas's friends at school. When asked how <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> name {{to appear in the}} credits, she suggested [...] "Ryder" [...] as her surname because a Mitch Ryder album that belonged to her father was playing in the background.|$|E

After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] From the moment she was signed in the film, Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". According to her publicist Liz Rosenberg, [...] "since [...] didn't write the music and lyrics, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> signature on that song...

500|$|In December 2011, Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat {{announced}} that Amy and Rory would {{leave in the}} seventh series in [...] "heartbreaking" [...] circumstances.

Moffat stated he felt [...] "tremendous pressure" [...] writing Amy and Rory's ending. He later revealed that he [...] "completely changed" [...] the ending as he was writing it, feeling the emphasis was wrong. During rewrites Moffat went back and forth deciding whether or not Amy and Rory should live or die. He eventually decided that death would complement the storyline involving the [...] "old, sentimental" [...] and [...] "dangerous" [...] characterisation of the Doctor. At one point he considered making the story that involved the Daleks, but felt the Weeping Angels were a [...] "better fit". Moffat was also interested in coming up with a new form for the Angels, and so he introduced the cherubs.

500|$|In a 1980 interview, Gordimer {{stated that}} she {{was fascinated by the}} role of [...] "white hard-core Leftists" [...] in South Africa, and that she had long envisaged the idea for Burger's Daughter. Inspired by the work of Bram Fischer, she {{published}} an essay about him in 1961 entitled [...] "Why Did Bram Fischer Choose to Go to Jail?" [...] Fischer was the Afrikaner advocate and Communist who was Nelson Mandela's defence lawyer during his 1956 Treason Trial and his 1965 Rivonia Trial. As a friend of many of the activist families, including Fischer's, Gordimer knew these families' children were [...] "politically groomed" [...] for the struggle, and were taught that [...] "the struggle came first" [...] and they came second. She modelled the Burger family in the novel loosely on Fischer's family, and Lionel Burger on Fischer himself. While Gordimer never said the book was about Fischer, she did describe it as [...] "a coded homage" [...] to him. Before submitting the manuscript to her publisher, Gordimer gave it to Fischer's daughter, Ilse Wilson (née Fischer) to read, saying that, because of connections people might make to her family, <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> to see it first. When Wilson returned the manuscript to Gordimer, she told the writer, [...] "You have captured the life that was ours." [...] After Gordimer's death in July 2014, Wilson wrote that Gordimer [...] "had the extraordinary ability to describe a situation and capture the lives of people she was not necessarily a part of." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{taking office}} as Labour leader in December 2011, Lamont urged First Minister Salmond {{to set a}} date for the referendum, arguing in her {{leadership}} acceptance speech that uncertainty over the referendum's timeline was having {{a negative impact on}} Scotland. On 10 January 2012 Salmond announced late 2014 as his preferred time for a referendum. The Scottish Government confirmed the referendum question on 25 January 2012, and announced on 21 March 2013 that the referendum would be held on 18 September 2014. Lamont told Scottish Labour's 2012 annual conference <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> party's campaign to be one of [...] "collective leadership" [...] against independence, a strategy which she envisaged would become a cross-party movement arguing the case for keeping Scotland in the UK. At the Scottish Conservative Party conference a few weeks later, party leader Ruth Davidson called for Lamont and her opponents to work together. The Better Together Campaign, fronted by former UK Government minister Alistair Darling, was launched at an event attended by Lamont and other senior Scottish political figures at Edinburgh's Napier University on 25 June 2012. Along with former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and other senior Scottish Labour figures, Lamont launched the party's own pro-union campaign, United with Labour in May 2013. The Scottish Government published Scotland's Future, a white paper setting out its vision for an independent Scotland, on 26 November 2013. Lamont dismissed it as [...] "670 pages of assertion and uncertainty". Addressing the Shadow Cabinet of UK Labour leader Ed Miliband on 28 January 2014, Lamont warned that Scots could vote for independence if they believed Labour was unlikely to win the 2015 UK general election.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on August 6, 7 and 8, 1998, and was {{directed}} by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, [...] "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan {{was to have the}} video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>her</b> video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that [...] "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." [...] The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, [...] "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, [...] "It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience". The music video was shot at Venice High School, the same school used to film the movie Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations in November 1998.|$|E
