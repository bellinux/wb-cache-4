And as, with the so-called Christian, I desired to plead for honest declaration and fulfilment of his belief in life,--with the so-called Infidel, I desired to plead for an honest declaration and fulfilment of his belief in death. The dilemma is inevitable. Men must either hereafter live, or hereafter die; fate may be bravely met, and conduct wisely ordered, on either expectation; but never in hesitation between ungrasped hope, and unconfronted fear. We usually believe in immortality, <b>so</b> far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> preparation for death; and in mortality, <b>so</b> far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> preparation for anything after death.

5|$|Although he {{appeared}} to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health, Nerva was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and childless. Furthermore, he had close connections with the Flavian dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate. Nerva had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of Nero; he knew that to hesitate even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict. Rather than decline the invitation and risk revolts, he accepted.

Another prerequisite of the program had by that time become mandatory university enrollment with a preference for students in Ivy League universities and students in their final year of university and thus near the age limit. Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoiding</b> hoarding of spots by families.

5|$|As {{the game}} {{gradually}} {{moved away from}} being a pursuit for wealthy amateurs to one dominated by working-class professionals, kits changed accordingly. The clubs themselves, rather than individual players, were now responsible for purchasing kit and financial concerns, along {{with the need for}} the growing numbers of spectators to easily identify the players, led to the lurid colours of earlier years being abandoned in favour of simple combinations of primary colours. In 1890 the Football League, which had been formed two years earlier, ruled that no two member teams could register similar colours, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> clashes. This rule was later abandoned in favour of one stipulating that all teams must have a second set of shirts in a different colour available. Initially the home team was required to change colours {{in the event of a}} clash, but in 1921 the rule was amended to require the away team to change.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the reconstruction of the}} main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of escalators replacing the lifts. The escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line Bank branch platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a passageway at the lower level <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the need to use the escalators. An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the passageway.

Disused passages remain with tiling and posters from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{set about}} {{changing}} the wing's tactical approach.

Johnson made another alteration to his units operations. He loathed ground-attack missions which highly trained fighter pilots were forced to participate in. He abandoned ground attack missions whenever he could. During these weeks, Johnson's wing escorted United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers to targets in France. On a fighter sweep, Ramrod 49, Johnson destroyed an Fw 190 for his eighth victory. Unteroffizier Hans Hiess from 6 Staffel bailed out, but his parachute failed to open.|$|E

If a hollow coin is suspected, it sometimes can be easily confirmed by weighing against a normal coin on a simple balance.

Following the declaration of war on Germany on 6 April 1917, Baker and MacArthur secured an agreement from President Wilson {{for the use of the}} National Guard on the Western Front. MacArthur suggested sending first a division organized from units of different states, <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the appearance of favoritism toward any particular state. Baker approved the creation of this formation, which became the 42nd ("Rainbow") Division, and appointed Major General William A.

There was no road or path to follow, and the terrain upon which Hunter's flying column marched was nearly nontraversable; the route alternated between broken, rocky ground and ankle-high sand, {{ultimately}} proving extremely difficult to navigate in the dark of night. Added to these difficulties was the measure of speed imposed upon the column, as the mounted Major-General Hunter and Lieutenant MacDonald drove their units to their breaking points in order to preempt Mahdist reinforcements. The column advanced until midnight, completing a march of over sixteen miles. Sleeping during the day was made impossible by the sweltering heat; only when adequate shade was found in the barren desert could the exhausted men of Hunter's flying column rest.|$|E

There was also an ownership change in what had been one of the most stable front offices in professional sports. In February 1991, after being diagnosed with Cancer, Tim Mara sold his 50% interest in the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million.

40|$|This article elaborates upon ideas {{contributed to}} a {{symposium}} considering the possible shape of an Asia Pacific Community, including future trade arrangements within an Asia Pacific Community. It suggests some innovations in dispute settlement {{that could be considered}} for inclusion in such arrangements. The author suggests some innovative mechanisms by focussing on the way in which trade agreements and the dispute settlement mechanisms influence the internal political position of governments. The first mechanism would provide for a pre-quantification of the extent of retaliation that would be permitted should a complaint be successful. This mechanism would encourage respondent governments to focus earlier on weighing the potential loss of political support from exporters with any political support from import competing producers. The second mechanism would provide for free publication of an expert economic report on the economic welfare cost to the respondent of maintaining the protectionist measure subject to the complaint. This mechanism could increase the political weight attributed by the respondent government to the overall economic effects of the controversial measure. The paper further suggests that something similar to the second mechanism could be adopted as a separate transparency mechanism unrelated to dispute settlement. Such a mechanism might make it more likely that governments reform protectionist measures <b>so</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoiding</b> the possibility of any legal dispute ever arising.
