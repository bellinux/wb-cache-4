The behavior of the plasma is described by a collisional two-fluid scheme with charge neutrality in the interior of the tube. Approximate nonlinear equations for the hydrodynamical moments are obtained from a Boltzmann equation in which electron-neutral, electron-ion and electron-electron collisions are all important.

50|$|In the meantime, the drift-diffusion {{model has}} been found to {{successfully}} predict the efficiency limit of perovskite solar cells. There are two prerequisites for predicting and approaching the perovskite efficiency limit. First, the intrinsic radiative recombination needs to be corrected after adopting optical designs which will significantly affect the open-circuit voltage at its Shockley-Queisser limit. Second, the contact characteristics of the electrodes need to be carefully engineered to eliminate the charge accumulation and <b>surface</b> <b>recombination</b> at the electrodes. With the two procedures, the accurate prediction of efficiency limit and precise evaluation of efficiency degradation for perovskite solar cells are attainable by the drift-diffusion model.|$|E
50|$|A window {{layer is}} used {{in order to reduce}} the <b>surface</b> <b>recombination</b> {{velocity}} S. Similarly, a back-surface field (BSF) layer reduces the scattering of carriers towards the tunnel junction. The structure of these two layers is the same: it is a heterojunction which catches electrons (holes). Indeed, despite the electric field Ed, these cannot jump above the barrier formed by the heterojunction because they don't have enough energy, as illustrated in figure E. Hence, electrons (holes) cannot recombine with holes (electrons) and cannot diffuse through the barrier. By the way, window and BSF layers must be transparent to wavelengths absorbed by the next pn junction i.e. EgWindow > EgEmitter and EgBSF > EgEmitter. Furthermore, the lattice constant must be close to the one of InGaP and the layer must be highly doped (n ≥ 1018 cm−3).|$|E

50|$|The photoactive {{region of}} a CCD is, generally, an {{epitaxial}} layer of silicon. It is lightly p doped (usually with boron) and is grown upon a substrate material, often p++. In buried-channel devices, {{the type of}} design utilized in most modern CCDs, {{certain areas of the}} surface of the silicon are ion implanted with phosphorus, giving them an n-doped designation. This region defines the channel in which the photogenerated charge packets will travel. Simon Sze details the advantages of a buried-channel device:This thin layer (= 0.2-0.3 micron) is fully depleted and the accumulated photogenerated charge is kept away from the surface. This structure has the advantages of higher transfer efficiency and lower dark current, from reduced <b>surface</b> <b>recombination.</b> The penalty is smaller charge capacity, by a factor of 2-3 compared to the surface-channel CCD. The gate oxide, i.e. the capacitor dielectric, is grown on top of the epitaxial layer and substrate.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of calculations obtained with a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method that describes both the external flow about the nose region of the Shuttle Orbiter and the internal flow in an inlet tube that provides the initial path between the shock-processed gases and a mass spectrometer mounted inside the Orbiter. A dedicated, three-dimensional version of the DSMC was developed during this study for the internal flow simulation along with the procedure for interfacing the external and internal flows. The calculations span the 140 to 95 km altitude range, which includes most of the hypersonic transitional flow encountered during reentry. All calculations were for a multicomponent gas mixture consisting of five chemical species while simulating the effects of transitional, rotational, vibrational, and chemical nonequilibrium. The results of the calculations show that within the entry region of the inlet tube where the gas has equilibrated with the sidewall tube temperature, the pressure is substantially less than the pressure at the external surface. This pressure correction for the entry region is significant for all conditions investigated and increases with altitude. The results highlight the structure of both the external and internal flow. Results of parametric studies show the sensitivity of the equilibrated inlet sidewall pressure to mass flow rates, gas-surface reflection model, tube side-wall temperature variations, and <b>surface</b> <b>recombinations...</b>|$|R
