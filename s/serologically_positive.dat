40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the serological prevalence of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1), and describe whether natural subclinical infections will lead to fertility losses in dairy cows and heifers in Burdur, Turkey. BHV- 1 prevalence was 11. 94 % (201 / 24) and 14. 60 % (89 / 13) in cows and heifers respectively. Conception rate (CR) was higher in BHV- 1 serologically negative cows (38. 98 %) than BHV- 1 positive cows (33. 33 %) but the difference was statistically insignificant (P> 0. 05). However, CR was higher (P> 0. 05) in BHV- 1 <b>serologically</b> <b>positive</b> heifers (84. 61 %) than BHV- 1 negative heifers (56. 57 %).

Of the positive non-vaccinated herds, most had one (n= 98) or two (n= 49) positive cows. The percentage positive cows per herd was 2. 5 +/- 3. 2 %. The true prevalences on cow and herd levels, based on a test sensitivity that ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 4 and a specificity that ranged from 0. 985 and 0. 995, were estimated at 2. 7 - 6. 9 % and 31 - 71 %.

E-mail: camilafb@usp. br Caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE) and caseous lymphadenitis (CL) have high incidence and transmissibility in small ruminants. Since both virus have tropism for macrophages and monocytes and affect the innate immune response, {{it is believed that}} CAE can predispose the animal to infection by Corynebacteruim pseudotuberculosis, the etiological agent of CL. To confirm this hypothesis, we evaluated phagocytosis from the monocyte-macrophage cells from 30 Saanen goats. Goats were uniformly divided in two groups according to results of agar gel immunodiffusion test for CAE virus (CAEV). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation and the monocyte-macrophage cells were isolated from the mononuclear cells by their adhesion properties in plaques. Afterwards, phagocytosis of C. psudotuberculosis was performed for two hours at 37 degrees C, 5 % of CO 2, and assessed by microscopic visualization. There was no difference in the percentage of monocyte-macrophage cells that phagocytozed C. bovis between groups (P = 0. 41). However, when phagocytosis rates were classified according to the number of C. pseudotuberculosis phagocyted, the percentage of monocyte-macrophage cells that internalized more than 12 bacteria were higher in <b>serologically</b> CAEV <b>positive</b> animals compared to the serologically negative ones (P < 0. 001).

Definitive diagnosis of strongyloidiasis is based on the presence of Strongyloides larvae in stool, but majority of cases involve low and irregular larval output. While limitations of serological assays for strongyloidiasis are well known, characteristics of persons who are misdiagnosed based on negative coproparasitological tests have been little explored. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the use of IgG avidity to detect patients with active strongyloidiasis and to characterize sources of disagreement between serology and coproparasitology. A total of 80 serum samples was analyzed, 40 from patients with Strongyloides larvae in stool (G 1) and 40 from individuals with negative coproparasitology, but positive serology (G 2). Serum samples were analyzed in an indirect IgG avidity ELISA using urea 6 M in serial double dilutions from 1 : 80 to 1 : 2560. Avidity index (AI) was calculated to each serum dilution and analyzed as screening AI (serum dilution of 1 : 160) or mean AI of different serum dilutions that had a positive result. Statistical analyzes were performed by Mann–Whitney's (U) and Fisher's exact tests. At screening dilution, median of AI was 68 % in G 1 and 88 % in G 2 (P 75 % (P< 0. 0001).

40|$|A Artrite Encefalite Caprina (AEC) e a Linfadenite Caseosa (LC) possuem alta incidência e transmissibilidade em pequenos ruminantes. Como ambas possuem tropismo por monócitos-macrófagos e afetam mecanismos da resposta inata do hospedeiro, acredita-se que a AEC predispõe o animal a infecções por Corynebacteruim pseudotuberculosis, agente etiológico da LC. Para confirmar esta hipótese, avaliou-se a fagocitose de células da série monócito-macrófago de cabras naturalmente infectadas pelo vírus da AEC (VAEC). Para tanto, foram utilizadas 30 cabras da raça Saanen, alocadas em dois grupos distintos, com 15 animais cada, {{conforme}} a sororreatividade de anticorpos séricos antivírus da AEC. Células mononucleares de sangue periférico foram isoladas por gradiente de densidade e plaqueadas para isolamento de células da série monócito-macrófago. Posteriormente, o ensaio de fagocitose de C. pseudotuberculosis foi realizado, após incubação por duas horas a 37 ºC a 5 % de CO 2, e a visualização da fagocitose foi identificada por microscopia óptica. O presente estudo não encontrou diferença na porcentagem de monócito-macrófagos que realizaram fagocitose entre os diferentes grupos (P = 0, 41). Todavia, a análise quantitativa de bactérias fagocitadas, demonstrou maior capacidade fagocítica pelos macrófagos-monócitos do grupo sororreagente ao vírus da AEC.

Considering the possibility of venereal transmission, we studied genital lesions in dogs naturally infected with {{visceral leishmaniasis}} and shedding of Leishmania sp. in the semen. Approximately 200 dogs were serologically tested for anti-Leishmania antibodies and divided into three groups: 1) serologically negative dogs (n 20), 2) asymptomatic <b>serologically</b> <b>positive</b> dogs (n 20), and 3) symptomatic <b>serologically</b> <b>positive</b> dogs (n 20). Samples from both testes, all segments of both epididymes, prostate gland, glans penis, and prepuce were histologically evaluated and processed for immunodetection of Leishmania sp.

40|$|Glycophorin gene hybrid GYP(B-A-B) encodes {{a variant}} glycophorin, GP. Mur, that bears several {{immunogenic}} epitopes. Antibodies against GP.

This project aims to develop a fast and direct PCR-ASP method that specifically targets the GYP. Mur allele. Allele specific primers were tailored to discriminate GYP. Mur from other glycophorin alleles with respect to single nucleotide polymorphism of the corresponding nucleotide sequences. Polymerase chain reaction protocols were optimized using this primer set and an internal control primer set that amplifies the Human Growth Hormone (HGH) gene. Samples with GP. Mur status screened by serology beforehand were analyzed using this novel PCR design. The results were confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing approach described by Hsu et al. (3) A total of 202 untransfused samples from Chinese individuals were screened by undifferentiated in-house Miltenberger antibody(ies). Eleven of which were serologically reactive. The reactive samples and another 11 non-reactive random samples were investigated using the PCR-ASP method. However, nine out of the 11 serologically reactive samples and one of 11 non-reactive samples {{were found to be}} GP. Mur-positive by the PCR-ASP. All of 10 GP.

A group of 124 dogs was examined, 37 of which showed typical symptoms of disease. PCR was performed on 124 blood samples and 52 lymph node aspirates. Using microscopic examination as the “gold standard,” we calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 100 % using lymph node aspirates and values of 85, 80, 95, and 57 %, respectively, using blood samples. We found that 40 % of the animals without lesions and 38 % of the animals with clinical signs gave false-negative results by indirect immunofluorescence antibody testing. These animals could contribute to the spreading of infection among dogs, and represent a potential risk for human health as well...|$|R
40|$|The human {{serological}} {{response was}} analyzed by using sera from {{patients who were}} <b>serologically</b> <b>positive</b> but isolation negative for Chlamydia pneumoniae and from patients with proven C. pneumoniae infection based on serology and isolation. To assess whether seroreactivity to C. pneumoniae proteins had potential diagnostic value, the cross-reactivities of these sera to other Chlamydia species and of sera from patients infected with C. trachomatis and C. psittaci to C. pneumoniae proteins were determined. In all serum samples from patients with proven C. pneumoniae infections, reactivities were seen with 98 -, 68 -, 60 -, 39. 5 -, and 30 -kilodalton proteins. Similar patterns were seen in sera from patients who were <b>serologically</b> <b>positive</b> and isolation negative. The onset of seropositivity for C. pneumoniae was accompanied by reactivities against presumably shared chlamydial antigens and a C. pneumoniae-specific 98 -kilodalton protein...|$|E

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{presence}} of Babesia in humans was performed in Puerto Berrío (Latitude 6. 50 deg. Longitude: - 74. 38 deg. River: Magdalena. Area: 74. 410 km², Colombia-South America). Indirect immunofluorescence, thin and thick blood smears were used to study 194 individuals. Patients were grouped according to their risk-factors for Babesia infection: (group 1) individuals with fever, chills, sweating and other malaria-type symptoms; (group 2) symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals from local cattle ranches, which were enrolled in an active form, and (group 3) workers from the local slaughterhouse. Seven individuals were <b>serologically</b> <b>positive</b> for Babesia: Three individuals presented IgM antibodies against B. bovis, while one had IgG against this species; one individual had IgM against B. bigemina, another had IgG and a third both IgM and IgG against this species. Only one individual was parasitologically positive for Babesiaand <b>serologically</b> <b>positive</b> for Babesia bovis (IgM 1 : 64...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Dusky-footed wood rats (Neotoma fuscipes Baird) and {{two species}} of Peromyscus mice (P. maniculatus Wagner and P. truei Shufeldt) were {{collected}} over a 16 -month period from three sites in Sonoma County, California. Blood was collected from 93 wood rats and 177 mice and serum or plasma was tested for seroreactivity with Ehrlichia phagocytophila sensu lato (also known as the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent). Thirty-five (37. 6 %) wood rats and 15 (8. 5 %) mice were seropositive. Positive Neotoma serology by site ranged from 9. 4 % to 62. 1 %. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the Ehrlichia groESL heat shock operon was performed on all the seropositive and selected seronegative wood rats; 24 (68. 6 %) seropositive animals were PCR positive. Two seroconversions and no seroreversions were detected among 18 of the seropositive wood rats that were recaptured and tested multiple times (range 26). Fourteen (77. 8 %) of the 18 were also PCR positive with six of these positive at every testing point (range 26). One wood rat remained <b>serologically</b> and PCR <b>positive</b> in six specimens collected over a 14 -month period. One male of 84 questing adult Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls collected was PCR-positive for E. phago-cytophila. Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, was cultured from ear punch biopsies from six of seven E. phagocytophila seropositive and one of four seronegative wood rats...|$|R

40|$|The fimbriate {{colonization}} factor antigen (CEA) of Escherichia coli strain H- 1047 {{was isolated}} {{and used to}} prepare anti-CFA antiserum. Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolated from 29 adults with diarrhea acquired in Mexico were examined for CFA by using this serum. Retrospectively, {{it was found that}} ETEC possessing the H- 10407 -type CFA were isolated from 25 (86 %) of these diarrhea cases as compared with 2 of 11 (18 %) from asymptomatic controls from whom ETEC had been isolated. CFA was found onE. coli of various serotypes, as demonstrated by bacterial agglutination by the anti-CFA serum. Heat treating the cells at 65 degress C for 1 h prevented the agglutination. CFA-positive strains did not react with anti-CFA serum when the cultures were grown at a low incubation temperature (18 degrees C). E. coli isolates identified <b>serologically</b> as CFA <b>positive</b> were shown to adhere to the intestinal villous surfaces of infant rabbits. By the indirect immunofluorescence technique, it was found that adhesion occurred preferentially in the upper 20 cm of the small intestine. Also, the ability or inability of various isolates to adhere to intestinal mucosa in vivo correlated with {{the presence or absence of}} fimbriae on the cells when grown in vitro. Agglutinability with anti-CFA serum, fimbriae, and adhesiveness were spontaneously lost by many isolates after laboratory passage in a manner previously described with E. coli H- 10407. These observations suggest that the H- 10407 -type CFA plays a role in the virulence of ETEC possessing this antigen...|$|R
