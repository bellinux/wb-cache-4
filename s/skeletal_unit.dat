40|$|The {{present study}} explores the shape changes of cranial {{structures}} {{directly involved in}} food capturing during growth after reef settlement in two species of Pomacentridae (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus pavo). Landmark-based geometric morphometrics were used to study allometric patterns and related shape changes in four skeletal units: neurocranium, suspensorium and opercle, mandible and premaxilla. At settlement, the larvae of both species have a relatively similar morphology, especially {{with respect to the}} mandible. Their shapes suggest a feeding mode defined as ram/suction-feeding. Ontogenetic shape changes show a shift to a suction feeding mode of prey capture. The main transformations involved are an increase in height of the suspensorium and the opercle, an elevation of the supraoccipital crest, a relative shortening of the mandible, and a lengthening of the ascending process of the premaxilla. Shape changes of the mandible in the two studied species also reflect an increase of biting capacities. The high disparity between adult shape results from differences in the rate and in the length of ontogenetic trajectories, from divergence of the ontogenetic trajectories (neurocranium, mandible, and premaxilla) and parallel shifts of the trajectories in the size-shape space (suspensorium and opercle).

However, detailed investigations devoted {{to the study of}} the {{evolution of}} ontogenetic patterns shaping giant species are scarce. The damselfishes of the genus Dascyllus appear as an excellent model for such a study. Their well understood phylogeny reveals that large-bodied species have evolved in two different clades. Geometric morphometric methods were used to compare the ontogenetic trajectories of the neurocranium and the mandible in both small-bodied (Dascyllus aruanus and Dascyllus carneus; maximum size: 50 – 65  mm standard length) and giant (Dascyllus trimaculatus and Dascyllus flavicaudus; maximum size: 90 – 110  mm standard length) Dascyllus species. At their respective maximum body size, the neurocranium of the giant species is significantly shorter and have a higher supraoccipital crest relative to the small-bodied species, whereas mandible shape variation is more limited and is not related to the 'giant' trait. The hypothesis of ontogenetic scaling whereby the giant species evolved by extending the allometric trajectory of the small-bodied ones (i. e. hypermorphosis) is rejected. Instead, the allometric trajectories vary among species by lateral transpositions. The rate of shape changes and the type of lateral transposition also differ according to the <b>skeletal</b> <b>unit</b> among Dascyllus species.

40|$|The Pomacentridae family, or damselfishes, {{includes}} more than 330 species living mainly in a coral reef environment. They have a complex life cycle involving a pelagic dispersion period of larvae and a juvenile and adult benthic life period associated to reef. The colonisation {{is associated with a}} metamorphosis allowing the fish to adapt to their new environment. Our study focused on morphological modifications, as skeletal shape changes, occurring during the development from settling larvae to juvenile and leading to diversification of adult species. To test allometry and to examine diversification in shapes, geometric morphometrics were used. This method, which allows description and statistical analysis of form, is applied to define ontogenetic shape changes and to compare allometries responsible for species diversification. It is applied here for skull structures involved in food capture as neurocranium, suspensorium, opercle, premaxillary bone and mandible. Six species were studied: Chromis viridis, Dascyllus aruanus, Dascyllus carneus, Pomacentrus pavo, Chrysiptera glauca and Stegastes nigricans. At the end of larval stage, structures in fishes are rather similar. None of the species has an isometric growth.

Most studies of {{disparity}} have focused on its temporal dynamics over a geological time scale and generally show that phenotypic disparity decreases or remains stable in numerous groups. Surprisingly, the relationship between ontogeny and disparity has received little attention. The ontogenetic dynamics of shape disparity are influenced by diverse interactions such as developmental constraints and/or environmental factors. Coral reefs have an extraordinary diversity of fishes. As the majority of demersal coral reef fishes, the damselfishes (Pomacentridae) have a bipartite life cycle. During the pelagic dispersion phase, all larvae feed on planktonic preys. On the other hand, juveniles and adults associated to the coral reef environment show a high diversity of diets. We test the hypothesis that this ontogenetic change in habitat and diet is related to an increase of shape disparity in head <b>skeletal</b> <b>units</b> (neurocranium, suspensorium, opercle, mandible and premaxilla). We also compare ontogenies of shape among eight species of damselfishes to identify the evolutionary changes in developmental processes modifying shape disparity.

The main {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify mandibular asymmetry in UCH patients with a reliable and reproducible method. Secondly, it was evaluated whether the existing classification can be confirmed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 37 UCH-patients with progressive mandibular asymmetry, supported by a positive bone scan and/or such clinical progression that condylectomy was performed, were included in this retrospective study. A group of healthy subjects, matched for age and gender, was used as the control group. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans were imported in Maxilim(R) software. Each mandibular half was divided into three skeletal segments (condyle, ramus, and body). Linear and volumetric measurements were calculated for these <b>skeletal</b> <b>units</b> on the affected and unaffected side, for both patients and controls. RESULTS: Significant differences between affected and unaffected sides in the patient group were found in condylar, ramus, and body segments for linear (p < 0. 01) as well as for volumetric quantitative measurements (p < 0. 0040). A mean linear difference between affected and unaffected sides in the condylar region of the UCH patient group was found of 3. 6 mm (sd 2. 9) versus 0. 2 mm (sd 1. 5) in controls. For volumetric measurements there was a mean difference between the left and right condyle of 718 mm 3 (sd 638) in the patient group versus 8 mm 3 (sd 225) difference in the control group. The condyle was the most affected segment. Differences between sides were significantly larger in the patient group than in the control group (p < 0. 001).

We conclude from this study that our SMUs have the potential to restore lost tissue volume in cases of acute VML...|$|R
40|$|SummaryMotor units {{comprise}} a pre-synaptic motor neuron and multiple post-synaptic muscle fibers. Many movement disorders disrupt motor unit contractile dynamics {{and the structure}} of sarcomeres, <b>skeletal</b> muscle’s contractile <b>units.</b> Despite the motor unit’s centrality to neuromuscular physiology, no extant technology can image sarcomere twitch dynamics in live humans. We created a wearable microscope equipped with a microendoscope for minimally invasive observation of sarcomere lengths and contractile dynamics in any major skeletal muscle. By electrically stimulating twitches via the microendoscope and visualizing the sarcomere displacements, we monitored single motor unit contractions in soleus and vastus lateralis muscles of healthy individuals. Control experiments verified that these evoked twitches involved neuromuscular transmission and faithfully reported muscle force generation. In post-stroke patients with spasticity of the biceps brachii, we found involuntary microscopic contractions and sarcomere length abnormalities. The wearable microscope facilitates exploration of many basic and disease-related neuromuscular phenomena never visualized before in live humans. Video Abstrac...|$|R
25|$|Tim Noakes, {{based on}} an earlier idea by the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill has {{proposed}} {{the existence of a}} central governor. In this, the brain continuously adjusts the power output by muscles during exercise in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in prior length of strenuous exercise, the planned duration of further exertion, and the present metabolic state of the body. This adjusts the number of activated <b>skeletal</b> muscle motor <b>units,</b> and is subjectively experienced as fatigue and exhaustion. The idea of a central governor rejects the earlier idea that fatigue is only caused by mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral fatigue"). Instead, the brain models the metabolic limits of the body to ensure that whole body homeostasis is protected, in particular that the heart is guarded from hypoxia, and an emergency reserve is always maintained. The idea of the central governor has been questioned since ‘physiological catastrophes’ can and do occur suggesting athletes (such as Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess) can over-ride the ‘‘central governor’.|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{engineered}} {{skeletal muscle}} has potential for application as a graft source for repairing soft tissue injuries, {{a model for}} testing pharmaceuticals, and a biomechanical actuator system for soft robots. However, engineered muscle to date has not produced forces comparable to native muscle, limiting its potential for repair and for use as an in vitro model for pharmaceutical testing. In this study, we examined the trophic effects of dexamethasone (DEX), a glucocorticoid that stimulates myoblast differentiation and fusion into myotubes, on our tissue engineered three-dimensional <b>skeletal</b> muscle <b>units</b> (SMUs). Using our established SMU fabrication protocol, muscle isolates were cultured with three experimental DEX concentrations (5, 10, and 25 ?nM) and compared to untreated controls. Following seeding onto a laminin-coated Sylgard substrate, the administration of DEX was initiated on day 0 or day 6 in growth medium or on day 9 after the switch to differentiation medium and was sustained until the completion of SMU fabrication. During this process, total cell proliferation was measured with a BrdU assay, and myogenesis and structural advancement of muscle cells were observed through immunostaining for MyoD, myogenin, desmin, and α-actinin. After SMU formation, isometric tetanic force production was measured to quantify function. The histological and functional assessment of the SMU showed that the administration of 10 ?nM DEX beginning on either day 0 or day 6 yielded optimal SMUs. These optimized SMUs exhibited formation of advanced sarcomeric structure and significant increases in myotube diameter and myotube fusion index, compared with untreated controls. Additionally, the optimized SMUs matured functionally, as indicated by a fivefold rise in force production. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the addition of DEX to our process of engineering skeletal muscle tissue improves myogenesis, advances muscle structure, and increases force production in the resulting SMUs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] During exercise, <b>skeletal</b> muscle motor <b>units</b> are {{recruited}} {{based on}} afferent sensory input following peripheral metabolic by-product accumulation. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether lactate plays a role in conveying fatigue-related information to the brain. [Subjects] Eleven healthy adults partici-pated in this study. [Methods] Subjects performed handgrip exercises at 10 %, 30 %, and 50 % maximal voluntary contraction for 120 s. They were monitored for brachial artery blood pressure, respiratory quotient, muscle fatigue (integrated electromyogram, median power frequency), blood lactate levels, muscle blood flow, and brain activity. [Results] The handgrip exercise protocol caused significant muscle fatigue based on 28 % and 37 % reductions in median power frequency detected at 30 % and 50 % maximal voluntary contraction, respectively. Subjects exhibited intensity-dependent increases in blood pressure, respiratory quotient, muscle blood flow, and circulating lactate concentrations. Furthermore, brain activity increased at 30 % and 50 % maximal voluntary contraction. Multiple regression analysis identified muscle blood flow at 30 % maximal voluntary contraction and lactate at 50 % maximal voluntary contraction with standardized partial regression coefficients of − 0. 64 and 0. 75, respectively. [Conclusion] These data suggest that blood lactate concentration and muscle blood flow, which reflect muscle metabolism, may convey load intensity information to the brain during muscle fatigue...|$|R
40|$|High-intensity {{exercise}} {{can result in}} up to a 1, 000 -fold increase {{in the rate of}} ATP demand compared to that at rest (Newsholme et al., 1983). To sustain muscle contraction, ATP needs to be regenerated at a rate complementary to ATP demand. Three energy systems function to replenish ATP in muscle: (1) Phosphagen, (2) Glycolytic, and (3) Mitochondrial Respiration. The three systems differ in the substrates used, products, maximal rate of ATP regeneration, capacity of ATP regeneration, and their associated contributions to fatigue. In this exercise context, fatigue is best defined as a decreasing force production during muscle contraction despite constant or increasing effort. The replenishment of ATP during intense exercise {{is the result of a}} coordinated metabolic response in which all energy systems contribute to different degrees based on an interaction between the intensity and duration of the exercise, and consequently the proportional contribution of the different <b>skeletal</b> muscle motor <b>units.</b> Such relative contributions also determine to a large extent the involvement of specific metabolic and central nervous system events that contribute to fatigue. The purpose of this paper is to provide a contemporary explanation of the muscle metabolic response to different exercise intensities and durations, with emphasis given to recent improvements in understanding and research methodology...|$|R
40|$|Network {{analyses}} {{have been}} increasingly {{used in the}} context of comparative vertebrate morphology. The structural units of the vertebrate body are treated as discrete elements (nodes) of a network, whose interactions at their physical contacts (links) determine the phenotypic modules. Here, we use the network approach to study the organization of the locomotor system underlying the hindlimb of frogs. Nodes correspond to fibrous knots, <b>skeletal</b> and muscular <b>units.</b> Edges encode the ligamentous and monoaxial tendinous connections in addition to joints. Our main hypotheses are that: (1) the higher centrality scores (measured as betweenness) are recorded for fibrous elements belonging to the connective system, (2) the organization of the musculoskeletal network belongs to a non-trivial modular architecture and (3) the modules in the hindlimb reflect functional and/or developmental constraints. We confirm all our hypotheses except for the first one, since bones overpass the fibrous knots in terms of centrality. Functionally, there is a correlation between the proximal-to-distal succession of modules and the progressive recruitment of elements involved with the motion of joints during jumping. From a developmental perspective, there is a correspondence between the order of the betweenness scores and the ontogenetic chronology of hindlimbs in tetrapods. Modular architecture seems to be a successful organization, providing of the building blocks on which evolution forges the many different functional specializations that organisms exploit...|$|R
40|$|Skeletal muscle {{possesses}} plasticity and adaptability {{to external}} and internal physiological changes. Due to these characteristics, skeletal muscle shows dramatic changes depending on its response to stimuli such as physical activity, nutritional changes, disease status, and environmental changes. Modulation of the rate of protein synthesis/degradation {{plays an important role}} in atrophic responses. The purpose of this review is to describe different features of skeletal muscle adaptation with various models of deceased use. In this review, four models were addressed: immobilization, spinal cord transection, hindlimb unloading, and aging. Immobilization is a form of decreased use in which skeletal muscle shows electrical activity, tension development, and motion. These results differ by muscle group. Spinal cord transection was selected to simulate spinal cord injury. Similar to the immobilization model, dramatic atrophy occurs in addition to fiber type conversion in this model. Despite the fact that electromyography shows unremarkable changes in muscle after hindlimb unloading, decreased muscle mass and contractile force are observed. Lastly, aging significantly decreases the numbers of muscle fibers and motor <b>units.</b> <b>Skeletal</b> muscle responses to decreased use include decreased strength, decreased fiber numbers, and fiber type transformation. These four models demonstrated different changes in the skeletal muscle. This review elucidates the different skeletal muscle adaptations in these four decreased use animal models and encourages further studies...|$|R
