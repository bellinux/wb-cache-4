The government's Inpres program launched in 1973 resulted in primary <b>school</b> <b>enrolment</b> ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia reaching rice self-sufficiency by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earned Suharto a gold medal from FAO in November 1985.|$|E

Nauti School on Funafuti is the largest primary in Tuvalu with more than 900 students (45 percent of the total primary <b>school</b> <b>enrolment).</b> The pupil-teacher ratio for Tuvalu is low compared to the Pacific region, which has a ratio of 1:29.|$|E

The University of the South Pacific (USP) Extension Centre on Funafuti operates the Augmented Foundation Programme for sixth form students who pass their Pacific Secondary School Certificate (PSSC) so that the students can enter tertiary education programmes outside of Tuvalu. The Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI) is located on Amatuku motu (islet).|$|E

25|$|The Ministry of Education (MoE) {{provides}} some indication of achievements {{in the five years}} from 2008/9 to 2012/13 although statistics do depend upon the accuracy of data collected. Primary <b>school</b> <b>enrolment</b> has increased substantially but only about half of those enrolled manage to complete both cycles. There are a large number of over-age children enrolling for grade 1 although this has been declining. This is shown by the difference between gross intake rate (GIR) and net intake rate (NIR). GIR is the percentage of children enrolled for grade 1, regardless of age, out {{of the population of the}} appropriate age of 7 years. NIR is the percentage of children of appropriate age out of the population of that age.|$|E

25|$|Another {{minority}} is the Roma, who nonetheless {{have very}} little influence on Czech policy. Around 90% of the Roma that lived in the Czech Republic prior to World War II were exterminated by the Nazi Porajmos. The Roma there now are 80% post-war immigrants from Slovakia or Hungary, or the descendants thereof. In total, the Roma in the CR now number around 200,000. There is Romani press in the CR, written in both Czech and Romani, but Romani radio is broadcast in Czech {{and there is no}} Romani television. Romani is also absent from legislative, judiciary, and other political texts but it has recently entered some university and elementary school courses. Life expectancy, literacy, median wage, <b>school</b> <b>enrolment,</b> and other socio-economic markers remain low while, according to Říčan (1998), Roma compose the majority of prison and habitual offender populations despite accounting for only a fraction of a percent of Czech population.|$|E
25|$|A trade liberalization-versus-inequality graph has a {{measures}} trade openness {{along the}} x-axis and inequality along the y-axis. Dobson and Ramlogan determine trade openness by {{the ratio of}} exports and imports (the total trade) and the average tariff rate; inequality is determined by gross primary <b>school</b> <b>enrolment</b> rates, the share of agriculture in total output, the rate of inflation, and cumulative privatization. By studying data from several Latin American countries that have implemented trade liberalization policies in the past 30 years, the Kuznets curve seems {{to apply to the}} relationship between trade liberalization and inequality (measured by the GINI coefficient). However, many of these nations saw a shift from low-skill labour production to natural resource intensive activities. This shift would not benefit low-skill workers as much. So although their evidence seems to support the Kuznets theory in relation to trade liberalization, Dobson and Ramlogan assert that policies for redistribution must be simultaneously implemented in order to mitigate the initial increase in inequality felt.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{because of}} its reputation, the demand for places in the school has outstripped capacity, and entry was selective. The school was zoned {{at least since the}} 1960s. Since 2000, school zoning is {{determined}} by a state <b>school</b> <b>enrolment</b> scheme, which gives first preference to students living in a designated home zone, and then to brothers of current students who live outside the zone. The school argues that zoning increases house prices in the zone, reducing access to the school for students from lower socio-economic groups. Research by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand shows there is a 30 percent premium ($257,000) on houses in-zone compared to those out of zone. In 2014, nearby One Tree Hill College and Selwyn College introduced enrolment schemes which initially planned to overlap parts of the Auckland Grammar zone. Both were forced to backtrack after opposition from parents in the overlapping areas, who feared it could ultimately lead to Auckland Grammar shrinking its zone and affecting the resale value of their homes.|$|E

Popular high-decile schools experienced large roll growths, while less popular low-decile school experienced roll declines.

During World War II, when wartime conditions {{made it impossible for}} many children to attend <b>school,</b> <b>enrolments</b> in the Primary Correspondence School rose to a peak of 11,000 with a staff of 150.
