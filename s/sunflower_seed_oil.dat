25|$|Citrus fruits, vegetables, cereal grains, olive oil, and wine—Spain's {{traditional}} agricultural products—continued to {{be important}} in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and dairy products. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did <b>sunflower</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the European Community.|$|E

L. plantarum PE 21, L. curvatus PE 4 and W. confusa PE 36 were selected based on the kinetics of growth and acidification, and used as the autochthonous mixed starter for the fermentation of RYPs. A protocol which included blanching at 85 °C for 2 min, fermentation at 35 °C for 15 h in brine (1 %, w/v), and heat treatment at 85 °C for 15 min, followed by storage at roomtemperature for 30 days with and without <b>sunflower</b> <b>seeds</b> <b>oil</b> was set up.
