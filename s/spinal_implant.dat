40|$|Study Design: A {{retrospective}} study of tissue surrounding titanium alloy <b>spinal</b> <b>implants</b> was performed using histological and electron microprobe analysis. Purpose: To identify the metal debris generated by <b>spinal</b> <b>implants,</b> {{and then to}} evaluate the electron microprobe analysis results and the histological response of soft tissue surrounding the <b>spinal</b> <b>implants.</b> Overview of Literature: Microscopic metal particles from the soft tissue surrounding joint arthroplasty {{have been shown to}} activate a macrophage response that leads to bone resorption and increased inflammation. The effect of unintended wear particles in spinal instrumentation remains a clinical concern. Methods: Ten patients (average age, 51. 3 years), 6 men and 4 women, who had undergone previous lumbar fusions using pedicle screw instrumentation and who were now undergoing revision surgery were included in the study. The tissues obtained from the adjacent area of these implants were analyzed by light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscope. After the removing the <b>spinal</b> <b>implants,</b> the changes of back pain and the spinal fusion were assessed. Results: There were metal particles in the soft tissue in 7 cases. Histological finding observed mild chronic inflammation surrounding the deposition of the metal particles and the anti Cotrel-Dubousset 68 positive macrophages were observed at tissue adjacent to the metal particles in 5 patients. Scanning electron microscopy of the specimens showed metallic debris within the tissue and mapping of the metallic particles revealed the distribution of titanium in the tissue in 5 cases. Nine patients had successful relief of back pain after removing the <b>spinal</b> <b>implants.</b> Improvement of the back pain may be an association macrophage response rather than the metal particle. Conclusions: The presence of metallic particles generated from <b>spinal</b> <b>implants</b> may serve as the impetus for a late-onset inflammatory response and late operative site pain...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{combination}} of surgery and radiation therapy {{is a common}} clinical practice {{in the treatment of}} spi-nal tumors.

Methods: We performed four <b>spinal</b> <b>implant</b> reconstructions on standard sawbones spine models: posterior instru-mentation without anterior column reconstruction, posterior instrumentation with anterior column reconstruction with use of a titanium cage, anterior instrumentation with anterior column reconstruction with use of a titanium cage, and anterior instrumentation with anterior column reconstruction with use of chest tubes filled with bone cement. Irradia-tion with two different radiation therapy units (a cobalt- 60 teletherapy unit and a linear accelerator) was performed twice for each model in a posterior-to-anterior direction, and thermoluminescent dosimeters were used to measure the dose changes in the anterior, middle, and posterior portions of the spinal canal. Results: Compared with the sawbones-only model, the posterior instrumentation reconstructions resulted in a 5 % to 7 % decrease in the radiation dose delivered to the spinal canal with both radiation therapy units, whereas the ante-rior instrumentation reconstructions resulted in a 1 % decrease in the dose delivered with the linear accelerator uni...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of compressive residual stress {{is an effective}} way to reduce fretting fatigue and fretting wear between a <b>spinal</b> <b>implant</b> rod and its holding fixture. The objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate that cavitation peening can introduce compressive residual stress into the surface of a <b>spinal</b> <b>implant</b> rod manufactured from medical grade tita nium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, which has already been processed by glass shot peening. In order to apply the cavitation peening for the small rod, whose diameter is only 5. 5 mm, the cavitating region was concentrated by increasing the ambient pressure. The depth profiles of the resulting residual stress were evaluated by X-ray diffraction following layer removal by electropolishing. The results show that cavitation peening creates compressive residual stress deeper into the rod, even though the stress value at the near surface is saturated due to initial processing using glass shot peening. The depth of the compressive residual stress continuously increases from 44 μm to 230 μm with an increase in the cavitation peen ing processing time. In addition, the full width at half maximum value of the X-ray diffraction profile, which is closely related to the micro-strain, decreases by up to 32 % following the application of cavitation peening. </p...|$|E
40|$|Solid implant rods made of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (ELI) are {{currently}} used in <b>spinal</b> <b>implant</b> devices. Due {{to the high}} stiffness of these solid rods, the implant devices are unable the meet the needs for increased flexibility {{over a wide range}} of human activities owing to changes in lifestyles and in human work environments, thereby, necessitating the need for more flexible rods. Hence, designing, developing, manufacturing and testing flexible <b>spinal</b> <b>implant</b> rods is the aim of this project. In this project, increased flexibility has been achieved by reducing the cross-section of the solid rods. Since reduction in cross-section leads to reduced load bearing capacity, the fatigue endurance level of the flexible rods is lowered.

30|$|Spinal {{arthrodesis}} with {{titanium alloy}} instrumentation is {{popular due to}} higher corrosion resistance and biocompatibility in comparison with other biomaterials such as stainless steel and cobalt chrome alloys. There is current literature that provides concerning evidence to support metal wear debris being systemically distributed and deposited in solid organs. This literature is confined to animal model and human cadaveric studies only and relates exclusively to hip replacement prostheses [11, 12]. A number of human studies investigating serum metal ion levels following spinal instrumentation (both stainless steel and titanium alloys) all report abnormally elevated metal ion levels (chromium, nickel, iron, titanium and aluminium) [10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Wang et al. demonstrated that patients with pseudarthrosis of titanium <b>spinal</b> <b>implants</b> generated much higher metal debris [6]. On {{the basis of these}} findings, it seems reasonable to suggest a self-perpetuating cycle of wear, corrosion and <b>implant</b> failure in <b>spinal</b> <b>implants</b> contributing to these findings. However, the exact moment of release of metal ions during the process has not been extensively reviewed or studied.|$|R

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether metal ion concentrations are elevated {{in patients with}} spinal instrumentation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Studies have shown that serum and urinary levels of component metal ions are abnormally elevated in patients with total joint arthroplasties. Little is known of metal ion release and concentrations in patients with spinal instrumentation. METHODS: The study group consisted of patients who had undergone spinal instrumentation for various spinal disorders {{with a variety of}} stainless steel implants, 5 to 25 years previously. A group of volunteers without metal implants were controls. All subjects were tested for serum nickel, blood chromium, and random urine chromium/creatinine ratio estimation. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 32 patients with retained implants and 12 patients whose implants had been removed. There were 26 unmatched controls. There was no difference in serum nickel and blood chromium levels between all 3 groups. The mean urinary chromium/creatinine ratio for patients with implants and those with implants removed was significantly greater than controls (P < 0. 001). The difference between study subgroups was not significant (P = 0. 16). Of several patient and instrumentation variables, only the number of couplings approached significance for correlation with the urine chromium excretion (P = 0. 07). CONCLUSION: <b>Spinal</b> <b>implants</b> do not raise the levels of serum nickel and blood chromium. There is evidence that metal ions are released from <b>spinal</b> <b>implants</b> and excreted in urine. The excretion of chromium in patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>implants</b> was significantly greater than normal controls although lower where the implants have been removed. The findings are consistent with low-grade release of ions from implants with rapid clearance, thus maintaining normal serum levels. Levels of metal ions in the body fluids probably do not reach a level that causes late side-effect; hence, routine removal of the implants cannot be recommended...|$|R
