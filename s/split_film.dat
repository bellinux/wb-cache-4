40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, we {{aimed to}} provide {{experimental}} data to validate CFD for pollutant diffusion around buildings in non-isothermal flow. We developed {{a system for}} simultaneously measuring fluctuating velocity, temperature and concentration. The system compensates for the contribution of temperature to output voltage of a <b>split</b> <b>film</b> with a cold wire. We made a calibra-tor for a <b>split</b> <b>film</b> for different temperatures and proposed calibration equations for it, and it showed good performance. These equations {{can be used to}} simultaneously measure wind veloci-ty and temperature around buildings in non-isothermal flow. We used a high speed flame ioniza-tion detector to measure concentration simultaneously with wind velocity and temperature, enabling us to provide turbulence statistics such as heat flux and concentration flux...|$|E

40|$|Reattachment of a {{turbulent}} shear layer {{is an important}} process in wide variety of engineering systems. A few examples of such systems arc diffusers, airfoils with separation bubbles, sudden area expansion in pipes or ducts, buildings and fences. Comparison of experimental data and evaluation of previous works on this subject are complicated by lack of instruments reliable in the separation regions. In this paper, an experiment was conducted employing a <b>split</b> <b>film</b> probe in the backward facing step which has large expansion ratio and high Reynolds number. A <b>split</b> <b>film</b> probe can measure the instantaneous magnitude {{and direction of the}} velocity in the separation region. From these measurement data, time-mean velocity profiles, turbulence intensities and forward flow fraction were evaluated. The experimental results brought out several features of the complex separation-reattachment process. Free shear layer was fully developed upstream of time-mean reattachment point. The maximum root-mean-squares of longitudinal velocity and of lateral velocity were about 0. 22 and 0. 14 at about x/x_R= 0. 6 and 0. 8 respectively, where x is the longitudinal distance and x_R is the time-mean reattachment length. Unsteady reversing flow fraction still extended beyond time-mean reattachment point...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As a {{first step}} to clarify the bridge {{response}} characteristics in complex terrain, the flow structure {{in the wake of}} a conical hill that causes large horizontal response of a horizon-tally supported cantilever model was studied. Fluctuating wind velocities of u-, v-, w-components were measured with <b>split</b> <b>film</b> probes, and they were conditionally sampled based on the large horizontal response of the cantilever model. A clear flow structure with velocity toward downward and inward that acted around the tip location of the cantilever model was observed and it was thought to cause the large response. The flow structure seemed to de-velop as a downward flow and change its direction horizontally near the ground, and then intensify its magnitude in horizontal velocity components. The front line of the structure was skewed about 40 degrees from normal to the mean flow direction...|$|E
40|$|A {{polarization}} {{phase shifting}} lateral shearing interferometer {{based on a}} polarization beam splitting plate(PBSP) is proposed. The front surface of the PBSP is coated with polarization beam <b>splitting</b> <b>film</b> and its back surface is coated with total reflection film. The beam to be tested is split by the PBSP with an incidence angle of 45 and divided into two mutually perpendicular linearly polarization beams. Phase shifting can be introduced to the interferometer when the PBSP is combined with a polarzation temporal or spatial phase shifter. A polarizaiton temporal phase shifting lateral shearing interferometer system is built up both with the ASAP software and the experiments. The usefulness of the interferometer is verified...|$|R

40|$|Two {{dimensional}} subsonic {{wind tunnel}} tests were conducted on a 20 % thickness: chord ratio circulation controlled elliptic aerofoil section equipped with forward and reverse blowing slots. Overall performance measurements were made over a range of trailing edge blowing momentum coefficients from 0 to 0. 04; some included the effect of leading edge blowing. A detailed investigation of the trailing edge wall jet, using <b>split</b> <b>film</b> probes, hot wire probes and total head tubes, provided measurements of mean velocity components, Reynolds normal and shear stresses, and radial static pressure. The closure of the two dimensional angular momentum and continuity equations was examined using the measured data, with and without correction, {{and the difficulty of}} obtaining a satisfactory solution illustrated. Suggestions regarding the nature of the flow field which should aid the understanding of Coanda effect and the theoretical solution of highly curved wall jet flows are presented...|$|E
40|$|The Combined Surface Blowing (CSB) V/STOL lift/propulsion system {{consists}} of a blown flap system which deflects the exhaust from a turbojet engine over a system of flaps deployed at {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. Flow measurements consisting of velocity measurements using <b>split</b> <b>film</b> probes and total measure surveys using a miniature Kiel probe were made at control stations along the flap systems at two spanwise stations, the centerline of the nozzle and 60 percent of the nozzle span outboard of the centerline. Surface pressure measurements were made in the wing cove and the upper surface of the first flap element. The test showed a significant flow separation in the wing cove. The extent of the separation is so large that the flow into the first flap takes place only at {{the leading edge of the}} flap. The velocity profile measurements indicate that large spanwise (3 dimensional) flow may exist...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} conducted in the OSU subsonic tunnel to measure {{the characteristics of the}} separation bubble on an airfoil with glaze ice. A measured glaze ice accretion on a NACA 0012 airfoil was simulated in wood for this dry tunnel test. The 21 inch chord model was pressure belted and the ice shape internally tapped to obtain surface pressures, lift and moment coefficients. A wake survey probe was used to obtain airfoil drag. The separation bubble was explored by measuring the time averaged velocities using a <b>split</b> <b>film</b> probe. The probe was positioned using a computer controlled two-dimensional traversing system. In this paper, airfoil lift, drag, and moment coefficient data are compared for the airfoil with and without glaze ice. Velocity profiles in the separation bubble are presented for several chordwise stations at three angles of attack. The ice shape caused a severe lift and drag penalty. The velocity profiles show clearly the large bubble geometry, regions of reversed flow, and bubble reattachment...|$|E

2500|$|Kill Bill {{was planned}} and {{produced}} {{as a single}} film. After shooting ended and editing began, producer Harvey Weinstein, known for pressuring filmmakers to shorten their films, suggested that Tarantino <b>split</b> the <b>film</b> in two. The decision meant Tarantino {{did not have to}} cut scenes, such as the anime sequence. He told IGN: [...] "I'm talking about scenes that {{are some of the best}} scenes in the movie, but in this hurdling pace where you're trying to tell only one story, that would have been the stuff that would have had to go. But to me, that's kind of what the movie was, are these little detours and these little grace notes." [...] The decision to <b>split</b> the <b>film</b> was announced in July 2003.|$|R
50|$|Kill Bill: Volume 2 was {{released}} in theaters on April 16, 2004.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} the effects of normal velocity gradients on hot wire measurements in a subsonic boundary layer {{of the same size}} as the flow investigated by Johnson and Rose (1975). Both hot wire and film anemometers were used to measure the turbulent properties of the boundary layer. A special X-wire probe with one wire vertical and the other at an angle of about 40 deg to the flow was used to demonstrate the gradient effects. The results indicate that major errors are encountered when mean and turbulent velocity gradients exist along the length of hot wire sensors, the problem being more pronounced at high speeds. Although the <b>split</b> <b>film</b> sensor results show a significant improvement over the X-wire sensor, further reduction in the space resolution of sensors by roughly an order of magnitude would appear to be necessary to reduce the error to acceptable values near the wall...|$|E
40|$|Curved {{diffusers}} {{are used}} in pipe lines or in some fluid machineries, such as blades of impeller, a volute casing, or suction duct. The performance of the curved diffuser has a considerable effect on the energy conversion in the pipe lines or the machineries. Furthermore, the volute casing in the pumps or blowers is generally attached to the radial diffuser, so that the flow in the volute or scroll casing has usually very high complexities. The flow in the volute casing will be moderated by {{the combination of the}} single curved diffuser and the longitudinal side wall slit duct. However, the studies to the flow in the curved diffuser with the longitudinal slit, were merely conducted in the past ages. In this report, as a step of the study of the flow in the volute casing, experiments of flow in a two-dimensional curved diffuser, which has a small diverging angle and 90 ° turning angle, were carried out. The time average velocities and velocity fluctuations were measured using a constant temperature hot-wire or <b>split</b> <b>film</b> probe system. It is shown that the flow in the curved diffuser has velocity profiles with gradually variant gradients and attached to the outer side wall, and the profiles of velocity fluctuations have very interesting patterns concernig to the stall and the secondary flow...|$|E
