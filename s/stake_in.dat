40|$|Abstract: This paper reviews ten {{published}} articles on deterrence {{that address the}} interaction of <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> conformity with the perception of legal risk. These articles are classified by types of <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> conformity examined, such as marriage, education, and employment, and more general types of <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> conformity, such as social identity. Analysis of evidence suggests that some individuals with low <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> conformity may be less deterrable by legal sanctions and for those with high <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> conformity, legal sanctions, such as imprisonment, may increase recidivism. The results, however, continue to show an incongruence between whether and which <b>stakes</b> <b>in</b> conformity act as a consistent deterrent...|$|R
