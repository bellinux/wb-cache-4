Of those twelve, seven were Prophets of Israel and were male. The remaining five were prophets of the Classical World, called Sibyls and were female. The prophet Jonah is placed above the altar and Zechariah at the further end. The other male and female figures alternate down each side, each being identified by an inscription on a painted marble panel supported by a putto.|$|E

25|$|The {{definition}} of scope was introduced {{early in the}} development of Logical Form scholarship. The scope of an operator is the domain within which it has the ability to affect the interpretation of other expressions. In other words, an operator has scope of operation, or affecting the interpretation of other phrases, only within its own domain. Three uncontroversial examples of scope affecting <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interpretation are: quantifier-quantifier, quantifier-pronoun, quantifier-negative polarity item.|$|E
25|$|The Temple Mount is the holiest site in Judaism, which regards it as {{the place}} where God's divine {{presence}} is manifested more {{than in any other}} place, and is the place Jews turn towards during prayer. Due to its extreme sanctity, many Jews will not walk on the Mount itself, to avoid unintentionally entering the area where the Holy of Holies stood, since according to Rabbinical law, <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine presence is still present at the site. It was from the Holy of Holies that the High Priest communicated directly with God.|$|E

25|$|If {{it is so}} {{difficult}} to define terms such as 'psychology' with such precision, why bother? Why not just agree that we all have at least a rough idea of what psychology is, and take {{the rest of the afternoon}} off? After all, if theoretical or empirical work improves our understanding of <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world or our fellow people, or improves our ability to help people enhance their physical or emotional well being, what difference does it make whether this work is considered a part of psychology, of cognitive science, of behavioral neuroscience, of public health, or what have you? This raises the question of what definitions in general are good for.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the plot}} twists are {{the death of}} {{apparently}} crucial characters and the reappearances of believed-to-be dead characters. However, Rachael Brown of The Atlantic said that Martin's penchant for unpredictability may make the reader grow increasingly skeptical of apparent deaths, alluding to Jon Snow's fate in A Dance with Dragons. Martin believes that bringing back a dead character necessitates a transformative experience of the character. The body may be moving, but <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spirit is changed or lost. One of the characters who has come back repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord, and what has happened with him echoes {{with some of the}} other revived characters; bits of his humanity and his past lives are lost every time he comes back from death, his flesh is falling away from him, but he remembers the mission he was sent to do before death.|$|E

500|$|Confronting these blurred {{distinctions between}} gods and other beings, {{scholars}} have proposed various definitions of a [...] "deity". One widely accepted definition, suggested by Jan Assmann, {{says that a}} deity has a cult, is involved in <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe, and is described in mythology {{or other forms of}} written tradition. According to a different definition, by Dimitri Meeks, nṯr applied to any being that was the focus of ritual. From this perspective, [...] "gods" [...] included the king, who was called a god after his coronation rites, and deceased souls, who entered the divine realm through funeral ceremonies. Likewise, the preeminence of the great gods was maintained by the ritual devotion that was performed for them across Egypt.|$|E
500|$|As {{a further}} means of misdirection, the Turk {{came with a}} small wooden coffin-like box that the {{presenter}} would place {{on the top of}} the cabinet. While Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a later owner of the machine, did not use the box, Kempelen often peered into the box during play, suggesting that the box controlled <b>some</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine. The box was believed by some to have supernatural power; Karl Gottlieb von Windisch wrote in his 1784 book Inanimate Reason that [...] "ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten the tales she had been told in her youth… went and hid herself in a window seat, as distant as she could from the evil spirit, which she firmly believed possessed the machine".|$|E
