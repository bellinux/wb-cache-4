40|$|We present {{experimental}} and numerical {{results of the}} effect that a partial discharge has on the morphological and micro-mechanical properties of non-spherical, convex particles in a silo. The comparison of the particle orientation after filling the silo and its subsequent partial discharge reveals important shearinduced orientation, which affects stress propagation. For elongated particles, the flow induces {{an increase in the}} packing disorder which leads to a reduction of the vertical stress propagation developed during the deposit generated prior to the partial discharge. For square particles, the flow favors particle alignment with the lateral walls promoting a behavior opposite to the one of the elongated particles: vertical force transmission, parallel to gravity, is induced.

40|$|Introduction One {{out of many}} {{interesting}} {{features of}} granulates 1 is the stress distribution in static arrays of sand. The pressure in a <b>silo</b> <b>filled</b> with grains does not increase linearly with depth {{as in the case}} of a liquid filling. Instead, the stress saturates at a certain value 2 due to arching and internal friction. Thus the walls of the silo carry a part of the materials' weight. In a pile of sand where no vertical walls are present the total weight of the pile is carried by the bottom. However, the distribution of forces under and inside the material is not yet completely understood. Experiments on piles with many thousands of particles reveal a relative minimum in the vertical stress at the bottom of the pile, the so-called dip. 3; 4 In the presence of disorder, stress chains are observed, i. e. stresses are mainly transported along selected paths, and the probability distribution of stress spans sev...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The flow {{behaviour}} of granular materials is relevant for many industrial applications including the pharmaceutical, chemical, consumer goods and food industries. A key {{issue is the}} accurate characterisation of these powders under different loading conditions and flow regimes, for example in mixers, pneumatic conveyors and <b>silo</b> <b>filling</b> and discharge. This paper explores the experimental aspects of cohesive powder handling at different compaction levels and flow regimes, namely inertial and quasi-static regimes. So far, laboratory element test set-ups capable of defining the full stress states at very low compaction levels have not been fully explored in literature. In contrast the mechanical behaviour of cohesive powders under relatively high consolidation stress (several kPa upward) can be carefully measured using element tests such as biaxial test, true triaxial and hollow cylinder tests. However in practice these tests are expensive and slow to conduct and are almost never performed for many industrial applications requiring material characterisation.

40|$|The {{storage silo}} of a sugar {{refinery}} {{was designed by}} its manufacturer for a plug-flow pattern of sugar ingots {{in order to ensure}} effective drying of the sugar introduced {{at the top of the}} silo.

Depending on the drainage properties of the stored material, the effect of the filling process may be time-dependent. The excess pore water pressure resulting from the filling process may cause a substantial increase in the hoop stresses in the wall.

40|$|Silage is {{a common}} way of storing and feeding forage in the United States. There are 4 phases (aerobic, anaerobic, stable, and feedout) that silage undergoes. The most {{critical}} phases to manage to minimize nutritive losses are when the silage is going from an aerobic to an anaerobic environment and at feedout. The first important step in achieving silage of high nutritive value is to harvest at the proper maturity and moisture level. Alfalfa should be harvested between mid bud and one-tenth bloom, and corn should be harvested between one-half and two-thirds milkline. The type of silo (pile, bunker, bag, or upright) {{has an impact on}} silage DM lost during storage. Bunker silos and piles usually have higher silage DM loss than bag and upright silos primarily because there is a greater amount of surface area exposed to oxygen. Limited research suggests that the nutritive value of high DM corn silage (~ 38 %) can be preserved better (increased milk production) in a bagged silo system compared to a bunker <b>silo.</b> <b>Filling</b> bunker silos rapidly using the progressive wedge technique has been shown to improve the nutritive value of silage. Covering bunker silos with polyethylene plastic also improves the amount of silage DM recovered and the nutritive value of both hay crop and corn silage.

40|$|ABSTRACT. High densities in bunker silos {{minimize}} {{losses and}} reduce storage costs; however, the guidelines to attain high densities {{are based on}} relatively little research. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine those practices or factors most correlated with bunker silo density. Density was measured in 175 bunker silos across Wisconsin using core samples collected at chest height (1. 13 m, 3. 70 ft, on average) across the feed-out face. <b>Silo</b> <b>filling</b> practices were surveyed and correlated with density. Most silages sampled were alfalfa or corn. Dry matter densities ranged from 106 to 434 kg/m 3 (6. 6 to 27. 1 lb/ft 3). The core densities were correlated with the height of silage above the core, indicating the effect of selfcompaction. To adjust for this, all densities were corrected for the median depth below the surface (2. 16 m or 7. 09 ft) using the equations of Pitt (1983) for density with height for the center of tower silos. The adjusted dry matter densities were most strongly correlated with how thinly a load was spread (L), tractor weight (W), packing time per tonne as-fed (T), and dry matter content (D). These four factors were combined into a packing factor [W (TD) 1 / 2 L – 1] that explained 18. 2 % of the variation in dry matter density. Additional factors such as the use of dual wheels, etc. did not significantly improve the prediction of dry matter density.
