The phosphor was normally {{a very dark}} color, and lit up brightly when the electron beam hit it, appearing to be green or amber on black, depending on phosphors applied on a monochrome <b>screen.</b> <b>RGB</b> screens continued along a similar vein, using all the beams set to [...] "on" [...] to form white.|$|E
40|$|In {{a digital}} age where artists and {{printers}} {{are required to}} learn {{a wide range of}} skills, from graphic design to colour science, is it possible to return to a more artistic application of colour, tone and texture with a mechanically printed image using CAD software? The reproduction of digitally generated works is divided between the on <b>screen</b> (<b>RGB)</b> representation of colour and a colorimetric translation through an imaging pipeline to a printing device (CMYK). The developers’ goal of inkjet hardware and software is to match printed colour and texture {{as close as possible to}} its on screen representation. The texture in this case is a simulation though contrast, tone and through the illusional properties of halftoning. So far inkjet has not fully addressed the three dimensional rendering of texture. As touch-screen devices develop and evolve to replicate the creative methods of the artist, can an on screen difference in appearance between a thickly applied paint or watercolour, be replicated in the same way through the printing hardware? Drawing tablets have made digital input devices closer to how an artist would intuitively generate the image, so now is it the turn of the digital printer to bring the prints closer to how artists would apply the colour? My research and practice explores tonal image creation through texture via a variety of digital output devices that are not solely restricted to digital print machines. By looking at 19 th century photomechanical methods of low relief continuous tone images, primarily focusing on the Woodburytype. The Woodburytype process translates a two-dimensional tonal gradation present in the image to a three dimensional model in gelatine. The Woodburytype photomechanical print is the only continuous tone print process ever invented. The research moves into the 21 st century investigating alternative methods that incorporates vector based software and 3 D printing. The surface relief contained within the image is created through the varying density of pigmented gelatin which is used as a vehicle to transfer the image on to paper. However the Woodburytype and variations of the process have been achieved so far as single colour prints. Limitations with their technical process and materials available in the 19 th Century meant that the processes were never finalised. Within the context of 21 st Century technologies this research proposes to digitally explore the generation of print matrices through CNC and additive layer manufacturing (3 D printing) and the exploration of alternative materials that emulate 19 th Century pigmented gelatins but will assist in the introduction of two or more colours to create a more robust surface relief whilst retaining the photographic image qualities. By exploring, adapting and modifying current technology and methodologies the research and practice will provide the opportunity for developing closer links and crossovers between the industrial printer and the artistic printmaker. It intends to explore and create controlled mechanical output of images through an investigation of the practitioner application of colour...|$|E

50|$|Using {{additive}} colors such {{as those}} on computer screens, {{it is possible to}} create a much brighter purple than with pigments where the mixing subtracts frequencies from the component primary colors. The equivalent color on a computer to the pigment color red-violet shown above would be this electric purple, i.e. the much brighter purple you can see reproduced on the screen of a computer. This color is pure purple conceived as computer artists conceive it, as the color on the color wheel halfway between color wheel violet and electric magenta. Thus, electric purple is the purest and brightest purple {{that it is possible to}} display on a computer <b>screen.</b> Its <b>RGB</b> code is (191, 0, 255).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{color space}} {{used to create}} color on a {{computer}} monitor or a television <b>screen</b> is <b>RGB</b> color space. However, RGB color space is strongly related to each other, therefore RGB color space is inadequate for adjustment of brightness or contrast. Moreover RGB color space is not suitable for pattern recognition. For this reason, it is needed that color space conversion from RGB to YIQ, YUV or YCrCb. The color space conversion matrix consists of 3 by 3 matrix element that is represented by floating point numbers. However RGB or YUV color space is in integer domain. Therefore these transform lead to lose the least significant bit (LSB) of color space. We propose the simple and fast reversible transform matrix. No lose the least significant bit (LSB) and not required multiplication but shift and addition that provides for real time conversion of huge image...|$|R
50|$|Brown {{colors are}} dark or muted shades of reds, oranges, and yellows which are created on {{computer}} and television <b>screens</b> using the <b>RGB</b> color model and in printing with the CMYK color model. Browns {{can also be}} created by mixing two complementary colors from the RYB color model (combining all three primary colors). In theory, such combinations should produce black, but produce brown because most commercially available blue pigments tend to be comparatively weaker; the stronger red and yellow colors prevail, thus creating the following tones. Below {{is a list of}} some of the common brown colors.|$|R
50|$|The RGB color model, {{invented in}} the 19th century and fully {{developed}} in the 20th century, uses combinations of red, green, and blue light against a black background to make the colors seen on a computer monitor or television <b>screen.</b> In the <b>RGB</b> model, the primary colors are red, green and blue. The complementary primary-secondary combinations are red-cyan, green-magenta, and blue-yellow. In the RGB color model, the light of two complementary colors, such as red and cyan, combined at full intensity, will make white light, since two complementary colors contain light with {{the full range of}} the spectrum. If the light is not fully intense, the resulting light will be gray.|$|R

5000|$|Adobe Fireworks (formerly a Macromedia product) is a vector editor with bitmap editing {{capabilities}} {{with its}} main purpose being {{the creation of}} graphics for Web and <b>screen.</b> Fireworks supports <b>RGB</b> color scheme and has no CMYK support. This means it is mostly used for screen design. The native Fireworks file format is editable PNG (FWPNG or PNG). Adobe Fireworks has a competitive price but its features can seem limited in comparison with other products. It is easier to learn than other products and can produce complex vector artwork. The Fireworks editable PNG file format is not supported by other Adobe products. Fireworks can manage the PSD and AI file formats which enables it to be integrated with other Adobe apps. Fireworks can also open FWPNG/PNG, PSD, AI, EPS, JPG, GIF, BMP, TIFF file formats, and save/export to FWPNG/PNG, PSD, AI (v.8), FXG (v.2.0), JPG, GIF, PDF, SWF and some others; recently, also some support for exporting to SVG has been added (via a free Export extension).|$|R
40|$|Subject of study. The paper {{deals with}} light quality {{improvement}} of multi–chip RGB light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and luminaries on their basis. In particular, we {{have studied the}} issues of the edge effect reducing, which is non–uniformity of color when observing the source of light under different angles as well as non-uniformity of color distribution on the illuminated surface. Methods. Experimental study of the edge effect has been performed, namely, the analysis of the halo at the periphery of the illuminated area and the non–uniformity of area at the surface of the <b>screen</b> illuminated with <b>RGB</b> LEDs with and without light concentrators. Modeling of illumination distribution at various distances from the source for the system containing four RGB LEDs with reflectors by ZEMAX software has been carried out. Assessment of the uniformity for light distribution via calculating the chromaticity coordinates has been performed. Main results. The possibility of modeling application at the stage of a luminary design is shown on the example of RGB LEDs for assessing the efficiency of light flux usage and colorimetric parameters. Suggested method simplifies significantly the design of luminaries and reduces associated costs. Practical relevance. The findings can be used in the design of luminaries based on RGB LEDs, including the ones with secondary optics elements. ...|$|R

Our ongoing survey of M 31 includes wide-field deep optical images in the intermediate-width DDO 51 band and Washington system M and T_ 2 bands obtained with the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4 -m telescope and Mosaic camera. The DDO 51 band allows us to <b>screen</b> M 31 <b>RGB</b> star candidates from foreground Galactic dwarf star contaminants. The imaging is followed up with spectroscopy using the Keck II 10 -m telescope and DEIMOS. A combination of photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics is used to reliably isolate M 31 RGB stars; these stars are seen {{in all of our}} fields out to a projected distance of 165 kpc from M 31 's center. These newly discovered RGB stars represent the hitherto elusive stellar halo of M 31. The surface brightness of M 31 beyond r > 30 kpc is characterized by a power law, r^{- 2. 6 +/- 0. 3 }, distinct from the Se'rsic profile that characterizes its extended bulge. Our data show that M 31 is 3 - 5 times larger than any of its previously mapped spheroidal/disk components. Together, the Galactic and M 31 halos span > 1 / 3 of the distance between them, suggesting that stars occupy a substantial volume fraction of our Local Group, and possibly most galaxy groups...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{significant}} recent {{breakthrough in}} medical imaging {{is the development}} of a new non-invasive modality based on multispectral and hyperspectral imaging that can be easily integrated in the operating room. This technology consists of collecting series of images at wavelength intervals of only few nanometers and in which single pixels have spectral information content relevant to the scene under observation. Before becoming of practical interest for the clinician, such system should meet important requirements. Firstly, it should enable real reflectance measurements and high quality images to dispose of valuable physical data after spatial and spectral calibration. Secondly, quick band pass scanning and a smart interface are needed for intra-operative mode. Finally, experimentation is required to develop expert knowledge for hyperspectral image interpretation and result display on <b>RGB</b> <b>screens,</b> to assist the surgeon with tissue detection and diagnostic capabilities during an intervention. This paper is focused mainly on the two first specifications of this methodology applied to a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) based visible and near infrared spectral imaging system. The system consists of an illumination unit and a spectral imager that includes a monochrome camera, two LCTFs and a fixed focal lens. It also involves a computer with the data acquisition software. The system can capture hyperspectral images in the spectral range of 400 - 1100 nm. Results of preclinical experiments indicated that anatomical tissues can be distinguished especially in near infrared bands. This promises a great capability of hyperspectral imaging to bring efficient assistance for surgeons...|$|R
