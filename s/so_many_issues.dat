500|$|The most {{important}} thing for Paterson was to keep the spirit of the book alive while finding a way to transform it from [...] "a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium". Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination. While Paterson focused on [...] "bringing out the emotions of the story," [...] he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia [...] "because it was too close". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. [...] "What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way", David said. Csupó noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book. Csupó reasons that the movie [...] "deals with <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>issues</b> including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that", so it [...] "made more sense" [...] to make the characters older.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{songs were}} {{inspired}} by {{the effects of the}} late-2000s recession and Hunt's experience in North Hollywood, a district marked by population density, low income, and other recession-related issues. Hunt said of the district, [...] "There's <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>issues</b> resulting from the recession. People are poor and struggling." [...] He cited North Hollywood's [...] " [...] aesthetic" [...] as an inspiration for the songwriting: [...] "It's kind of stepchild, not just to Hollywood but Studio City and Sherman Oaks. North Hollywood isn't particularly small, but it doesn't carry the same weight as the other places around it." [...] Greg Kot calls Hunt's compositions [...] "frisky and playful", and writes that most of the album's lyrical setting is North Hollywood [...] "in decline, populated with hustlers, two-timers ... Money is tight and girlfriends are fickle. Todd Martens of the Los Angeles Times comments that much of the album [...] "deals with economic difficulties and its effect on self-identity and love", and writes of its North Hollywood theme, [...] "Songs about or set in Los Angeles aren't a rarity. Yet amid the glamour, the noir and the inner-city grit lies plenty of unexplored territory. Van Hunt spends a significant portion of [...] traversing it." [...] Of Hunt's perspective on the album, Martens writes that [...] " [...] idea of beauty may be somewhat twisted ... informed by artistic roadblocks and career rejection".|$|E
