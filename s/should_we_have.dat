Labour is the lesser of two evils. What else <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>have?</b> Anarchy? Someone has to be responsible." [...] Prior to the 2005 general election, Gallagher stated that he was still supporting the Labour government partly because of his concern that [...] "Phil Collins is threatening to come back and live here.

He said: [...] "asked about their racist and bigoted views that are damaging to good community relations, it will be a good opportunity to expose what they are about." [...] When pressed on the reversal of Labour's 'No Platform' policy, Brown said [...] "The issue is: <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> someone there?

2500|$|As MNQ president, Simard {{argued that}} francophone Quebecers were unfairly {{singled out by}} Canadian federalists for having condoned racist and xenophobic {{behaviour}} in earlier times. In {{the wake of a}} public controversy over Esther Delisle's The Traitor and the Jew, which addressed historical anti-Semitism and Quebec nationalism, Simard said, [...] "Of course we denounce all forms of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, and we don't excuse it even fifty years later. But why <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to respond to [...] attacks that are obviously politically motivated?" [...] Unlike other Quebec sovereigntist groups, the MNQ under Simard's leadership sought to build links with francophone groups across Canada.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the Arab–Israeli conflict, in a January 2012 Republican debate, Romney said, [...] "Well, {{the reason}} that there’s not peace between the Palestinians and Israel is because there is — in the {{leadership}} of the Palestinian people are Hamas and others who think like Hamas, who have as their intent the elimination of Israel. And whether it’s in school books that teach how to kill Jews, or whether it’s in the political discourse that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas, there is a belief that the Jewish people do not have a right to have a Jewish state." [...] Romney added, [...] "There are some people who say <b>should</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a two state solution, and the Israelis would be happy [...] to have a two state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two state solution, they want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say the best way to have peace in the Middle East is not for us to vacillate and appease, but it is to say we stand with our friend Israel. We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel. We will not have an inch of difference between ourselves and our ally Israel." [...] Despite his pessimism about a two-state solution being achieved in the short term, Romney has defended the two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict as an ideal that ought {{to be included in the}} Republican Party platform.|$|E
