50|$|In main {{sequence}} stars {{of less than}} about 1.3 solar masses, the outer envelope of the star contains a region where partial ionization of hydrogen and helium raises the heat capacity. The relatively low temperature in this region simultaneously causes the opacity due to heavier elements to be high enough to produce a steep temperature gradient. This combination of circumstances produces an outer convection zone, the top of which is visible in the Sun as <b>solar</b> <b>granulation.</b> Low mass {{main sequence}}s of stars, such as red dwarfs below 0.35 solar masses, as well as pre-main sequence stars on the Hayashi track, are convective throughout and do not contain a radiation zone.|$|E
50|$|A more {{realistic}} {{description of the}} uppermost part of the convection zone is possible through detailed three-dimensional and time-dependent hydrodynamical simulations, taking into account radiative transfer in the atmosphere. Such simulations successfully reproduce the observed surface structure of <b>solar</b> <b>granulation,</b> as well as detailed profiles of lines in the solar radiative spectrum, {{without the use of}} parametrized models of turbulence. The simulations only cover a very small fraction of the solar radius, and are evidently far too time-consuming to be included in general solar modeling. Extrapolation of an averaged simulation through the adiabatic part of the convection zone by means of a model based on the mixing-length description, demonstrated that the adiabat predicted by the simulation was essentially consistent with the depth of the solar convection zone as determined from helioseismology. An extension of mixing-length theory, including effects of turbulent pressure and kinetic energy, based on numerical simulations of near-surface convection, has been developed.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new model of {{large-scale}} multilayer convection in solar type stars. This model allows us to understand such self-similar structures observed at <b>solar</b> surface as <b>granulation,</b> supergranulation and giant cells. We study the slow-rotated hydrogen star without magnetic field with the spherically-symmetric convective zone. The photon’s flux comes to the con-vective zone from the central thermonuclear zone of the star. The interaction of these photons with the fully ionized hydrogen plasma with T> 105 K is carried out by the Tomson scattering of photon flux on protons and elec-trons. Under these conditions plasma is optically thick relative to the Tom-son scattering. This fact is the fundamental one for the multilayer convection formation. We find the stationary solution of the convective zone structure. This solution describes the convective layers responsible to the formation of the structures on the star’s surface.

40|$|Aims. We {{estimate}} the minimum length on which <b>solar</b> <b>granulation</b> {{can be considered}} to be a Markovian process. Methods. We measure the variation in the bright difference between two pixels in images of the <b>solar</b> <b>granulation</b> for different distances between the pixels. This scale-dependent data is empirically analyzed to find the minimum scale on which the process can be considered Markovian. Results. The results suggest that the <b>solar</b> <b>granulation</b> can {{be considered to be}} a Markovian process on scales longer than rM = 300 − 500 km. On longer length scales, solar images can be considered to be a Markovian stochastic process that consists of structures of size rM. Smaller structures exhibit correlations on many scales simultaneously yet cannot be described by a hierarchical cascade in scales. An analysis of the longitudinal magnetic flux density indicates that it cannot be a Markov process on any scale. Conclusions. The results presented in this paper constitute a stringent test for the realism of numerical magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of solar magneto-convection. In future exhaustive analyse, the non-Markovian properties of the magnetic flux density on all analyzed scales might help us to understand the physical mechanism generating the field that we detect in the solar surface...|$|E

Numerical simulations show that an initial velocity pulse quickly steepens into a leading shock, while the nonlinear wake in the chromosphere leads to the formation of consecutive pulses. The time interval between arrivals of two neighboring pulses to a detection point in the corona is approximately 5 min. Therefore, the consecutive pulses may result in the 5 -min oscillations that are observed in the solar corona.

40|$|The Cycle 23 –Cycle 24 minimum {{was deep}} and prolonged, similar to minima of the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries but quite {{different}} from those between the overlapping cycles of the early space age. This provides {{a unique opportunity to}} study the Sun at very low levels of magnetic activity. Here we examine the quiet Sun, defining it to be those portions of the Sun for which continuum intensity variations are dominated by thermal perturbations as op- posed to opacity fluctuations due to the presence of magnetic fields. We briefly present evidence that: (1) The expected thermal signature of the <b>solar</b> super- <b>granulation</b> {{can not be separated from}} magnetic contributions without masking the contribution of at least 95 % of the pixels. By this measure, at most 5 % of the Sun is truly quiet. (2) There was a rapid decay of active network magnetic fields entering this solar minimum, a consequent increase in the internetwork area, but a nearly constant fractional area covered by network fields. This sug- gests the continuous fragmentation and decay of active region fields into weaker field components, but also, possibly, an underlying continuous flux concentration mechanism maintaining the network field. (3) One of the first flux emergence episodes of Cycle 24 did not occur as a coherent active region, but instead in the form of disorganized spatially-dispersed small-scale magnetic elements. Under the paradigm of a deep-rooted dynamo, this suggests an episode of incoherent field loss fromthe generation region or a failed/shredded omega loop rise through the convection zone. ...|$|R
40|$|Supergranulation is {{characterized}} by horizontally divergent flows with typical length scales of 32 Mm in the <b>solar</b> photosphere. Unlike <b>granulation,</b> the size of which is comparable to both {{the thickness of the}} radiative boundary layer and local scale height of the plasma in the photosphere, supergranulation does not reflect any obvious length scale of the solar convection zone. Early suggestions that the depth of second helium ionization is important are not supported by numerical simulations. Thus the origin of the solar supergranulation remains largely a mystery. Moreover, observations of flows in the photosphere using either Doppler imaging or correlation or feature tracking show a monotonic decrease in power at scales larger than supergranulation. Both local area and global spherical shell simulations of solar convection by contrast show the opposite, a power law increase in horizontal flow amplitudes to low wavenumber. Here we examine this disparity, and investigate how the solar supergranulation may arise as a consequence of strong photospheric driving and non-local heat transport by cool diving plumes. Using three dimensional anelastic simulations with surface driving, we show that the kinetic energy of largest convective scales in the upper layers of a stratified domain reflects the depth of transition from strong buoyant driving to adiabatic stratification below. We interpret the observed monotonic decrease in solar convective power at scales larger than supergranulation to be a consequence of this rapid transition, and show how the supergranular scale can be understood as the largest buoyantly driven mode of convection in the Sun...|$|R

The main uncertainties come from the statistical variation of the granulation pattern in the analyzed area (70 ? × 70 ?), from the film calibration and from the noise produced by film granularity. Despite these uncertainties, the <b>solar</b> <b>granulation</b> appears to vary in phase with the solar cycle as follow: the contrast decreases with increasing activity, while the horizontal scale seems to increase.

40|$|The ANTARES {{radiation}} hydrodynamics code {{is capable}} of simulating the <b>solar</b> <b>granulation</b> in detail unequaled by direct observation.

While the ANTARES code already provides promising insights into small-scale dynamical processes occurring in the quiet-Sun photosphere, it will soon be capable of modeling the latter in the scope of radiation magnetohydrodynamics. In this first preliminary study we focus on the vertical photospheric stratification by examining a 3 -D model photosphere with an evolution time much larger than the dynamical timescales of the <b>solar</b> <b>granulation</b> and of particular large horizontal extent corresponding to 25 " × 25 " on the solar surface to smooth out horizontal spatial inhomogeneities separately for up- and downflows. The highly resolved Cartesian grid thereby covers ∼ 4 Mm of the upper convection zone and the adjacent photosphere. Correlation analysis, both local and two-point, provides a suitable means to probe the photospheric structure and thereby to identify several layers of characteristic dynamics: The thermal convection zone is found to reach some ten kilometers above the solar surface, while convectively overshooting gas penetrates even higher into the low photosphere. An ≈ 145 km wide transition layer separates the convective from the oscillatory layers in the higher photosphere.

40|$|We apply {{computational}} seismic holography to high-frequency helioseismic {{observations of}} the quiet Sun from SDO/HMI to locate predominant sources of seismic emission {{with respect to the}} structure of the <b>solar</b> <b>granulation.</b> The regions of greatest seismic emission are the edges of photospheric granules. Seismic emission from regions whose continuum brightnesses are 95 - 100 % of the mean, as resolved by HMI, are about 2. 5 times as emissive as regions whose brightnesses are 100 - 104 % of the mean. The greater seismic emissivity from regions whose brightnesses are somewhat less than the mean is roughly in line with expectations from an understanding that attributes most seismic emission to cool plumes plummeting from the edges of granules. However, seismic emission from regions whose continuum brightnesses significantly exceed 104 % of the mean is also remarkably high.

The contrast also varies with the position on the equator, in phase with the scale: where the scale is larger, the contrast is higher too.
