5000|$|BS 71 Report on Dimensions of <b>Wheel</b> Rims and <b>Tyre</b> Bands for <b>Solid</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>Tyres</b> for Automobiles ...|$|R
50|$|Typical {{features}} include <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres,</b> very strong construction, and thick rubber bumpers {{along the top}} and on the ends.|$|R
5000|$|The M-48 (B-1A2) has {{light alloy}} <b>wheels</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> and {{modified}} suspension, its maximum towing speed is 30 km/h.|$|R
5000|$|... 1869, The road-steamer {{built by}} Robert William Thomson of Edinburgh became famous because its wheels were shod with heavy <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There are now various tourist buses {{decorated}} as [...] "trams", but {{running on}} <b>rubber</b> <b>tyred</b> <b>wheels</b> independently of rails, in both Perth and Fremantle. They operate {{services such as}} the Kings Park tram tour and others.|$|R
50|$|The Trevethan was an Australian {{automobile}} {{built in}} Toowoomba, Queensland by the Thomas and Walter Trevethan carriage building company. The vehicle had chain-drive and <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 60 pounder {{remained}} unchanged except for carriage modifications to enable mechanisation and new sights. Carriages were first the Mk IVR carriage that had wooden <b>wheels</b> and <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> {{and later the}} Mk IVP carriage had metal <b>wheels,</b> pneumatic <b>tyres</b> and appropriate brakes. South Africa developed a new carriage of their own design from the Mk 1, this used pneumatic <b>tyred</b> <b>wheels</b> on a two-wheel bogie.|$|R
5000|$|It {{opened its}} latest sales and service offices in Australia in Brisbane, in 2014 {{followed}} by another in Melbourne in 2015. Currently, GRI {{is one of the}} major tire manufacturers [...] operating in Sri Lanka, the largest producer of high-quality <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> in the world.|$|R
25|$|A Garford bus was {{purchased}} from New Zealand Farmers Co-op in June 1920 {{with the intention}} that it would replace the Walker electric bus on the Templeton service. Fitted with weather blinds and <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres,</b> its ride quality was no more improved {{than that of the}} vehicle it replaced.|$|R
50|$|No {{spare wheel}} was carried, {{considered}} unnecessary {{because of the}} use of run-flat (nearly <b>solid)</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> rather than pneumatic types vulnerable to punctures. Despite hard tyres, independent coil suspension gave each wheel having approximately 8 inches (20 cm) vertical deflection and coil springs all round gave a remarkably comfortable ride.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s saw {{the start}} of {{substantial}} growth {{with the formation of}} companies in the areas of electrical motor manufacturing, agricultural machinery, hotels, clothing, seafood export, computer software and <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres,</b> and in 2000 Jinasena consists of 17 companies {{and is one of the}} largest conglomerates in Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|In 1881 {{the first}} Foden {{traction}} engine {{was built in}} Sandbach, Cheshire. Then in 1898 Edwin Richard Foden influenced future truck design by designing the first steam wagon running on steel <b>tyre</b> <b>wheels</b> which had been successful until 1913 when vulcanised <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyre</b> development had advanced to the stage of allowing their fitment on heavy vehicles. Edwin introduced the first pneumatic-tyred Foden steam wagon, but as steam transport appeared to be going out of favour, Edwin {{turned his attention to}} the development of a 6-8 ton chassis fitted with new Gardner LW (Light Weight) high speed oil-engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{difference}} {{is in the}} wheels. Traction engines were generally built with large fabricated spoked steel wheels with wide rims. Those intended for road use would have continuous <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> bolted around the rims, to improve traction on tarmac. Engines intended for agricultural use would {{have a series of}} strakes bolted diagonally across the rims, like the tread on a modern pneumatic tractor <b>tyre,</b> and the <b>wheels</b> were typically wider to spread the load more evenly.|$|R
25|$|In 1917 the Board {{purchased}} {{its first}} bus and commenced a feeder service {{from the end}} of the Sockburn tram route to Templeton. The bus was a battery-powered vehicle with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> but proved to be so unreliable that it was rebuilt and converted to use a petrol engine. It was later joined by another petrol-powered bus.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} either type had steel or wooden wheels, later followed by <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b> Various developments, such as fully enclosed cabs and pneumatic tyres, were later tried by companies {{in a bid}} to compete with internal combustion engine-powered lorries. Some wagons built to run on solid tyres were later converted to pneumatic tyres.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{originally}} towed by horses but from 1916 onwards was commonly towed by the [...] "FWD" [...] 4 wheel drive 3 ton lorry as heavy field artillery. The wooden spoked wheels could be fitted with [...] "girdles" [...] {{for work in}} mud or sand to prevent them sinking. Towards {{the end of the}} war <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> were fitted over the iron <b>tyres</b> on the <b>wheel</b> rims, giving the rims a heavier appearance. It fired 22.4 million rounds on the Western Front.|$|R
50|$|Between {{the late}} 1920s {{and the early}} 1960s, some South Australian railway {{maintenance}} gangs working in country areas where {{they were required to}} live on-site, were accommodated in caravans built by the department instead of the tents they had previously used. These caravans were built like short railway carriages, about 6.1 m long; but had wooden <b>wheels</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> and ball bearings.|$|R
5000|$|When the {{original}} route commenced operation, it had four trolleybuses. [...] They were manufactured by the Railless Electric Traction Company, and powered by Siemens motors. [...] They had <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> and carried 28 passengers, who paid their fares when boarding. Known officially as [...] "trackless cars" [...] to distinguish them from trams, they ran on rural routes, to which trams were not suited.|$|R
50|$|The Ivel Agricultural Motor was light, {{powerful}} and compact. It had one front <b>wheel,</b> with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyre,</b> and two large rear wheels like a modern tractor. The engine used water cooling, by evaporation. It had one forward and one reverse gear. A pulley wheel {{on the left}} hand side allowed it {{to be used as}} a stationary engine, driving a wide range of agricultural machinery. The 1903 sale price was £300.|$|R
50|$|The type 1525 Truck, first {{produced}} in 1917, featured a 4-cylinder 4,712 cc engine with a claimed maximum power output of 22 hp. The maximum speed was given as 30 km/h (19 mph). The front-mounted engine drove {{the rear wheels}} via a four-speed gear box and a rotating steel drive-shaft. The truck came with steel wheels, which were doubled at the back, and shod with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b> The maximum usable load weight was reckoned at 4,000 kg.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike earlier [...] "Christie cruisers" [...] (A13, Marks III and IV and the Mark V Covenanter) {{that were}} built with four road wheels, Crusader had five road wheels each side to improve weight {{distribution}} {{in a tank}} that weighed almost 20 tons instead of the 14 tons of the previous cruisers. The 32 in-diameter wheels were of pressed steel with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b> The hull sides were built up of two separated plates, with the suspension arms between them.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "Beetle" [...] bus {{commenced}} {{service on}} 3 June 1918 but was never {{popular with the}} travelling public. The entrance to the vehicle was by way of narrow, steep steps, making ingress and egress difficult; the bus was initially fitted with weather blinds rather than windows, which offered little protection from the elements; <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> on rough roads made for poor ride quality; and despite frequent recharging, it occasionally failed to complete a shift without running out of power.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Humber, at {{that time}} by trade a Nottingham blacksmith, had built himself a {{velocipede}} based on a picture in a letter about the Paris-developed machine that {{was published in the}} English Mechanic magazine in late 1868. He sold it and made an improved version—bought by the same buyer. It took him 2 months to make each velocipede, he was concerned to develop improvements: <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres,</b> ball-bearings, while maintaining quality and reliability. He instituted races to win public interest.|$|R

2500|$|The 1870s and 1880s saw the {{development}} of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today, with two wheels of equal size, initially with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b> These were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism, but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears, allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals. [...] The relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes. In the late 1890s came the introduction of rim brakes and the freewheel.|$|R
5000|$|A {{special unit}} {{responsible}} for controlling traffic and servicing the vehicles numbered 300 officers and 8,500 men. The rolling stock {{was made up}} of 3500 Berliet and Renault trucks plus 800 ambulances, the latter often being Ford Model T's. Thirty breakdown trucks remained on the road at all times with repair crews stationed besides them. Any disabled vehicle was immediately moved to the roadside so as not to interrupt the flow of traffic. Automobile repair shops in Bar-le-Duc and Troyes worked ceaselessly as did hydraulic presses that renewed the truck's <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Wheels were of cast iron, {{sometimes}} wooden artillery or cart wheels {{for early}} examples. Fowler, builders of ploughing engines, built riveted steel-spoked wheels, {{as for the}} engines themselves. Their large vans differed distinctively from other makers in numerous details: side doors rather than rear, horizontal panelling and also common use of a clerestory window above. Later vans, from around 1900, carried <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b> Modern examples have sometimes been refitted with pneumatic tyres. Living vans for steam roller gangs on road construction began using pneumatic tyres in the 1930s, to avoid damage to newly-laid asphalt.|$|R
50|$|The {{driver and}} {{powerpack}} {{are at the}} front of the hull with a fully enclosed turret at the rear. It has torsion bar suspension with six dual <b>rubber</b> <b>tyred</b> road <b>wheels,</b> a drive sprocket at the front, idler at the rear and track return rollers. The PLZ-52 is offered for export.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Humber built {{himself a}} {{velocipede}} {{based on a}} picture in a letter about the Paris-developed machine that {{was published in the}} English Mechanic magazine in late 1868. It took him time to work out how to ride it but in the end he did manage to make the six miles from Nottingham to Radcliffe. He sold it and made an improved version—bought by the same buyer. It took him 2 months to make each velocipede, he was concerned to develop improvements: <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres,</b> ball-bearings, while maintaining quality and reliability. He instituted races to win public interest.|$|R
50|$|Dutton {{argued that}} a <b>rubber</b> <b>tyre</b> in contact with a hard road would be better at {{transferring}} tractive power than a steel wheel on steel rail. He claimed that the tractive effort to be obtained by using rubber-tyred driving wheels running on roads was 1330 lb per long ton of adhesive weight, compared to the 334 lb per long ton which could be obtained by using steel wheels running on rails. His proposed system would use railway trucks on rails, hauled by a rail-and-road-borne tractor which would be guided by a four-wheeled bogie on the rails, but with driving <b>wheels</b> fitted with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> which would run on well-prepared strips of road {{on each side of}} the rail track.|$|R
25|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} these engines are very large rear driving <b>wheels</b> fitted with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres,</b> three-speed gearing (most traction engine types {{have only two}} gears), rear suspension, and belly tanks to provide a greater range between the stops needed to replenish water. All these features are to improve the ride and performance of the engine, which were used for journeys of hundreds of miles. Most road locomotives are fitted with a winch drum on the back axle. This {{can be used by}} removing the driving pins from the rear wheels, allowing the drive train to power the winch drum instead of the wheels.|$|R
50|$|The Peerless lorry was a {{relatively}} slow and heavy vehicle but was reckoned to be tough, with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> and rear-wheel chain drive. The armour for the vehicle produced by the Austin company {{was based on an}} earlier design created for the Russian Army, which had been used in very limited numbers {{at the end of the}} war in France. The original Austin design, however, was shorter than the Peerless and the resulting combination was awkward and difficult to steer in confined spaces. In order to reduce the problem, a duplicate set of driving controls was installed at the rear of the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Fire Engine: Morris Fire Engine {{was built}} by the famous fire {{engineers}} M/s. John Morris and Sons Ltd of Salford, Lancashire in 1914. Only two Morris-Belsize fire-engine are known to exist in world today. Apart from the one with National Rail Museum, New Delhi, a 1912 model is preserved by the Enfield and District Veteran Vehicle. The fire engine preserved at the Enfield and District Veteran Vehicle, Whitewebbs Museum of Transport, Clay Hill, London, has been converted to use pneumatic tyres by Dennis Bros. Thus, the fire engine at National Rail Museum {{is the only one}} left in the world running on <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{company has}} {{its origins in}} the year 1892. The company's founder, Heinrich Schmitz, began to {{construct}} wagons at the family's forge located in Altenberge near Münster. The forge's new business first began to gain headway {{at the end of}} the 1920s as a result of increasing motorisation. During this time the company transformed from a craftsman's business into an industrial vehicle manufacturer. The first motor vehicle trailer equipped with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> was delivered in 1928. From 1935 onward semi-trailers and box vehicles with a steel exterior on a wooden frame were manufactured. In 1950 Schmitz Cargobull produced its first insulated and refrigerated body.|$|R
25|$|What bicycle did Moore {{ride in the}} Paris–Rouen race in 1869? There are two {{candidates}} and three or four accounts. Bonneville said that Moore was riding a Suriray bicycle specially built by Tribout, fitted with ball bearings, <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> 48¼-inch and 15¾-inch wheels with metal rims. It was the first high bicycle, said Bonneville, overlooking {{the fact that he}} had elsewhere said the honour belonged to Vibert. The anonymous authors of the series 'Pioneers of the Cycle Industry' in Bicycling News said that Moore rode a heavy wooden Michaux fitted with <b>solid</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>tyres</b> which were secured to the wheel rims by means of sheet-iron braces screwed to the latter, and his machine embodied a type of ball bearing which had been more or less handmade by a Parisian manufacturer...|$|R
