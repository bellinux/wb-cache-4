40|$|The slab {{allocator}} provides efficient object caching but has {{two significant}} limitations: its global locking doesn't scale to many CPUs, and the allocator can't manage resources other than kernel memory. To provide scalability we introduce a per-processor caching scheme called the magazine layer that provides linear scaling to {{any number of}} CPUs. To support more general resource allocation we introduce a new virtual memory allocator, vmem, which acts as a universal backing <b>store</b> <b>for</b> the <b>slab</b> allocator. Vmem is a complete general-purpose resource allocator in its own right, providing several important new services; it {{also appears to be}} the first resource allocator that can satisfy arbitrary-size allocations in constant time. Magazines and vmem have yielded performance gains exceeding 50 % on system-level benchmarks like LADDIS and SPECweb 99. We ported these technologies from kernel to user context and found that the resulting libumem outperforms the current best of breed user level memory allocators. libumem also provides a richer programming model and can be used to manage other user level resources...|$|R

Previous density functional theory studies have predicted that below a critical thickness this results in relaxation to the nonpolar planar h-MgO structure. The calculations presented here demonstrate that h-MgO-structured ZnO thin films are themselves unstable with respect to further relaxation to the d-BCT structure, which restores near-tetrahedral local coordination while minimizing the surface dipole.

The problem of which fireproofing material should be choose and how to make fireproofing measure needs to resolve. Fireproofing test is make <b>for</b> <b>slabs</b> strengthened by carbon fiber sheet bonded with the adhesive protected by Thick-typed Fireproof Coating for steel structure (TFCSS) and Thick-typed Fireproof Coating for tunnel (TFCT). Typical damage state of the two typical coating is compared during and after fire, Temperature field of slab specimen is analyzed, and fireproofing effect is compared. The test results indicate that, steel wire mesh in the middle of coating layer can prevent coating from falling fully, so steel wire mesh is necessary for fireproofing coat which is not too thick. under the protection of fireproof coating with proper construction, TFCT and TFCSS can supply effective fireproofing protection for carbon fiber sheet, but the former is inferior to the latter because the latter is easier to drop and crack in fire. So, TFCT with steel wire mesh can supply the most effective protection <b>for</b> <b>slabs</b> strengthened by carbon fiber sheet bonded with the adhesive...|$|R
