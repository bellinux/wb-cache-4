5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is driven by}} the <b>sympathetic</b> nervous system via preganglionic fibers {{originating}} in the thoracic spinal cord, from vertebrae T5–T11. Because it is innervated by preganglionic nerve fibers, the adrenal medulla can be considered as a specialized <b>sympathetic</b> ganglion. Unlike other <b>sympathetic</b> ganglia, however, the adrenal medulla lacks distinct synapses and releases its secretions directly into the blood.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamine {{release is}} {{stimulated by the}} {{activation}} of the <b>sympathetic</b> nervous system. Splanchnic nerves of the <b>sympathetic</b> nervous system innervate the medulla of the adrenal gland. When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Lymphatic {{drainage}} frequently {{passes the}} prelaryngeal lymph nodes (located {{just above the}} isthmus), and the pretracheal and paratracheal lymph nodes. The gland receives <b>sympathetic</b> nerve supply from the superior, middle and inferior cervical ganglion of the <b>sympathetic</b> trunk. The gland receives parasympathetic nerve supply from the superior laryngeal nerve and the recurrent laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Not {{everyone}} was <b>sympathetic,</b> however.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic <b>sympathetic</b> trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The <b>sympathetic</b> trunk has a <b>sympathetic</b> function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, <b>sympathetic</b> activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the <b>sympathetic</b> trunk.|$|E
5|$|The heart {{receives}} nerve {{signals from}} the vagus nerve and from nerves arising from the <b>sympathetic</b> trunk. These nerves act to influence, but not control, the heart rate. <b>Sympathetic</b> nerves also influence the force of heart contraction. Signals that travel along these nerves arise from two paired cardiovascular centres in the medulla oblongata. The vagus nerve of the parasympathetic nervous system acts to decrease the heart rate, and nerves from the <b>sympathetic</b> trunk act to increase the heart rate. These nerves form a network of nerves that lies over the heart called the cardiac plexus.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve {{has both}} motor and sensory functions. It does not carry {{parasympathetic}} fibers but does carry <b>sympathetic</b> fibers.|$|E
5|$|Tom Wilkinson as Colonel General Friedrich Fromm: The head of Germany's Reserve Army. Wilkinson {{was cast}} {{to make the}} treacherous Fromm <b>sympathetic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alexander Siddig as Prime Minister John Hatcher. Marshall {{originally}} wrote Hatcher as a <b>sympathetic</b> character misguided by Canaris, but {{revised the}} character {{to be more}} like Canaris in embracing political manipulation.|$|E
5|$|Doudna also {{proposes that}} Hyrcanus II {{was seen as}} the Teacher of Righteousness. According to Doudna, Hyrcanus II’s sectarian {{orientation}} is now generally understood to have been Sadducee; whereas Antigonus was more <b>sympathetic</b> towards the Pharisees.|$|E
5|$|Esthesioneuroblastoma, {{also known}} as {{olfactory}} neuroblastoma, is believed to arise from the olfactory epithelium and its classification remains controversial. However, since {{it is not a}} <b>sympathetic</b> nervous system malignancy, esthesioneuroblastoma is a distinct clinical entity and is {{not to be confused with}} neuroblastoma.|$|E
5|$|From the {{day when}} the peoples of those Republics first gained their {{independent}} and democratic form of government the people of the United States have watched their admirable progress in self-government with deep and <b>sympathetic</b> interest.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{dispute with}} Grassi {{permanently}} alienated {{many of the}} Jesuits who had previously been <b>sympathetic</b> to his ideas, and Galileo {{and his friends were}} convinced that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation. The evidence for this is at best equivocal, however.|$|E
5|$|He also {{continued}} his critical {{work and in}} 1860 reviewed On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin. He {{was one of the}} few contemporary critics to be <b>sympathetic</b> to Darwin, although he was reluctant to show he was convinced of the theories.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael (born 9 February 1957) is a Belgian film director, screenwriter and playwright. His {{films are}} {{especially}} {{focus on a}} respectful and <b>sympathetic</b> portrayal of people with mental and physical disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacón, {{a combat}} pilot {{assigned}} {{to support the}} Avatar Program who is <b>sympathetic</b> to the Na'vi. Cameron had {{wanted to work with}} Rodriguez since seeing her in Girlfight.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that foreign}} support would be {{necessary}} for {{the continued existence of}} the United Belgian States, the Statists tried to make contact with foreign powers they believed to be <b>sympathetic.</b> Despite numerous attempts, however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was <b>sympathetic</b> and did send some troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} events, {{possibly}} on the 29 July whilst still in Beaucaire, Napoleon wrote a political pamphlet titled Le souper de Beaucaire (The supper at Beaucaire) {{in which a}} soldier speaks with four merchants and, <b>sympathetic</b> to their opinions, attempts to dissipate their counter-revolutionary sentiments.|$|E
5|$|The 1951 film , {{based on}} Young's biography, portrayed Rommel in a <b>sympathetic</b> way, as a loyal, humane soldier and a firm {{opponent}} to Hitler's policies. The film played up Rommel's disputed {{role in the}} conspiracy against Hitler, while omitting Rommel's early association with the dictator.|$|E
5|$|The August 21 {{cancellation}} of The Rebel Media's registration on 24 hours notice {{was compared to}} that of The Daily Stormer, as both had provided coverage <b>sympathetic</b> to Charlottesville protesters.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually confirmed by a surgical pathologist, {{taking into account}} the clinical presentation, microscopic findings, and other laboratory tests. It may arise from any neural crest element of the <b>sympathetic</b> nervous system (SNS).|$|E
5|$|The {{only person}} clearly <b>sympathetic</b> to Rejtan {{is a young}} man {{in the middle of the}} room, holding in his hands a saber and a rogatywka, symbolizing the {{supporters}} of the anti-Russian Bar Confederation, and future insurgents from the Polish Uprisings in the Russian partition.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the <b>sympathetic</b> trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by <b>sympathetic</b> fibers than parasympathetic fibers. <b>Sympathetic</b> stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E
5|$|Union {{president}} Calderwood and 300 other miners {{were arrested}} and charged with a variety of crimes. Only four miners were convicted of any charges, and were quickly pardoned by the <b>sympathetic</b> populist governor.|$|E
5|$|While Lexie can be <b>sympathetic,</b> {{she is not}} empathetic, {{and tends}} to lash out and react childishly at {{perceived}} slights, or when faced with behavior she does not like or understand.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the {{declaration}} and the British entry into Jerusalem on December 9, the Vatican reversed its earlier <b>sympathetic</b> attitude to Zionism and adopted an oppositional stance that was to continue until the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Artistically, the Grand National {{experiment}} {{was a success}} for Cagney, {{who was able to}} move away from his traditional Warner Bros. tough guy roles to more <b>sympathetic</b> characters. How far he could have experimented and developed will never be known, but back in the Warner fold, he was once again playing tough guys.|$|E
5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more <b>sympathetic</b> to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|E
5|$|Aymer Vallance was {{commissioned}} {{to produce the}} first biography of Morris, published in 1897, after Morris' death, as per the latter's wishes. This presented the creation of SPAB as Morris' greatest achievement. Morris's next biographer was Burne-Jones' son-in-law John William Mackail, who authored the two-volume Life of William Morris (1899) in which he provided a <b>sympathetic</b> portrayal of Morris that largely omitted his political activities, treating them as a passing phase that Morris overcame.|$|E
5|$|Back in EMLL, Konnan {{lost his}} mask to Perro Aguayo in a Lucha de Apuesta mask versus hair match. on June 9, 1991 by disqualification. After the match, a young boy—introduced as Konnan's brother—entered the ring crying and handed Konnan his mask back, {{generating}} considerable bonhomie towards Konnan from the <b>sympathetic</b> crowd.|$|E
5|$|Bolton's first Mayor, Charles James Darbishire was <b>sympathetic</b> to Chartism and a {{supporter}} of the Anti-Corn Law League. In August 1839 Bolton was besieged by Chartist rioters and the Riot Act was read and special constables sworn in. The mayor accompanied soldiers called to rescue special constables at Little Bolton Town Hall, which was besieged by a mob, and the incident ended without bloodshed. Derby Barracks was established in Fletcher Street in the early 1860s.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun {{is often}} held in high regard by the Southern Lost Cause historians, who hold a romanticized {{view of the}} old Southern {{way of life and}} its cause during the Civil War. Historians such as Charles M. Wiltse, Margaret Coit, and Clyde N. Wilson have, in their writings, portrayed Calhoun as a <b>sympathetic</b> or heroic figure.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} {{towards the}} character was polarizing. Some considered {{her to be}} a likable and <b>sympathetic</b> protagonist, whereas others criticized her for being bland, generic and unoriginal as well as being inferior in comparison to Jess from the original Black Christmas. Despite these criticisms, Cassidy herself was generally praised for her performance.|$|E
5|$|Deane Malott, {{who became}} {{president}} of Cornell in 1951, was much less <b>sympathetic,</b> and instructed Morrison to curtail all activities beyond his academic field. Morrison agreed {{to do so in}} 1954. Nonetheless, {{he was one of the}} few ex-communists to remain employed and academically active throughout the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Descendants of the mutineers {{and their}} Tahitian consorts live on Pitcairn into the 21st century. The {{generally}} accepted view of Bligh as an overbearing monster and Christian as a tragic victim of circumstances, {{as depicted in}} well-known film accounts, has been challenged by late 20th- and 21st-century historians from whom a more <b>sympathetic</b> picture of Bligh, and a more critical one of Christian, has emerged.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} vandalism and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. The strikers intimidated the police, {{and only a few}} were willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were <b>sympathetic</b> to the strike, but the local judicial magistrates were not. According to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E
