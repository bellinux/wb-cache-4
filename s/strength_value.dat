30|$|Descriptive {{statistics}} {{including the}} mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum shear bond <b>strength</b> <b>values</b> {{were calculated for}} each of the six experimental groups tested. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine whether significant differences existed between the bond <b>strength</b> <b>values</b> of the various groups, depending on enamel pre-treatment and adhesive type. A post hoc Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test was used to determine whether significant differences existed in the bond <b>strength</b> <b>values</b> between the groups.

50|$|Consider {{strength}} measurements made on {{many small}} samples of a brittle ceramic material. If the measurements show little variation from sample to sample, the calculated Weibull modulus will be high {{and a single}} <b>strength</b> <b>value</b> {{would serve as a}} good description of the sample-to-sample performance. It may be concluded that its physical flaws, whether inherent to the material itself or resulting from the manufacturing process, are distributed uniformly throughout the material. If the measurements show high variation, the calculated Weibull modulus will be low; this reveals that flaws are clustered inconsistently and the measured strength will be generally weak and variable. Products made from components of low Weibull modulus will exhibit low reliability and their strengths will be broadly distributed.|$|E
50|$|Melee weapon {{sometimes}} have a Minimum <b>Strength</b> <b>value.</b> This is an optional rule {{to add more}} realism. A character must possess the listed minimum level of STR to fully inflict the weapon's damage. For every point of STR under the minimum, the weapon does one less die of damage. For example: A Battleaxe has a DC 5 and a Minimum STR of 5. A character with an STR 3, that uses the Battleaxe, suffers a -2 penalty to his Attack roll. It will also only inflict DC 3 of damage because the character's STR is 2 less than the minimum of 5. The character also suffers a -2 penalty to any Reflex checks and Reflex-based Skill checks when wielding the weapon.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of the RSL Test Method is the time in which valid and reproducible results can be obtained. One example is the long used Sustained Load Test of notched round bar tensile specimens found in ASTM F 519. In this test, the exposed test specimens are subjected to a load equal to 75% of the Fracture Strength and held for 200 hours. If the specimen does not break, the specimen has passed. If it fractures prior to the 200 hours then it has failed. The RSL test method can provide the same information {{in less than two}} days and will also give a percentage of Fracture <b>Strength</b> <b>value</b> which provides very valuable additional information.Similarly, an ASTM E1681 KIscc determination can take 12 specimens and up to 14-months because of the necessary run out times to confirm the threshold level. Using the RSL Test Method can provide the same results with 5-coupons in five to seven days.|$|E
50|$|Attrition is when {{forces are}} reduced {{in size to}} {{represent}} the effects of disease and desertion. A single die roll is made on the attrition table and then applied to all the hexes where you have forces (as a house rule, some players roll separately for each force to reduce the role of luck). There is a column for every <b>strength</b> <b>value</b> - the larger the force, the more severe attrition will be, but stacks of 5 Strength Points or less are immune, which rewards players for keeping their armies in corps-sized stacks (see below for how such stacks can reinforce one another in combat). There are DRMs that apply (e.g. attrition is more severe in winter, and in Spain and Russia where it was harder for armies to live off the land; all units in their home country get a -1 DRM whereas unsupplied units get a +1 DRM). If more than one strength point is to be lost then one of them must be cavalry {{if there is one}} in the hex.|$|E

50|$|Combat Cards {{provide the}} base Strength and Health values for a unit, which is {{enhanced}} by supporters, effects on Combat and Reinforcement Cards, and other effects. When both attacker and defender have placed their cards face-down, they are simultaneously revealed, with the attacker choosing which skirmish to be revealed and played out first, (and any Reinforcement Cards without Combat Cards, which may occur if a player places a card from their Combat Card Deck, are discarded and replaced with Combat Cards), and the Strength and Health values of the units are compared. If the <b>Strength</b> <b>value</b> of the primary unit matches or exceeds the Health {{of the value of}} the opposing primary unit, the opposing unit is destroyed. Note that, as in the video game, combat outcomes is subject to the type of the unit involved: for example, certain ground units may be unable to attack air units, in which case the unit may not lend its support if it is unable to attack the opponent's primary unit. Similarly, supporting units may be destroyed in place of the primary unit if the opposing primary unit is unable to target the player's own primary unit.|$|E

Methods: This study involved 120 subjects, aged 20 – 59 years old. The grip strength of subjects were measured using Jamar dynamometer and aneroid sphygmomanometer cuff method. Spearman {{analysis was used to}} evaluate the correlation between variables and grip strength. Forward stepwise was used to analyze the regression of Jamar dynamometer using aneroid sphygmomanometer cuff method. Results: There was a weak correlation (r< 0. 4) between grip strength with age and BMI, moderate correlation (r = 0. 4 – 0. 6) for grip circumference, and also strong correlation r= (0. 6 – 0. 8) for sex, hand length, and hand width.
