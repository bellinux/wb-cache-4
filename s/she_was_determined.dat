25|$|The {{last months}} of {{pregnancy}} of Aspasia {{are surrounded by}} intrigue. In the case that she gave birth a boy (who would be named Philip, {{as the father of}} Alexander the Great), rumours soon assured that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to place him on the throne after his birth. True or not, this possibility worried the Greek royal family, whose fears about the birth of a male child were exploited by the Venizelists to revive the succession crisis. The birth of a girl, on 25 March 1921 was a great relief for the dynasty and both King Constantine I and his mother Queen Dowager Olga agreed to be the godparents of the newborn.|$|E

With the Saxon–Silesian front stabilized, Frederick ordered {{the bulk of his}} East Prussian forces under Marshal Lehwaldt to reinforce Pomerania, predicting that no new Russian advance would come until the spring. The enlarged Prussian army quickly drove the Swedes back, occupied most of Swedish Pomerania, and blockaded its capital at Stralsund through the winter. Over the winter, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, now commander of Hanover's army, launched a series of offensives that drove the French out of northern Germany and across the Rhine, securing Prussia's western flank {{for the duration of the}} war.|$|E

Murray's speech, [...] "Jim Crow and Jane Crow", delivered in Washington, D.C. in 1964, sheds light on the long struggle of African-American women for racial equality and their later fight for equality among the sexes. Pauli Murray ultimately helped advance the American Civil Rights Movement by letting her audience know that women's rights were just as important as civil rights.|$|E

[...] Although she was intellectually stimulated by this group of gifted writers, she was distressed by their lack of faith and later described Richard Edgeworth as an [...] "infidel." [...] She also criticized Seward's persona of the female author, writing in her autobiography that she would never model herself after a woman who wore a wig and accumulated male flatterers. Despite what she viewed as the pitfalls of fame, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to become a writer and when she was seventeen her father, who encouraged her writing, helped her publish her first story, Traditions (1795).|$|E
500|$|After {{going home}} to Rhode Island, Dyer {{spent most of the}} {{following}} winter on Shelter Island, sitting between the north and south forks of Long Island. [...] Though sheltered from storms, the island's owner, Nathaniel Sylvester, used it as a refuge for Quakers seeking shelter from the Puritans, thus providing its name. [...] Here Dyer was able to commune with her fellow Quakers, including her Newport neighbors, William Coddington and his wife Anne Brinley, who had recently converted. [...] Dyer used her time here to mull over the vindication prepared by the Puritan authorities to send to England, concerning their actions against the Quakers. [...] This document was an affront to Dyer, and she viewed it as merely a means to soften public outrage. [...] <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to return to Boston to force the authorities to either change their laws or to hang a woman, and she left Shelter Island in April 1660 focused on this mission.|$|E

Bedingfield began collaborating with Steve Kipner, Andrew Frampton and Wayne Wilkins in London and Los Angeles, but their sessions were largely unproductive due to Bedingfield's writer's block and the pressure that she felt to produce a hit song. Frustrated, she began to sing [...] "I love you, I love you, I love you" [...] over and over. She was at [...] "wit's end and {{just wanted to say}} what I meant in a simple way, without using all those flowery words." [...] The line that Bedingfield sang out of frustration became the song's hook and its subject matter inspired by her real life difficulty writing a love song.|$|E
500|$|The {{second wave}} of {{feminism}} created greater cultural sympathy for her as a female poet. In the first collection of critical essays on Dickinson from a feminist perspective, she is heralded as the greatest woman poet in the English language. Biographers and theorists of the past tended to separate Dickinson's roles as {{a woman and a}} poet. For example, George Whicher wrote in his 1952 book This Was a Poet: A Critical Biography of Emily Dickinson, [...] "Perhaps as a poet [...] could find the fulfillment she had missed as a woman." [...] Feminist criticism, on the other hand, declares that there is a necessary and powerful conjunction between Dickinson being a woman and a poet. Adrienne Rich theorized in Vesuvius at Home: The Power of Emily Dickinson (1976) that Dickinson's identity as a woman poet brought her power: [...] " [...] chose her seclusion, knowing she was exceptional and knowing what she needed. ... She carefully selected her society and controlled the disposal of her time ... neither eccentric nor quaint; <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>determined</b> to survive, to use her powers, to practice necessary economics." ...|$|E

By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy). She attended Whitney Young High School, Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita. The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours. She recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it [...] "to fuel me, to keep me going." [...] She recalled experiencing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought. She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, {{was a member of the}} National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.
