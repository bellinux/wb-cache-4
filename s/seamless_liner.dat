40|$|ABSTRACT: The design, fabrication, {{and testing}} of an epoxy-glass {{reinforced}} polymer composite pressure vessel suitable for high-pressure gas storage have been reported. In this study compo-site pressure vessels {{are made up of}} aluminum alloy 6063 <b>seamless</b> <b>liner</b> and glass/epoxy composite reinforcement. The aluminum liner, which is developed by extruded aluminum tube of internal diameter 141 mm and wall thickness 4 mm, is subjected to super plastic deformation. Continuous glass fibers impregnated in epoxy resin are wound on the <b>seamless</b> <b>liner</b> by filament winding process. In this work, 10 pressure vessels were manufactured for 3. 5 MPa service pressure with marginal safety of 3. Four pressure vessels were subjected to cyclic and burst test; the burst pressures were 10. 9, 11. 0, 11. 0, and 13. 0 MPa.

40|$|As a {{pressure}} vessel, a small <b>seamless</b> aluminum <b>liner</b> with inner volume of about 6. 75 L {{is made from}} an initial billet material of AA 6061 -O. To produce the aluminum liner, warm forging including backward extrusion and head nosing was numerically simulated using a billet initially pre-heated to about 480 ℃. Compression tests on the billet material were performed at various temperatures and strain rates, and the measured mechanical properties {{were used in the}} numerical simulations. For the backward extrusion and the head nosing, the tool geometries were designed based on the desired configuration of the aluminum liner. Furthermore, the structural integrity of the tooling was evaluated to ensure adequate tool life. The <b>seamless</b> aluminum <b>liner</b> has an endurance limit of about 1. 47 MPa (15 Kgf/cm 2), estimated based on the required inner pressure. The results confirm that the small <b>seamless</b> aluminum <b>liner</b> of AA 6061 -O can be successfull...|$|R

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{tactility}} and dexterity of four different glove types, including the Australian in-service NBC butyl rubber glove and Nomex ® flying glove for standardised (Purdue pegboard) and operational (weapon asembly/disassembly) tasks. The Nomex ® flying glove was included for comparative purposes despite offering no NBC protection. Two commercially available chemically protective gloves (the Canadian NBC butyl rubber glove, Ansell TNT ® nitrile glove) were also assessed. Twenty-four healthy male subjects {{participated in the}} study. Subjects completed two questionnaires, one on the priority of glove functions and the second on glove specific fit and fuctionality. Subjects completed either the weapon assembly/disassembly task or the Purdue pegboard task. The results from both these tasks were consistent for all gloves and {{in agreement with the}} reponses recorded on the questionnaires. The Ansell TNT glove tended to provide the best dexterity scores followed by the Nomex flying, Canadian butyl and Australian butyl gloves. The Ansell TNT glove tended to be the most tactile glove followed by the Candian Butyl, Nomex flying and Australian butyl. Subjects felt their performance in the Australian Butly rubber glove could be enhanced through training and by adopting <b>seamless</b> <b>liners</b> similar to those used in the Canadian system. Overall subjects preferred single layered, seamless gloves that had a low impact on task-dependant dexterity and tactility. Typically subjects felt that if the Nomex flying glove offered NBC protection and had the seam removed on the index finger it would make an ideal NBC glove. The outcomes of this study provide a scientific basis from which a requirements document for a new NBC glove could be generated. It is intended that the most favourable features of a glove identified during this study will be used in future ADF NBC glove designs...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{possibility to}} reduce corrosion resistant pipeline costs {{is the concept}} of Tight Fit Pipe, which is a double wall pipe where a Corrosion Resistant Alloy liner is mechanically fitted inside a carbon steel outer pipe. The mechanical bonding of the Tight Fit Pipe is made through a thermohydraulic manufacturing process. Problem definition Buckling of cylinders subjected to flexural loads (applied to Tight Fit Pipe during cost effective reeling) correlates in a number of respects to buckling of axially compressed cylinders: in both cases the critical stresses (or strains) are of the same order of magnitude and the failure modes have the same characteristics. Results from the axial compression tests provided better understanding of the buckling behaviour of Tight Fit Pipe during bending and results from this thesis study have been used as input for a bending rig construction. Research The main objective of this thesis is to investigate, theoretically and experimentally, the local buckling behaviour due to axial compression of the Corrosion Resistant Alloy liner, whilst fitted in the outer pipe of the Tight Fit Pipe configuration. The liner of the Tight Fit Pipe as tested is first analysed when not fitted in the outer pipe. Secondly the liner is analysed when fitted in the outer pipe of the Tight Fit Pipe. The liner has a higher capacity in stress and strain when the liner is placed in the outer pipe, i. e. mechanically fitted, compared with the liner alone. Results, Conclusions and Recommendations [a. ] Buckling of the liners (of Tight Fit pipes (TFP) used in the experiments), without the outer pipe, occurred outward in a single axi symmetrical wrinkle. [b. ] The liners in the tight fit pipes, confined in an outer 12 ¾ inch pipes used in the experiments, buckle inward in a non-symmetrical wrinkle. [c. ] Wrinkles (of liners confined in an outer 12 ¾ inch pipe) do not exceed 90 º of the circumference. The wrinkles have an axis which is circumferential. Wrinkles do not tend to connect with each other if more than one is present at about the same height. [d. ] The maximum force in the load - strain diagram was considered to be the point at which wrinkling occurred. There was a good agreement between the Finite Element (FEM) results and test results for the maximum force. The FEM results for the strain at the maximum force were much higher than in the tests. [e. ] Buckling of a liner in a 12 ¾ inch pipe has a larger critical buckling force than a liner which is not confined in an outer pipe. This is due to the resistance to outward buckling. Bigger wrinkles must fit in a smaller radius which costs more energy than free outward buckling. This could also be the reason why the wrinkles do not tend to form as one big wrinkle in a 360 degrees radius. Outward buckling tend to occur in one axi symmetrical wrinkle. [f. ] The buckling behaviour of the liner in the TFP is believed to be influenced by three different TFP properties: [f 1. ] Low or high fit (residual hoop stress), [f 2. ] Type of CRA (Material strength) and [f 3. ] Type of outer pipe used, <b>seamless</b> or UOE-pipe (<b>Liner</b> to outer pipe contact irregularities) [f 1] has been proven in the test results; [f 2] and [f 3] are still to be proven in future work.
