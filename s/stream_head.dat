40|$|Dynamic {{expansions}} and contractions {{of stream}} networks {{can play an}} important role for hydrologic processes as they can connect different parts of the landscape to the stream channels. However, we know little about the temporal and spatial variations of stream networks during different flow and wetness conditions. This study focuses on the contraction and expansion of stream networks during different flow conditions in the boreal Krycklan catchment, located in Northern Sweden. The stream network and initiation points were extracted from a gridded digital elevation model (DEM) of 5 -meter resolution, and then compared with the stream network initiation points (heads) observed during the spring flood (freshet) period in 2012. From the results of the study, it was clearly seen that the observed <b>stream</b> <b>heads</b> and the <b>stream</b> <b>heads</b> appearing in the stream network map extracted from DEM did not agree very well. 49 % of the total observed <b>stream</b> <b>heads</b> (49) fell onto the low order stream branches and headwater streams derived from the DEM. Only few of them exactly matched the modeled <b>stream</b> <b>heads.</b> Moreover, the modeled stream network was much denser than the observed stream network, and so the simple raster based dynamic model developed could not well represent the dynamic stream network extension in the real system. Most headwater streams in the study catchment were man-made ditches, which were dug to drain water wetlands and to increase forest productivity. The majority of observed <b>stream</b> <b>heads</b> were formed by seepage from the saturated surrounding soils, while only a few of them were formed by saturation overland flow.  On the other hand, the dynamic stream network derived from the DEM suggested that the number of streams of lower order and their lengths was sensitive to change in streamflow, especially during the high flow episode...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} {{mechanism}} {{for the maintenance of}} streams based on the Scheme facility of call-with-current-continuation or call/cc. The mechanism supports stream sharing and has overhead cost which is independent of top-level program parameters if call/cc is implemented in heap-based systems. It is shown how the control structure of call/cc can save programming effort in cases where multiple procedures output to the same stream in irregular order. 1 Introduction In Scheme, a stream is typically implemented as a two-element cell: one element contains the value of the <b>stream</b> <b>head</b> and the other element contains a procedure which computes the remaining stream tokens. Stream tokens can be grabbed one at a time because, in Scheme, the body of a procedure is not evaluated until the procedure is invoked...|$|E

40|$|In {{soil erosion}} by {{overland}} flow, sediment discharge {{is driven by}} discharge and gradient against {{the resistance of the}} soil and vegetation. The form of the relationship, which is taken as a sum of power law terms, may then be inferred from several data sources: (1) ephemeral gully head location, (2) permanent channel head location, (3) slope profile form, (4) consistency with evolutionary models and (5) erosion plot data. The paper focuses on (1) to (4), in order to understand how far these data constrain the form of the dependence on discharge and gradient. Field data from mapping a set of ephemeral gully heads after storms show a weak inverse relationship between channel head gradient and catchment area, which flattens towards an upper threshold gradient of about 25 %. These relationships are compared with those theoretically obtained for a range of sediment transport laws which have been previously used, and which are analysed to forecast both overall slope profile form and the location of stream heads. The theory predicts that the location of ephemeral gully heads produced in a single storm will differ from the long-term average <b>stream</b> <b>head</b> location. There is a fairly good relationship between theoretical and observed locations, associated with the form of the sediment transport law. For a single event, the location depends on storm magnitude which cannot be well defined from the data sets, creating a spread of data with an envelope curve defined for the largest events. The empirically acceptable sediment transport equations have also been used to analyse families of slope profiles in a small area, and used within a landscape evolution model to generate landscapes which are compatible with those observed in the field, and provide confirmation of the long-term viability of the expressions obtained to forecast the direction, style and rates of landscape evolution in response to land use or climate drivers.

40|$|International audienceOn earth, {{landscape}} morphology {{is mainly}} controlled by rivers evolutions and {{their interactions with}} hillslopes. But hydrographic network may be re-organized by stream capture and modify deeply the relief. This transition may be induced by several mechanisms (diversion, headward erosion, avulsion, or subterranean filling up). It has interested numerous scientists since a long time (Davis 1895, Blache 1943, Lesson-Quinif 2001 & Le Roux-Harmand 1997 - 2009 [...] .). Here we focus on stream piracies by headward erosion, when an actively eroding low level stream (called the captor) encroaches on the drainage of a nearby stream flowing {{at a higher level}} (called the diverter) and diverts part of the water of the higher stream. During the last decades, several landscapes evolution models (LEM) have been developed to quantify the topography evolution with diffusion and advection equations. These models {{play an important role in}} sharpening our thinking to better understand the interaction between landscape evolution processes. LEM were developed basically to simulate erosion, tectonic and climate at different scales of time and space. But, these models were not designed to describe specific mechanisms as the stream capture. It's one of the aims of this work to evaluate LEM for this purpose. In this paper, we develop a 1 D model based on LEM equations to investigate the stream piracy by headward erosion responses to climatic or tectonic changes. This model incorporates the most common equations used in quantitative geomorphology; diffusion in hillslope, advection in river (detachment-limited mode) and an inequality based on slope and drainage area for the limit between these two domains (Montgomery and Dietrich, 1988). First, simulations on analytical cases highlight the <b>stream</b> <b>head</b> progression mechanism, and the results indicate that this progression rate is mainly controlled by the slope at the captor source. Consequently, the aggradation of the diverter or (and) the incision of the captor accelerate the process. Then, a predictive study with an improved version of GOLEM (software developed by Tucker & Slingerland in 1994) on the Meuse basin shows that several piracies may probably occur in the future. A comparison with the 1 D model gives similar results. The simplicity and the flexibility of the 1 D model allow complex simulations in the Meuse basin taking into account: lithological differences of outcropping layers, Meuse deposition tendency, etc. Once the 2 D simulations or topography analysis locate potential captures, 1 D simulation may intensively be used, as it presents many advantages; weak execution time, simple limits conditions setting, less time for data preparation, etc. Consequently, a sensitivity analysis to estimate piracies ages is realized with the developed 1 D model...|$|E

This article compares five existing and two new methods for extracting stream channel networks for use in topographic mapping. In order of increasing accuracy, these methods are: (1) blue lines on USGS 1 : 24, 000 topographic maps (64. 6 percent underrepresentation), (2) placing <b>stream</b> <b>heads</b> using a constant flow-accumulation area to mimic USGS blue lines (47. 8 percent under-representation), (3) constant flow-accumulation area equal to the mean for identified channel heads (30. 3 per-cent combined under- and overrepresentation), (4) variable flow-accumulation area estimated by multiple linear regression (28. 9 percent combined under- and overrepresentation), (5) variable flow-accumulation area esti-mated by a slope-power relationship (23. 6 percent combined under- and overrepresentation), (6) identifying stream cells using logistic regression (12. 7 percent combined under- and overrepresentation), and (7) extracting <b>stream</b> channel <b>head</b> locations from digital orthophotoquads (DOQs) (nearly 100 percent accurate, but only applicable under ideal conditions).
