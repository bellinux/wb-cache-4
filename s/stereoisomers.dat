5|$|Quinine wouldn't be {{successfully}} synthesized until 1918. Synthesis remains elaborate, expensive and low yield, {{with the additional}} problem of separation of the <b>stereoisomers.</b> Though quinine {{is not one of}} the major drugs used in treatment, modern production still relies on extraction from the cinchona tree.|$|E
5|$|One {{published}} {{study that}} analysed samples of mephedrone bought {{using the internet}} in the UK in 2010 found it was racemic (a mixture of both <b>stereoisomers)</b> and of high purity. An unpublished study of six samples also ordered off the internet in the UK in 2010 found they contained very few organic impurities. Four products sold in Irish head shops were tested in 2010 and were found to contain between 82% and 14% mephedrone, with some products containing benzocaine and caffeine.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol has 256 <b>stereoisomers</b> {{that arise}} from its 8 stereocenters, {{although}} {{only two of the}} <b>stereoisomers</b> are of biochemical significance (nat-cholesterol and ent-cholesterol, for natural and enantiomer, respectively), and only one occurs naturally (nat-cholesterol).|$|E
25|$|Both fac and mer <b>stereoisomers</b> of such {{compounds}} {{have been}} isolated.|$|E
25|$|Nadolol is {{a mixture}} of <b>stereoisomers.</b> It is polar and hydrophilic, with low lipid solubility.|$|E
25|$|CO2R-tropinone has 4 <b>stereoisomers,</b> {{although}} the corresponding ecgonidine alkyl ester {{has only a}} pair of enantiomers.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{investigated}} {{for use in the}} treatment of cancer. Captopril <b>stereoisomers</b> were also reported to inhibit some metallo-β-lactamases.|$|E
25|$|A newer drug {{palonosetron}} is a pharmacologically {{distinct and}} highly selective, second generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Palonosetron has two stereogenic centers and exists as four <b>stereoisomers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern organic syntheses now {{require the}} {{synthesis}} of compounds in enantiopure form. Since the aldol addition reaction creates two new stereocenters, up to four <b>stereoisomers</b> may result.|$|E
25|$|The S(+) and R(–) <b>stereoisomers</b> of {{ketamine}} bind to the dizocilpine {{site of the}} NMDA receptor {{with different}} affinities, the former showing approximately 2- to 3-fold greater affinity for the receptor than the latter.|$|E
25|$|Nordoxepin is {{a mixture}} of (E) and (Z) <b>stereoisomers</b> {{similarly}} to doxepin. Whereas pharmaceutical doxepin is supplied in an approximate 85:15 ratio mixture of (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers and plasma concentrations of doxepin remain roughly the same as this ratio with treatment, plasma levels of the (E)- and (Z)-stereoisomers of nordoxepin, due to stereoselective metabolism of doxepin by cytochrome P450 enzymes, are approximately 1:1.|$|E
25|$|Lactic acid is {{produced}} industrially by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates (sugar, starch) or by chemical synthesis from acetaldehyde, {{that is available}} from coal or crude oil. In 2009 lactic acid was produced predominantly (70-90%) by fermentation. Production of racemic lactic acid consisting of a 1:1 mixture of D and L <b>stereoisomers,</b> or of mixtures with up to 99.9% L-lactic acid, is possible by microbial fermentation. Industrial scale production of D-lactic acid by fermentation is possible, but much more challenging.|$|E
25|$|Chiral {{chromatography}} {{involves the}} separation of <b>stereoisomers.</b> In the case of enantiomers, these have no chemical or physical differences apart from being three-dimensional mirror images. Conventional chromatography or other separation processes are incapable of separating them. To enable chiral separations to take place, either the mobile phase or the stationary phase must themselves be made chiral, giving differing affinities between the analytes. Chiral chromatography HPLC columns (with a chiral stationary phase) in both normal and reversed phase are commercially available.|$|E
25|$|Paroxetine is a {{constrained}} structural analogue of fluoxetine {{where the}} linear phenylpropylamine group of fluoxetine has been folded into a piperidine ring (figure 5). The compound has {{the possibility of}} four <b>stereoisomers</b> because it contains two chiral centers, but one of them, the (3S,4R)-isomer, is marketed as paroxetine. Research has shown that stereochemical factors affect affinity of the molecule for SERT where substitution into the 2-ortho-position of either aromatic rings decreases affinity for rat SERT {{by as much as}} 10–100 times, where the greatest loss occurs in the phenoxy ring.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin is {{a mixture}} of (E) and (Z) <b>stereoisomers</b> with an {{approximate}} ratio of 85:15. When doxepin was developed, no effort was made to separate or balance the mixture following its synthesis, resulting in the asymmetric ratio. (Z)-Doxepin is more active as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake than (E)-doxepin. The selectivity of doxepin for inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake over that of serotonin is likely due to the 85% presence of (E)-doxepin in the mixture. Most other tertiary amine TCAs like amitriptyline and imipramine do not exhibit E-Z isomerism or such mixture asymmetry and are comparatively more balanced inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake.|$|E
25|$|During the {{conversion}} from straight-chain {{form to the}} cyclic form, the carbon atom containing the carbonyl oxygen, called the anomeric carbon, becomes a stereogenic center with two possible configurations: The oxygen atom may take a position either above or below {{the plane of the}} ring. The resulting possible pair of <b>stereoisomers</b> is called anomers. In the α anomer, the -OH substituent on the anomeric carbon rests on the opposite side (trans) of the ring from the CH2OH side branch. The alternative form, in which the CH2OH substituent and the anomeric hydroxyl are on the same side (cis) of the plane of the ring, is called the β anomer.|$|E
25|$|THC, {{along with}} its double bond isomers and their <b>stereoisomers,</b> {{is one of only}} three cannabinoids {{scheduled}} by the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances (the other two are dimethylheptylpyran and parahexyl). It was listed under Schedule I in 1971, but reclassified to Schedule II in 1991 following a recommendation from the WHO. Based on subsequent studies, the WHO has recommended the reclassification to the less-stringent Schedule III. Cannabis as a plant is scheduled by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (Schedule I and IV). It is specifically still listed under Schedule I by US federal law under the Controlled Substances Act passed by the US Congress in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Doxepin is a {{tricyclic}} compound, specifically a dibenzoxepin, and possesses three rings fused {{together with}} a side chain attached in its chemical structure. It is the only TCA with a dibenzoxepin ring system to have been marketed. Doxepin is a tertiary amine TCA, with its side chain-demethylated metabolite nordoxepin being a secondary amine. Other tertiary amine TCAs include amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, dosulepin (dothiepin), and trimipramine. Doxepin {{is a mixture of}} (E) and (Z) <b>stereoisomers</b> (the latter being known as cidoxepin or cis-doxepin) and is used commercially in a ratio of approximately 85:15. The chemical name of doxepin is (E/Z)-3-(dibenzooxepin-11(6H)-ylidene)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21NO with a molecular weight of 279.376g/mol. The drug is used commercially almost exclusively as the hydrochloride salt; the free base has been used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 1668-19-5 and of the hydrochloride is 1229-29-4.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone, as {{traditionally}} sold worldwide, is a {{racemic mixture}} of two <b>stereoisomers,</b> {{only one of}} which is active. In 2005, the pharmaceutical company Sepracor of Marlborough, Massachusetts began marketing the active stereoisomer eszopiclone under the name Lunesta in the United States. This had the consequence of placing what is a generic drug in most of the world under patent control in the United States. Although it was expected to be available in generic form by 2010, no generic has become available there at present. However, zopiclone is currently available off-patent in a number of European countries, as well as Brazil, Canada, and Hong Kong. The eszopiclone/zopiclone difference is in the dosagethe strongest eszopiclone derivative dosage contains 3mg of the therapeutic stereoisomer, whereas the highest zopiclone dosage (7.5mg) contains 3.75mg of the active stereoisomer. The two agents have not yet been studied in head-to-head clinical trials to determine the existence of any potential clinical differences (efficacy, side effects, developing dependence on the drug, safety, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Since synephrine {{exists as}} either of two enantiomers (see Chemistry section below for further discussion), {{which do not}} produce {{identical}} biological effects (see Pharmacology section below) some researchers have examined the stereoisomeric composition of synephrine extracted from natural sources. Although {{it seems clear that}} synephrine is found in those Citrus species which have been studied predominantly as the l-isomer, low levels of d-synephrine have been detected in juice and marmalade made from C. unshiu, and low levels (0.002%) have been reported in fresh fruit from C. aurantium. There are indications that some d-synephrine may be formed by the racemization of l-synephrine {{as a result of the}} processing of fresh fruit, although this matter has not been completely clarified. However, regardless of the situation in Citrus species, Ranieri and McLaughlin reported the isolation of racemic (i.e. a mixture of equal amounts of d- and l- <b>stereoisomers)</b> synephrine from a cactus of the Dolichothele genus, under conditions that would be unlikely to cause a significant amount of racemization.|$|E
500|$|Mild tasting, Suillellus luridus is edible after {{thorough}} {{cooking and}} is highly regarded in France. It is also commonly consumed in Italy and China. The mushroom {{is sold in}} regional markets in central Mexico; despite this, it is considered inedible by inhabitants of La Malinche National Park. Caution is advised if choosing this species for consumption, as it resembles other less edible blue-staining boletes. Some guidebooks recommend avoiding it altogether. If eaten raw or insufficiently cooked, symptoms of gastrointestinal poisoning can occur within 30 minutes to two hours, including [...] nausea, vomiting, abdominal [...] cramps, [...] and diarrhoea. A full recovery can be expected within 24 to 48 hours if fluid losses are restored. Chemical analysis has revealed traces of the toxin muscarine and its <b>stereoisomers.</b>|$|E
500|$|When {{bound in}} the active site of an oxidoreductase, the {{nicotinamide}} ring of the coenzyme is positioned {{so that it can}} accept a hydride from the other substrate. Depending on the enzyme, the hydride donor is positioned either [...] "above" [...] or [...] "below" [...] the plane of the planar C4 carbon, as defined in the figure. Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above; class B enzymes transfer it from below. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is prochiral, this can be exploited in enzyme kinetics to give information about the enzyme's mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has deuterium atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen. In this case, an enzyme can produce one of two <b>stereoisomers</b> of NADH.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Stereoisomers</b> include Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and [...] isomers include Δ6a(10a)-THC, Δ6a-THC, Δ7-THC, Δ8-THC, Δ10-THC and Δ9(11)-THC.|$|E

2500|$|Addition {{of another}} {{phenolic}} –OH {{group to the}} 3-position of the benzene ring produces the neurotransmitter epinephrine; addition of a methyl group to the α-position in the side-chain of synephrine gives oxilofrine (or [...] "methylsynephrine") (although {{it should be noted}} that four <b>stereoisomers</b> and two racemic modifications are possible for this substance).|$|E
2500|$|Endosulfan is a {{derivative}} of hexachlorocyclopentadiene, and is chemically similar to aldrin, chlordane, and heptachlor. Specifically, it {{is produced by}} the [...] Diels-Alder reaction of hexachlorocyclopentadiene with cis-butene-1,4-diol and subsequent reaction of the adduct with thionyl chloride. Technical endosulfan is a 7:3 mixture of <b>stereoisomers,</b> designated α and β. [...] α- and β-Endosulfan are configurational isomers arising from the pyramidal stereochemistry of the teravalent sulfur. α-Endosulfan is the more thermodynamically stable of the two, thus β-endosulfan irreversibly converts to the α form, although the conversion is slow.|$|E
2500|$|Each carbon atom {{bearing a}} {{hydroxyl}} group (-OH), {{with the exception}} of the first and last carbons, are asymmetric, making them stereo centers with two possible configurations each (R or S). Because of this asymmetry, a number of isomers may exist for any given monosaccharide formula. Using Le Bel-van't Hoff rule, the aldohexose D-glucose, for example, has the formula (C·H2O)6, of which four of its six carbons atoms are stereogenic, making D-glucose one of 24=16 possible <b>stereoisomers.</b> In the case of glyceraldehydes, an aldotriose, there is one pair of possible <b>stereoisomers,</b> which are enantiomers and epimers. 1, 3-dihydroxyacetone, the ketose corresponding to the aldose glyceraldehydes, is a symmetric molecule with no stereo centers. The assignment of D or L is made according to the orientation of the asymmetric carbon furthest from the carbonyl group: in a standard Fischer projection if the hydroxyl group is on the right the molecule is a D sugar, otherwise it is an L sugar. The [...] "D-" [...] and [...] "L-" [...] prefixes should not be confused with [...] "d-" [...] or [...] "l-", which indicate the direction that the sugar [...] rotates plane polarized light. This usage of [...] "d-" [...] and [...] "l-" [...] is no longer followed in carbohydrate chemistry.|$|E
2500|$|Oseltamivir total {{synthesis}} {{concerns the}} total {{synthesis of the}} antiinfluenza drug oseltamivir [...] marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche under the trade name Tamiflu. Its commercial production starts from the biomolecule shikimic acid harvested from Chinese star anise [...] with a limited worldwide supply. Due to its limited supply, searches for alternative synthetic routes preferably not requiring shikimic acid are underway and to date several such routes have been published. Control of stereochemistry is important: the molecule has three stereocenters and the sought-after isomer is only 1 of 8 <b>stereoisomers.</b>|$|E
2500|$|NEIL1 recognizes (targets) {{and removes}} certain oxidatively-damaged bases and then incises the abasic site via β,δ elimination, leaving 3′ and 5′ {{phosphate}} ends. NEIL1 recognizes oxidized pyrimidines, formamidopyrimidines, thymine residues oxidized at the methyl group, and both <b>stereoisomers</b> of thymine glycol. [...] The best substrates for human NEIL1 {{appear to be}} the hydantoin lesions, guanidinohydantoin, and spiroiminodihydantoin that are further oxidation products of 8-oxoG. [...] NEIL1 is also capable of removing lesions from single-stranded DNA as well as from bubble and forked DNA structures. A deficiency in NEIL1 causes increased mutagenesis at the site of an 8-oxo-Gua:C pair, with most mutations being G:C to T:A transversions.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between studies concerning synephrine as a single chemical entity (and even here it should be borne in mind that synephrine can exist {{in the form of}} either of two <b>stereoisomers,</b> d- and l-synephrine, which are chemically and pharmacologically distinct), and synephrine which is mixed with other drugs and/or botanical extracts in a [...] "Supplement", as well as synephrine which is present as only one chemical component in a naturally-occurring mixture of phytochemicals such as the rind or fruit of a bitter orange. Mixtures containing synephrine as only one of their chemical components (regardless of whether these are of synthetic or natural origin) should not be assumed to produce exactly the same biological effects as synephrine alone.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfenamides {{have been}} {{characterized}} by X-ray crystallography. [...] The S-N bond in sulfenamides is a chiral axis that leads to formation of diastereomeric compounds. [...] The existence of these distinct <b>stereoisomers</b> {{is due to the}} formation of a partial double bond between either sulfur or nitrogen’s lone pair and the other atom’s antibonding orbitals. [...] Additionally bulky substituent groups and lone pair repulsion can contribute resistance to interconversion. [...] The resulting torsional barriers can be quite large and vary from 12-20 kcal/mol. The interactions are thought to be dependent on the torsional preferences (also known as the gauche effect). The nitrogen atom is usually pyramidal, but cyclic and strongly steric hindered acyclic sulfenamides can display a planar arrangement of bonds around the nitrogen atom.|$|E
2500|$|The pi {{electron}} energy of cyclobutadiene {{is higher than}} that of its open-chain counterpart, 1,3-butadiene, and it is therefore said to be anti-aromatic rather than aromatic. [...] The electronic states of cyclobutadiene have been explored with a variety of computational methods. The singlet ground state has a rectangular structure. The first excited state is a triplet with a square geometry. The rectangular structure is consistent with the existence of two different 1,2-dideutero-1,3-cyclobutadiene <b>stereoisomers.</b> [...] This indicates that the pi electrons are localized and therefore not considered to be aromatic. Cyclobutadiene is far from stable, it is highly reactive and has a very short lifetime. Cyclobutadiene dimerizes at temperatures above 35 K by a Diels-Alder reaction. The monomeric form has been studied at higher temperatures by trapping with matrix isolation in a noble gas.|$|E
2500|$|... 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid or 9-HODE) {{has been}} used in the {{literature}} to designate either or both of two stereoisomer metabolites of the essential fatty acid, linoleic acid: 9(S)-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9(S)-HODE) and 9(R)-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9(R)-HODE); these two metabolites differ in having their hydroxy residues in the S or R configurations, respectively. [...] The accompanying figure gives the structure for 9(S)-HETE. [...] Two other 9-hydroxy linoleic acid derivatives occur in nature, the 10E,12E isomers of 9(S)-HODE and 9(R)-HODE viz., 9(S)-hydroxy-10E,12E-octadecadienoic acid (9(S)-EE-HODE) and 9(R)-hydroxy-10E,12E-octadecadienoic acid (13(R)-EE-HODE); these two derivatives have their double bond at carbon 12 in the E or trans configuration as opposed to the Z or cis configuration. [...] The four 9-HODE isomers, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress, may form together in cells and tissues; they have overlapping but not identical biological activities and significances. [...] Because many studies have not distinguished between the S and R <b>stereoisomers</b> and, particularly in identifying tissue levels, the two EE isomers, 9-HODE is used here when the isomer studied is unclear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{sertraline}} {{dates back to}} the early 1970s, when Pfizer chemist Reinhard Sarges invented a novel series of psychoactive compounds based on the structure of the neuroleptic chlorprothixene. Further work on these compounds led to lometraline and then to tametraline, a norepinephrine and weaker dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Development of tametraline was soon stopped because of undesired stimulant effects observed in animals. A few years later, in 1977, pharmacologist Kenneth Koe, after comparing the structural features of a variety of reuptake inhibitors, became interested in the tametraline series. He asked another Pfizer chemist, Willard Welch, to synthesize some previously unexplored tametraline derivatives. Welch generated a number of potent norepinephrine and triple reuptake inhibitors, but to the surprise of the scientists, one representative of the generally inactive cis-analogs was a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Welch then prepared <b>stereoisomers</b> of this compound, which were tested in vivo by animal behavioral scientist Albert Weissman. The most potent and selective (+)-isomer was taken into further development and eventually named sertraline. Weissman and Koe recalled that the group did not set up to produce an antidepressant of the SSRI type—in that sense their inquiry was not [...] "very goal driven", and the discovery of the sertraline molecule was serendipitous. According to Welch, they worked outside the mainstream at Pfizer, and even [...] "did not have a formal project team". The group had to overcome initial bureaucratic reluctance to pursue sertraline development, as Pfizer was considering licensing an antidepressant candidate from another company.|$|E
2500|$|Oxidative {{stress in}} cells and tissues {{produces}} Free radical-induced and singlet oxygen-induced oxidations of linoleic acid {{to generate the}} various racemic mixtures of 9-HpODE and 9-HODE in non-enzymatic reactions that produce, or are suspected but not proven to produce, approximately equal amounts of their S and R <b>stereoisomers.</b> [...] These oxidations are credited with being the major contributors to 9-HODE and 13-HODE isomer production in tissues undergoing oxidative stress such as occurs in any tissue suffering inadequate blood flow, inflammation, or other serious insult, in liver steatohepatitis, in the atheroma plaques of cardiovascular disease, in nerve tissues of neurodegenerative diseases, and in the various tissues compromised by diabetes (see oxidative stress). [...] Free radical oxidation of linoleic acid produces racemic mixtures of 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE; singlet oxygen attack on linoleic acid produces (presumably) racemic mixtures of 9-HODE, 10-hydroxy-8E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid, and 12-hydroxy-9Z-13-E-octadecadienoic acid. [...] Since free radical-induced and singlet oxygen-induced oxidations of linoleic acid produce a similar set of 13-HODE metabolites (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid), since both free radicals and singlet oxygen attack not only free linoleic acid but also linoleic acid bound to phospholipids, glycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids, and since free radical and singlet oxygen reactions may occur together, oxygen-stressed tissues often contain an array of free and lipid-bound 9-HODE and 13-HODE products. [...] For example, laboratory studies find that 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE (along with their 13-HODE counterparts) {{are found in the}} phospholipid and cholesterol components of low density lipoproteins that have been oxidized by human monocytes; the reaction appears due to the in situ free radical- and/or superoxide-induced oxidation of the lipoproteins.|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{find that}} 1) 9(S)-HODE (and 13(S)-HODE) levels are {{elevated}} in the plasma of older patients with early-stage cataracts compared to non-cataract subjects; 2) 9-HODE (and 13-HODE) are {{increased in the}} low density lipoproteins of patients with rheumatoid arthritis compared to healthy subjects {{as well as in}} the destructive but not normal bone tissue of the rheumatoid arthritic patients; 3) total HODEs (includes 9-HODE and 13-HODE <b>stereoisomers)</b> are higher in the plasma and liver of patients with hepatitis C and hepatitis B chronic viral infections {{as well as in the}} plasma and red blood cells of patients with Alzheimer's disease compared to healthy subjects; 4) 9-HODE and 9-oxoODE (as well as 13-HODE and 13-oxo-ODE) levels were elevated in the serum and/or pancreatic secretions of patients with pancreatitis compared to control subjects; 5) levels of the hydroperoxy precursors to 9-HODE and 13-HODE are elevated in the plasma and/or red blood cells of patients with Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, diabetic nephritis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and alcoholic steatohepatitis compared to healthy subjects. [...] These studies suggest that high levels of the HODEs may be useful to indicate the presence and progression of the cited diseases. [...] Since, however, the absolute values of HODEs found in different studies vary greatly, since HODE levels vary with dietary linoleic acid intake, since HODEs may form during the processing of tissues, and since abnormal HODE levels are not linked to a specific disease, the use of these metabolites as markers has not attained clinical usefulness. [...] HODE markers may find usefulness as markers of specific disease, type of disease, and/or progression of disease when combined with other disease markers.|$|E
