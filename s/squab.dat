5|$|<b>Squab</b> pie is a {{traditional}} dish from South West England, with early records showing it was associated with Cornwall, Devon and Gloucestershire. Although the name suggests it contains <b>squab</b> (young domestic pigeon), in fact it contains mutton and apples. The pie was eaten {{around the world in}} the 1900s, though outside South West England it generally did contain pigeon. It is no longer a popular dish, with less than 3% of British teenagers surveyed having eaten it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Squab</b> pie is a mutton {{pie with}} a shortcrust pastry lid. It {{should be made}} {{with at least one}} layer of onions, {{followed}} by alternating layers of sliced apples and mutton chops. The mixture should be covered with water, though less than in some pies, covered with pastry and baked in the oven for about two hours.|$|E
5|$|Varieties of meat {{consumed}} include poulet (chicken), pigeon (<b>squab),</b> canard (duck), oie (goose, {{the source}} of foie gras), bœuf (beef), veau (veal), porc (pork), agneau (lamb), mouton (mutton), caille (quail), cheval (horse), grenouille (frog), and escargot (snails). Commonly consumed fish and seafood include cod, canned sardines, fresh sardines, canned tuna, fresh tuna, salmon, trout, mussels, herring, oysters, shrimp and calamari.|$|E
50|$|Pigeon's milk {{begins to}} be {{produced}} {{a couple of days}} before the eggs are due to hatch. The parents may cease to eat at this point in order to be able to provide the <b>squabs</b> (baby pigeons and doves) with milk uncontaminated by seeds, which the very young <b>squabs</b> would be unable to digest. The baby <b>squabs</b> are fed on pure crop milk for the first week or so of life. After this the parents begin to introduce a proportion of adult food, softened by spending time in the moist conditions of the adult crop, into the mix fed to the <b>squabs,</b> until by the end of the second week they are being fed entirely on softened adult food.|$|R
5|$|Incubation {{takes two}} weeks. The hatched young, called <b>squabs,</b> are {{strongly}} altricial, being helpless at hatching {{and covered with}} down. Both parents feed the <b>squabs</b> pigeon's milk (dove's milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. Fledging takes place in about 11–15 days, before the <b>squabs</b> are fully grown but after {{they are capable of}} digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.|$|R
40|$|Pigeon raising is {{conducted}} successfully {{as a special}} business, also as a side issue {{on a small scale}} in towns and cities and on general farms. The demand for <b>squabs,</b> especially in large cities, is gradually increasing. <b>Squabs</b> are often used to replace the supply of dressed game which is decreasing in this country [...] This bulletin discusses the general management of pigeons for the production of <b>squabs</b> and also contains a summary of data secured from pigeon breeders throughout the United States.

5|$|Within the UK, {{the most}} common {{variation}} is to use lamb instead of mutton. Gloucester <b>Squab</b> pie did not require lamb and suggests any leftover meat could be used. Other ingredients can be included, for example Agatha Christie produced a variant which included hard-boiled eggs and another recipe took the concept of serving with clotted cream and adds cream to thicken.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{written record}} of the dovecote was in 1393 although the exact date of construction is not known. It was attached to a mansion house which burnt down in 1875. The manor previously belonged to Montacute Priory, a Cluniac priory of the Benedictine order, founded between 1078 and 1102 {{although it is not}} known if the construction of the dovecote was undertaken by the priory or the Lovel family who later held the manor. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh (<b>squab),</b> and dung.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{freshwater}} ponds (often called stews) held carp, pike, tench, bream, eel, and other fish. Poultry {{was kept in}} special yards, with pigeon and <b>squab</b> being reserved for the elite. Game was highly prized, but very rare, and included venison, wild boar, hare, rabbit, and birds. Kitchen gardens provided herbs, including some, such as tansy, rue, pennyroyal, and hyssop, which are rarely used today. Spices were treasured and very expensive at that time – they included pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, and mace. Some spices used then, but no longer today in French cuisine are cubebs, long pepper (both from vines similar to black pepper), grains of paradise, and galengale. Sweet-sour flavors were commonly added to dishes with vinegars and verjus combined with sugar (for the affluent) or honey. A common form of food preparation was to finely cook, pound and strain mixtures into fine pastes and mushes, something believed to be beneficial {{to make use of}} nutrients.|$|E
2500|$|Pigeons, {{unlike other}} poultry, form pair bonds to breed, and <b>squabs</b> must be brooded and fed by both parents {{until they are}} four weeks old; a pair of pigeons may produce 15 <b>squabs</b> per year. Ten pairs can produce eight <b>squabs</b> each month without being fed by their keepers. Pigeons which are {{accustomed}} to their dovecote may forage and return there to rest and breed.

25|$|A New York Times {{reviewer}} {{wrote in}} a May 14, 1918, piece on the play The <b>Squab</b> Farm by Frederic and Fanny Hatton, that Helen Barnes {{appeared to be the}} audience’s favorite <b>squab.</b> The play, a satire that compared a motion picture set to a barnyard, was performed at the Bijou Theatre with Helen Barnes playing the role of Hortense Hogan.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether an}} increase in begging levels delays growth of chicks. In experiment 1, we hand-reared nine pairs of ring dove <b>squabs,</b> divided into a control and a begging group.

In experiment 2, we hand-reared 27 pairs of magpie chicks for 3 days. The design of experiment 2 was similar to that of experiment 1. Daily food intake and begging affected growth rates. On average, chicks in the begging group grew 0. 8 g/day less than control chicks, which represents a decrease of 8. 15 % in growth rate. Because growth is usually positively associated with expected fitness, this demonstrates that begging is a costly behavior, an assumption routinely made in models of begging behavior.

25|$|After his 1911 {{marriage}} he and {{his wife}} purchased land north of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania at Cold Springs. It was a large tract of land. Mulford and Fridel lived in a multi-story home with the basement and an outbuilding devoted to his snakes. It was remote, connected to services only by a train with a depot near their house and walking path. He had plans of refurbishing one of the old farmhouses on the property although this never transpired. According to historians the farmhouse likely burned down sometime in 1919 and the family left Cold Springs sometime after this. During his years at Cold Springs Mulford kept busy on the property developing the former hotel grounds, growing an orchard, raising fruits and vegetables, his reptiles and <b>squab</b> as well as involved in some fashion with the bottling and selling of the spring water which came from underground sources. In Mulford's time, the collected spring water and <b>squab</b> would eventually find their way to tables as far away as Harrisburg and Philadelphia. Additional information has been collected on the Cold Springs inhabitants of the early 1900s including the Fosters and {{can be found in the}} book Cold Spring Hotel Site.|$|E

The breed chosen was the red carneau. Together they bought four acres of land on Webster Avenue near the Wykagyl Country Club, built a row of pigeon houses and installed 4,000 birds. The result, called the Silver Ring <b>Squab</b> Farm, had set the two back a total of $15,000.|$|E

25|$|Their {{dreams of}} pigeon-born wealth went {{anything}} but smoothly, however: A local mobster reputedly demanded {{a portion of}} the proceeds, while hotels had a habit of canceling orders. Friends were interested, but more in eating <b>squab</b> than paying for them. Not long after, Phillips contracted tuberculosis, and he and his wife left for Europe. Now sole manager of the farm, Montague put in thousands more to keep it afloat.

25|$|Assamese cuisine is {{a mixture}} of {{different}} indigenous styles, with considerable regional variation and some external influences. Although it is known for its limited use of spices, Assamese cuisine has strong flavours from its use of endemic herbs, fruits, and vegetables served fresh, dried, or fermented. Rice is the staple food item and a huge variety of endemic rice varieties, including several varieties of sticky rice {{are a part of the}} cuisine in Assam. Fish, generally freshwater varieties, are widely eaten. Other nonvegetarian items include chicken, duck, <b>squab,</b> snails, silkworms, insects, goat, pork, venison, turtle, monitor lizard, etc. The region's cuisine involves simple cooking processes, mostly barbecuing, steaming, or boiling. Bhuna, the gentle frying of spices before the addition of the main ingredients, generally common in Indian cooking, is absent in the cuisine of Assam. A traditional meal in Assam begins with a khar, a class of dishes named after the main ingredient and ends with a tenga, a sour dish. Homebrewed rice beer or rice wine is served before a meal. The food is usually served in bell metal utensils. Paan, the practice of chewing betel nut, generally concludes a meal.|$|E

The Old Fashioned or Original Hünkari (Oriental Frill) possess less exaggerated features unlike the Oriental Frill of today.
