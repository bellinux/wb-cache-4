50|$|When beating egg whites, {{they are}} {{classified}} {{in three stages}} according to the peaks they form when the beater is lifted: soft, firm, and <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks.</b> Overbeaten eggs take on a dry appearance, and eventually collapse. Egg whites do not beat up correctly if {{they are exposed to}} any form of fat, such as cooking oils or the fats contained in egg yolk.|$|E
50|$|A {{baseball}} cap {{is a type}} of soft cap with a rounded crown and a <b>stiff</b> <b>peak</b> projecting in front.|$|R
50|$|It has {{the same}} overall shape and <b>stiff</b> <b>peak</b> in front as a flat cap, but {{the body of the}} cap is rounder, fuller, and paneled with a button on top, and often with a button {{attaching}} the front to the brim (as the flat cap sometimes has).|$|R
5000|$|Heavy body {{acrylics}} {{are typically}} {{found in the}} Artist and Student Grade paints. [...] "Heavy Body" [...] refers to the viscosity or thickness of the paint. They are {{the best choice for}} impasto or heavier paint applications and will hold a brush or knife stroke and even a medium <b>stiff</b> <b>peak.</b> Gel Mediums ("pigment-less paints") are also available in various viscosities and used to thicken or thin paints, as well as extend paints and add transparency.|$|R
50|$|According to most recipes, the yolks must be whipped {{until they}} swell to double their {{original}} volume. Some recipes also call for egg whites (1--2 whites for each 10 yolks), beaten separately to <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks</b> consistency and gently mixed into the yolks. The mixture is then poured into greased muffin forms (about 1/2 tablespoon each) and baked {{until they are}} firm but still without crust. The pieces are then boiled lightly in the syrup, which may be flavored with rum, vanilla, or orange peel.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical {{leavening}} agents {{include a}} weak base, such as baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) plus a weak acid, such as cream of tartar, lemon juice, or cultured buttermilk, {{to create an}} acid—base reaction that releases carbon dioxide. (Quick bread leavened specifically with baking soda is often called [...] "soda bread"). Baking powder contains both an acid and a base in dry powdered form, and simply needs a liquid medium in which to react. Other alternative leavening agents are egg whites mechanically beaten to form <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks,</b> {{as in the case}} of many waffle recipes, or steam, in the case of cream puffs. Nevertheless, in a commercial process, designated chemical leavening acids and bases are used to make gas production consistent and controlled. Examples of acid—base combinations include: ...|$|E
50|$|The lemon custard {{is usually}} {{prepared}} with egg yolks, lemon zest and juice, sugar, and, optionally, starch. This {{gives it a}} texture {{similar to that of}} a sturdy pudding. The meringue, which includes well beaten egg whites and sugar, is cooked on top of the pie filling. As the meringue bakes, air bubbles trapped inside the protein of the egg white will expand and swell. However, if the egg whites are beaten too much, or if a tiny amount of fat is allowed to contaminate the mixture, then the proteins {{will not be able to}} form the correct molecular structure when cooked, and the meringue may collapse when cooked. The meringue can be beaten into either soft or <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks.</b> The temperature the pie is baked at and the method by which sugar is added also determines the texture and durability of the meringue.|$|E
50|$|For Other Ranks, the SD uniform {{originally}} comprised khaki wool (serge) trousers, a khaki wool tunic, with stand-and-fall (or Prussian) collar, four pockets on the front, each buttoned {{closed by}} a flap {{with a straight}} (horizontal) edge, large, serge reinforcement patches over each shoulder, shoulder straps {{and a pair of}} brass wire hangers on the back, over the kidneys, to support the belt. The front of the jacket was closed by five buttons, usually of a regimental pattern, arranged vertically. A peaked cap was provided, covered in the same khaki serge (including the <b>stiff</b> <b>peak),</b> with a leather chin strap (brown, for most regiments) held at either side by brass or horn buttons. This uniform was worn with ankle Ammunition boots; in the field, Puttees would be wound up (or down) the length of the shins, covering the top of the boots. The carrying equipment worn by infantry with this uniform was normally the 1908 Pattern Webbing, made of fabric and also khaki (though a lighter shade than the uniform). Cavalry and gunners of the Royal Regiment of Artillery did not wear webbing equipment, but instead used the leather 1903_Bandolier Equipment, worn over one shoulder. Originally derived from the bandoliers carried by the Boer commandos during the Second Boer War, it had been found to be unsuitable for infantry use but remained in service with mounted troops.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn-situ {{synchrotron}} x-ray {{experiments have}} been used to follow the evolution of the diffraction peaks for crystalline dendrites embedded in a bulk metallic glass matrix subjected to a compressive loading-unloading cycle. We observe irreversible diffraction-peak splitting even though the load does not go beyond half of the bulk yield strength. The chemical analysis coupled with the transmission electron microscopy mapping suggests that the observed peak splitting originates from the chemical heterogeneity between the core (major <b>peak)</b> and the <b>stiffer</b> shell (minor <b>peak)</b> of the dendrites. A molecular dynamics model has been developed to compare the hkl-dependent microyielding of the bulk metallic-glass matrix composite. The complementary diffraction measurements and the simulation results suggest that the interface, as Maxwell damper, between the amorphous matrix and the (211) crystalline planes relax under prolonged load that causes a delay in the reload curve which ultimately catches up with the original pat...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} program is developed assuming underlying soil as horizontally layered and one-dimensional. Soil material non-linearity is considered in this problem. One dimensional shear wave equation is solved. Space is discretized by Finite Element method {{and time is}} discretized by Central Difference method. Two parameter hyperbolic model and Masing rule are used to obtain the dynamic stress-strain behaviour. The number of soil layers, the properties of different soil layers such as density, initial shear modulus, reference strain and the properties of rigid base rock such as density and shear modulus are used as input data. Record of the earthquake which occurred at El-Centro in 1940, is used here as surface acceleration data. The output {{of the program is}} dynamic stress-strain behaviour in different soil layers, variation of secant shear modulus with time in different soil layers, deformation in different soil layers and base rock acceleration of the soil layer. The soil properties data assumed here is soft layer in the upper portion and comparatively stiffer layer in the bottom layer. The base rock layer is the <b>stiffest</b> layer. The <b>peak</b> base rock acceleration is found greater than the peak surface acceleration. Hysteresis loop is maintained in each layer of the soil column for obtaining dynamic stress-strain behaviour. Variation of secant shear modulus with time is fluctuating. The surface deformation is found greater than the base rock deformation...|$|R
40|$|Egg white foam {{is a type}} of foam (a colloid {{in which}} a gas is {{dispersed}} or spread throughout a liquid) used in meringues, souffl és, and angel food cake to make them light and porous (airy). To prepare an egg white foam, egg whites are initially beaten (with a wire wisk or electric mixer) until they become frothy. Then an acid (such as cream of tartar) is added. Depending on the application, the beating of the egg white continues until soft (when the peaks stand straight and bend slightly at the tips) or <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks</b> (when the peaks stand straight without bending) are formed. Salt and sugar may also be added. How It Works: Egg whites are made up of water, protein, and small amounts of minerals and sugars. When the egg whites are beaten, air is added and the egg white protein, albumen, is denatured. Denaturation is the change of a protein’s shape under stress (in this case, beating). The denatured protein coats the air bubbles and holds in the water, causing them t...|$|E
40|$|Various {{concentrations}} of the globular protein hemoglobin were successfully electrospun to create micro-fibrous mats of varying physical and mechanical characteristics. The electrospinning parameters are reported. One concentration of myoglobin was electrospun into a mat for {{comparison to the}} hemoglobin mats. Scanning electron microscopy revealed ribbon-like morphologies for the hemoglobin and myoglobin structures. Mean fiber width and thickness for each mat electrospun from a different hemoglobin concentration increased from 2. 68 ± 0. 83 to 3. 55 ± 1. 49 μm and from 0. 49 ± 0. 08 to 0. 99 ± 0. 41 μm, respectively, for increasing hemoglobin solution concentrations (from 150 to 225 mg/mL). For calculations of surface {{area to volume ratio}} for the four different electrospun hemoglobin concentrations, there was a negative correlation (r = - 0. 84) with concentration; the surface area to volume ratio ranged between 0. 50 ± 0. 16 and 1. 53 ± 0. 24 m 2 /cm 3. Also, {{there appears to be a}} positive correlation between electrospun hemoglobin concentration and porosity, which increased with increasing concentration from 69. 5 to 83. 3 %. Following cross-linking with glutaraldehyde, the mechanical properties of two constructs were evaluated via uniaxial tensile testing to demonstrate handling capability. Results indicated that increased cross-linking time produced <b>stiffer</b> structures, as <b>peak</b> stress and modulus increased while strain at break decreased when the mats were cross-linked for 30 minutes with glutaraldehyde versus the 20 minute cross-linking time...|$|R
40|$|Malalignment is {{the main}} cause of tibial {{component}} loosening. Implants that migrate rapidly in the first two post-operative years are likely to present aseptic loosening. It has been suggested that cancellous bone stresses can be correlated with tibial component migration. A recent study has shown that patient-specific finite element (FE) models have the power to predict the short-term behavior of tibial trays. The stresses generated within the implanted tibia are dependent on the kinematics of the joint; however, previous studies have ignored the kinematics and only applied static loads. Using explicit FE, it is possible to simultaneously predict the kinematics and stresses during a gait cycle. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the cancellous bone strains during the stance phase of the gait cycle, for varying degrees of varus/valgus eccentric loading using explicit FE. A patient-specific model of a proximal tibia was created from CT scan images, including heterogeneous bone properties. The proximal tibia was implanted with a commercial total knee replacement (TKR) model. The stance phase of gait was simulated and the applied loads and boundary conditions were based on those used for the Stanmore knee simulator. Eccentric loading was simulated. As well as examining the tibial bone strains (minimum and maximum principal strain), the kinematics of the bone-implant construct are also reported. The maximum anterior–posterior displacements and internal–external rotations were produced by the model with 20 mm offset. The peak minimum and maximum principal strain values increased as the load was shifted laterally, reaching a maximum magnitude for ? 20 mm offset. This suggests that when in varus, the load transferred to the bone is shifted medially, and as the bone supporting this load is <b>stiffer,</b> the resulting <b>peak</b> bone strains are lower than when the load is shifted laterally (valgus). For this particular patient, the TKR design analyzed produced the highest cancellous bone strains when in valgus. This study has provided an insight in the variations produced in bone strain distribution when the axial load is applied eccentrically. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that the bone strain distribution of a proximal implanted tibia has been examined, also accounting for the kinematics of the tibio– femoral joint as part of the simulation. This approach gives greater insight into the overall performance of TKR...|$|R
