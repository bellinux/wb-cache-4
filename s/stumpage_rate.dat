50|$|Stumpage is {{the price}} a private firm pays {{for the right to}} harvest timber from a given land base. It is paid to the current owner of the land. Historically, the price was {{determined}} on a basis of the number of trees harvested, or “per stump”. Currently it is dictated by more standard measurements such as cubic metres, board feet, or tons. To determine stumpage, any stand that will be harvested by the firm is first assessed and appraised through processes aimed at finding the volume of timber that is to be harvested. A given <b>stumpage</b> <b>rate,</b> measured in $/volume, is then applied to the amount of timber to be harvested. The firm will then pay this price to the landowner.|$|E
40|$|Governments often {{sell the}} right to harvest timber on public land. If timber is of {{heterogeneous}} quality and timber pri ces reflect this heterogeneity, then charging a fixed <b>stumpage</b> <b>rate</b> per cubic meter of timber harvested independent of timber quality can induce the economically inefficient practice of harvesting only the best grades of timber, "high-grading. " Charging a lump sum that is independent {{of the volume of}} timber harvested yields the efficient choice of minimum timber quality. With competitive bidding, the lump-sum scheme extracts all of the resource rent while the <b>stumpage</b> <b>rate</b> scheme leaves some rent in the forest. ...|$|E
40|$|Northern British Columbia is {{experiencing}} an infestation of epidemic proportions {{from the mountain}} pine beetle. The British Columbia provincial and Canada federal governments have proposed that uses other than dimensional lumber {{should be encouraged to}} maximize the economic value of the dying and dead lodgepole pine. Future wood pellet production facilities would need to become standalone and utilise whole trees as a source of wood fibre inputs. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} examine the financial viability of a Northern British Columbia standalone wood pellet production facility located in Prince George when fibre input comes from primary harvesting using a whole mountain pine beetle-killed lodgepole pine tree. The secondary objective was to understand whether incentives by way of stumpage relief provided by the government of British Columbia would provide financial viability of a standalone wood pellet production facility. Data obtained from the British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range, Wood Pellets Association of Canada, and European Pellet Centre was used to project cash flow for five, seven, and ten-year baseline, realistic, pessimistic, and optimistic scenarios. Analysis was done using net present value of cash flows with an annual 8. 9 % return requirement. In all but the optimistic scenario it was proven that a standalone wood pellet production facility was not financially viable. It was further determined that mountain pine beetle-killed lodgepole pine was already assessed the lowest <b>stumpage</b> <b>rate</b> and further relief would have no bearing on the financial viability of a standalone wood pellet production facility. Government encouragement of additional wood pellet production facilities would require direct or indirect subsidies aimed at capital costs and taxation relief.

40|$|With the {{assistance}} of a World Bank loan, Tanzania has been developi ng its largest softwood industrial plantation at Sao Hill. It was clear that the achie vements that had been realized {{by the end of the}} first phase of development justified a second ph ase. However, it was necessary to find solutions to certain key problems that had bee n identified as possible threats to the development of the Sao Hill plantation. The purpose of this TCP assistance was therefore to carry out studies to identify the cause of persisten t die-back in pine and eucalyptus species; to investigate forest fire management and control; and to determine <b>stumpage</b> <b>rates</b> based on production costsPreviously known causes of die-back include boron deficiency, inadeq uate site preparation, drought and Diploidea pinea attack. The results of studies carried out by the project indicate that other factors, such as adverse physical properties of the soil in subsurface horizons, pruning practices and vulnerable genotypes, may have an important impa ct on the incidence of die-back. It was recommended that attention be focused initially o n those physical factors that can readily be brought under control, for example, by carr ying out a more systematic classification of sites to be planted and, where root-impeding s ubsurface soils are spotted, ripping the B horizon during site preparation. In the longer term, consideration should be given to selecting species and provenances that are less prone to die- backFrom the information available, it appears that human factors are re sponsible for more than half of the recorded outbreaks of forest fires (excluding cases of controlled burning). In order to improve the prevention, detection and suppression of plan tation fires, it was recommended that continuing efforts be made to improve public relations w ith the local residents, and that those involved in fire control activities be adequately equi pped in terms of functioning communication and transport facilities. The training in forest f ire management and control received by the participants in the study tour to Australia should b e of great benefit in implementing the latter recommendationThe studies on <b>stumpage</b> <b>rates</b> indicate that there are marked differe nces in the values of stumpage raised in different areas of the country. For this reason, i t was recommended that the current practice of applying uniform stumpage values for th e whole country be reviewed with a view to arriving at stumpage values that would be mor e appropriate for each plantation area, having regard to the dependent wood-based industries. It was also recommended that the <b>stumpage</b> <b>rates</b> be reviewed annually to ensure t hat the rates levied are in line with the economic, social and political aspirations of the co untry. A balance needs to be maintained between the desirable <b>stumpage</b> <b>rates,</b> the ability of industries to pay, and the prices of forest products in the domestic marke...|$|R
40|$|Management {{strategies}} were compared, including thinning {{and the production}} of fuelwood versus larger size-class volume, to develop a management plan for the mesquite woodland of the southern Arizona study site. Pre-commercial thinning of mesquite stands is not economic and the production and separate marketing of the larger size class at current <b>stumpage</b> <b>rates</b> gives only marginally higher returns than fuelwood alone, $ 9. 57 /ha/yr compared to $ 9. 13 /ha/yr. Equations were developed for prediction of fuelwood volume and for estimating volume in stem pieces 20 cm or greater in diameter. Estimated growth rates were 0. 43 m 3 /ha/yr for the upland areas and 0. 84 m 3 /ha/yr for the riparian areas. The culmination of mean annual increment suggests a rotation age of 40 years...|$|R

40|$|The usual {{statistical}} sampling technique of choosing {{a sample size}} to produce an estimate with a specified error limit can be improved upon in situations where indirect costs resulting from estimation errors can be evaluated. The estimation of the weight to volume conversion factor in weigh scaling is such a situation and this paper presents the formulae needed to determine sample sizes that will minimise total scaling costs for both simple random sampling and stratified random sampling. Using cost and production data that is representative of weigh scaling for a New Zealand Forest Service conservancy, the minimum total scaling cost strategy is compared with the 2 V 2 percent error strategy in terms of sample sizes, variable and total scaling costs, and standard error attained. The comparisons illustrate {{the differences between the}} strategies when considering various stratum classifications and <b>stumpage</b> <b>rates.</b> The minimum total cost strategy produces significant savings compared to the current method and produces more accurate estimates (i. e. smaller standard error) of more valuable forest products which is an intuitively desirable characteristic...|$|R
50|$|A {{timber cruise}} is a sample {{measurement}} of a stand {{used to estimate}} the amount of standing timber that the forest contains. These measurements are collected at sample locations called plots, quadrants, or strips. Each of these individual sample areas is one observation {{in a series of}} observations called a sample. These sample areas are generally laid out in some random fashion usually {{in the form of a}} line plot survey. Depending on the size of the plot and the number of plots measured, the data gathered from these plots can then be manipulated to achieve varying levels of certainty for an estimate that can be applied to the entire timber stand. This estimate of stand conditions, species composition, volume and other measured attributes of a forest system can then be used for various purposes. For example, in British Columbia the sale of Crown timber is a business proposition and both the buyer and the Ministry of Forests and Range (seller) must know the quantity and the quality of timber being sold. Our satellite provides the essential data and information for determining <b>stumpage</b> <b>rates,</b> for establishing conditions of sale and for planning of the logging operations by the licensee. Generally a timber cruise includes measurements or estimates of timber volume by forest product sort (and sometimes grade), log defect, and log lengths, whether the estimates are made in the field or using computer software.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} element of timber auctions is the upset—the minimum acceptable price, often called the reserve price in other auction environments. The upset has three main purposes: (1) to guarantee substantial revenue in auctions where competition is weak but the upset is met, (2) to limit the incentive for—and the impact of—collusive bidding, and (3) to provide useful information to bidders. We analyze {{the determination of the}} upset in British Columbia timber auctions. Setting the upset too high results in unsold stands and produces an upward bias in price if the competitive auctions are used to determine <b>stumpage</b> <b>rates</b> for non-auctioned timber. Setting the upset too low will reduce auction revenue and can create downward bias when the auction prices are used to calculate timber prices for non-auctioned stands. It is therefore important to set the upset at or near the optimal level. We present the theory of upset pricing and then apply that theory to the data available from historical timber auction sales in the BC Interior from 1999 to 2000. We find that an upset of about 70 percent (a rollback of 30 percent) maximizes auction revenues if the Ministry values timber at about 52 to 56 percent of its appraised value. This upset strikes the right balance between enhanced revenues and unsold timber stands. Given its importance, this upset calibration should be refined as additional data becomes available to assure that the upset is not set too high or too low...|$|R
40|$|Beginning in 1980, large {{forestry}} {{corporations in}} British Columbia began to rapidly downsize and restructure their operations. The combination of volatile international market conditions, increasing demands for environmental conservation, First Nation?s land claims, higher <b>stumpage</b> <b>rates,</b> American protectionism, a declining timber supply, and introduction of labor saving technologies, made {{it no longer}} profitable for these companies to employ large numbers of workers under a Fordist organizational structure. The tremendous job losses seriously compromised the sustainability of forestry dependent communities throughout the province. The responses from forestry based communities in B. C. have been diverse. Some have chosen {{to take a more}} passive approach and have become bedroom communities to larger urban centers or retirement destinations. Others have actively pursued economic diversification through increased entrepreneurial activities. No matter which alternative individual communities have chosen to pursue, it is evident that they are all undergoing a significant transformation. This exploratory study examines how the identity (or image) of these places has evolved, and investigates the impact this has had on local residents. The three Vancouver Island communities of Chemainus, Sooke, and Port Alberni have been selected as case studies. A variety of quantitative and qualitative research methods are employed including a resident survey, personal interviews, and review of real estate guides and promotional materials. Overall the findings suggest that the identity associated with each case study community has both positively and negatively perceived elements. With a greater appreciation for these elements, it was possible for the researcher to make a variety of justifiable recommendations to improve current planning policies and processes, in each of the case studies, which will help them build a stronger, more positive image, and therefore become healthier, more viable, and sustainable communities. By emphasizing the significance of identity for community planning, and by outlining the participatory methods necessary to conduct an in depth identity investigation, this study also paves the way for future investigations on other British Columbia communities in transition and for the widespread use of the principle of identity as a contributory decision-making strategy in the planning profession...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{generalized}} Faustmann model is developed for uneven-aged management {{to allow the}} number of years and the level of residual growing stock to vary from one cutting cycle to the next. Comparative static analyses are conducted to determine the effect of changes in interest <b>rate,</b> <b>stumpage</b> price of the trees selected for harvest, the stumpage value of the residual growing stock, and the future land value on the decision variables. The model is then applied to study the uneven-aged management of a loblolly-shortleaf pine stand in south central U. S. to determine the length of the cutting cycle and the level of residual growing stock for the first cutting cycle as well as for a case involving four cutting cycles. Sensitivity analyses reveal that for the uneven-aged loblolly-shortleaf pine stand both the length of the cutting cycle and the level of the residual growing stock are very sensitive to changes in land value in the future, in the stumpage prices of trees selected for harvest, in the stumpage prices of the residual growing stock, and in the interest rate.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{estimating}} return on {{and risk of}} non-industrial private forest (NIPF) ownership involving the innovation of dividing the return into (i) felling, (ii) price change, (iii) change in the growing stock and (iv) silvicultural cost components has been developed. Comparison is made between stumpage price change and inflation {{as well as between}} forests and other assets, which are housing, offices, stocks and their subclass forest industry stocks as well as bonds and debentures. These results are based on a complete count of the stumpage prices, silvicultural costs, felling volumes and national forest inventory (NFI) data. Forest ownership produced a real return of only 2. 6 % in the 1972 – 2003 period, housing 4. 6 % and forest industry stocks as much as 7. 6 %. The nominal return on forest ownership of 8. 4 % consist-ed of <b>stumpage</b> price change <b>rate</b> 4. 6 %, commercial fellings 3. 1 %, costs – 0. 35 %, and volume change component 1. 0 %. Surprisingly, stumpage price change did not exceed the inflation level of 5. 8 %. The correlation with forest ownership was statistically significant only with private housing. Competi-tiveness benchmarking places forests slightly behind housing. However, optimal portfolios, which also recognise correlations, place housing behind forests. In all, financial investments clearly outperformed real investments in the low inflation 1987 – 2003 period.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Recent {{changes in}} public timber {{supplies}} in the Pacific Northwest {{have increased the}} importance of the role private timber plays in the forest products industry and local communities. Most economic models of timber supply, however, have emphasized national or regional markets where data are adequate and statistical testing methodologies relatively well documented. Little {{attention has been paid to}} modeling timber harvests at the local market level. This study attempts to develop an economic model to explain timber harvests at the county level where previous efforts, which have emphasized a simultaneous equations approach, have met with poor results. A set of economic timber harvest relations was tested for eight counties in Northwest Oregon using the seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) technique. For industrial landowners, a present net worth maximization model was used where harvest is a function of <b>stumpage</b> price, discount <b>rate,</b> and level of growing stock inventory. For non-industrial private landowners a utility maximization model was used where harvest is a function of stumpage price, personal income, and level of growing stock inventory. Parameter coefficient estimates developed using SUR were compared with those developed using ordinary least squares (OLS) to evaluate the adequacy of the error-related approach. Results of the study showed significant contemporaneous correlation between harvests in the counties of the study region for both industrial and non-industrial landowners. Therefore parameter coefficient estimates obtained using SEJR are more efficient than those obtained with OLS. The greatest improvements in modeling efficiency were observed for non-industrial owners. Furthermore, the present net worth maximization model used for industrial landowners appears to reasonably represent the harvest motivations of those landowners. However, the high standard errors and poor explanatory power observed in the non-industrial landowner estimations suggest that the utility maximization model used for those landowners needs to be re-evaluated. For both landowners, the level of growing stock inventory plays a large role in determining timber harvests. Policy makers and analysts interested in predicting countylevel timber harvests should advocate the collection of more extensive county-level inventory information than is currently collected. The recording of county-specific price information would also prove valuable for future analyses by eliminating the need for a proxy variable...|$|R
