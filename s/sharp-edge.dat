40|$|One of {{the issues}} that arise in the text {{steganography}} is the capacity of hiding secret bit. Focusing in Arabic text steganography we propose a <b>sharp-edges</b> method to encounter the issue. This new method will hide the secret bits in the <b>sharp-edges</b> for each character in the Arabic text document. The main processes involved are identifying <b>sharp-edges</b> in the cover-text, secret message preparation to be hidden as a binary string and lastly, the bit hiding process. The experiments show that the capacity percentage used to hide the secret bit was increased up to 37. 8 %, resolving the capacity issue. The stego-text for this method has high invisibility, and therefore it is possible to be published publicly. We introduce keys to determine the possition of the secret bit randomly. This method utilizes the advantages of the Arabic text for steganography and can also be implemented to the same text scripting of languages such as Jawi, Persian or Urdu...|$|R

40|$|The study {{presents}} two novel {{approaches for}} gust response analysis of elastic free aircraft configuration using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) tools. The first approach involves full aeroelastic dynamic simulation within a CFD run. The second involves computing rigid <b>sharp-edge</b> gust responses in a CFD run, evaluating the gust input forces due to arbitrary gust profiles via convolution using those rigid <b>sharp-edge</b> gust responses, and applying a linear aeroelastic feedback loop. The latter is highly computationally efficient, as only one relatively short CFD run {{is required for the}} computation of the <b>sharp-edge</b> gust responses, after which responses to arbitrary gust profiles can be computed in seconds. The former is more elaborate and time consuming, and can be used in cases in which the elastic response may be non-linear. The two methods are demonstrated by computing responses to one-minus-cosine gust inputs of a transport aircraft model. I...|$|E
40|$|A thick orifice {{of a given}} {{diameter}} is one {{in which}} the length-diameter ratio exceeds that of a British Standard <b>sharp-edge</b> orifice of the same diameter. Thick orifices are important technically but little systematic work appears to have been performed on them. <b>Sharp-edge</b> orifices are treated as limiting cases of thick orifices. This paper describes a carefully controlled investigation into the behaviour of the steady flow of air through thirty-eight orifices ranging in diameter from to + in and of length-diameter ratios, Z/d, of 2. 0, 1. 0, and 0. 5 and of <b>sharp-edge</b> orifices. These orifices have been calibrated against a range of <b>sharp-edge</b> orifices according to the British Standards code. The maximum possible instrument error over the experimental range (maximum pressure 150 lb/in 2 absolute, maximum temperature 940 ”R) is estimated to be less than 0. 1 per cent.

With this present study {{it is intended to}} measure the awareness regarding safe use of sharp-edged medical instrument of nurses working in Training and Research Hospitals and to create the basis for the training program planned to be provided on this topic. Method: This descriptive and cross-sectional type study was conducted on nurses (N= 365) working in the Training and Research Hospital of Hitit University. No sample selection was made, the sample consisted of nurses (n= 259) working during the dates of the study (15. 02 / 15. 05. 15). Research data has been collected through an and ldquo;Attitude Scale of Health Care Workers to Safe Use of <b>Sharp-Edged</b> Medical Instrument and rdquo; questionnaire and characteristics of participants defining questions. Research data has been evaluated with appropriate statistical methods. p 5 years working nurses who participated in the study are higher compared to nurses working and # 8804; 5 years.

40|$|Tomographic imaging of {{the crust}} and upper mantle beneath the western United States has greatly {{improved}} {{with the addition}} of USArray data. These models display many detailed images of both fast and slow blobs penetrating into the transition zone. To study such features, we apply a newly developed technique, called MultiPath Detector analysis, to the SH waveform data. The method simulates each observed body waveform by performing a decomposition; by [S(t) +C×S(t–Δ_ 9 LR)) ]/ 2, where S(t) is the synthetics for a reference model. Time separation Δ_ 9 LR) and amplitude ratio C are needed to obtain a high cross-correlation between a simulated waveform and data. The travel time of the composite waveform relative to the reference model synthetics is defined as Δ_T. A simulated annealing algorithm is used to determine the parameters Δ_(LR) and C. We also record the amplitude ratio (Amp) between the synthetics for the reference model relative to the data. Generally, large Δ_(LR) values are associated with low Amp's. Whereas the conventional tomography yields a travel time correction (Δ_T), our analysis yields an extra parameter (Δ_(LR)), which describes the waveform complexity. With the array, we can construct a mapping of the gradient of Δ_(LR) with complexity patterns. A horizontal structure introduces waveform complexity along the distance profile (in-plane multipathing). An azimuthally orientation Δ_(LR) pattern indicates a vertical structure with out-of-plane multipathing. Using such maps generated from artificial data, we can easily recognize features produced by dipping fast structures and slow structures (DSS). Many of these features display organized waveform complexity that are distinctly directional indicative of dipping <b>sharp-edges.</b> Here, we process the array data for events arriving from various azimuths and construct maps of multipathing patterns. The similarity between tomographic features and complexity maps is striking. When features are dipping such as the slab structures beneath the Cascade Range and Nevada, strong complexity is observed from Southeastern events arriving along these ray paths with split pulses separated up to 6 s for both. This requires extended slab segments to at least 600 / 300 km with a 4 / 8 per cent velocity jump along the edges. One of the most dramatic set of DSS observations is associated with a slow northwest dipping conduit beneath Yellowstone that extends into the transition zone. A number of forward modelling experiments are included for the strongest patterns formed by sharpening present tomographic images...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} alumina nano-fluid {{concentration}} on <b>sharp-edge</b> orifice flow characteristics in both cavitations and non-cavitations turbulent flow regimes are numerically investigated. At different concentration of AL 2 O 3 nonmetallic particles (2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 %, and 10 %) volume fractions in pure liquid water as a base fluid. A single-hole orifice pipe is with a small diameter ratio 0. 297 and the orifice plate thickness 14 mm. The effects of alumina nano-fluid concentration on <b>sharp-edge</b> orifice flow characteristics have been investigated based on the turbulent kinetic energy, turbulent intensity, turbulent viscosity, and volume fraction of vapor. The results show that for increasing the nonmetallic particle volume fraction from 0. 0 to 10 %, the turbulent kinetic energy decreases by 20. 87 % in average downstream the orifice in the whole region, the turbulent intensity decreases by 11. 11 % in average downstream the orifice in the whole region, the turbulent intensity decreases by 11 % in average in the whole region, and the volume fraction of vapor increases by 16. 9 %. Also, in the separation region downstream the orifice the turbulent kinetic energy increases by 160 % in average and the turbulent intensity increases by 74 % in average for increasing the nano-fluid concentration from 0. 0 % to 2 %. These are mainly because for using the alumina nano-fluid the separation phenomena decrease due to the increase of the viscosity of the nano-fluid, the total losses in the <b>sharp-edge</b> orifice increase for the increase of the viscosity of the nano-fluid and this causes the increase of the rate of vaporization. In the orifice pipe the total-stress criterion predicts larger cavitating regions in the flow field. However using the nano-fluid with high concentration accelerates the cavitations at the orifice pipe...|$|E
