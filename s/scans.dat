40|$|Abstract—A {{two-stage}} <b>scan</b> {{architecture is}} proposed to constrain transition propagation within {{a small part}} of <b>scan</b> flip-flops. Most <b>scan</b> flip-flops are deactivated during test application. The first stage includes multiple <b>scan</b> chains, where each <b>scan</b> chain is driven by a primary input. Each <b>scan</b> flip-flop in the multiple <b>scan</b> chains drives a group of <b>scan</b> flip-flops in the second stage. <b>Scan</b> flip-flops in different stages use separate clock signals. Test signals assigned to <b>scan</b> flip-flops in the multiple <b>scan</b> chains are applied to the <b>scan</b> flip-flops of the second stage in one clock cycle after the test vector has been applied to the multiple <b>scan</b> chains. There exists no transition at the <b>scan</b> flip-flops in the second stage when a test vector is applied to the multiple <b>scan</b> chains.

5|$|Archaeologist Don Brothwell {{considers}} {{that many of}} the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation. The use of sophisticated techniques, such as computer tomography (CT) <b>scans,</b> has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such <b>scans</b> allow the reconstruction of the body and internal examination. Of the 27bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of Worsley Man have survived, together with a shoe from another body.
