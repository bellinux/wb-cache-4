2500|$|Research {{has shown}} {{that there is a}} strong {{correlation}} between forms of academic integrity system and levels of cheating at a school.

2500|$|Greek {{organizations}} both {{nationally and}} locally sponsor many risk avoidance {{programs for the}} real benefits of student safety and well-being, {{as well as to}} avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban [...] "pledging" [...] nationwide is only the latest of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities. While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples. [...] In this area too, active and alumni Greek leaders have responded to such negative publicity and the resulting criticism with programs that seek to reduce alcohol abuse and eliminate underage or binge drinking, with risk management training, by <b>self-policing</b> their own chapters, and with more stringent procedures to discipline offenders. All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the NIC and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors. Hence, individual chapters are not alone in addressing these problems.
