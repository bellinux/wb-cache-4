5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports from}} the crash site speculated that the Amana was already on fire when it struck the tops of trees because those trees, and pieces of the aircraft's left wing torn off in the impact with them, showed signs of <b>scorching.</b> Several eyewitnesses reported seeing flames in the sky before the aircraft struck the ground. Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's push-button engine fire extinguishers had activated and this had most likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{began in}} Marrakech, Morocco on May 4, 1998 and lasted 17weeks. Photography {{then moved to}} the Sahara desert outside {{the small town of}} Erfoud, and then to the United Kingdom before {{completion}} of shooting on August 29, 1998. The crew could not shoot in Egypt because of the unstable political conditions. To avoid dehydration in the <b>scorching</b> heat of the Sahara, the production's medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences. Snakes, spiders and scorpions were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted out after being bitten.|$|E

However, minor modifications in the script were allowed for the surroundings. Though Panag had been in Rajasthan, she felt the <b>scorching</b> summer heat unbearable at times. She liked the only continuous shooting schedule and said that it provided consistency in look and performance. In Himachal, it was slightly different when the crew had hard time framing the mountains correctly. On seeing the captured frames, they shifted all the interior shots to outside.|$|E
30|$|Both crown volume <b>scorched</b> and {{crown length}} <b>scorched</b> values were {{visually}} assessed {{based on the}} proportions of the pre-fire crown that were either <b>scorched</b> or consumed (i.e., had pale green, brown, or blackened needles). These variables are not interchangeable (Peterson 1985, Hood et al. 2010). Crown volume <b>scorched</b> equals {{the percentage of the}} pre-fire crown volume of which needles were either <b>scorched</b> or consumed and could include areas with live and dead buds. Total tree height, pre-fire crown base height, and the average height of crown <b>scorch</b> were measured to calculate percentage crown length <b>scorched.</b> FOFEM calculates crown volume <b>scorched</b> from crown length <b>scorched</b> (Hood et al. 2007); however, for model validation, we used our direct estimates of crown volume <b>scorched</b> that we obtained in the field, as recommended by Peterson (1985).|$|R

5|$|Carte finally {{assembled}} a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company {{to launch a}} series of original English comic operas, beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, The Sorcerer, in November 1877. This work was a modest success, and H.M.S. Pinafore followed in May 1878. Despite a slow start, mainly due to a <b>scorching</b> summer, Pinafore became a red-hot favourite by autumn. After a dispute with Carte over the division of profits, the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes, intending to mount a rival production. The attempt was repelled by stagehands {{and others at the}} theatre loyal to Carte, and Carte continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Indeed, Pinafore was so successful that over a hundred unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} {{volatile}} compounds {{such as water}} and carbon dioxide, if present, might evaporate in the <b>scorching</b> heat of the sunward side, migrate to the cooler night side, and condense to form ice caps. Over time, the entire atmosphere might freeze into ice caps on the night side of the planet. However, it remains unknown if water and/or carbon dioxide are even present {{on the surface of}} Gliese 581c. Alternatively, an atmosphere large enough to be stable would circulate the heat more evenly, allowing for a wider habitable area on the surface. For example, although Venus has a small axial inclination, very little sunlight reaches the surface at the poles. A slow rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's produces prolonged days and nights. Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight cast on Venus at any given time, polar areas and the night side of Venus are kept almost as hot as on the day side by globally circulating winds.|$|E

3000|$|The {{effect of}} fire {{intensity}} on the efficacy or the raking treatment was investigated using mixed effects logistic regression. Fire intensity {{is defined as}} “the energy released during various phases of the fire” (Keeley 2009), and crown <b>scorch</b> is a commonly used proxy for fire intensity (Van Wagner 1973, Williams et al. 1998, Twidwell et al. 2009). We used percent crown volume <b>scorched</b> instead of maximum crown <b>scorch</b> height or relative <b>scorch</b> height as our measure of fire intensity because it {{is viewed as a}} more accurate assessment of crown <b>scorch</b> (Peterson 1985, Twidwell et al. 2009). The effect of fire intensity on raking treatment efficacy was tested by including an interaction between raking and fire intensity category in a GLMM model. Low intensity was defined as trees with crowns that were not <b>scorched</b> (n = 172), moderate intensity was defined as trees with percent crown volume <b>scorched</b> between 1 % and 80 % (n = 181), and high intensity was defined as trees with a percent crown volume <b>scorched</b> > 80 % (n = 104). A crown <b>scorch</b> value of 80 % was chosen for the high intensity cutoff because this is within the range (75 % to 90 %) often cited as causing death in conifers (McHugh and Kolb 2003, Fowler et al. 2010 [...]...|$|R

While these variables are approximately equal for most species, the difference can be substantial for some Western conifer species with large or protected buds such as ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, and western larch (Dieterich 1979, Hood et al. 2010). Both crown bud kill and crown needle <b>scorch</b> were assessed on 5635 ponderosa pine and Jeffrey pine trees to test if accounting {{for differences in}} crown kill and <b>scorch</b> improved prediction of tree mortality. Crown bud kill equals the percentage of pre-fire crown volume of which buds were killed either by heated air (i.e., <b>scorched)</b> or consumed by flame contact.
