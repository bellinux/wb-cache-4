40|$|Cellular differentiation, from {{pluripotent}} {{stem cells}} to the diverse cell types in our body, is guided by complex gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Although networks with thousands of genes can produce only a finite set of stable equilibrium states, termed “attractors”, we are still very far from completely understanding all the regulatory interactions and all the possible cell types and states they can produce. To explore landscapes of stable cellular states and their underlying GRNs, we have developed a new computational method, called SCENIC (Single Cell rEgulatory Network Inference and Clustering). SCENIC allows simultaneously reconstruction of GRNs and identification of stable cell states using <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA-seq</b> data. Regulatory modules are inferred for each transcription factor based on co-expression and transcription factor binding site analysis. Co-active regulatory modules in each cell are subsequently assembled into stable cell states. We used SCENIC to re-analyze publicly available single-cell data. On brain <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA-seq</b> datasets, SCENIC recovered known cell types, and inferred meaningful GRNs with known and novel master regulators for each cell type without any prior knowledge of the system. Furthermore, clustering single cells based on the active regulatory modules {{rather than on the}} raw expression profiles revealed cell states that with other approaches remain hidden, meanwhile compensating for technical bias. When applied to single-cell data from melanoma biopsies, SCENIC identifies otherwise hidden melanoma cell states, including an invasive cell state driven by NFATC 2, NFIB, TCF 4, and TEAD transcription factors.

We directly measure technical stochasticity by a pool/split design and find that there are significant differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and allelic bias and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison.

The combination of CD 25 high expression with other candidate biomarkers led to the identification of CD 298, CD 63 and CD 317 as the best biomarkers for permissiveness. CD 25 highCD 298 highCD 63 highCD 317 high cell population showed an enrichment of HIV-infection of up to 28 fold as compared to the unsorted cell population. The purified hyper-permissive cell subpopulation was characterized by a downregulation of interferon-induced genes and several known restriction factors. <b>Single-cell</b> <b>RNA-seq</b> analysis coupled with functional characterization of cell biomarkers provides signatures of the "HIV-permissive cell"...|$|E
30|$|Adenocarcinoma of {{the lung}} {{is the most}} common histologic subtype of lung cancer, {{accounting}} for more than 40 % of lung cancer incidence. Several studies have performed <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA-seq</b> on lung cancer patients to investigate molecular heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Min et al. [44] examined 34 single cells from a lung adenocarcinoma PDX model, and after filtering out differentially expressed genes associated with xenografting and cell culture, identified a set of 64 genes associated with poor prognosis that stratified the adenocarcinoma cells into two groups. In a separate study, single lung adenocarcinoma cells from this same PDX were evaluated by RNA-seq and expressed mutation profiling to study how heterogeneous cell populations respond to anti-cancer treatments [45]. Combining the status of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) G 12 D (35 G>A) mutation with the expression profiles of 69 genes associated with clinical prognosis classified the adenocarcinoma cells into four groups with different gene expression patterns. One group of cells that appeared cell-cycle quiescent and exhibited upregulation of ion channel transport genes survived exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and thus may be responsible for treatment failure. This study suggests that the actual cells responsible for drug resistance may be masked when analyzing large sections of the primary carcinoma, but <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA-seq</b> data may be useful for detecting rare potentially drug-resistant sub-clones. Suzuki and colleagues conducted <b>single-cell</b> <b>RNA-seq</b> on 336 cells from seven lung adenocarcinoma cell lines to investigate how cellular heterogeneity influences drug response [46]. Focusing on the LC 2 /ad cell line and a derivative cell line (LC 2 /ad-R), which has acquired resistance to the multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug vandetanib, showed that average gene expression levels changed more in LC 2 /ad-R cells than in LC 2 /ad cells in response to vandetanib treatment, potentially reflecting an acquired plasticity in the ability to respond to vandetanib. As seen in other single-cell studies, the great diversity in gene expression at the single-cell level, which may serve as a reservoir for cells to acquire drug resistance, cannot be detected with bulk tissue sequencing.|$|E
