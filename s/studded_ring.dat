50|$|The 1713 badge was a Maltese cross {{enameled}} {{red with}} white borders with diamonds set {{in each of}} the balls at the eight points of the cross and with diamond set rays appearing between each of the points of the cross, i. e., a larger longer ray between each arm of the cross and a smaller ray between each of the two points of these arms. In the centre of the cross was a white enamelled eagle in high relief with spread wings and facing left and with a diamond set royal crown on its head. At the top of the cross between the two top points was a diamond studded semi-circular link through which passed a diamond <b>studded</b> <b>ring</b> through which, in turn, passed the light-blue ribbon from which it was worn. The reverse side of this Maltese cross was enamelled white with red borders and had at its center an oval gold medallion with the founder's crowned royal cypher above two crossed swords taken from his arms as the Arch-Marshall of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E

One hadn't a halfpenny; and because I wouldn't let him through, he went back a little way, stooped down, took a run, and butted at the hatch like a ram. He smashed his hat rarely, but his head didn't seem no worse - in my opinion {{on account of his}} being wrong in it afore. Sometimes people haven't got a halfpenny. If they are really tired and poor we give 'em one and let 'em through. Other people will leave things - pocket-{{handkerchiefs}} mostly.

60|$|But {{it is with}} The Court {{that we have to}} do at present, {{not with}} Yarleys. Mr. Champers-Haswell had a {{week-end}} party. There were ten guests, all men, and with the exception of Alan, who it will be remembered was one of them, all rich and in business. They included two French bankers and three Jews, everyone a prop of the original Sahara Syndicate and deeply interested in the forthcoming flotation. To describe them is unnecessary, for they have no part in our story, being only financiers of a certain class, remarkable for the riches they had acquired by means that for the most part would not bear examination. The riches were evident enough. Ever since the morning the owners of this wealth had arrived by ones or twos in their costly motorcars, attended by smart chauffeurs and valets. Their fur coats, their jewelled <b>studs</b> and <b>rings,</b> something in their very faces suggested money, which indeed was the bond that brought and held them together.|$|R

She donated the jewels to the temple of Sri Ranganayaki. Every Friday and Tuesday Sri Ranaganayaki was decorated with a large pearl-studded nose ring and other precious jewellery, which was put into the safe custody of Alamelamma the rest of the week, since she was known to be a staunch devotee of Sri Ranganayaki.|$|R

40|$|Context. The Galaxy Ultraviolet Explorer (GALEX) {{satellite}} {{has recently}} shown {{the presence of}} an extended, outer <b>ring</b> <b>studded</b> with UV-bright knots surrounding the lenticular galaxy NGC 4262. Such a structure-not detected in the optical-is coupled with a ring of atomic (HI) gas. Aims: We want to show that both star-forming and HI rings surrounding this SB 0 galaxy share the same radial distance from the galaxy center and spatial orientation. We also model the kinematics of the ring(s) and of the galaxy body. Methods: We make use of archive FUV and NUV GALEX data plus HI observations from the literature. Results: We confirm that the UV-bright and atomic gas rings of NGC 4262 have the same extent and projected spatial orientation. Their kinematics is not coupled with that of the galaxy stars. Conclusions: It is possible that NGC 4262 has undergone a major gas stripping event in the past that was the origin of the present “necklace” of UV-bright knots...|$|R
40|$|T he {{growing trend}} for body {{jewellery}} is amatter {{of concern for}} all dental professionals. Strictly speaking, the term “body jewellery” refers to jewellery {{that is designed to}} go through the body, rather than simply on the body. Examples of dental relevance include lip <b>studs</b> and <b>rings,</b> tongue bars, and rings placed through the uvula. As will be discussed in this article, there are multiple compli-cations from intra-oral piercing and from an ethical standpoint, all dental professionals should dis-courage oral piercing because of these risks. Most dental professionals are well aware of the common long term risks of intra-oral body jew-ellery, such as damaging teeth on tongue barbells while eating, sleeping, talking or chewing. Certain problems such as speech impairment from oral jew-ellery 1 and swallowed jewellery 2 are obvious complications. Thus the emphasis herein will be on the broader list of less obvious but nevertheless doc-umented problems, summarized in Tables 1 and 2. It is doubtful whether such a comprehensive listing of complications is considered by every person contemplating undergoing or performing intra-oral piercing. In this author’s view, patients should be actively discouraged from having piercings involving the oral cavity, while patients with existing piercings should be informed of all the long term complications and encouraged strenuously to remove their intra-oral body jewellery and allow the hole to close. If patients will not do this, they should remove tongue bars every time before they eat, sleep or engage in strenuous physical activity. Missing the point: The risks of intra-oral piercin...|$|R
50|$|The Round Barn Theatre is a non-Equity {{regional}} theatre {{located in}} Nappanee, Indiana. It {{is part of}} Amish Acres, a historic farm and heritage resort. Amish Acres is owned by founders Richard and Susan Pletcher. Jennifer Wysong serves as president. The Pletchers are the producers of The Round Barn Theatre. The building is a round barn built in 1911 that was dismantled and relocated at the farm in 1998. It was moved twelve miles (19 km) from its original location. To meet state building codes a thirty-two ton six-inch (152 mm) tubular steel frame was erected and the original <b>studs,</b> compression <b>rings,</b> rafters, and cupola were reassembled attached to the frame. The barn is sixty feet in diameter and stands sixty feet tall {{to the top of}} the cupola. Insulation is sandwiched between new barn siding inside and outside the frame. A post and beam straw shed that was added to the structure shortly after its construction was also moved intact to become the proscenium stage for the theatre. Robert Holdeman, AIA, of Traverse City, Michigan designed the plans that converted the barn into a state of the art performing arts center. Ninety-six dimmer circuits provide theatre lighting and a sound system using Audiotechnica cordless microphones provide the required tools for the lighting and sound designers. The stage is outfitted with a counterweight fly system. The orchestra is housed in a loft open to the audience. The seating capacity in the orchestra, mezzanine, and balcony is four hundred.|$|R
