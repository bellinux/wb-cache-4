50|$|<b>Skybase</b> is a 330 metre long {{command ship}} and the {{operational}} headquarters of Spectrum. It is permanently stationed above the clouds at 18,288 m. There are six main engines {{to keep the}} base positioned {{in the sky and}} a further ten engines designed to keep <b>Skybase</b> balanced. <b>Skybase</b> is home to the fleet of high-tech Spectrum vehicles, including the squadron of Falcon aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Skybase</b> Freedom and <b>Skybase</b> Courage {{were two}} smaller bases. Both {{were able to}} connect to the Justice. The two bases were of similar design, and their toys shared almost all of their parts, albeit recolored.|$|E
50|$|Varan {{is by now}} {{becoming}} a Mutt himself. He hides this fact and leads a Solonian attack on the <b>Skybase</b> which results in his death and those {{of many of his}} warriors. On <b>Skybase</b> Jo, Ky, Stubbs and Cotton are captured by the Marshal, and Stubbs is killed in a failed escape attempt. The Doctor meanwhile has returned to the <b>Skybase</b> - without Sondergaard, who seems too weak following the radiation contamination. He instead returns to the caves to communicate with the Mutants and explain to them their change is natural and not to be feared.|$|E
50|$|Falcon Interceptor (the Angel Interceptor in Anderson's earlier series): The five White Falcons of the Angel Squadron {{comprise}} the main force of <b>Skybase's</b> air power. The White Falcon is the Spectrum ATF or Advanced Tactical Fighter, piloted by the Angels. Each pilot has a designated craft, assigned to them, with her codename marking the fuselage. The same codename also {{appears on the}} front of each Angel's helmet. An ultimate all-around attack aircraft, the Falcon is a high-speed fighter plane powered by two of Halo pulsejets, with multi-step afterburners. State-of-the art designed wing-tip geometry and variable multi-plane flaps make the Falcon a supersonic strike fighter with high speed and agility, that can outmanoeuvre any other known fighter plane. Because of the incredible forces generated by the supersonic speeds and turning ability of the Falcon, the Angel pilots need to wear specifically designed and fitted G-suits for their protection against G-forces in flight. Armament {{comes in the form of}} twin 30 mm Tempest cannons, front and rear, firing titanium-tipped ammunition. Stowed within the main fuselage of the Falcon, a variety of air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles can be fired through internal tubes at any target. In the case of an emergency, the front portion of the plane, including the front canard wings, can disengage from the main body and become a self-powered escape pod. In the unlikely event of this pod failing or being damaged, there is still an ejector seat.|$|R
50|$|In the computer-animated remake series Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet (2005), Cloudbase is re-imagined as <b>Skybase.</b> The updated headquarters, now {{situated}} at 60,000 ft, resembles the original Cloudbase both in appearance and function. Robotic deckhands are stationed on Skybase's flight deck {{to assist in}} the take-off and landing of aircraft. <b>Skybase</b> is protected by a fleet of Falcon Interceptors (updated Angel aircraft) and, in addition to the facilities featured previously, is now also equipped with squash courts.|$|E
5000|$|Chief Engineer: Featured in Episode [...] "Swarm" [...] and is {{posted in}} central control in <b>Skybase.</b> As a {{possible}} nod to Montgomery Scott from the Star Trek franchise, {{he has a}} Scottish accent.|$|E
50|$|The Falcons {{are handled}} on <b>Skybase</b> using a unique {{magnetic}} control system. After {{landing on the}} magna-strip runway, a circular lift lowers the plane into the hangar. Robotic arms automatically re-fuel, and re-arm guns and missiles. Using this system means that the Falcons are always action ready.|$|E
50|$|Doctor Gold (Dr Mason Frost): Main {{doctor on}} board <b>Skybase.</b> He was shown {{constantly}} throughout the series to have terrible bedside manners. Gold has grey {{hair and blue}} eyes, and wears glasses. His wife, Ula, is a veterinarian, and his daughter, Hattie, is a cosmetic dentistry scientist. Voiced by Nigel Plaskitt.|$|E
5000|$|Albatross SDC: Amongst Spectrum's {{fleet of}} various craft, the Albatross is unique. <b>Skybase</b> carries {{two of these}} massive VTOL Deployment Aircraft, which are used to carry {{vehicles}} - mainly a Rhino - anywhere it is needed around the world. It can carry the heaviest weight, putting it down or picking it up on any ground, and in almost any conditions. The deployment system of the Albatross is unique. The cargo doors under {{the belly of the}} craft open, and unfold to form the landing feet. Then, the vehicle it carries is lowered by a lift from the Albatross' cargo, just as it finishes its landing procedure and approach. The Rhino can be deployed at the same second the Albatross makes its landing, and once it is out, the craft can take off immediately. This 'drop-and-go' deployment, helped by the SlyFOXX anti-detection shielding with which the Albatross is equipped, makes the aircraft perfect for covert operations. However, due to its massiveness, it could attract visual attention, and therefore, the sturdy craft has been equipped with anti-missile Acoustic Disruptors - which makes it a hard target to hit, despite his size. While so massive, the Albatross nevertheless has remarkable swiftness in flight. Powerful pivoting twin multi-directional XBurn engines, set {{on each side of the}} craft, give it lifting capability, maneuverability, and in-flight velocity, even while carrying the heaviest of loads. Also unique is the launching method with which the Albatross is launched from <b>Skybase.</b> Set in its hangar over an airlock, the Albatross is held in place by clamps attached to its nose. During launch sequence, the airlock doors open, and the pilot powers up the thrusters. Once ready for launched, the pilot releases the clamps, and the Albatross drops several meters from underneath <b>Skybase,</b> before the thrust of the engines stops its fall and it finally leaves <b>Skybase</b> to carry on its mission.|$|E
50|$|Cloudbase is {{the fictional}} skyborne {{headquarters}} of the international security organisation Spectrum, from Gerry Anderson's science-fiction television series Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons (1967-68). In the 2005 computer-animated remake, Cloudbase is re-imagined as <b>Skybase.</b> In both series, the base's design is that of an airborne aircraft carrier, stationed in either Earth's high troposphere (1960s series) or low stratosphere (2005 series).|$|E
5000|$|Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet: Spectrum owns a {{fleet of}} red sports cars (Cheetah RRV), which can extend wings, fire a {{thruster}} and either jump over obstacles in its path or fly. Moreover, Spectrum owns a flying motorcycle design (Skyrider, which does not have wheels) and a motor-tricycle design (Stallion Raid Bike). The latter has wings, {{so it can be}} launched from <b>Skybase.</b>|$|E
50|$|He is {{a former}} Royal Marine and SIS agent. He was {{recruited}} to the SIS from the Marines and reached the position of director. He subsequently {{moved on to the}} UN Security Development Committee, which in turn created Spectrum. In contrast to his depiction in the original series, he is frequently seen away from his desk and to move around <b>skybase,</b> often pursuing an interest in chess, fishing and fencing.|$|E
50|$|In the computer-animated remake series Gerry Anderson's New Captain Scarlet (2005), the {{successor}} to the SPV is the Spectrum Rhino. The Rhino is more heavily armed than the SPV, and unlike the original is incapable of travelling on water. Instead of being hidden in safehouses, it is deployed from <b>Skybase</b> via Albatross dropships. The driver of the Rhino adopts a normal driving position, in contrast with his predecessor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Skybase</b> is, essentially, an {{improved}} {{version of the}} original Cloudbase, carrying {{a wide variety of}} vehicles and weapons on board, and housing Spectrum officers. A notable addition is that, on the flight deck, the Angels use a robot (Nicknamed 'F.R.E.D.'), that is controlled through telepresence by a Landing signal officer, who operates inside the base for safety purposes. The officer gives the traditional hand signals to the pilots, such as the order to launch.|$|E
5000|$|The CGI <b>Skybase</b> was {{realised}} using LightWave 3D software {{under the}} supervision of Ron Thornton, co-founder of animation studio Foundation Imaging (whose commissions included the Star Trek TV series and films). The large computer model, which at three million polygons (described by Thornton as [...] "way over the top") was originally {{three times the size of}} Foundation's model of Enterprise NX-01 for Star Trek: Enterprise, could not be rendered in one step.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2068, peace on Earth is {{maintained}} by the Spectrum Organization, a super-efficient security group, headquartered in the vast floating aircraft carrier <b>Skybase,</b> which hovers {{on the edge of}} Earth's atmosphere. Spectrum is manned by agents recruited from various military services, who are each assigned colour codenames to hide their true identities. Under the command of Colonel White, Spectrum has become the supreme peace-keeping force, maintaining a fleet of sophisticated vehicles for use by Spectrum field agents.|$|E
5000|$|The Doctor is {{now back}} on <b>Skybase</b> and surmises the Marshal to be mad. It {{becomes clear that}} the Earth Government has now {{dispatched}} an Investigator {{to look into the}} strange events on Solos. The Marshal's rocket attacks have not terraformed the planet, but they have left a hideous environmental impact and he knows he must clean this up or face problems when the Investigator arrives. Under duress (the Marshal has taken Jo prisoner) the Doctor uses Jaeger's technology to conduct a rapid decontamination of the planet's surface. The Investigator arrives and demands answers, but is given more lies by the Marshal, supported by the Doctor. Luckily Jo, Ky and Cotton have escaped their detention and arrive in time to help the Investigator see the truth of the situation on Solos and the crimes of the Marshal and Jaeger. The Doctor accuses them of [...] "the most brutal and callous series of crimes against a defenceless people it's ever been my misfortunate to encounter." [...] Sondergaard now reaches the <b>Skybase</b> with some Mutants, one of whom scares the Investigator enough that he accepts the Marshal's analysis that the creatures should be killed.|$|E
50|$|In the remake series, Green (born Serena Lewis) is re-imagined as a 27-year-old, female, African-American officer, {{originally}} from Texas. She remains confined to <b>Skybase</b> (the new series' Cloudbase), but her desk is smaller and her computer uses holographic technology. She is knowledgeable about {{all aspects of}} Spectrum, and {{used to work for}} the United Nations. Green is attracted to Captain Blue. At the end of the episode 'Proteus', she is offered a promotion to the rank of captain but elects to remain a lieutenant.|$|E
5000|$|Varan by now has {{discovered}} the Marshal's treachery but events make him an outlaw on <b>Skybase.</b> The Doctor makes contact {{and together they}} persuade Stubbs and Cotton, the most senior soldiers to the Marshal that much is wrong on <b>Skybase.</b> He then flees to Solos with Varan, and at the thaesium mine where Ky and Jo are hiding he encounters many Mutts, who are not as hostile as they first appeared. The Doctor passes the message box to Ky, and it opens to reveal ancient tablets and etchings which are written {{in the language of}} the Old Ones of the planet. Help in avoiding poisonous gas released by the Marshal is provided by a fugitive human scientist, Sondergaard, who lives in the caves and knows much about Solonian anthropology. Sondergaard explains he tried to inform Earth Control about the Marshal's evil, but he was prevented and forced to flee to the caves, where the radiation seems to have affected him. He interprets the contents of the box as a [...] "lost Solos Book of Genesis", and the Doctor then calculates a Solonian year to be equivalent to two thousand human years, with natural changes in the population every five hundred years within the cycle. Investigating a more radioactive part of the caves, the Doctor thus deduces the Mutant phase is a natural part of the Solonian life-cycle.|$|E
50|$|The Mysterons primary Earth {{agent is}} Captain Black, recreated {{from the body}} of the {{original}} Spectrum agent. Captain Scarlet was also engineered to become an agent of destruction, but the Mysterons' hold over him was broken after he fell through a power conduit in the <b>Skybase</b> engineering section. Retaining the original man's memories, personality and loyalties, the new Captain Scarlet also retains the Mysteron ability to survive injuries that would prove fatal to any other person. Spectrum's personnel and facilities are now mainly mobilised to combat the threat of the Mysterons, with Captain Scarlet as their greatest weapon.|$|E
50|$|Stallion Raid Bike: The Stallion is Spectrum's {{high-speed}} attack bike. With its pressurised canopy {{and wings}} {{it can be}} launched from <b>Skybase.</b> After leaving the runway, the Raid Bike freefalls, before deploying its wings in stages to glide. As the bike touches the ground, the canopy and wings disengage, the twin rear wheels grip the road and it blasts away. The rear wheels tilt independently of the body, keeping traction on the road. Extra stability is provided at high speed with front winglets. The Stallion Raid Bike is armed with two front mounted machine guns and two racks of missiles.|$|E
50|$|The Doctor and Jo {{arrive on}} <b>Skybase</b> One, their TARDIS having been transported {{there by the}} Time Lords. They have with them a message box which will only open for an {{intended}} recipient - {{and that is not}} the Marshal or his entourage - but seems to be for Ky, who has been framed for the murder of the Administrator. Jo and Ky flee to the surface of Solos, which is poisonous to humans during daylight hours. This quickly affects Jo, but she survives with Ky's help. The Doctor learns from the Marshal and his chief scientist Jaeger that they are involved in an experiment using rocket barrages to terraform Solos, making the air breathable for humans, regardless of the cost to indigenous life.|$|E
50|$|Like Power Rangers, VR Troopers used a {{combination}} of American footage spliced with fight scenes from Japanese shows. The Japanese shows adapted in to VR Troopers are Space Sheriff Shaider, Dimensional Warrior Spielban, and Choujinki Metalder. All three come from Toei's Metal Hero Series. Choujinki Metalder provided footage of Ryan Steele's season one robotic suit, Grimlord, the Virtual Dungeon, Grimlord's four lieutenants, Dark Heart, and the military-type robots that are featured in several episodes. Dimensional Warrior Spielban provided footage of J.B.'s and Kaitlin's robotic suits, Ivar, Icebot, skugs, and the battle scenes involving the <b>Skybase,</b> shark cruisers, tanks, and fighter jets. Space Sheriff Shaider provided the new footage for season two, including Ryan Steele's season two robotic suit and the ultra-skugs.|$|E
5000|$|The Mysterons rebuilt Scarlet as an invincible human replica to {{infiltrate}} Earth and lead their {{war against the}} planet. While {{under the control of}} the Mysterons, Scarlet tried to destroy <b>Skybase,</b> but was stopped in his efforts by Captain Blue. Falling down through a plasma stream, Scarlet was killed, but recovered later on in Sickbay, under the astonished eyes of Doctor Gold and other onlookers, and revealed himself to be fully free of the Mysterons' control. Metcalfe's human psyche had survived and regained control of his physical body. Instead of being killed by the power surge, Scarlet was only harmed temporarily, and was restored to life by the genetic mutation of the Mysteron [...] "retrometabolisation" [...] process which makes him virtually [...] "indestructible".|$|E
5000|$|In the 30th century, the Earth Empire is {{contracting}} {{and plans}} {{are being made}} to decolonise the colony world of Solos. The militaristic Marshal and other human soldiers, known as Overlords, rule it from <b>Skybase</b> One, an orbiting space station. The Marshal opposes the decolonisation plans outlined to him by an Administrator sent from Earth, and is also obsessed with eradicating the Mutants or [...] "Mutts" [...] {{that have sprung up}} on the planet below. The Solonians themselves are a tribal people, split between those who actively oppose the occupation, such as Ky, and those like Varan who collaborate with the imperialists. Indeed, the Marshal and Varan ensure the Administrator is murdered before he can confirm to Ky and other tribal chiefs that the Earth Empire is indeed withdrawing from Solos.|$|E
50|$|Cheetah RRV (the SSC in Anderson's earlier series): The Cheetah is a rapid {{response}} vehicle. It can travel on its four wheels, but this car also features concealed wings and a tail fin {{that emerges from}} the boot (US: trunk). When powered by the jump jets in its wings and booster jets in the rear, the Cheetah is able to glide over obstructions with ease. In any mode the Cheetah, like its animal namesake, is capable of extremely rapid acceleration and deadly speed. It has a machine gun concealed inside the front grill, and also possesses star deflectors, which are used to repel missiles. In the first series, these wings were only ever used for landings from <b>Skybase</b> or flying jumps. Only in the second series was the Cheetah shown {{to be able to}} take off from the ground under its own power.|$|E
50|$|Mondo's {{history is}} {{outlined}} to the Rangers by their mentor, Zordon. He broke {{off from the}} United Alliance of Evil. At the time Zeo begins, Mondo has conquered dozens of star systems, {{to the point where}} Earth's solar system has become the last hope of curbing his assault. Whenever Mondo conquers a planet, he strips its natural resources, processes them into soldiers for his empire, and moves on to the next planet. Setting his sights on Earth from his colossal <b>Skybase,</b> Mondo surrounds himself with his family: his wife Machina and son Sprocket. Despite his violent tendencies and short temper, Mondo shows himself to be a caring, if pampering, family man, often taking the advice of his family over that of his much more intelligent butlers, Klank and Orbus. Though he considers them primitive, Mondo is shown to be fascinated with mundane human activities, and many of his early schemes involve turning small problems in the Rangers' personal lives into life-threatening situations through use of his Machine Beasts.|$|E
5000|$|The show {{focused on}} three young adults {{in their late}} teens, Ryan Steele, Kaitlin Star, and J.B. Reese, living in the fictional West Coast town of Cross World City, California. They {{regularly}} attended and were teachers at [...] "Tao's Dojo", a karate studio. Ryan was the most focused martial artist; J.B. was the computer wizard; while Kaitlin was a photographer & budding reporter for the local newspaper, the Underground Voice Daily. One day, Ryan's search for his long-missing father led him and his two friends to a strange laboratory. Inside, a digitized head of Professor Horatio Hart, a friend of Ryan's father, Tyler, explained the truth about his life's work of having developed extremely advanced virtual reality technology in secret. [...] "VR" [...] is a dimension existing alongside our own; within it lie mutants bent on conquering both worlds. The main ruler of these is a creature known as Grimlord, who, unbeknownst to anyone on Earth, has a human identity as billionaire industrialist Karl Ziktor. As Karl Ziktor tries to overcome the barriers of the true reality to allow his armies easy passage from virtual world, the responsibility falls to Ryan, Kaitlin, and J.B. of defending the planet {{on both sides of}} the dimensional barrier. They have assistance in the form of armored bodies having incredible firepower. This included eventual additions to their arsenal, such as a Turbo Cycle, Techno Bazooka, VR Troopertron, VR Shoulder Cannon, VR Battlecruiser/Interceptop and a flying, laser-blasting <b>Skybase.</b>|$|E
