They are published in five clusters; engineering; biomedicine; the natural sciences; the social sciences; and the arts and humanities, and covered 42 subjects in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Access {{to public}} higher {{education}} institutions is subject to enrollment restrictions (numerus clausus), and students must compete for admission. Students who hold a diploma of secondary education (12th grade) or the equivalent, who meet all legal requirements, particularly exams in <b>specific</b> <b>subjects</b> in which minimum marks must be obtained, may apply. Any citizen over 23 years old {{who does not have}} the secondary education diploma (12th grade) can attempt to gain admission to a limited number of vacant places available, through special examination which includes an interview (Decree law: Decreto-Lei 64/2006, de 21 de Março). Public university's tuition fees are greater than polytechnics', and polytechnic weekend and evening classes are usually organized. For a large number of academic fields, undergraduate and graduate admission criteria and student evaluation in most public university institutions are usually more selective and demanding than in many private institutions or polytechnic institutions. Access to private {{higher education institutions}} is regulated by each institution.|$|E
25|$|Bacon {{has been}} called the father of empiricism. His works argued for the {{possibility}} of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, he argued this could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves. While his own practical ideas about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of scientific method. This marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, the practical details of which are still central in debates about science and methodology today. In addition to his work in the sciences, Bacon was also a venerable patron of libraries and developed a functional system for the cataloging of books by dividing them into three categories- history, poesy, and philosophy- which could further be divided into more <b>specific</b> <b>subjects</b> and subheadings.|$|E
25|$|The Parliamentary Assembly (PACE), which {{comprises}} national parliamentarians {{from all}} member states. It elects its President {{for a year}} {{with the possibility of}} being re-elected for another year. In January 2016, Pedro Agramunt from Spain was elected President of the Parliamentary Assembly. In 2017, October 6 Stella Kyriakides from Cyprus has been elected President of the PACE following the resignation of Pedro Agramunt.  She will remain in office until the opening of the next ordinary session in January, 2018. National parliamentary delegations to the Assembly must reflect the political spectrum of their national parliament, i.e. comprise government and opposition parties. The Assembly appoints members as rapporteurs with the mandate to prepare parliamentary reports on <b>specific</b> <b>subjects.</b> The British MP Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe was rapporteur for the drafting of the European Convention on Human Rights. Dick Marty's reports on secret CIA detentions and rendition flights in Europe became quite famous in 2006 and 2007. Other Assembly reports were instrumental in, for example, the abolition of the death penalty in Europe, highlighting the political and human rights situation in Chechnya, identifying who was responsible for disappeared persons in Belarus, chronicling threats to freedom of expression in the media and many other subjects.|$|E

The virtual human body synthesis method will follow the same mechanism as face dose. As we know, faces are characterized by their shapes and their textures, By using a frontal and profile images of a <b>specific</b> <b>subject,</b> a deformation technique allows interactive alignment of features in the 3 -D general graphic face model with the features of the pre-provided images of the <b>specific</b> <b>subject.</b> The deformation result is a 3 -D face model of the specific human face.
