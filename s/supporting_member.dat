25|$|The KKB then {{experienced}} a tremendous growth: {{as an independent}} organization, {{they were able to}} ask for financial support from a greater variety of institutions; furthermore, many members and patrons contributed to the improved financial situation, allowing them, for example, to hire more qualified teachers. Public relations were enormously strengthened and improved, and the choir got a logo by holding a public competition. In the summer of 1973, their first concert tour took place in the Bernese Oberland and their first record, a collection of choral and organ works by Felix Mendelssohn, was made. In 1974, a tour of the Netherlands followed {{with the help of the}} organist Hans Peter Aeschlimann, and the KKB became a <b>supporting</b> <b>member</b> of the Gesellschaft für das Gute und Gemeinnützige Basel ("Society for a Good and Charitable Basel"). Their first television appearances took place in 1975 and 1976 on Südwestrundfunk.|$|E

An infrared detector element is mounted on the <b>support</b> <b>member</b> and a temperature signal representative of the infrared energy contacting the <b>support</b> <b>member</b> can then be derived by comparing {{the temperature of the}} <b>support</b> <b>member</b> and the heat sink. The temperature signal from a <b>support</b> <b>member</b> and a temperature signal from the connection <b>support</b> <b>member</b> can then be used to drive a heater unit mounted on the connection <b>support</b> <b>member</b> to thereby control the thermal conductance of the <b>support</b> <b>member.</b> Thus, the thermal conductance can be controlled {{so that it can be}} actively increased or decreased as desired...|$|R

A second end cap is pivotally connected to the first and second <b>support</b> <b>members</b> at the second ends opposite the first ends. The second end cap has a threaded sleeve configured to engage a portion of the jackscrew. Rotation of the jackscrew into the threaded sleeve causes the first and second <b>support</b> <b>members</b> to extend outwardly from a collapsed condition to a deployed condition...|$|R

50|$|In initial {{candidate}} debates, few {{differences in}} policy emerged. Instead the differences manifested in political outlook. Miller, <b>supported</b> by 27 <b>members</b> of caucus, {{was viewed as}} the candidate of small town conservatism. Grossman, with 10 <b>supporting</b> <b>members</b> was the candidate of high-powered urbanity. Timbrell with 18 <b>supporting</b> <b>members</b> was seen more {{along the lines of}} the previous leader, aping Davis's pragmatic blandness. McMurtry coming in last with 8 <b>supporting</b> <b>members</b> tried to portray a populist image with links to ethnic communities.|$|R
50|$|Another {{part of the}} puzzles {{involves}} the choice of which <b>support</b> <b>member</b> to take along. <b>Support</b> <b>members</b> don't just affect Latok's combat statistics, but some points in the game can only be passed with the right <b>support</b> <b>member</b> tagging along. There are even items in the game that Latok cannot use himself, but the right supportmember can. As an example, Latok finds a magical scroll with a lightning spell inscribed, but doesn't master enough magic to cast them himself. On a certain {{part of the first}} floor, there is a seemingly impassable wall of rubble. When Fray is selected as a <b>support</b> <b>member,</b> she will snatch the lightning scroll from Latok and use it to blast a path through the rubble.|$|R
