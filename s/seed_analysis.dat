Lake Shinji was more transparent prior {{to the beginning of}} herbicide use for rice weed control in the mid- 1950 s, because its bottom was covered by SAV up to 3 m depth. Although Chara braunii C.

40|$|Introduction: Functional {{connectivity}} (FC) {{studies have}} gained immense {{popularity in the}} evaluation of several neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). AD is a complex disorder, characterised by several pathological features. The problem with FC studies in patients {{is that it is not}} straightforward to focus on a specific aspect of pathology. In the current study, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is applied in a mouse model of amyloidosis to assess the effects of amyloid pathology on FC in the mouse brain. Methods: Nine APP/PS 1 transgenic and nine wild-type mice (average age 18. 9 months) were imaged on a 7 T MRI system. The mice were anesthetized with medetomidine and rsfMRI data were acquired using a gradient echo EPI sequence. The data were analysed using a whole brain seed correlation analysis and interhemispheric FC was evaluated using a pairwise <b>seed</b> <b>analysis.</b> Qualitative histological analyses were performed to assess amyloid pathology, inflammation and synaptic deficits. Results: The whole brain <b>seed</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed an overall decrease in FC in the brains of transgenic mice compared to wild-type mice. The results showed that interhemispheric FC was relatively preserved in the motor cortex of the transgenic mice, but decreased in the somatosensory cortex and the hippocampus when compared to the wild-type mice. The pairwise <b>seed</b> <b>analysis</b> confirmed these results. Histological analyses confirmed the presence of amyloid pathology, inflammation and synaptic deficits in the transgenic mice. Conclusions: In the current study, rsfMRI demonstrated decreased FC in APP/PS 1 transgenic mice compared to wild-type mice in several brain regions. The APP/PS 1 transgenic mice had advanced amyloid pathology across the brain, as well as inflammation and synaptic deficits surrounding the amyloid plaques. Future studies should longitudinally evaluate APP/PS 1 transgenic mice and correlate the rsfMRI findings to specific stages of amyloid pathology...|$|E

Therefore, {{the aim of}} the present study was to evaluate different temperatures and substrates to perform the germination test of S. tenuifolia seeds. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial 4 × 3 design and consisted of four substrates (paper roll; on paper; on sand and on vermiculite) and three temperatures (25, 30 and 35 °C), with four replicates of 25 seeds. The percentage of normal seedlings, the germination speed index, the shoot length, root length and dry mass of seedlings were evaluated. The Tukey test was used at 5 % probability. There was a significant interaction between the temperatures and substrates tested for all variables, indicating that there is at least one ideal combination of the two factors that can increase the germination of seeds. The germination and vigor of S. tenuifolia seeds are influenced by the temperature and by the substrate used in the germination test.
