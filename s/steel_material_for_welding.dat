40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{possibilities of}} using welding techniques {{as a means}} of protection from corrosion of <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> <b>welding</b> structuresoperating in power engineering industry, chemical industry and shipbuilding. Based on the example of an LNG installation, the potentials of weld overlaying in anti-corrosive protection of parts operating in LNG installations have been described. The weld overlaying technique enables building up of protective coatings, which not only protect material from corrosion resulting from the flow of more or less aggressive medium (e. g. water, exhaust gas) but also increase the performance life of thus “coated” elements due to the improved abrasion wear resistance of weld overlays. The weld overlaying process is equally well suitable in building of new structures as in the repair of damaged or worn out elements of water or power feeding installations...|$|R

40|$|We use <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> <b>for</b> a car, an {{industrial}} machine, a building and so on. The <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> are used <b>for</b> the main {{parts of the}} machine. The <b>steel</b> <b>materials</b> have good mechanical characteristics, however, higher mechanical characteristics by special treatment are often demanded. In this case, some evaluation methods are also required to monitor and control the mechanical characteristics of <b>steel</b> <b>materials.</b> Normally, mechanical destructive testing {{is used for the}} evaluation of them, however, all products on line cannot be evaluated because destructing samples are needed by mechanical testing. Therefore, non-destructive evaluation by electromagnetic method is focused on in this paper. We have developed a non-destructive evaluation for hardening steel named as a frequency sweep excitation and spectrogram (FSES) method [1]. This proposed method can evaluate mechanical characteristics non-destructively by using several frequency components of magnetic flux depending on hardening conditions [1]. Figure 1 shows the measured magnetic coercive force Hc and maximum magnetic field strength Hmax. The sample were hardened by induction heating with the current of 80 [A]. As shown in Figure 1, in the 8 - 12 [mm] and 16 - 22 [mm] sections, the spectrogram of the maximum magnetic field strength Hmax was changed locally in comparison of the one of the magnetic coercive force Hc.

40|$|Welding {{of metal}} {{materials}} belongs to non-demountable joints. Current trend especially in an automotive industry is to join materials {{with a different}} melting temperature. Most of all, there are dural profiles with ferrite or austenite steel. The {{reason for this is}} the effort to lower the weight of the whole construction {{and at the same time}} preserve sufficient mechanical characteristics. However, there is a big risk of different electrical potentials of both of these metals in this type of non-demountable joints. The experimental part of this paper brings evaluation of mechanical-corrosion processes of overlapped joints produced by the CMT (cold metal transfer) method. The base <b>material</b> <b>for</b> <b>weld</b> bead is dural sheet AlMg 3 and dural sheet with a surface treatment aluzinc DX 51 D+AZ 150.

The central shaft is generally made of lattice steel structure, and the guys are spaced at equal angles around the mast to ensure the vertical shaft’s stability. By taking a 102 m meteorological guyed tower in Hainan as an example, this paper made two design proposals using steel pipe and round <b>steel</b> <b>material</b> <b>for</b> the shaft respectively. According {{to the requirements of}} the project, this paper then did non-linear static analysis and buckling analysis of the structure by finite element software SAP 2000, and compared the results of the two proposals so as to find the optimal one. The results show that <b>steel</b> pipe <b>material</b> is more economical when used for the mast shaft and more reasonable for bearing forces. The choice of the number and the initial tension of guys, as well as the wind vibration coefficient, which have a great effect on a guyed mast, are also discussed in this paper...|$|R
