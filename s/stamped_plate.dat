50|$|Subsequently {{the model}} Sport was launched, that coexist with the {{previous}} (known since Turismo), with the same engine and cylinder capacity. The Sport model was the first which had a T-shape <b>stamped</b> <b>plate</b> chassis that would become characteristic of the brand, with a seat upholstery in two colors and a rounded fuel tank, {{as well as a}} painted exhaust pipe, unlike the general trend which was chromed. This model was distributed in color schemes of blue and gray or red and cream. Both models had a luxury option called Lujo, externally differentiated because the swingarm was tubular instead of stamped sheet metal, also had a different logo than the usual in the crankcases.|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the suitability of}} thin film, single and multi-layered coatings, by a Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) process for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell bipolar plates. Due to the multifunctional nature of this particular component a comprehensive approach was used where several key properties were examined for coatings including: ZrN, TiN, CrN, Graphit-iC™, CrN+C, TiN+C and Au. Chemical etching and surface roughness were found to influence the Interfacial Contact Resistance (ICR) of the substrate; however, any observed effect was negated {{with the addition of}} a conductive coating. CrN+C and TiN+C multi-layer coatings showed a striking reduction in the ICR compared with the nitride only equivalents. The suitability of pre-coated PVD coatings for serial production via stamping was assessed in collaboration with an industrial partner. The coating durability was found to be influenced by several factors including coating type, thicknesses and position on <b>stamped</b> <b>plate.</b> The multi-layered TiN+C coating was found to noticeably improve the stampability compared to the TiN only coating. The corrosion resistance of the coatings was evaluated under simplified corrosion conditions. Under these conditions TiN+C was found to have two beneficial effects, improving the free corrosion potential and the stability of the carbon topcoat under startup/shutdown potentials. ...|$|E

Existence of three bays in the side walls was determined, while existence of arch-like robbers’ passages in virgin soil along the lengthwise walls of the catacomb was not confirmed. Rare finds by their composition in general agree with the finds from excavations in the 19 th c.; however several new types of <b>stamped</b> <b>plates</b> and beads were discovered. Also, the research of traces of funeral feast near the barrow was continued. On the territory of about 300 m 2 in the south-western section of the barrow animal bones, several amphorae fragments, and two heaps of rocks were found.

50|$|The {{idea was}} refined by De La Rue in 1879 when the {{printing}} process was {{split into two}} {{through the use of}} a key plate (or head plate) for the bulk of the design and a separate duty plate for the name of the colony and the value. These are often known as key <b>plate</b> <b>stamps.</b> While key type stamps are always of one colour, key <b>plate</b> <b>stamps</b> are bi-coloured. This method has the advantage that most of the design remains the same in each of a stamp series with only the value, name and colours changing.|$|R

After experimentation both machines proved to be failures. From one machine a few <b>stamps</b> from <b>Plates</b> 70 and 71 have survived.

30|$|The bipolar {{plate is}} among the most expensive, {{heaviest}} and voluminous components in the fuel cell stack. The bipolar plates conduct current between cells, provide flow channels for reactants and products, facilitate water and thermal management and constitute the structural backbone of a fuel cell stack. The materials for bipolar plates need to have high electric and thermal conductivity, good corrosion resistance and mechanical strength. Replacing bulky, brittle machined graphite plates by thin, durable <b>stamped</b> metal <b>plates</b> is particularly desirable for portable and mobile applications where lower bulk, fragility and cost are all needed.|$|R
