25|$|While {{consumption}} of {{small amounts of}} <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> is common in diets, meta-analyses found a significant correlation between high {{consumption of}} <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and blood LDL concentration, {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular diseases.

50|$|Not all <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> have equally cholesterolemic effects. Studies have {{indicated}} that consumption of palm olein (which is more unsaturated) reduces blood cholesterol when compared to sources of <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> like coconut oil, dairy and animal fats.|$|R
50|$|Mary Gertrude Enig (née Dracon; July 13, 1931 - September 8, 2014) was a {{nutritionist}} and researcher {{known for her}} unconventional positions on the role <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> play in diet and health. She promoted skepticism towards the widely held view in the scientific and medical communities that diets high in <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> can contribute to development of heart disease, while she advocated for a diet based on whole foods and rich in certain <b>saturated</b> <b>fats.</b>|$|R

25|$|Various fats contain {{different}} {{proportions of}} saturated and unsaturated fat. Examples of foods containing {{a high proportion}} of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> include animal fat products such as cream, cheese, butter, other whole milk dairy products and fatty meats which also contain dietary cholesterol. Certain vegetable products have high <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> content, such as coconut oil and palm kernel oil. Many prepared foods are high in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> content, such as pizza, dairy desserts, and sausage.|$|E
25|$|That {{study also}} {{suggests}} that fat and <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> are not likely contributors to pancreatic cancer. Animal fat, particularly from ruminants, tends {{to have a higher}} percentage of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> vs. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat when compared to vegetable fats, with the exception of some tropical plant fats; consumption of which has been correlated with various health problems. The <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> found in meat has been associated with significantly raised risks of colon cancer, although evidence suggests that risks of prostate cancer are unrelated to animal fat consumption.|$|E
40|$|<b>Saturated</b> <b>fats</b> {{have been}} {{in the line of fire}} for more than three decades. The major mistake in {{understanding}} fats was to equate all saturated fatty acids as one. The oversimplification of the relationship of <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> with cardiovascular disease (CVD) led to unwarranted removal of some valuable fats from our diets. Recently, the relationship of dietary <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and that of individual saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to CVD risk has been reevaluated. All <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> are not equal and these fats are not as bad as they are made out to be. Thus, not all SFAs in natural fats are atherogenic (formation of fatty deposits in arteries). Butter, clarified butter (desi ghee), coconut oil, and palm oil as a part of a healthy diet are not contraindicated.

25|$|Cholesterol ratio: This ratio {{compares the}} levels of LDL to HDL. Trans fat behaves like <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> by raising the level of LDL, but, unlike <b>saturated</b> <b>fat,</b> it has the {{additional}} effect of decreasing levels of HDL. The net increase in LDL/HDL ratio with trans fat is approximately double that due to <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> (Higher ratios are worse.) One randomized crossover study published in 2003 comparing the effect of eating a meal on blood lipids of (relatively) cis and trans fat rich meals showed that cholesteryl ester transfer (CET) was 28% higher after the trans meal than after the cis meal and that lipoprotein concentrations were enriched in apolipoprotein(a) after the trans meals.|$|E

Suggestions are offered for interventions designed to improve adherence to healthy eating recommendations for people diagnosed with these chronic conditions with a specific emphasis on the steps and activities that are required to promote a healthier lifestyle.
