In {{oil and gas}} exploration, salt {{is an important component}} of drilling fluids in well drilling. It is used to flocculate and increase the density of the drilling fluid to overcome high downwell gas pressures. Whenever a drill hits a <b>salt</b> <b>formation,</b> salt is added to the drilling fluid to saturate the solution in order to minimize the dissolution within the salt stratum. Salt is also used to increase the curing of concrete in cemented casings.|$|E
2500|$|In Sweden a {{new type}} of storage {{facility}} has been built, called [...] "lined rock cavern". This storage facility consists of installing a steel tank in a cavern in the rock of a hill and surrounding it with concrete. Although the development cost of such facility is quite expensive, its ability to cycle gas multiple times compensates for it, similar to <b>salt</b> <b>formation</b> facilities.|$|E
50|$|Since these <b>salt</b> <b>formations</b> {{have a wide}} lateral extent, {{increased}} difficulty {{has been}} experienced in all phases of exploration.

Additionally, drilling costs through the <b>salt</b> <b>formations</b> to reach the underlying rocks serving as potential reservoirs has decreased the economic viability of wells in the region.|$|R

CH TRUW does not have the very high radioactivity of high-level waste, nor its high heat generation, but RH TRUW can be highly radioactive, with surface dose rates up to 1,000,000 mrem/h (10,000mSv/h).

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that Eq. (17) is an {{empirical}} equation only for <b>salt</b> <b>formations.</b> If inclusions of rocks exist in <b>salt</b> <b>formations</b> (e.g., in <b>salt</b> sutures), the fracture gradient should be lower and depend on the fracture gradient in the rocks.

In the subsalt formations, Eaton’s method underestimates the fracture gradient based on the measured data, but the proposed fracture gradient with a depth-dependent k 0 [Eq. (16)] has a better estimate on the fracture gradient.|$|R

50|$|Derivatization of racemic {{compounds}} {{is possible}} with optically pure reagents forming pairs of diastereomers {{which can be}} separated by conventional techniques in physical chemistry. Derivatization is possible by <b>salt</b> <b>formation</b> between an amine and a carboxylic acid. Simple deprotonation affords the pure enantiomer. Examples of chiral derivatizing agents (a.k.a. chiral resolving agents) are tartaric acid and brucine.

50|$|The other isomer, 2-quinuclidone, appears equally uneventful, {{but in fact}} it has defied {{synthesis}} until 2006. The {{reason is}} that this molecule is very unstable because its amide group has the amine lone pair and the carbonyl group not properly aligned, as may be expected for an amide, as a result of steric strain. This behaviour is predicted by Bredt's Rule, and formal amide group resembles in fact an amine, as evidenced by the ease of <b>salt</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{fracture}} gradient is {{a critical}} parameter for drilling mud weight design in the energy industry. A new method in fracture gradient prediction is proposed based on analyzing worldwide leak-off test (LOT) data in offshore drilling. Current fracture gradient prediction methods are also reviewed and compared to the proposed method. We analyze more than 200 LOT data in several offshore petroleum basins and find that the fracture gradient depends {{not only on the}} overburden stress and pore pressure, but also on the depth. The data indicate that the effective stress coefficient is higher at a shallower depth than that at a deeper depth in the shale formations. Based on this finding, a depth-dependent effective stress coefficient is proposed and applied for fracture gradient prediction. In some petroleum basins, many wells need to be drilled through long sections of <b>salt</b> <b>formations</b> to reach hydrocarbon reservoirs. The fracture gradient in <b>salt</b> <b>formations</b> is very different from that in other sedimentary rocks. Leak-off test data in the <b>salt</b> <b>formations</b> are investigated, and a fracture gradient prediction method is proposed. Case applications are examined to compare different fracture gradient methods and validate the proposed methods. The reasons why the LOT value is higher than its overburden gradient are also explained.|$|R
