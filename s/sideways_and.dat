5|$|Until its {{acceptance}} by the National Trust, Belton House {{was always in}} the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> sometimes through the female line.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the game the Decepticon Soundwave hacks onto a satellite and finding a piece of Cybertronian technology on a NEST truck in Shanghai. <b>Sideways</b> <b>and</b> Demolishor are contacted to steal the technology. Optimus Prime is transported to near where the technology was stolen, where he confronts Devastator. Nearby Ironhide engages in battle with Demolishor. Elsewhere in the city, Bumblebee chases Sideways through the streets, who narrowly escapes with assistance from Starscream. Starscream and Sideways travel to the Laurentian Abyss, where the dead body of Megatron is being guarded by military forces. Starscream attacks the navy ships, giving Sideways an opportunity to retrieve the body. Megatron is then resurrected by The Fallen, becoming his servant.|$|E

5|$|Earnhardt, {{who began}} {{the race in}} thirty-second, had moved up ten {{positions}} to twenty-second by lap 22. Two laps later, Bowyer passed Montoya for second position. Scott Speed spun <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> collided with the wall four laps later, causing the first caution of the race. On lap 28, Robby Gordon moved into the lead for one lap, delaying his pit stop until lap 29. Once the race resumed, Bowyer regained the lead followed by McMurray in second. McMurray led the next lap, but Bowyer reclaimed the lead on lap 32. Three laps later, Kyle Busch, in seventh place, collided with the wall, but escaped with minor damage. A collision involving Ambrose and Menard occurred on lap 39 and prompted the second caution.|$|E
5|$|The drivers {{took the}} track at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up in wet weather, with lap times {{slower than the}} {{previous}} days' practice and qualifying sessions. Häkkinen maintained his good performance, setting a time of 2:03.392. Michael Schumacher was the second-fastest driver; Button was third, two-thousands of a second behind Schumacher. Barrichello completed the top four, three-tenths of a second behind Häkkinen. Giancarlo Fisichella struck the barriers heavily at turn 14 after spinning <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> was launched into the air, landing upside-down; the session was suspended while marshals cleared the track of debris. Fisichella sustained a bruised left knee, {{and was forced to}} start the race with his team's spare car. Jacques Villeneuve damaged his car's rear end in a crash later in the session, but was able to continue.|$|E
5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to the ground in a defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E

5|$|Kasey Kahne {{retained}} his {{pole position}} lead {{into the first}} corner, followed by Carl Edwards, who started second. On the following two laps, Jimmie Johnson took over the fourth position. On the fourth lap, Edwards passed Kahne for the first position. After starting from 37th, Denny Hamlin had moved to 27th by lap six. Eleventh-placed qualifier Jeff Gordon joined team-mate Johnson in the top ten four laps later. Johnson passed A. J. Allmendinger on lap 12 to claim the third position, as David Reutimann and Kurt Busch collided into the wall. Five laps later, the first caution was given after Reutimann collided into the wall again. Most of the front runners made pit stops, except for J. J. Yeley, who didn't pit until the following lap. At the lap 22 restart, Edwards was first, ahead of Kahne, Allmendinger, and Johnson. Hamlin turned <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> drove through the grass in the infield, prompting the second caution on the following lap. Hamlin only sustained minor damage to his splitter. Edwards remained the leader during the restart, while Allmendinger took over second from Kahne.|$|E
5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out <b>sideways,</b> <b>and</b> this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E

5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes {{about half of the}} shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The tenth caution {{was given}} on lap 243 when Harvick and Kyle Busch collided, {{resulting}} in Busch spinning <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> colliding into the wall. His car was engulfed in flames, {{but he was}} pulled from the car by NASCAR personnel. At the lap 250 restart, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Johnson, Kenseth, and Harvick. On the following lap, Harvick passed Kenseth for third, as Hamlin fell to 21st. By lap 254, Edwards had less than a one-second lead over Johnson, while Harvick was 2.59 seconds behind. Edwards continued to increase his lead, as Hamlin passed Martin for 15th. With seven laps remaining, Edwards had a 1.67 second lead over Johnson. As Edwards crossed the finish line to win the race, Johnson won his fifth consecutive championship. Harvick finished third, ahead of Almirola and Allmendinger in fourth and fifth. Kahne, Newman, Stewart, Kenseth and Biffle rounded out the top ten finishers in the race.|$|E
5|$|With {{assistance}} from Kyle Busch, Harvick took over fifth {{place on the}} following lap. Afterward, Edwards became the leader, after passing Truex, Jr. On lap 105, Jamie McMurray passed Truex, Jr. to move into second. David Ragan passed Kahne for the tenth position eleven laps later. Having led 86 of the first 124 laps, Edwards was finally passed on lap 125. Truex, Jr. moved into first position, and by the same lap Almirola had slipped to tenth. Marcos Ambrose spun sideways on lap 135, causing the fourth caution of the race. The front runners subsequently made pit stops. At the lap 139 restart, Truex, Jr. was the leader, ahead of Edwards, Harvick, and Johnson. One lap later, Montoya and Joey Logano collided, which resulted in Logano spinning <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> sustaining major damage. At the lap 143 restart, Edwards was leader, after passing Truex, Jr. before the previous caution. On the following lap, Johnson fell to fifth, as Harvick moved to third. During lap 145, Kyle Busch took third away from Harvick. Two laps later, Truex, Jr. reclaimed the lead from Edwards.|$|E

5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other <b>sideways</b> <b>and</b> push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E
