5|$|In an interview, Jodi Benson {{stated that}} for Ariel's Beginning, the writers revised the script {{multiple}} times {{to make sure}} Ariel retained her relevance in a more modern context. Benson complained {{to them that they}} wrote Ariel out of character and <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> bring her back to her roots.|$|E
5|$|In his 1892 work La planète Mars et ses {{conditions}} d'habitabilité, Camille Flammarion {{wrote about}} how these channels resembled man-made canals, which an intelligent race could use to redistribute water across a dying Martian world. He advocated {{for the existence of}} such inhabitants, and <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> may be more advanced than humans.|$|E
5|$|When {{the plan}} was {{presented}} to the Admiralty they refused to support it. The certain loss of one or both destroyers to eliminate the dry dock was out of the question. They <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> could provide an old Free French destroyer, the Ouragan, and a flotilla of small motor launches to transport the commandos and evacuate them afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphology}} of {{the outer}} and middle ear <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> had an auditory sensitivity similar to modern humans and very different from chimpanzees.

50|$|However, {{the lack}} of wear on anomalocaridid {{mouthparts}} <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> did not come into regular contact with mineralised trilobite shells, and computer modelling of anomalocaridid mouthparts <b>suggests</b> <b>they</b> were possibly better suited to feeding on smaller, soft-bodied organisms by suction, since they would have experienced structural failure if they were used against the armour of trilobites.|$|R

5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan in Sheffield. The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in the Damned—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (then going by Johnny Rotten), and <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> form a band together if the Pistols broke up.|$|E
5|$|Brisco was {{developed}} by Boam and Cuse {{at the request of}} Fox executive Bob Greenblatt. Impressed by the duo's work on the script for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Greenblatt <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> develop a series that bore the tone and style of vintage movie serials. The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. Brisco {{was one of the last}} television shows to be filmed on the Warner Bros. Western backlot. Randy Edelman composed the distinctive theme music, which has been reused by the National Broadcasting Company during its coverage of the Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis {{are not well}} known. Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has been}} little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, {{paleontologist}} John Ostrom {{began work}} on the theropod Deinonychus. His findings, which were expanded upon by his student Robert T. Bakker, contributed to the Dinosaur Renaissance, {{a revolution in the}} study of dinosaurs. Of particular importance were a reevaluation of the origin of birds that showed them to be closely related to coelurosaurian dinosaurs, reappraisal of dinosaur physiology that <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> weren't the sluggish cold-blooded animals they'd long been assumed to be, and a recognition that dinosaurs formed a natural group.|$|E
5|$|Rumours also {{surfaced}} in 1900, after Albert Victor's death, of {{his association with}} another former Gaiety girl, Maude Richardson (birth name: Louisa Lancey), and that the royal family had attempted to pay her off. In 2002, letters purported to have been sent by Albert Victor to his solicitor referring to a payoff made to Richardson of £200 were sold at Bonhams auction house in London. Owing to discrepancies in the dates and spelling of the letters, one historian has <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> could be forgeries.|$|E
5|$|The Hiroshima {{authorities}} took {{advice about}} the city's reconstruction from foreign consultants, and in 1947 Tam Deling, an American park planner, <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> build a Peace Memorial and preserve buildings situated near ground zero, that point directly below {{the explosion of}} the atomic bomb. In 1949 the authorities enacted the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Reconstruction Act, which gave the city access to special grant aid, and in August 1949, an international competition was announced for the design of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.|$|E
50|$|Aboard Voyager, the robot's {{battered}} body {{is examined}} by Lieutenant Tuvok, Captain Kathryn Janeway and Lieutenant B'Elanna Torres {{and found to}} have a quickly dying plasma-based energy source.

5|$|The IUCN {{currently}} recognizes {{only one}} species of giraffe with nine subspecies. In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed. A 2007 {{study on the}} genetics of Giraffa, <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> were six species: the West African, Rothschild's, reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African giraffe. The study deduced from genetic differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that giraffes from these populations are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block their mutual access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai giraffe was also suggested to consist of possibly two species separated by the Rift Valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{economics}} of fission–fusion designs {{have always been}} questionable. The same basic effect can be created by replacing the central fusion reactor with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} {{varieties}} of short-period comet: Jupiter-family comets (those with semi-major axes of less than 5AU) and Halley-family comets. Halley-family comets, named for their prototype, Halley's Comet, are unusual in that although they are short-period comets, it is hypothesized that their ultimate origin lies in the Oort cloud, not in the scattered disc. Based on their orbits, it is <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> were long-period comets that were captured by {{the gravity of the}} giant planets and sent into the inner Solar System. This process may have also created the present orbits of a significant fraction of the Jupiter-family comets, although the majority of such comets are thought to have originated in the scattered disc.|$|E

5|$|When the U.S. entered World War II {{at the end}} of 1941, Lombard {{traveled}} to her home state of Indiana for a war bond rally with her mother, Bess Peters, and Clark Gable's press agent, Otto Winkler. Lombard was able to raise over $2 million ($35 million in 2016) in defense bonds in a single evening. Her party had initially been scheduled to return to Los Angeles by train, but Lombard was anxious to reach home more quickly and wanted to fly by a scheduled airline. Her mother and Winkler were both afraid of flying and insisted they follow their original travel plans. Lombard <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> flip a coin; they agreed and Lombard won the toss.|$|E
5|$|While {{majoring in}} drama at Northwestern University, Gittings {{developed}} a close but non-sexual friendship with another female student, prompting {{rumors that the}} two were lesbians, which led Gittings to examine her own sexual orientation. In her attempts to understand it, she had her suspicions confirmed by a psychiatrist who offered to cure her. Not having enough money to make regular visits, {{she was unable to}} get the money from her father, who reasoned there were no problems a psychiatrist could solve that a priest could not. A close friend <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> see less of each other so as not to further encourage the rumors about them.|$|E
5|$|Wright's Air Pump {{was unusual}} {{in that it}} {{depicted}} archetypes rather than specific people, though various models for the figures have been suggested. The young lovers may {{have been based on}} Thomas Coltman and Mary Barlow, friends of Wright's, whom he later painted in Mr and Mrs Thomas Coltman (also in the National Gallery) after their marriage in 1769; Erasmus Darwin has been suggested as the man timing the experiment on the left of the table, and John Warltire, whom Darwin had invited to help with some air pump experiments in real life, as the natural philosopher; but Wright never identified any of the subjects or <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> were based on real people.|$|E

5|$|Although Deal was the bassist of the Pixies, {{she wanted}} to play guitar for the Breeders, because she felt it was an easier {{instrument}} to handle when singing at the same time. Deal recruited Josephine Wiggs of Perfect Disaster to be the Breeders' bassist; the two knew each other from when Perfect Disaster had toured with the Pixies in Europe in 1989. Deal wanted Steve Albini to record the album; she had previously worked {{with him on the}} Pixies' Surfer Rosa. She hoped to have Kelley Deal be the Breeders' drummer, but the latter was not able to take time away from her program analyst job. Albini <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> try Britt Walford of the band Slint instead. Before recording began, Deal, Wiggs, and Walford rehearsed at Wiggs' house in Bedfordshire, England for a week, and then joined Donelly in London to practice more. Albini was involved in the pre-production of the songs, which Donelly found beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Another {{chance for}} the F-20 was as an upgrade for the Air National Guard (ANG). Northrop claimed that the F-20's fast {{scramble}} time made it a natural fit for this role, its lower cost would allow the ANG to operate larger aircraft numbers, and that it supported the AIM-7 while the F-16 did not. Additionally, the ANG would not be competing with the Air Force for production quotas, {{they would be able}} to replace their aircraft more quickly. However, the Air Force's requirements had priorities favoring the F-16 for the role; if the ANG flew the F-16, they would further lower unit costs, maintain commonality between the ANG and USAF, and better equip ANG units to perform front line combat roles. The Congressional Budget Office had also disputed Northrop's lower cost claim in their own research. On 31 October 1986, the Air Force announced that the F-16C had been selected, which had been upgraded to support the AIM-7. As several nations had <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> would accept the F-20 on the condition that it was inducted into the USAF, the selection was a heavy blow to Northrop.|$|E
5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has <b>suggested</b> <b>they</b> be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E
