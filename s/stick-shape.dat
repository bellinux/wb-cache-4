40|$|We use sticks {{as tools}} {{for a variety}} of activities, {{everything}} from conducting music to playing sports or even engage in combat. However, these experiences are inherently physical and are poorly conveyed through traditional digital mediums such as video. Linked-Stick is a shape-changing stick that can mirror the movements of another person's <b>stick-shape</b> tool. We explore how this can be used to experience and learn music, sports and fiction in a more authentic manner. Our work attempts to expand the ways in which we interact with and learn to use tools...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{sequential}} Monte Carlo filter (particle filter) {{for state and}} parameter estimation of dynamic systems. It {{is applied to the}} problem of extended object tracking in the presence of dense clutter. The unknown length of a <b>stick-shape</b> object is estimated in addition to the kinematic parameters. The kernel density estimation technique is utilised to approximate the joint posterior density of target state and static size parameters. The convolution particle filtering approach is validated on a Poisson model for the measurements, originating from the target and clutter. Examples illustrating the filter performance are presented. Simulation results show that the convolution particle filter provides accurate on-line tracking, with very good estimates both for the target kinematic states and for the parameters of the target extent...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the design and {{fabrication}} of a photonic crystal (PC) channel drop filter based on an asymmetric silicon-on-insulator (SOI) slab. The filter is composed of two symmetric <b>stick-shape</b> micro-cavities between two single-line-defect (W 1) waveguides in a triangular lattice, and the phase matching condition for the filter to improve the drop efficiency is satisfied by modifying the positions and radii of the air holes around the micro-cavities. A sample is then fabricated by using electron beam lithography (EBL) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching processes. The measured 0 factor of the filter is about 1140, and the drop efficiency {{is estimated to be}} 73 % +/- 5 % by fitting the transmission spectrum.

40|$|Miniature Neolithic figurines in clay are {{a special}} topic of research. This {{especially}} concerns areas where their representation {{has so far}} been poor. While carrying out archaeological excavations in Northern Kurzeme, the north-west coastal dune zone of Rīga Bay, a ritual-like complex was recovered at Ģipka A site belonging to the local Culture of Pit Ceramics. It consists of several large and smaller fireplaces and pits, with the finds of fragmentary clay figurines recovered under the palisade that surrounded the settlement. The head and body of the miniature anthropomorphic figurines in clay have original modelling. It is possible to single out two types of figurine: with rather broad cheekbones, and oval modelling of face. The large amount of ochre found in the settlement and the purposeful breaking of figurines are evidence of their role during a rite. Clay figurines have a symbolic meaning, and the signs depicted on them, incised walking <b>stick-shape</b> and other motifs, are the symbols of early farmers...|$|E
