50|$|Field pea is a cool-season legume crop that {{is grown}} on over 25 million acres worldwide. Field pea or “dry pea” is marketed as a dry, <b>shelled</b> <b>product</b> for either human or {{livestock}} food. Field pea differs from fresh or succulent pea, which is marketed as a fresh or canned vegetable. The major producing countries of field pea are Russia and China, followed by Canada, Europe, Australia and the United States. Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States raise over 4.5 million acres and are major exporters of peas. In 2002, there were approximately 300,000 acres of field peas {{grown in the}} United States.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} of a very narrow P Cygni profile {{on top of the}} broad emission Ha and Hb lines of the Type IIn Supernova 1997 eg. A similar feature has been detected in SN 1997 ab (Salamanca et al. 1998), SN 1998 S (Meikle & Geballe 1998, Fassia et al. 2001) and SN 1995 G (Filippenko & Schlegel 1995). The detection of the narrow P Cygni profile indicates the existence of a dense circumstellar material (CSM) into which the ejecta of the supernova is expanding. From the analysis of the spectra of SN 1997 eg we deduce (a) that such CSM is very dense (n 5 x 10 ^ 7 cm^- 3), (b) that has a low expanding velocity of about 160. The origin of such dense CSM can be either a very dense progenitor wind (dotM 10 ^- 2 solar masses per year) or a circumstellar <b>shell</b> <b>product</b> of the progenitor wind expanding into a high pressure environment.

40|$|Abstract. Collaborative {{communication}} produces significant (N 2 where N {{is number}} of nodes used for collaboration) power gain and overcomes {{the effect of}} fading. With imperfect frequency synchronization significant but slightly less than N 2 power can be achieved. As the N increases more power gain can be achieved {{at the expense of}} more circuit power. In this paper an energy consumption model for collaborative communication system with imperfect frequency synchronization is proposed. The model to calculate the energy consumed by the sensor network for local communication and communication with base station is presented. Energy efficiency model for collaborative communication for the off-the <b>shell</b> <b>products</b> (CC 2420 and AT 86 RF 212) are presented. It is also shown that significant energy can be saved using collaborative communication as compared to traditional SISO (Single input single output) for products. The break-even distance where the energy consumed by SISO and collaborative communication is also calculated. From results it is revealed that collaborative communication using 5 nodes produces efficient energy saving...|$|R
40|$|The present {{status of}} the {{different}} molluscan fisheries of India and their potentials {{are discussed in the}} paper. Molluscs of commercial importance are all essentially marine and broadly come under two major categories, viz., (i) edible and (ii) ornamental. Squids, mussels, oysters, clams, etc., which are used for human consumption come under the edible molluscan fisheries. Of these the most widely distributed is the squid fishery. The mussel fishery is of considerable local importance in rocky areas especially along the West Coast. Backwater oysters, clams, etc., form sustenance fisheries of limited importance in some localities. Most of the edible molluscs are consumed by the poor class of people along the coastal areas. Special reference is made regarding the scope {{for the development of the}} mussel fishery in certain parts of India. Under ornamental molluscan fisheries, pearl oyster, chank, window-pane oyster, Trochus, Turbo and a variety of curio shells are included. In addition to the above, dead <b>shells</b> and <b>shell</b> <b>products</b> are used for a variety of purposes including the manufacture of lime and cement...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to create a macromodel of {{interfacial}} transition layer in ceramic matrix composites. Chemical and mineralogical compositions were investigated by means of X-ray fluorescence analysis and X-ray diffractometry, ceramic and technological properties of raw materials were defined using standard test methods for argillaceous raw materials. Phase composition and structure of ceramic specimens were studied using a complex of modern physico-chemical analysis methods. The layer-by-layer model of shell-core transition in ceramic matrix material was suggested. Boundary conditions for obtaining specimens were defined in terms of number of layers, thickness of such layers and pitch of core-to-shell material ratio. Forced air supply was organized while burning for directed heat and mass transfer inside the specimens. Mineral composition of layers was defined for ceramic specimens with the core of iron ore waste and the shell of clay. The study enabled to determine dependences between qualitative and semi-quantitative variation of new mineral formations content in transitional layers of a composite, which is the evidence of interaction between the core and the <b>shell</b> <b>products</b> while burning a ceramic matrix material...|$|R

40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{systematic}} study of the electrical properties of carbon nanotube-based polymeric composite materials. Our purpose was the production and characterization of a light, thin and mechanically strong new composite material able to cover electric circuits against external electromagnetic interference.

Two types of curing agent were used along with the resin, namely A 1 and PAP 8 agent: the composite was obtained using the A 1 curing agent, selected for {{the stability of the}} corresponding material over a wide range of pressure values. Setting the resistivity properties of carbon nanotube-based composites against those containing micro-sized graphite particles as constituent we showed the advantages of using carbon nanotubes. The change in the resistivity values for carbon nanotubes-based composites turned out to be significant, even for small changes in the added carbon nanotubes percentage. We also plan to show the composite's behavior in controlled humidity environments and for different temperatures. These results might be important for determining the most suitable "recipe" for the realization of composite materials useful to high-fidelity circuits applications, or even in devices exposed to predominantly electromagnetic noise...|$|R
