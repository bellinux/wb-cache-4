40|$|Objectives: To {{revise the}} {{literature}} concerning {{the differences between}} incentive <b>spirometers</b> (IS) and the technique of Breath-Stacking (BS), comparing volume and flow incentive <b>spirometers</b> devices between themselves and both with the Breath-Stacking. Method: After a search on PUBMED data basis with the terms “incentive spirometry” and “Breath Stacking”, we selected for this revision only the works that approached the differences between IS {{and the ones that}} compared those to the BS. Results: The volume incentive <b>spirometers</b> promote a more abdominal respiratory pattern with less use of respiratory accessorial muscles when compared to flow <b>spirometers.</b> A longer inspiration period and lower respiratory frequencies are also associated to the use of volume incentive <b>spirometers.</b> The Breath-Stacking causes pulmonary expansion up to volumes close to Total Pulmonary Capacity. According to the analyzed literature, significant higher volumes, as well as longer period of sustained inspiration were obtained during the use of Breath-Stacking when compared to <b>spirometers.</b> The Breath-Stacking also differs from <b>spirometers</b> concerning pulmonary ventilation pattern. The former being more directed to lung basis and periphery, which are more susceptible regions for post-operatory pulmonary complications.

40|$|Rationale: Spirometry is {{essential}} in the diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory diseases. To extend and facilitate the diagnosis of these diseases, electronic <b>spirometers</b> were introduced {{on the market and}} are specially adapted to the practice of general medicine. The performance of <b>spirometers</b> is often measured only in ideal conditions with a mechanical simulator reproducing expiratory standard ATS curves generated by a computer. Studies have questioned the value of these results in real conditions. Methods: We have tested 5 office <b>spirometers</b> (PocketSpiro, Spirobank, SpiroStar, MicroLoop, SpiroScout). We studied the basic spirometric parameters (FVC, FEV 1 and PEF) by subjecting the devices to a HansRudolph simulator in both ATPS and BTPS conditions. In addition to testing the flow-volume curves recommended by the ATS, we also submitted the <b>spirometers</b> to the curves obtained in real patients. Results: The reproducibility of the office <b>spirometers</b> complied with the requirements of the ATS – ERS societies but significant differences were observed mainly in the curves of patients with severe COPD. The limits of agreement between the simulator and <b>spirometers</b> were always lower for FEV 1 than FVC. The accuracy of most <b>spirometers</b> significantly decreased when submitted to low flow rates like those from COPD patients. We were able to design a "critical curve” taking into account the errors found with the real curves mimicking a COPD GOLD 4. The SpiroScout presented a large difference on the FVC compared to the simulator, underestimating the low flows (table). The device with the best performances in terms of accuracy and precision, and the only one in which all curves tested met the ATS recommendations was the Microloop. Table: differences between simulator and <b>spirometers</b> (%) FVC FEV 1 PocketSpiro - 1. 96 0. 19 MicroLoop - 2. 91 2. 56 SpiroScout - 24. 56 - 0. 76 SpiroBank - 2. 64 6. 36 SpiroSlar 2. 12 1. 14 Conclusion: The overall quality of most <b>spirometers</b> is acceptable for screening lung diseases but the standard curves of the ATS are not sufficient to certify the accuracy of the office <b>spirometers</b> tested with severe COPD.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The American Thoracic Society (ATS) {{has set the}} {{acceptable}} resistance for <b>spirometers</b> at less than 1. 5 cm H 2 O/l/s over the flow range 0 - 14 l/s and for monitoring devices at less than 2. 5 cm H 2 O/l/s (0 - 14 l/s). The aims {{of this study were}} to determine the resistance characteristics of commonly used <b>spirometers</b> and monitoring devices and the effect of resistance on ventilatory function.  METHODS—The resistance of five <b>spirometers</b> (Vitalograph wedge bellows, Morgan rolling seal, Stead Wells water sealed, Fleisch pneumotachograph, Lilly pneumotachograph) and three monitoring devices (Spiro 1,Ferraris, mini-Wright) was measured from the back pressure developed over a range of known flows (1. 6 - 13. 1 l/s). Peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and mid forced expiratory flow (FEF 25 - 75 %) were measured on six subjects with normal lung function and 13 subjects with respiratory disorders using a pneumotachograph. Ventilatory function was then repeated with four different sized resistors (approximately 1 - 11 cmH 2 O/l/s) inserted between the mouthpiece and pneumotachograph.  RESULTS—All five diagnostic <b>spirometers</b> and two of the three monitoring devices passed the ATS upper limit for resistance. PEF, FEV 1 and FVC showed significant (p< 0. 05) inverse correlations with added resistance with {{no significant difference between the}} normal and patient groups. At a resistance of 1. 5 cm H 2 O/l/s the mean percentage falls (95 % confidence interval) were: PEF 6. 9 % (5. 4 to 8. 3); FEV 1 1. 9 % (1. 0 to 2. 8), and FVC 1. 5 % (0. 8 to 2. 3).  CONCLUSIONS—The ATS resistance specification for diagnostic <b>spirometers</b> appears to be appropriate. However, the specification for monitoring devices may be too conservative. PEF was found to be the most sensitive index to added resistance. ...|$|R

40|$|METHODS: During {{the survey}} period (which ranged from 3 months to 6 {{months in the}} various locations) we {{collected}} daily calibration data from the 70 EasyOne <b>spirometers</b> used in the 5 survey cities. The calibrations were conducted with a 3 -L syringe, and the calibration data were stored in the <b>spirometer’s</b> database. RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent of the calibration volumes were within 64 mL (2. 1 %) of the 3 -L calibration signal. Excluding data from the first city studied (São Paulo), where one calibration syringe had to be replaced, 98 % of the calibration checks were within 50 mL (1. 7 %). The measured volume was affected only minimally by the syringe’s peak flow or emptying time. CONCLU-SION: In these 70 EasyOne <b>spirometers</b> neither calibration nor linearity changed during the study. Such calibration stability is a valuable feature in spirometry surveys and in the clinical setting. Key words: spirometry, quality control, calibration, pulmonary function tests, reliability.

40|$|COPD {{is easily}} {{detected}} in its preclinical phase using spirometry, and successful smoking cessation (a cost-effective intervention) prevents further disease progression. This consensus statement recommends {{the widespread use}} of office spirometry by primary-care providers for patients> 45 years old who smoke cigarettes. Discussion of the spirometry results with current smokers should be accompanied by strong advice to quit smoking and referral to local smoking cessation resources. Spirometry also is recommended for patients with respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough, episodic wheezing, and exertional dyspnea in order to detect airways obstruction due to asthma or COPD. Although diagnostic-quality spirometry may be used to detect COPD, we recommend the development, validation, and implementation of a new type of spirometry—office spirometry— for this purpose in the primary-care setting.
