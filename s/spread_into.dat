5|$|Based on genome sequencing, the Tapanuli {{orangutan}} {{separated from}} other orangutans about 700,000 years ago, {{and the two}} other species diverged about 400,000 years ago. The orangutans are the only surviving species of the subfamily Ponginae, which also included several other species, such as the three extinct species of the genus Gigantopithecus, including the largest known primate Gigantopithecus blacki. The ancestors of the Ponginae subfamily split from the main ape line in Africa 16 to 19 million years ago (mya) and <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> Asia.|$|E

5|$|Bumblebees are {{parasitised}} by tracheal mites, Locustacarus buchneri; protozoans including Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi; and microsporidians including Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae. The tree bumblebee B. hypnorum has <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> the United Kingdom despite hosting {{high levels}} of a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees' attempts to establish colonies. Deformed wing virus {{has been found to}} affect 11% of bumblebees in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|C.maxima {{originated}} in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants {{are sensitive to}} frost, and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. C.maxima did not start to <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of C.maxima include triloba, zapallito, zipinka, Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow (C.maxima Marrow), Show, and Turban.|$|E
5|$|C.mutica {{were also}} {{discovered}} in Ketchikan, Sitka, Juneau, Cordova, Kodiak, Kachemak Bay, Prince William Sound, and Unalaska in Alaska between 2000 and 2003. This {{was the first}} instance of a non-native marine species being found in the Aleutian Islands. In 2009, they were discovered to have <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> British Columbia, Canada. This indicates that C.mutica have completely expanded up the entire west coast of North America.|$|E

5|$|In his 1982 monograph, Schodde {{proposed}} a southern origin {{for the common}} ancestor of the superb and splendid fairywrens. At {{some time in the}} past it was split into southwestern (splendid) and southeastern (superb) enclaves. As the southwest was drier than the southeast, once conditions were more favourable, the splendid forms were more able to <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> inland areas. In the east, the superb fairywren <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> Tasmania during a glacial period when the sea level was low and the island was connected {{with the rest of the}} continent via a land bridge. What gave rise to subspecies cyaneus became isolated as the sea levels rose. The Bass Strait forms were isolated from Tasmania but more recently and so their subspecific status was not maintained. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the ancestors of the superb and splendid fairywrens diverged from each other around 4 million years ago, and their common ancestor diverged around 7 million years ago from a lineage that gave rise to the white-shouldered, white-winged and red-backed fairywrens.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, American prospectors began to <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> the area. Making deals with the Native Tlingit and Tagish tribes, the early prospectors opened the {{important}} routes of Chilkoot and White Pass, and reached the Yukon valley between 1870 and 1890. Here, they encountered the Hän people, semi-nomadic hunters and fishermen who lived along the Yukon and Klondike Rivers. The Hän did not appear to know about the extent of the gold deposits in the region.|$|E
5|$|Non-native plants {{sometimes}} threaten {{native species}} by using up nutrient resources. Though exotic species are most {{commonly found in}} areas with the greatest human visitation, such as near roads and at major tourist areas, they have also <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> the backcountry. Generally, most exotic species are controlled by pulling the plants out of the soil or by spraying, {{both of which are}} time consuming and expensive.|$|E

5|$|Princes Margret Hospital, the island's only hospital, {{suffered}} {{damage to the}} roofs of the psychiatric and intensive care units. This led to heavy water damage, which also <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> the maternity ward and damaged the electrical system. All of the patients had been evacuated before the storm arrived. Because most equipment and supplies had also been removed, the hurricane's cost to the health sector {{was limited to the}} EC$3million of structural damage.|$|E
5|$|The Stern–Gerlach {{experiment}} of 1922 provided {{further evidence}} of the quantum nature of the atom. When a beam of silver atoms was passed through a specially shaped magnetic field, the beam was split based on the direction of an atom's angular momentum, or spin. As this direction is random, the beam could be expected to <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> a line. Instead, the beam was split into two parts, depending on whether the atomic spin was oriented up or down.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler breeds {{in western}} North America, its range {{extending}} from southwestern British Columbia along the Pacific coast to northern Baja California, and east to New Mexico and southern Montana. It winters mostly in Mexico, from southern Baja California to Oaxaca state. It has <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> parts of Wyoming and Montana only recently, as Juniperus osteosperma {{has expanded its}} range due to a warming climate. Vagrants have been recorded across eastern North America and in Cuba.|$|E

5|$|The library {{block is}} {{predominantly}} clad in glass, fitted with horizontal fins, on its frontage {{with the main}} road. The alfresco café had a street frontage and was <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> the shared forecourt. The roof of the community building resembles the leaves of a palm tree, and covers the community club's rooftop basketball court. The court's location on the roof level was {{a departure from the}} norm, as in other community centres then, the basketball court occupies space on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Vampirism and {{the vampire}} {{lifestyle}} also represent a relevant part of modern day's occultist movements. The mythos of the vampire, his magickal qualities, allure, and predatory archetype express a strong symbolism {{that can be}} used in ritual, energy work, and magick, and can even be adopted as a spiritual system. The vampire has been part of the occult society in Europe for centuries and has <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> the American sub-culture as well for more than a decade, being strongly influenced by and mixed with the neo gothic aesthetics.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people. However, calculations show that one pound of plutonium could kill no more than 2 million people by inhalation. This makes the toxicity of plutonium roughly equivalent with that of nerve gas. Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology. Cohen's own estimate is that a dose of 200micrograms would likely be necessary to cause cancer.|$|E

5|$|Around 05:00UTC on November9, the cyclone made {{landfall}} at {{peak intensity}} in eastern India, near the state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, {{and close to}} the city of Ichchapuram. Although the IMD officially estimated peak winds of 120km/h (75mph), winds could have been as high as 150km/h (95mph), based on the damage and estimates from the Dvorak technique. After moving ashore, the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land. By 12:00UTC on November9, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November10. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant low, by which time the system had turned to the northeast and <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> Nepal. The circulation dissipated, although moisture and convection from the storm spread through Nepal.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes yielded relationships quite different; the three New World pelicans formed one lineage, with the American white pelican sister {{to the two}} brown pelicans, and the five Old World species the other. The Dalmatian, pink-backed and spot-billed were all closely related to one another, while the Australian white pelican was their next-closest relative. The great white pelican also belonged to this lineage but {{was the first to}} diverge from the common ancestor of the other four species. This finding suggests that pelicans evolved in the Old World and <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> the Americas, and that preference for tree- or ground-nesting is more related to size than genetics.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Chapman made {{a routine}} {{visit to a}} dentist, who found a small, but {{malignant}} tumour {{on one of his}} tonsils, leading to both being removed via a tonsillectomy. The following year, the cancer had <b>spread</b> <b>into</b> Chapman's spinal cord, where another tumour was surgically removed. Chapman had several chemotherapy treatments and surgeries during the final months of his life, but ultimately the cancer was declared inoperable. According to his brother, Chapman was visibly upset by the death of his mother that July, by which time he was terminally ill. Shortly afterwards, Chapman filmed scenes for the 20th anniversary of the first broadcast of Flying Circus, the final time he appeared on television.|$|E
