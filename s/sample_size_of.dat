5|$|This is {{believed}} to be due to the increased exposure of mucosal tissue to potential infection sites. Transmission risk from infected female to male is around 4–5% annually. Suppressive antiviral therapy reduces these risks by 50%. Antivirals also help prevent the development of symptomatic HSV in infection scenarios, meaning the infected partner will be seropositive but symptom-free by about 50%. Condom use also reduces the transmission risk significantly. Condom use is much more effective at preventing male-to-female transmission than vice versa. Previous HSV-1 infection may reduce the risk for acquisition of HSV-2 infection among women by a factor of three, although the one study that states this has a small <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> 14 transmissions out of 214 couples.|$|E

Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting {{and placed it on}} the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated in the form of a randomized clinical trial with a greater <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> newborns.|$|E

In a Bayesian framework, it is straightforward to monitor an ongoing experiment looking at the posterior probability that a parameter of interest θ, belongs to a given set. Specifically, {{in this paper we}} focus on the context of phase II clinical trials, where θ represents treatment efficacy. The Bayesian stopping rule we adopt involves the posterior probability that θ exceeds a clinically relevant threshold. Moreover, we introduce a robust version of this criterion by replacing the single prior distribution with a class of prior distributions. A simulation study is performed to compare the average <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the robust sequential approach both with the <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> the non robust approach and of the non sequential approach.

40|$|Recent studies {{reveal that}} the data that {{exhibits}} heteroscedasticity are modelled by Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedastic (EGARCH). Nevertheless, EGARCH model estimation is not efficient when the heteroscedasticity data have leverage effect. In this study, an algorithm is developed which is called Combine White Noise (CWN). The standardized residuals of EGARCH errors (heteroscedastic variance) are decomposed into equal variances (white noise series). The white noise series are transformed into Combine White Noise Model (CWN). The assessments of the model are based on data simulation. The simulated data of 200 and 300 <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> EGARCH are generated. The generated EGARCH data are based on low, moderate and high values of leverage and skewness.

The CWN model fit best in the transformed 200 <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> EGARCH generated data with moderate leverage and moderate skewness.

25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia. In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment.

A multi-institutional study involving a larger <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not {{have an effect on the}} development of taste disorders in cancer patients. An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to immunocompromised cancer patients. Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientist}} and former astrologer, Geoffrey Dean and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted {{a large scale}} scientific test, involving {{more than one hundred}} cognitive, behavioural, physical and other variables, but found no support for astrology. Furthermore, a meta-analysis was conducted pooling 40 studies consisting of 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests, which had a total of 300 participating, involved the astrologers picking the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others which were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually 3 to 5 others). When the date and other obvious clues were removed no significant results were found to suggest there was any preferred chart. A further test involved 45 confident astrologers, with an average of 10 years experience and 160 test subjects (out of an original <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> 1198 test subjects) who strongly favoured certain characteristics in the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to extremes.

The other surveys all asked people to recall events over the previous five years, while Lott had only asked people about events that had occurred during just the previous year. Lott used the higher estimate because it accounted for his claim of media bias.
