This paper {{describes}} {{the concept of}} the construction of <b>steelmaking</b> <b>shop,</b> which is carried out as part of a modernization plan aimed at creating a 21 st century environmental-friendly iron and steel works, designs the smelting reduction process of producing stainless steel crude melts in a 150 t converter and presents an outline of the equipment specifications and the conditions of operation, according to the blowing conditions of 185 t smelting reduction converter of No. 4 <b>steelmaking</b> <b>shop</b> in Chiba Works of JFE Steel. In the future, a rational production system will be constructed by flexible selection of raw materials in response to changing stainless steel raw material prices and further improvement in productivity and quality, making the maximum use of functions of the equipment...|$|E

To {{detect the}} {{metallurgical}} flaws and to realize its automatic classification {{has long been}} expected by technicians in the <b>steelmaking</b> <b>shop,</b> among various methods have been tried, ultrasonic is the mostly preferred one. In this work, a method used to realize the steel flaws detection and auto-classification has been tried, which involving {{the use of the}} high center frequency ultrasonic detection, transient nonstationary signal processing tools, wavelet transformation, and neural networks. On the base of ultrasonic test results, the different flaw echoes were analyzed by multiresolution signal decomposition using wavelet transform, and a chain of 120 data samples were extracted from the reconstructed wavelet coefficient, which can represents the character of the corresponding flaw. Totally there were 42 chains of data were collected from specimens with different flaws contained, they were divided into a training set and a testing set for the training of the neural networks, which are used for automatic classification of the flaw signals. The results produced from the network architectures investigated shown classification rates in the range from 70 to 100 % based on real and artificial defects and with comparatively simple feature extraction method, a performance can be accepted in the light of rough evaluatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{scheduling}} for {{molten iron}} logistic optimization {{is to determine}} the distribution of molten iron from iron-making stage to steelmaking stage, the transportation routes of torpedo cars and locomotives such that the molten iron from blast furnaces can be delivered to the <b>steelmaking</b> <b>shops</b> on schedule and on quality. By taking the molten iron transportation process of an iron and steel enterprise as research background, the paper investigated the torpedo car scheduling problem, which is a key problem in the molten iron logistics optimization and developed a mixed integer programming model. The model was then solved by commercial optimization software CPLEX to obtain the torpedo car scheduling scheme. Meanwhile, another scheduling scheme was obtained by a heuristics based on the nearest neighborhood idea in which the earliest available torpedo car is used to service the un-serviced task whose tapping time is the earliest. Two schemes were compared to validate the efficacy and reasonability of the model. Keywords-torpedo car scheduling; mixed integer programming; heuristics; the nearest neighbourhood I...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{integrated}} indicator of quality of rolled metals, for example bearing steel 1. 3520 (EN), {{as a set of}} properties reflecting the quality of the profile geometry, surface defects, macro and microstructure and mechanical properties was considered. The qualitative evaluation of the achieved quality level, the calculation of the probability of occurrence of defects was made. The methodology of technology management on the basis of statistical relations of the studied quality indicators with parameters of industrial technologies in <b>steelmaking</b> and rolling <b>shops</b> was established.
