5000|$|In 2012, Representative Wes Keller {{blocked a}} {{resolution}} honoring the 100th {{anniversary of the}} Girl Scouts due to internet rumors that the Girl Scouts were linked to Planned Parenthood. [...] He stated “I’m <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of the information that’s floating around the internet, and I’d like {{to give you the}} opportunity to respond to your connection, the Girl Scout connection, with Planned Parenthood and the activist role in that — is there a connection? Is there not? Frankly, I haven’t looked into it but I see it’s out there,” [...] Keller later softened his tone, praising the Girl Scouts but refusing to let the resolution pass.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2011, Asghar emailed fellow Conservatives {{asking them}} to support his wife in a vacant Newport City Council seat {{two days after the}} {{incumbent}} Les Knight had died. The email read: [...] I am very sad about Coun Les Knight although it seems that things are already moving on in terms of the Allt-yr-yn seat. I would be very grateful if you could consider Firdaus Asghar to stand in the elections from Allt-yr-yn. I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> that Firdaus has lived in the ward for more than 20 years and worked closely with Coun Knight on many constituency matters. One of the Conservative councillors who received the email said: [...] I was extremely shocked to get this email, which I found in appallingly bad taste. I have known Les and his wife for more than 30 years and am very sad at his death. When I received the email the funeral arrangements hadn’t even been made. Sending an email like this was callous and in extremely poor taste. I can’t imagine what was meant by ‘things are already moving on in terms of the Allt-yr-yn seat.' Asghar later apologised for the email, and confirmed that his wife would not be standing for election in the forthcoming elections.|$|E

Alaska has recently implemented a Perinatal Hepatitis B Case Management Program designed to identify, track, educate and continue to further prevent this vaccine-preventable disease.

The Task Force’s findings and recommendations include the following: Patient safety should trump all other values. Corporate concerns about liability and intellectual property ownership may be valid but should not over-ride all other considerations. Transparency and a commitment to patient safety should govern vendor contracts. Institutions are duty-bound to provide ethics education to purchasers and users, and should commit publicly to standards of corporate conduct. Vendors, system purchasers, and users should encourage and assist in each others ’ efforts to adopt best practices...|$|E

40|$|I must admit, {{your letter}} came as quite a {{surprise}} to me. I wasn’t expecting such an unusual request from a foreign dignitary and a friend. However, if you believe my ideas will be of some use, then I am {{more than happy to}} provide you with a few professional suggestions. Japan and Australia are two nations with similar goals in mind- to expand economically on the world stage- and any collaborative project would have to be undertaken with that knowledge in hand. The project should offer mutual benefits to its participants and encourage growth and prosperity within their respective communities. It should operate on a number of levels in the professional, political and public sectors to ensure that its message of improved relations is clearly received by all members of both Japanese and Australian society. The first part of the project should be to organise and implement what I would term as professional or business exchanges.

40|$|Transcription begins] 4 December 1944 Somewheres [sic] in Germany Bubsie Dear, Today was a {{good day}} from a mail standpoint, {{receiving}} 7 letters. Here’s the analysis: (1) air mail letter dated 20 Nov. from you, (3) V-mail letters from you dated 31 Oct., 15 Nov., and 23 Nov from you [sic], a letter from Ma Sokol date[d] 26 Oct., a V-letter from Ukie dated 22 Nov. ans a V-mail letter from Ma 2 ̆ 6 Pa Speert dated 22 Nov. Not bad at all. Darling, the way {{it appears to me}} is that they may have held some of our letters back until the 16 th of November at which time the 9 th Army went into action. This {{may or may not be}} true—it’s just speculation. That “house without furniture” simile was excellent, darling. I love to read your letters because there [sic] so much like you and I’m <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of the fact that I’m absolutely and completely in love with you. Sweets, I adore you! How did you like the play, “Tomorrow the World?” Are you willing to deal lightly with the Nazi youth? As for me, you can kill them all over 6 years of age. Darling, they got the damn Hitler doctrine seared into their brains and already are planning to come back for World War III. We hear stories of women acting as snipers and kids 14 years of age doing a similar job. Naturally all snipers are summarily executed (by the person finding them). Don’t sell Germany short. I think the great battle will be fought on the Rhine. Germany is intent on destroying herself and we are doing our utmost to cooperate with the Fatherland. The Germans highlighted sexuality 2 ̆ 6 sensuality among their peoples. In many of the art magazines and drawings which we found in the homes this theme was highly prevalent. I’m sending some of Hitler’s propoganda [sic] (in German) which you may or may not be able to read. Also I came across a document which is supposed to be highly confidential and dealt with the sterilization laws in Germany. Naturally, a Nazi was the judge and he could decree that anyone be sterilized that he so desired. Russia is doing very well now militarily 2 ̆ 6 I hope she continues. Boy, if only Russia beats us into Berlin and takes over. That would be perfect. I would even volunteer to construct the public scaffolds. I know this may sound brutal and ruthless but we are dealing with so-called “civilized” barbarians. There are some Germans who have been found O. K. and who are being trained to assume administrative jobs in post-war Germany. The Nazis are spreading word to their peoples to kill 2 ̆ 6 murder these peoples if they find them cooperating with the Allies. Do you see what kind of people we are up against? I know I’ve got on a subject and ranted a bit but I think you like to get some of my political ideas as well. Yes, darling? Sweetheart, my folks are really falling in love with [you], too, despite the awkward ways they may express themselves. You should see the letters I received from them—all superlatives about their daughter-in-law. I’m hoping and happy you are getting along O. K. with them (at least while I’m away). When I come back it will be you, me 2 ̆ 6 our string of kids—O. K. ? The weather here is beginning to turn cold and I wouldn’t be surprised if we got some snow before the week was over. Today we had a slight sleet which stopped almost as soon as it began. Sweetheart, the ammunition shortage that you may read about is absolutely true. I takes an awful lot of heavy ammunition to split open a pill-box and they have an awful lot of pill-boxes around here. The British are a lot of fun and darn good scrappers. A lot of the men resented the “limeys” in England but here in Germany they admire them a lot. There is [are] definitely better feelings between the “Tommy” 2 ̆ 6 the Yank. Goodnight for now dearest. I wrote myself out again. I’ll dream of you in my arms— Forever and ever yours alone— Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E

5000|$|On 4 February 1940, Mackensen {{wrote to}} Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch:"As a man becomes older, {{he has to}} watch {{carefully}} that age has not reduced his creativity. After reaching the age of 90, I {{have decided not to}} involve myself any longer with matters that are not concerned with my private life. However, I am still the most senior German officer. Many turn to me, sometimes with wishes, but more often with their concerns.During these weeks our concern is with the spirit of our unique and successful Army. The concern results from the crimes committed in Poland, looting and murder that take place before the eyes of our troops, who appear unable {{to put an end to}} them. An apparent indifference has serious consequences for the morale of our soldiers and it is damaging to the esteem of our Army and our whole nation.I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> of these events and that you certainly condemn them. These lines intend to convey my daily growing concern at the reports that constantly reach me, and I have to ask you to take up this matter with the highest authority. The messages I receive are so numerous, many come from high ranking persons and from witnesses. As the most senior officer I cannot keep them to myself. In transmitting them to you, I fulfil my duty to the Army. The honour of the Army and the esteem in which it is held must not be jeopardised by the actions of hired subhumans and criminals.

5000|$|Some critics believe that, on the contrary, the American {{media have}} been too {{critical}} of U.S. forces. Rick Mullen, a former journalist, Vietnam veteran, and U.S. Marine Corps reserve officer, has suggested that American media coverage has been unfair, and has failed {{to send a message}} adequately supportive of U.S. forces. Mullen calls for a lesser reporting of transgressions by US forces (condemning [...] "American media pouncing on every transgression"), and a more extensive reporting of US forces' positive actions, which Mullen feels are inadequately reported (condemning the media for [...] "ignoring the legions of good and noble deeds by US and coalition forces"). Mullen compares critical media reports to the 9/11 terrorist attacks: [...] "I have got used to our American media pouncing on every transgression by U.S. Forces while ignoring the legions of good and noble deeds performed by U.S. and coalition forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan... This sort of thing is akin to the evening news focusing on the few bad things that happen in Los Angeles or London and ignoring the millions of good news items each day... I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> that it <b>is</b> not the enemy's objective to defeat us on the battlefield but to defeat our national will to prevail. That battle is fought in the living rooms of America and England and the medium used is the TV news and newspapers. The enemy is not stupid. As on 9/11, they plan to use our [...] "systems" [...] against us, the news media being the most important [...] "system" [...] in their pursuit to break our national will."
