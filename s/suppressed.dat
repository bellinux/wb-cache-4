5|$|The {{production}} of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), {{released by the}} anterior pituitary gland. TSH release in turn is stimulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), released in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. The thyroid hormones provide negative feedback to the thyrotropes TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones are high, TSH production is <b>suppressed.</b> This negative feedback also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be <b>suppressed.</b>|$|E

40|$|Regulatory T cells (Tregs) can {{potentially}} {{migrate to the}} B cell areas of secondary lymphoid tissues and <b>suppress</b> T cell-dependent B cell Ig response. T cell-dependent Ig response requires B cell stimulation by Th cells. It has been unknown whether Tregs can directly <b>suppress</b> B cells or whether they must <b>suppress</b> Th cells to <b>suppress</b> B cell response. We report here that Foxp 3 + Tregs are found in T-B area borders and within germinal centers of human lymphoid tissues and can directly <b>suppress</b> B cell Ig response. Although Tregs can effectively <b>suppress</b> T cells, they can also directly <b>suppress</b> B cell response without the need to first <b>suppress</b> Th cells. The direct suppression of B cell Ig production by Tregs is accompanied by inhibition of Ig class switch recombination...|$|R
50|$|Antigonadotropins are drugs which <b>suppress</b> the GnRH-mediated {{secretion}} of gonadotropins {{from the}} pituitary gland. Gonadotropins include luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and are peptide hormones that signal the gonads to produce sex hormones. By <b>suppressing</b> gonadotropin secretion, antigonadotropins <b>suppress</b> gonadal sex hormone production {{and by extension}} circulating androgen levels. GnRH analogues, including both GnRH agonists and GnRH antagonists, are powerful antigonadotropins {{that are able to}} <b>suppress</b> androgen levels by 95% in men. In addition, estrogens and progestogens are antigonadotropins via exertion of negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and high-dose estrogens are able to <b>suppress</b> androgen levels to castrate levels in men similarly to GnRH analogues, while high-dose progestogens are able to <b>suppress</b> androgen levels by up to approximately 70 to 80% in men.|$|R

40|$|Thought {{suppression}} {{has been}} previously associated with increased frequency of suppression target thoughts during and after efforts to <b>suppress.</b> All previous research has investigated the effect of attempts to <b>suppress</b> a single target thought.

We sought to extend previous thought suppression research by investigating the comparative effect of attempting to <b>suppress</b> one, vs attempting to <b>suppress</b> three, personally relevant target thoughts. We observed an immediate enhancement effect, but no evidence for the rebound effect. Attempts to <b>suppress</b> three targets resulted in the same total number of intrusions as attempts to <b>suppress</b> a single target.

40|$|In Cambodia, the {{planting}} of rice lines with a competitive and/or allelopathic ability {{would be a}} very useful way to supplement weed management in the rain-fed, low-input production systems. The present study examines a wide range of rice germplasm, mainly from Cambodia, and uses a series of bioassay techniques to identify those that might have a weed growth-suppressing, allelopathic trait. A laboratory bioassay study that involved 359 rice lines showed that there were 15 that could significantly reduce the growth of awnless barnyard grass seedlings. In a second laboratory bioassay, involving the best 96 rice lines that were identified in the first study, 14 were shown to <b>suppress</b> the shoot growth of awnless barnyard grass, 11 could <b>suppress</b> the shoot growth of barnyard grass, six could <b>suppress</b> the shoot growth of small umbrella sedge, four could <b>suppress</b> the shoot growth of two-leaf fimbristylis, four could <b>suppress</b> the shoot growth of water primrose, and three could <b>suppress</b> the shoot growth of gooseweed. Of the 13 rice lines that were able to <b>suppress</b> the growth of at least two weed species, there were three lines that could <b>suppress</b> the growth of three weed species, one line that could <b>suppress</b> the growth of four weed species, and one line that could <b>suppress</b> the growth of five weed species. In a third soil-based, pot bioassay that studied the 18 best lines coming from the second laboratory bioassay, all showed a significant weed growth-suppressive ability. A linear regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between their weed growth-suppressive ability and their physical seedling size, supporting the idea that the growth suppression was allelopathic in nature and not a physical competition effect. In summary, the results indicate that an allelopathic trait does exist in some Cambodian rice lines and that this trait is effective in the growth suppression of a number of major rice weeds...|$|R
