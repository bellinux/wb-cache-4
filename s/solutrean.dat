25|$|Around 16,000BC, Europe {{witnessed}} {{the appearance of}} a new culture, known as Magdalenian, possibly rooted in the old Gravettian. This culture soon superseded the <b>Solutrean</b> area and the Gravettian of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine.

25|$|Excavation of {{this site}} has {{resulted}} in the discovery of four layers of stratigraphy. Level I has produced evidence for eighth to third centuries BC use by Phoenicians. Below that, level II produced evidence for brief Neolithic use. Level III has yielded at least 240 Upper Paleolithic artefacts of Magdalenian and <b>Solutrean</b> origin. Level IV has produced 103 items, including spear-points, knives, and scraping devices that are identified as Mousterian, and shows repeated use over thousands of years.|$|E
25|$|The biface leafpoint {{tools of}} central Europe are called blattspitzen. They are {{projectile}} points {{belonging to the}} Middle Palaeolithic with a leaf-shaped form. They are often dual pointed and flat, making them similar to <b>Solutrean</b> laurel leaf blades. It is possible to distinguish the two only from their archaeological context. Blattspitzen survived in some Upper Palaeolithic cultures. The pieces from the eastern European Szeletien culture (both blattspitzen and Micoquian bifaces) could be the link that connects the tradition of Lower and Middle Palaeolithic bifacial objects with those from the Upper Palaeolithic and beyond.|$|E

2500|$|Sanielevici's grid {{rated the}} Tungusic peoples as <b>Solutrean,</b> and the modern-day Italian people as [...] "grass"-eaters, proposing that the [...] "impulsive" [...] {{behavior}} of Jews was owed {{to a high}} nitrogen intake, from beans. The Han Chinese were descendants of the Aurignacians, having a rice-based [...] "rodent" [...] diet, which strained their muscles to create the epicanthic fold. Black people and their Spanish relatives, he conjectured, owed their darker skin to the intoxicating contact with laterites, also responsible for [...] "impulsiveness". By 1916, Sanielevici's racial perspectives had incorporated definitions of race popular in early 20th-century scholarship.

2500|$|Currently, the {{earliest}} known European art is from the Upper Palaeolithic period of between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago and France has a large selection of extant pre-historic art from the Châtelperronian, Aurignacian, <b>Solutrean,</b> Gravettian, and Magdalenian cultures. This art includes cave paintings, such as the famous paintings at Pech Merle in the Lot in Languedoc which date back to 16,000 BC, Lascaux, located {{near the village of}} Montignac, in the Dordogne, dating back to between 13,000 and 15,000 BC, or perhaps, as far back as 25,000 BC, the Cosquer Cave, the Chauvet Cave dating back to 29,000 BC, and the Trois-Frères cave; and portable art, such as animal carvings and great goddess statuettes called Venus figurines, such as the [...] "" [...] of 21,000 BC, discovered in the Landes, now in the museum at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye or the Venus of Lespugue at the Musée de l'Homme.

2500|$|New studies {{shed light}} on the {{founding}} population of indigenous Americans, suggesting that their ancestry traced to both east Asian and western Eurasians who migrated to North America directly from Siberia. A 2013 study in the journal Nature reported that DNA found in the 24,000-year-old remains of a young Boy in Mal’ta Siberia suggest that up to one-third of the indigenous Americans may have ancestry that {{can be traced back to}} western Eurasians, who may have [...] "had a more north-easterly distribution 24,000 years ago than commonly thought" [...] Professor Kelly Graf said that [...] "Our findings are significant at two levels. First, it shows that Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day Native Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia." [...] A route through Beringia is seen as more likely than the <b>Solutrean</b> hypothesis.|$|E
2500|$|Sanielevici partly rejected, partly nuanced, the {{historical}} definitions {{of race and}} the tenets of scientific racism. Călinescu paraphrases his core idea: [...] "races are affinities of an anthropological kind, reaching beyond the supposedly historical races." [...] Thus, the main criterion available for differentiation and classification of human races was human nutrition. Already in 1903, he argued that Mongols, [...] "the least mixed" [...] people of the [...] "yellow race", were [...] "brachycephalic" [...] because they consumed raw meat, and thus required stronger temporal muscles. In La Vie des mammifères..., Sanielevici postulated that racial clusters had emerged around staple foods, corresponding to regional patterns in the Stone Age diet. In his account, a European megaflood had pushed Dryopithecus out of the canopy, replacing its diet with nuts, pushing it toward bipedalism, and then turning it into modern man. The Romanian author distinguished five basic racial and dietary types, based on the archeological cultures and each created by its own foodstuff: Aurignacian (allium plants, beans), Chellean (nuts), Magdalenian (fish), Mousterian (snails, fruit) and <b>Solutrean</b> (meat, horses). These types corresponded to the environmental divisions, respectively: warm steppe, warm woods, tundra, cool woods, cold steppe.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the general}} {{impression}} of these tools {{were based on}} ideal (or classic) pieces that were of such perfect shape that they {{caught the attention of}} non-experts. Their typology broadened the term's [...] meaning. Biface hand axe and bifacial lithic items are distinguished. A hand axe need not be a bifacial item and many bifacial items are not hand axes. Nor were hand axes and bifacial items exclusive to the Lower Palaeolithic period in the Old World. They appear throughout the world and in many different pre-historical epochs, without necessarily implying an ancient origin. Lithic typology is not a reliable chronological reference and was abandoned as a dating system. Examples of this include the [...] "quasi-bifaces" [...] that sometimes appear in strata from the Gravettian, <b>Solutrean</b> and Magdalenian periods in France and Spain, the crude bifacial pieces of the Lupemban culture (9000B.C.) or the [...] tools found near Sagua La Grande in Cuba. The word biface refers to something different in English than biface in French or bifaz in Spanish, which could lead to many misunderstandings. Bifacially carved cutting tools, similar to hand axes, were used to clear scrub vegetation throughout the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods. These tools are similar to more modern adzes and were a cheaper alternative to polished axes. The modern day villages along the Sepik river in New Guinea continue to use tools that are virtually identical to hand axes to clear forest. [...] "The term biface should be reserved for items from before the Würm II-III interstadial", although certain later objects could exceptionally be called bifaces.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of high-resolution genomic analysis has provided opportunities to further define Native American subclades and narrow {{the range of}} Asian subclades that may be parent or sister subclades. For example, the broad geographic range of Haplogroup X has been interpreted as allowing {{the possibility of a}} western Eurasian, or even a European source population for Native Americans, as in the <b>Solutrean</b> hypothesis, or suggesting a pre-Last Glacial Maximum migration into the Americas. The analysis of an ancient variant of Haplogroup X among aboriginals of the Altai region indicates common ancestry with the European strain rather than descent from the European strain. Further division of X subclades has allowed identification of Subhaplogroup X2a, which is regarded as specific to Native Americans. With further definition of subclades related to Native American populations, the requirements for sampling Asian populations to find the most closely related subclades grow more specific. Subhaplogroups D1 and D4h3 have been regarded as Native American specific based on their absence among a large sampling of populations regarded as potential descendants of source populations, over a wide area of Asia. Among the 3764 samples, the Sakhalin - lower Amur region was represented by 61 Oroks. [...] In another study, Subhaplogroup D1a has been identified among the Ulchis of the lower Amur River region(4 among 87 sampled, or 4.6%), along with Subhaplogroup C1a (1 among 87, or 1.1%). Subhaplogroup C1a is regarded as a close sister clade of the Native American Subhaplogroup C1b. [...] Subhaplogroup D1a has also been found among ancient Jōmon skeletons from Hokkaido The modern Ainu are regarded as descendants of the Jōmon. The occurrence of the Subhaplogroups D1a and C1a in the lower Amur region suggests a source population from that region distinct from the Altai-Baikal source populations, where sampling did not reveal those two particular subclades. The conclusions regarding Subhaplogroup D1 indicating potential source populations in the lower Amur and Hokkaido areas stand in contrast to the single-source migration model.|$|E

50|$|Archaeologists Dennis Stanford and Bruce Bradley {{suggest that}} the Clovis point derived from the points of the <b>Solutrean</b> culture of {{southern}} France (19,000 BP) through the Cactus Hill points of Virginia (16,000 BP) to the Clovis point. Stanford and Bradley also refer to other pre-Clovis finds in the Chesapeake Bay region of northeastern North America—such as the laurel-leaf Cinmar bifacial point—as possible links between <b>Solutrean</b> and Clovis lithic technology.The idea of a Clovis-Solutrean link remains controversial and does not enjoy wide acceptance. The hypothesis is challenged by large gaps in time between the Clovis and <b>Solutrean</b> eras, a lack of evidence of <b>Solutrean</b> seafaring, lack of specific <b>Solutrean</b> features and tools in Clovis technology, the difficulties of the route and other issues.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Solutrean</b> {{hypothesis}} {{builds on}} {{similarities between the}} <b>Solutrean</b> industry and the later Clovis culture / Clovis points of North America, and suggests that people with <b>Solutrean</b> tool-technology crossed the Ice Age Atlantic by moving along the pack ice edge, using survival skills {{similar to those of}} modern Eskimo people. The migrants arrived in northeastern North America and served as the donor culture for what eventually developed into Clovis tool-making technology.|$|E

50|$|According to the <b>Solutrean</b> hypothesis, {{people of}} the <b>Solutrean</b> culture, 21,000 to 17,000 years ago, in Ice Age Europe {{migrated}} to North America by boat along the pack ice of the north Atlantic Ocean. They brought their methods of making stone tools with them and {{provided the basis for}} the later (c. 13,000 years ago) Clovis technology that spread throughout North America. The hypothesis is based on similarities between European <b>Solutrean</b> and Clovis lithic technologies.|$|E
50|$|In {{northern}} Catalonia {{there is}} an early local <b>Solutrean,</b> followed by scarce middle elements but with a well-developed final <b>Solutrean.</b> It {{is related to the}} French Pyrenean sequences. Main sites are Cau le Goges, Reclau Viver and L'Arbreda.|$|E
5000|$|University of New Mexico {{anthropologist}} Lawrence G. Straus, {{a primary}} {{critic of the}} <b>Solutrean</b> hypothesis, points to the theoretical difficulty of the ocean crossing, a lack of Solutrean-specific features in pre-Clovis artifacts, {{as well as the}} lack of art (such as that found at Lascaux in France) among the Clovis people, as major deficiencies in the <b>Solutrean</b> hypothesis. The 3,000 to 5,000 radiocarbon year gap between the <b>Solutrean</b> period of France and Spain and the Clovis of the New World also makes such a connection problematic. In response, Bradley and Stanford contend that it was [...] "a very specific subset of the <b>Solutrean</b> who formed the parent group that adapted to a maritime environment and eventually made it across the north Atlantic ice-front to colonize the east coast of the Americas" [...] and that this group may not have shared all <b>Solutrean</b> cultural traits.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Solutrean</b> {{hypothesis}} {{argues that}} Europeans may have {{immigrated to the}} New World during the Paleolithic era, circa 16,000 to 13,000 BCE. This hypothesis proposes contact partly {{on the basis of}} perceived similarities between the flint tools of the <b>Solutrean</b> culture in modern-day France, Spain and Portugal (which thrived circa 20,000 to 15,000 BCE), and the Clovis culture of North America, which developed circa 9000 BCE.The <b>Solutrean</b> hypothesis, first proposed in the mid-1990s, has had little support amongst the scientific mainstream, and subsequent genetic research has been cited as further weakening support for the idea.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{hypotheses}} {{began to}} arise {{as a result}} of this pre-Clovis evidence. One such hypothesis is advocated by Dennis Stanford. In what is known as the <b>Solutrean</b> hypothesis, he suggests that European Solutreans migrated to the Americas across the Atlantic Ocean. The supporting evidence for this hypothesis includes the discovery of artifacts at Cactus Hill dated to the time period between the Clovis and <b>Solutrean</b> and, perhaps just as strongly, evidence of the same technology used between the two cultures. According to Dr. Bruce Bradley, [...] "the Cactus Hill flint was a technological midpoint between the French <b>Solutrean</b> style and the Clovis points dating five millennia later." [...] The major criticism to this hypothesis is that there is simply not enough evidence to support it. In their journal article, Lawrence Guy Straus, David J. Meltzer, and Ted Goebel claim, [...] "We believe that the many differences between <b>Solutrean</b> and Clovis are far more significant than the few similarities, the latter being readily explained by the well-known phenomenon of technological convergence or parallelism." [...] The <b>Solutrean</b> hypothesis is generally disregarded by mainstream archeologists.|$|E
