40|$|Recent {{national}} {{developments in}} the teaching of literacy in the early years in the UK mean that teachers need to have explicit fluent knowledge of the <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> of the language and its relationship to orthography in order to teach reading effectively. In this study, a group of 38 graduate trainee primary teachers were given a pencil and paper test of phonological awareness as part of a course on teaching literacy. Results from the pencil and paper test were used as the basis of teaching about the <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> of <b>words.</b> The test was repeated six months later. The results showed that they did not use a consistent system for segmenting words into component sounds. Though there was substantial improvement on second testing, many trainees still did not show evidence that they had yet developed sufficient insights into the <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> of <b>words</b> to be able to teach children about phonemes with certainty. It is argued that student teachers need substantial explicit training and practice in manipulating the <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> of <b>words</b> to enable them to teach this aspect of language confidently...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a brain-damaged subject, RR, who manifests superior written over spoken naming of concrete entities {{from a wide}} range of conceptual domains. His spoken naming difficulties are due pri-marily to an impairment of lexical-phonological processing, which implies that his successful written naming does not depend on prior access to the <b>sound</b> <b>structures</b> of <b>words.</b> His performance therefore provides further support for the “orthographic autonomy hypothesis, ” which maintains that written word production is not obligatorily mediated by phonological knowledge. The case of RR is especially inter-esting, however, because for him the dissociation between impaired spoken naming and relatively pre-served written naming is significantly greater for two categories of unique concrete entities that are lexicalised as proper nouns—specifically, famous faces and famous landmarks—than for five categories of nonunique (i. e., basic level) concrete entities that are lexicalised as common nouns—specifically, animals, fruits/vegetables, tools/utensils, musical instruments, and vehicles. Furthermore, RR’s predominant error types in the oral modality are different for the two types of stimuli: omissions for unique entities vs. semantic errors for nonunique entities. We consider two alternative explanations for RR’s extreme diffi-culty in producing the spoken forms of proper nouns: (1) a disconnection between the meanings of proper nouns and the corresponding word nodes in the phonological output lexicon; or (2) damage to th...|$|R

Seeing that phonological disorders include articulation errors {{and other forms of}} speech disorders, studies pertaining to children with ADHD symptoms who demonstrate signs of phonological disorders in their native Arabic language are lacking. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a description of Arabic language deficits and to present a theoretical model of potential associations between phonological language deficits and ADHD. Dodd and McCormack’s (1995) four subgroups classification of speech disorder and the phonological disorders pertaining to the Arabic language provided by a Saudi Institute for Speech and Hearing are examined within the theoretical framework.

40|$|To {{what extent}} are phonological words {{isomorphic}} to syntactic <b>words?</b> The <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> of <b>words</b> can undergo dramatic changes {{when they are}} produced in different utterance contexts. For example, the sentence “do you like her ” could be articulated as a single prosodic unit with one main stress, e. g., “je-lie-ker”. The rules for parsing a sentence into prosodic units in English are still a matter of debate. Broadly speaking, we could distinguish three algorithms for phonological word formation. According to Selkirk‟s (1984) algorithm, phonological word formation requires syntactic class information. Thus, a phonological word comprises a content word plus any attached function word or words, within a syntactic phrase. An alternative view (Nespor & Vogel, 1986, 2008) proposes that phonological words can only be equal to or smaller than the terminal node of a syntactic tree. This parsing algorithm makes use of morphological information and defines a phonological word as a stem and any linearly adjacent set of affixes. Yet another view allows all syntactic classes to be phonological words using purely prosodic information and defines phonological words as a stressed foot to which unstressed syllables can be adjoined. The issue is whether the default annexation is leftwards or rightwards: the former is proposed by Lahiri, Jongman & Sereno, (1990), Gussenhoven (1993), Lahiri & Plank (2009) and the latter by Selkirk (1984).

40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} {{modifications}} affect the <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> of foreign <b>words</b> {{as they are}} bor-rowed into Korean. We consider specifically the adaptation of word-final stops, liquids, and voiceless as well as voiced coronal sibilants. The particular manifestation of these is shown to corre-late with the place they hold in the syllable structure of the recipient language rather than, as {{might seem to be}} the case, with either contrastive categories of the source language or allophonic qualities of the recipient. This discussion thus contributes to the continuing debate over the awareness that listeners may have of phonetic properties that are contrastive in the source language but redundant in the recipient (and hence presumably below the threshold of categorical perception), as well as vice versa, and it offers a unified view of the factors which appear to be at play in the phonological pro-cessing of both native words and loanwords. At base is a simple yet comprehensive principle of phonological perception: Phonetic representations are interpreted according to the salient perceptual categories of the listener’s native language...|$|R
40|$|Background/context: Description {{of prior}} research, its {{intellectual}} context and its policy context. A {{large body of}} evidence documents {{the presence of a}} cluster of phonological processing abilities (PPA) in preschool that are remarkably stable from the late preschool period onward and predictive of beginning reading (Lonigan, 2006). These abilities are uniquely related to—and play a special role in—preschool children’s emergent literacy even after controlling for other cognitive abilities (Anthony, Williams, McDonald, & Francis, 2007). It is now well established that deficits in PPA are a prominent feature of numerous reading problems (Smith, Simmons, & Kame’enui, 1998), {{and in the absence of}} intervention becomes more difficult to remediate overtime beginning in kindergarten (Lonigan et al., 2009). Among PPA, the most extensively researched has been phonological awareness (PA). Children who show facility in recognizing and manipulating the <b>sound</b> <b>structures</b> in spoken <b>words</b> learn to read earlier and better than less able peers, even after other variables such as receptive and expressive vocabulary, working memory, and socioeconomic status variables were controlled for (Lonigan, 2006).

40|$|A {{model of}} grammar needs to {{reconcile}} the undesirability inherent to allomorphy, the apparent extra burden on learning and memory, with its occurrence and possible stability. OT approaches this task by positing an anti-allomorphy constraint, henceforth referred to as "OO-correspondence", which requires leveling (i. e. sameness of <b>sound</b> <b>structure)</b> in related <b>word</b> forms (Benua 1997). The occurrence of allomorphy then indicates crucial domination of OO-correspondence by other constraints. To assess the adequacy of this proposal {{it is necessary to}} establish the level of abstractness at which OO-correspondence applies and to examine the consequences of this decision for ranking order. While proponents of OT tacitly assume the level in question to be rather concrete, the notion of allomorphy as originally envisioned in Structuralism was defined by distinctness at a more abstract level referred to as "phonemic" (Harris 1942; Nida 1944). The basic intuition here is that the defining property of subphonemic sound properties, their conditionedness by context, entails that whatever burden they put on learning and memory is of a fundamentally different nature than that entailed by phonemic distinctness. The evidence from German supports that intuition in that leveling can be shown to target phonemic <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> to the exclusion of subphonemic properties. Allomorphy, defined by phonemic alterna-tion, tends to serve phonological optimization in closed class items (function words, affixes) while serving to express morphological distinctions in open class items. The key to demonstrating the correlations in question lies in the discernment of phonemic structure, which is therefore {{at the core of the}} article...|$|R
40|$|Dyslexia is {{associated}} with impaired neural representation of the <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> of <b>words</b> (phonology). The ‘phonological deficit’ in dyslexia may arise in part from impaired speech rhythm perception, thought to depend on neural oscillatory phase-locking to slow amplitude modulation (AM) patterns in the speech envelope. Speech contains AM patterns at multiple temporal rates, and these different AM rates are associated with phonological units of different grain sizes, e. g. related to stress, syllables or phonemes. Here, we assess the ability of adults with dyslexia to use speech AMs to identify rhythm patterns. We study 3 important temporal rates : 'Stress' (~ 2 Hz), 'Syllable' (~ 4 Hz) and 'Sub-beat' (reduced syllables, ~ 14 Hz). 21 dyslexics and 21 controls listened to nursery rhyme sentences that had been tone-vocoded using either single AM rates from the speech envelope (Stress only, Syllable only, Sub-beat only) or pairs of AM rates (Stress+Syllable, Syllable+Sub-beat). They were asked to use the acoustic rhythm of the stimulus to identity the original nursery rhyme sentence. The data showed that dyslexics were significantly poorer at detecting rhythm compared to controls {{when they had to}} utilise multi-rate temporal information from pairs of AMs (Stress+Syllable or Syllable+Sub-beat). These data suggest that dyslexia {{is associated}} with a reduced ability to utilise AMs < 20 Hz for rhythm recognition. This perceptual deficit in utilising amplitude modulation patterns in speech could be underpinned by less efficient neuronal phase alignment and cross-frequency neuronal oscillatory synchronisation in dyslexia. Dyslexics' perceptual difficulties in capturing the full spectro-temporal complexity of speech over multiple timescales could {{contribute to the development of}} impaired phonological representations for words, the cognitive hallmark of dyslexia across languages...|$|R

40|$|The core {{difficulty}} in developmental dyslexia across languages is a “phonological deficit”, a specific {{difficulty with the}} neural representation of the <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> of <b>words.</b> Recent data across languages suggest that this phonological deficit arises in part from inefficient auditory processing of {{the rate of change}} of the amplitude envelope at syllable onset (inefficient sensory processing of rise time). Rise time is a complex percept that also involves changes in duration and perceived intensity. Understanding the neural mechanisms that give rise to the phonological deficit in dyslexia is important for optimising educational interventions. In a three-deviant passive ‘oddball’ paradigm and a corresponding blocked ‘deviant-alone’ control condition we recorded ERPs to tones varying in rise time, duration and intensity in children with dyslexia and typically developing children longitudinally. We report here results from test Phases 1 and 2, when participants were aged 8 – 10 years. We found an MMN to duration, but not to rise time nor intensity deviants, at both time points for both groups. For rise time, duration and intensity we found group effects in both the Oddball and Blocked conditions. There was a slower fronto-central P 1 response in the dyslexic group compared to controls. The amplitude of the P 1 fronto-centrally to tones with slower rise times and lower intensity was smaller compared to tones with sharper rise times and higher intensity in the Oddball condition, for children with dyslexia only. The latency of this ERP component for all three stimuli was shorter on the right compared to the left hemisphere, only for the dyslexic group in the Blocked condition. Furthermore, we found decreased N 1 c amplitude to tones with slower rise times compared to tones with sharper rise times for children with dyslexia, only in the Oddball condition. Several other effects of stimulus type, age and laterality were also observed. Our data suggest that neuronal responses underlying some aspects of auditory sensory processing may be impaired in dyslexia...|$|R

However, whether improving the classroom listening environment {{is sufficient to}} enhance young children’s learning in areas critical to early reading acquisition, such as awareness of the <b>sound</b> <b>structure</b> of spoken <b>words</b> (phonological awareness: PA), is unclear. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of an enhanced listening environment combined with PA intervention which aimed to specifically increase children’s PA compared to an enhanced listening environment alone. Participants were 38 children aged 5 - 6 years from two classes at a low-decile primary school. All children were hearing screened at baseline, pre- and post-intervention. PA, letter-sound knowledge, real and non-word decoding were measured three times over 10 weeks (Term 1) prior to SFA installation in both classrooms, as well as pre- and post-intervention. In Term 2, children in class 1 {{were randomly assigned to}} receive SFA and an eight-week class-based teacher-administered PA programme. Class 2 received SFA only. A significant learning effect for all children occurred during {{the first phase of the}} monitoring period. Yet, a plateau was reached for most children between assessment times two and three prior to intervention. Following intervention, class 1 demonstrated a significant difference compared to class 2 in one PA assessment. Other measures failed to show any differences between classes. Visual data analyses revealed particular (non-significant) improvements for poor readers in class 1. These children outperformed poor readers in class 2 on all measures. Teacher questionnaires indicated that children’s listening skills improved with SFA. The significant difference observed in one measure of PA between classes demonstrated that the combination of enhanced classroom acoustic environment and PA intervention actively improved PA development.

The Phonetic Calculator Program (PCP) analysed the samples in terms of speech <b>sound</b> inventory, syllable <b>structure</b> of <b>words</b> and the frequency of occurrence of speech <b>sounds</b> and syllable <b>structures.</b> The data were processed to allow for the comparison of the findings at three age levels, namely 3. 0 – 4. 0 (Group 1), 4. 1 – 5. 1 (Group 2) and 5. 2 – 6. 2 (Group 3). There was developmental progression, but much speech and syllable structure development seems to occur before the age of 3. 0. However, the speech sound inventory and syllable structure inventory were incomplete by the age of 6. 2. The nasals, plosives, approximants and fricatives were found to develop earlier than the affricates, clicks and prenasalised consonant sounds.
