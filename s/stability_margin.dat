5000|$|Loudspeakers {{present a}} {{reactive}} load to an amplifier (capacitance, inductance and resistance). This impedance may vary in value with signal frequency and amplitude. This variable loading affects the amplifier's performance both because the amplifier has nonzero output impedance (it cannot keep its output voltage perfectly constant when the speaker load varies) {{and because the}} phase of the speaker load can change the <b>stability</b> <b>margin</b> of the amplifier. The influence of the speaker impedance is different between tube amplifiers and transistor amplifiers. The reason is that tube amplifiers normally use output transformers, and cannot use much negative feedback due to phase problems in transformer circuits. Notable exceptions are various [...] "OTL" [...] (output-transformerless) tube amplifiers, pioneered by Julius Futterman in the 1950s, or somewhat rarer tube amplifiers that replace the impedance matching transformer with additional (often, though not necessarily, transistorized) circuitry in order to eliminate parasitics and musically unrelated magnetic distortions. In addition to that, many solid-state amplifiers, designed specifically to amplify electric instruments such as guitars or bass guitars, employ current feedback circuitry. This circuitry increases the amplifier's output impedance, resulting in response {{similar to that of}} tube amplifiers.|$|E
50|$|A {{detailed}} stability {{review was}} performed by FaAA {{as part of its}} investigation. It opined that the ship was designed, built, and operated in accordance with American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Standards. In 1988, the ship was modified to include a top drive unit. The stability effect of this modification was analyzed by FaAA, and it found that stability improved due to conversion of the No. 3 center tank to permanent ballast as part of the top drive modification. (FaAA never found the alleged ABS calculations and certification of the ship's stability with the top drive.) At the time of the capsize, FaAA opined the ship was operating within accepted stability standards. However, its investigation revealed errors in the wind overturning moment calculations performed by the shipbuilder and approved by ABS. Erroneous instructions in the operator's manual would allow the ship to be operated with the height of the vertical center of gravity above accepted limits, resulting in reduced <b>stability</b> <b>margin.</b> FaAA opined that while this could have been a serious issue in this situation, it was not, since the ship was operating at less than the maximum allowable vertical position of the center of gravity prior to the event.|$|E
5000|$|Developed at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, Honest John {{was a large}} {{but simple}} fin-stabilized, unguided {{artillery}} rocket weighing 5820 lb in its initial M31 nuclear-armed version. Mounted {{on the back of}} a truck, HJ was aimed in much the same way as a cannon and then fired up an elevated ramp, igniting four small spin rockets as it cleared the end of the ramp. The M31 had a range of 15.4 mi with a 20 kiloton nuclear warhead and was also capable of carrying a 1500 lb conventional warhead. Early tests exhibited more scatter on target than was acceptable when HJ was conventionally armed. Development of an upgraded Honest John, M50, was undertaken to improve accuracy and extend range. The size of the fins was greatly reduced to eliminate [...] "weathercocking" [...] (the tendency of crosswinds to turn a rocket to face into the wind). Increased spin was applied to restore the positive <b>stability</b> <b>margin</b> that was lost when fin size was reduced. The improved M50, with the smaller fins and more [...] "rifling", had a maximum range of 30+ miles with a scatter on target of only 250 yd, demonstrating an accuracy approaching that of tube artillery. Honest John was manufactured by the Douglas Airplane Company of Santa Monica, California. The M31 consisted of a truck-mounted, unguided, solid-fueled rocket transported in three separate parts.

40|$|Several {{static and}} dynamic {{stability}} criteria have been {{defined in the}} course of walking-robot history. Nevertheless, previous work on the classification of stability criteria for statically stable walking machines (having at least four legs) reveals that there is no <b>stability</b> <b>margin</b> that accurately predicts robot stability when inertial and manipulation effects are significant. In such cases, every momentum- based <b>stability</b> <b>margin</b> fails. The use of an improper stability criterion yields unavoidable errors in the control of walking robots.
