5|$|Pliny the Elder and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the crater. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the {{building}} by an accumulation of material, presumably tephra, which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from the raining debris. They approached the beach again but the wind prevented the ships from leaving. Pliny <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed. Though Pliny the Elder died, his friends ultimately escaped by land.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{entered the}} room {{that had been set}} aside for Crabbe, wet and hurried, and embraced Crabbe with brotherly affection. The royal gift was forgotten— the ample skirt of the coat within which it had been packed, and which he had {{hitherto}} held cautiously in front of his person, slipped back to its more usual position— he sat down beside Crabbe, and the glass was crushed to atoms. His scream and gesture made his wife conclude that he had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pair of scissors, or the like: but very little harm had been done except the breaking of the glass.|$|E
25|$|Pliny and {{his party}} saw flames coming from several parts of the mountain, which Pliny and his friends {{attributed}} to burning villages. After staying overnight, the party was driven from the building by an accumulation of material which threatened to block all egress. They woke Pliny, who had been napping and emitting loud snoring. They elected {{to take to the}} fields with pillows tied to their heads to protect them from rockfall. They approached the beach again but the wind had not changed. Pliny <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> sail that had been spread for him and could not rise even with assistance when his friends departed, escaping ultimately by land. Very likely, he had collapsed and died, which is the most popular explanation of why his friends abandoned him, although Suetonius offers an alternative story of his ordering a slave to kill him to avoid the pain of incineration. How the slave would have escaped to tell the tale remains a mystery. There is no mention of such an event in his nephew's letters.|$|E

500|$|The US 3rd Brigade {{subsequently}} also {{uncovered a}} significant tunnel complex, after Sergeant Stewart Green from US 1/28th Battalion accidentally <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nail and uncovered a trap door on 11 January. Volunteering {{to enter the}} tunnel, Green then located an underground dispensary occupied by more than 30 Viet Cong who subsequently escaped. Later a smoke machine was used to pump smoke into the tunnel system, and this was successful in locating numerous tunnel entrances and bunkers as the smoke rose above the jungle canopy. They were the first American troops to enter the tunnels, and they proceeded to attack them with CS gas, and later explosives. However, such tactics met with limited success with the tear gas flushing out large numbers of women and children, but few Viet Cong. Led by Green, a squad of Americans equipped with flashlights, pistols and a field telephone penetrated over [...] of the tunnel system before becoming involved in a fire-fight with the Viet Cong. Wearing gas-masks the Americans threw gas grenades and fought {{their way back to}} the tunnel entrance, but one soldier became lost in the darkness and Green re-entered the tunnel to find him. The Viet Cong subsequently withdrew.|$|E
500|$|At around 9:30 on {{the night}} of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his {{newspaper}} with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, [...] "I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever it was, I forgive him." [...] He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to [...] "take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, [...] "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." [...] Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E
2500|$|A usage less {{familiar}} from English but common in other Bantu languages such as Swahili is {{to express a}} present state resulting from a recent event. For example, [...] "he is wearing a suit" [...] is expressed in Chichewa as [...] "he has put on a suit"; [...] "he {{is sitting on a}} chair" [...] is expressed as [...] "he has <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chair"; [...] "I am tired" [...] is expressed as [...] "I have become tired", and so on.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, H. C. Sanders, {{owner of}} a nearby gas station, {{reported}} 20 years earlier {{he ran out of}} gas at night near the Red River across from the Bell Witch Cave. He began to walk towards town when a rabbit came out of the woods and began to follow him. Sanders walked faster, but the rabbit kept pace even as he broke out into a run. After a mile, Sanders <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> log to catch his breath. The rabbit hopped up {{on the other side of}} the log looked at him and said, [...] "Hell of a race we had there, wasn't it?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The idea to make Cook Forest {{a public}} park {{originated}} with McCreight on {{his first visit to}} the “Forest Cathedral” near the Clarion River in northwest central Pennsylvania. [...] “It was a beautiful day, August 21, 1910, that the writer with a few others were invited to a weekend house party at the A.W. Cook home. Cook would comment, as he led the way into the silent ‘temple of the gods’, and then listen to the exclamations of astonishment that were sure to come from those who followed along the fern-bound path in this fairyland. Often there was heard no comment, for in this silent cathedral of the Almighty, it was unuttered. [...] Frequently it was observed that sturdy men could not restrain their tears, at the solemnity of their environment. [...] It was during this walk that A.W. Cook and the writer <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> log to talk about the future fate of the magnificent panorama they saw and felt all about them. The writer said to him: ‘Cook, no greater crime could be committed than to destroy this; it shall not be destroyed; it must be saved for humanity’s sake.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While not {{active in}} any Watergate {{activities}} per se, Gray was aware through {{his dealings with}} John Dean that the White House was concerned about what might be discovered from a full-field FBI investigation and explored {{what he could do}} to limit the investigation or shift it away from the Bureau’s jurisdiction. As Dean wrote in his Watergate memoir “Blind Ambition,” he used Gray as a shill knowing that “we could count on Pat Gray to keep the Hunt material from becoming public, and he did not disappoint us.” [...] In fact, even though he thought of this as a political not criminal situation and that he was ultimately serving the President as the “nation’s chief law enforcement officer,” Gray would come dangerously close to collusion because he chose to be useful to the White House without asking the hard questions. Dean goes on to say, “I met Pat Gray secretly at his home in southwest Washington. We were both apprehensive about the meeting as we walked to a park and <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bench overlooking the Potomac, discussing my request to obtain FBI 302s and AirTels on the Watergate investigation." ...|$|E
60|$|Some one started another topic; {{and an hour}} or {{so later}} most of the little party strolled out on the terrace in front of the house. It was almost dark now, but the evening was no more than pleasantly cool, and Ida <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> old stone seat.|$|R

Rising to go back, she missed her way, and became quite lost, and went on uneasily, conscious that she had committed a rudeness in not waiting for her attendant.|$|R
2500|$|Major Israel McCreight of Du Bois, Pennsylvania, was {{author and}} steward of Cook Forest State Park, the first Pennsylvania State Park {{acquired}} {{to preserve a}} natural landmark, and {{a founder of the}} Pennsylvania Conservation Association. Cook Forest is the most important tract of virgin timberland to be found in Pennsylvania, and is without rival for size East of the Rockies. [...] Once called the “Black Forest,” the area is famous for its towering white pines and hemlocks. The idea to make Cook Forest a public park originated on McCreight's first visit to the “Forest Cathedral” near the Clarion River in northwest central Pennsylvania. [...] “It was a beautiful day, August 21, 1910, that the writer with a few others were invited to a weekend house party at the A.W. Cook home. Cook would comment, as he led the way into the silent ‘temple of the gods’, and then listen to the exclamations of astonishment that were sure to come from those who followed along the fern-bound path in this fairyland. Often there was heard no comment, for in this silent cathedral of the Almighty, it was unuttered.

In 1910, McCreight and others formed the Pennsylvania Conservation Association and successfully lobbied the legislature to consider Cook Forest for state park purposes. For sixteen years a series of unsuccessful legislative bills were introduced for the state to acquire Cook Forest. In 1923, the [...] was formed for the purpose of acquiring the Cook Forest tract of virgin white pine and hemlock. Early pioneers with the Cook Forest Association were Major Israel McCreight, Theo Wilson and John Nicholson. The Association, endorsed by national natural resource groups and Governor Gifford Pinchot, raised $200,000.|$|E

60|$|I <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{old wooden}} settle, carved all over like <b>a</b> bench <b>on</b> the Battery.
