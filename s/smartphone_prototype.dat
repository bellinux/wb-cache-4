50|$|Recently, a <b>smartphone</b> <b>prototype</b> {{using the}} {{benefits}} of cartilage conduction has been manufactured by ROHM Co., Ltd. This type of the smartphone provides clearer sound compared with conventional phones, even under noisy circumstances. Furthermore, the sound pressure level can be easily modified by adjusting the physical pressure level of the smartphone pressed against the outer ear. Importantly, the cartilage vibration, which is a sound source, can be heard only by oneself but not by others because sound from cartilage vibration cannot be leaked outside. This makes talking in public easy. In addition, the smartphone’s surface can be kept clean because one’s face or ear does not directly contact the smartphone’s surface. The cartilage conduction phone {{can also be used}} simultaneously with conventional air conduction hearing aids, which is good news for hearing-impaired people.|$|E
50|$|In May 2011, Human Media Lab at Queen's University in Canada {{introduced}} PaperPhone, {{the first}} flexible smartphone, {{in partnership with}} the Arizona State University Flexible Display Center. PaperPhone used 5 bend sensors to implement navigation of the user interface through bend gestures of corners and sides of the display. In January 2013, the Human Media Lab introduced the first flexible tablet PC, PaperTab, in collaboration with Plastic Logic and Intel Labs, at CES. PaperTab is a multi-display environment in which each display represents a window, app or computer document. Displays are tracked in 3D to allow multidisplay operations, such as collate to enlarge the display space, or pointing with one display onto another to pull open a document file.

Since full-colour, US Letter-sized displays were not available at the time, PaperWindows deployed a form of active projection mapping of computer windows on real paper documents that worked together as one computer through 3D tracking. At a lecture to the Gyricon and Human-Computer Interaction teams at Xerox PARC on May 4, 2007, Prof. Vertegaal publicly introduced the term Organic User Interface (OUI) as a means of describing the implications of non-flat display technologies on user interfaces of the future: paper computers, flexible form factors for computing devices, but also encompassing rigid display objects of any shape, with wrap-around, skin-like displays. The lecture was published a year later as part of a special issue on Organic User Interfaces in the Communications of the ACM. In May 2010, the Human Media Lab partnered with ASU's Flexible Display Center to produce PaperPhone, the first flexible smartphone with a flexible electrophoretic display. PaperPhone used bend gestures for navigating contents. Since then, the Human Media Lab has partnered with Plastic Logic and Intel to introduce the first flexible tablet PC and multi-display e-paper computer, PaperTab, at CES 2013, debuting the world's first actuated flexible <b>smartphone</b> <b>prototype,</b> MorePhone in April 2013.|$|E

This addiction has however not been classified as a disorder and the components in the games that create an addiction have not been determined. This thesis had two goals. The first was to investigate and identify addictive components in smartphone games. The second goal was to use these components to develop an addictive proof of concept <b>smartphone</b> game <b>prototype.</b> The prototype was also to be evaluated regarding usability and how well it included the addictive components. The components in these games that create an addiction were identified using a literature study. After establishing a theoretical framework, eight different areas of addictive smartphone game components were found. These areas were further condensed into 16 guidelines of {{how to make a}} smartphone game addictive. The guidelines were used to create a prototype which later was evaluated with a supervised play test, a short interview, a usability questionnaire and a survey with questions regarding how well the guidelines were implemented. The usability of the game prototype was regarded as good and 13 of 14 implemented guidelines received positive results in the survey. In addition to this, all test users also regarded the game prototype as fun to play and wanted to play it again. Based on these results, the implemented <b>smartphone</b> game <b>prototype</b> was concluded to be addictive...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a {{research that has}} designed and evaluated a high-fidelity <b>smartphone</b> <b>prototype,</b> called SafeTHA. SafeTHA has been designed for patients to reduce the occurrence of postoperative adverse events after total hip arthroplasty (THA). A User-Centered Design approach was utilized to facilitate an optimal user experience and to emphasize the end-user. The prototype has two main functionalities. Firstly, it enables patients to self-report their current state through answering five simple questions from evidence-based practices regarding pain, anxiety, mobility, progress, and quality of recovery. Secondly, it informs the user about several aspects of rehabilitation such as pain, known risk factors, wound management, and recommended activity level. The use of mobile technology could enable timely self-reporting and collection of subjective patient data out of a hospital setting. The low-, and mid-fidelity prototypes were assessed by experts of Interaction Design, Medical Informatics, Biomedical Engineering, and healthcare professionals with respect to interaction flow, information content, and self-reporting functionalities.

40|$|Due to the {{pervasive}} availability of connected devices, smart-phone users {{are able to}} access specific information, like traffic, weather, personal calendar and car status, anytime. Using such information {{makes it easy to}} influence {{the course of a day}} in advance instead of getting suprised by an unexpected situation, like, a 10 km traffic jam or rain while riding to work by bicycle. The growing number of available information makes it time consuming to consider every possible situation that could happen throughout the day. A cross-domain personal assistant based on the users' personal habits and needs, can help to keep the time consumption limited. Companies like Amazon, Apple, BMW and Google offer products with the aim of combining data sources and assist the user throughout the day in various kinds with a limited functional range. However, to date, only limited research exists that outlines a suitable functional range of what a personal assistant could be or in which situations which kind of automation is desired by a user. Hence, in this paper, we discuss the result of three consecutive user-centric surveys about functional demands of a personal assistant. The first two surveys are online based questionnaires and aim to answer the question which pro-active features are adequate for the user. Based on these insights, the last survey investigates four use cases as interactive <b>smartphone</b> <b>prototypes</b> along with an interview while the participants try to complete given tasks.

40|$|Abstract. Smartphones host {{operating}} {{systems that are}} {{on a par with}} modern desktop environments. For example, Google Android is a mobile operating system that is based upon {{a modified version of the}} Linux OS. Notwithstanding traditional threats to mobile phones, threats to desktop environments are also applicable to smartphones. Management of security configurations for the end-user has, to date, been complex and errorprone. As a consequence, misconfiguration of and/or a poor understanding of a security configuration may unnecessarily expose a smartphone to known threats. In this paper, a threat-based model for smartphone security configuration is presented. To evaluate the approach, a <b>prototype</b> <b>smartphone</b> security agent that automatically manages security configurations on behalf of the end-user is developed. A case study based on firewall access control demonstrates how automated security configuration recommendations can be made based on catalogues of countermeasures. These countermeasures are drawn from best-practice standards such as NIST 800 - 124, a guideline on cell phone and PDA security and NIST 800 - 41 -rev 1, a guideline on firewall security configuration. ...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: In {{order to}} stay within {{schedule}} and budget limits, construction projects require fluent communication and information exchange between the collaborating parties. Unnecessary project delays and rework are often caused by missing or outdated information. Easily available, accurate and up-to-date information on project status can improve work efficiency and quality. Such information can be efficiently shared between project parties in electronic form, but recording the information on-site and transmit it to the office requires mobile devices and wireless communication. This paper presents a <b>prototype</b> <b>smartphone</b> application called Construction Progress Control (CPC) that can record on-site progress in different activities, convert this information into a format that can be imported to a project management software (e. g., Primavera P 6) and send this information to a PC where the project management software picks up this information and updates the schedule accordingly. The efficiency of construction projects can be improved by collecting and recording progress information at the worksite using electronic devices, by providing schedulers in the office with accurate and up-to-date progress information, and by updating the work schedule in a timely fashion, henc...|$|R
40|$|Many {{platforms}} {{for civic}} engagement, whether online or offline, require that citizens leave {{the places they}} normally inhabit physically or virtually and commit to a separate space and set of processes. Examples include town hall meetings, occurring during specific times and in specific places, and online forums, where deliberation occurs within profile-based websites for which you need to sign up and to regularly return. This thesis responds to the design challenge and research question: How do you address barriers to minimum effective engagement in community projects, and ensure that all citizens can contribute their input {{on how to improve}} their local communities? In order to raise levels of participation in community projects and expand the range of voices heard in governmental decision-making, {{there is a need for}} a civic engagement platform that is lightweight and compelling enough to enjoy continued use. To this end, I have developed a theoretical basis for effective citizenship through monitorial actions aided by mobile computing, finding connections between various theories of citizenship and learning to fill a gap in the literature and in terms of civic technology design. My argument and design goals for such a system are reinforced by findings from a needs assessment of Boston-area municipalities that confirmed a desire to use new technologies to elicit feedback on community issues from a more diverse demographic than those who currently attend public meetings. Based my analysis of the literature and the distilled design goals, I built and completed early-stage user testing of a <b>prototype</b> <b>smartphone</b> app-based civic engagement platform called Action Path, which uses location-awareness in the form of geo-fences along with push notifications to prompt users to respond to one-item surveys dotting their urban landscape. Interviews with users suggest Action Path might help people see their communities as filled with opportunities for civic intervention, and might increase their sense of efficacy. Additionally, workshops about geo-fence design and curricular design with potential stakeholders showed how Action Path might be effectively deployed through civic technologists and in schools. by Erhardt Graeff.

40|$|Emergency workers {{comprise}} large professional {{groups like}} volunteer fire-fighters, police officers, emergency medical staff and so on. Their professions {{have to deal}} frequently with {{a considerable number of}} a combination of health and safety risk factors, which are often unavoidable. For example, workplace scenes demanding the intervention of emergency workers may be located in remote, difficult to access areas (mountains, sea, caves), and sometimes in extremely difficult weather conditions. Moreover, emergency workers must arrive very rapidly at the disaster scene at any time of the day or night, and there is always the possibility of car crashes or other transportation accidents on the journey to the disaster scene or to hospitals. Others examples are the industrial workplaces, which are inherently places with a high concentration of heavy machinery, fast handling equipments, high heat and pressure pipes, polluted and explosive areas where people work in a relatively small area. Therefore, in an environment where situational awareness and tactical decision making are critical elements to a successful operation, it is really important to have available efficient instruments to ensure the safety for all operators that work in the field. Despite the fact that a lot sophisticated solutions have been used for increasing request due to the growing need of safety concerns by the operators, the mission-critical environments are still considered high-risk environments with serious work safety related issues and higher accident rates than in other workplaces. This study focuses on the safety precautions in outdoor and indoor environments, safety communication and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and proposes solutions to ensure secure and reliable communications between forces deployed in the field and their dispatch center, which is often of decisive importance for the work of the emergency services, analyzing two different important case studies. Moreover, we have designed a control system intended as a platform for real-time information capable of monitoring, by means of camera and sensor data harvesting about people and vehicles movements. It provides automatic and semi-automatic risk prevention measures thanks to the work in progress on designing and implementing a first working prototype of sensor network based on RFID BAN. These capabilities are the topic of a larger research project that aims to find the optimal solution in terms of feasibility and practical implementation. To conclude our study, we have developed a indoor navigation system for mobile devices. The application is able to follow the user and it indicates the shortest path to achieve a specific destination. It uses only smartphone motion sensor and not requires the use of extra equipment. Moreover, thanks to an algorithm widely explained afterwards {{and the use of the}} gyroscope sensor rather than the compass, the mobile application ensure a very good orientation. The thesis is organized as following: - In the first chapter, to design a radio communication system both for health emergency services and Civil Protection services, different Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) standards was analized. PMR, also known as land mobile radio (LMR) in North America, are field radio communications systems which use portable, mobile, base station, and dispatch console radios. It has referred to a suite of radio mobile network tecnologies deployed for missioncritical users, which need high affordable communication system. In the specific, PMR networks provide radio services for closed user group, group call and push-to-talk, and call set-up times which are generally short compared with cellular system. In addition, they provide communications in extreme situations that might cause failures in other communications network, like 2 G or 3 G. As a result of the analysis of the main digital PMR standards (TETRA and DMR) used in European countries, we decided to use the DMR standard to design the radio network for 118 service in Sardinia and for Civil Protection service. DMR has been identified as the best solution, which grants cost saving, high coverage, spectral efficiency and simplicity in network configuration and it is well suitable in wide area with a low/medium density of traffic. - The second and third chapter of the thesis are focused on improvement of the safety of operators in a maritime cargo terminal. Hence, a new infrastructure of a maritime cargo terminal has been defined, using a control system for monitoring workplace safety. By combining, in the control system, the inputs from a Body Area Network (BAN) integrated in the safety equipment and from CCTV cameras, a human supervisor is able to achieve an accurate overview of the entire situation in terms of work safety and act accordingly when needed. In addition, we focused even on the design and implementation of a working prototype of an RFID-based BAN sensor network for actively monitoring and preventing workplace safety risks in the same industrial area. This first conceptual and technological analysis, together with the test implementation, is the forerunner of a complex monitoring system in development to be implemented both for the specific case and for any industrial environment. - The last chapter aims to describe an indoor navigation system developed for smartphone android. Specifically, it has been demonstrated how the use of a gyroscope sensor can brings more benefits respect to a compass sensor to get the best detected position. Nowadays, modern mobile devices, such as smartphones and PDAs in general, come to the market already equipped with sensors able to track them as they move, both in outdoor and indoor environment. The sensing technologies embedded in such devices make it ideal for a wide range of location-based services, such as navigation applications. An Inertial Navigation System (INS) uses motion and rotation sensors in order to determine the position, orientation, and velocity of a moving object/user without the need of external infrastructures. This is essential in an indoor environment where common localization systems, such as Global Positioning System (GPS), fail due to severe attenuation or obscuration of the satellite's signal. In inertial navigation systems, localization/ orientation estimation is source-independent. The user's position is calculated in relation to a known starting position using a dead reckoning algorithm and the orientation is usually provided by a digital compass embedded in the smartphone. A digital compass sensor provides the orientation of the device relative to the magnetic north of the earth. However, when it is used in indoor environments, like any magnetic device, it is affected by significant error caused by nearby ferrous materials, as well as local electromagnetic fields. Such errors seriously affect the performance and the accuracy of the system, thus the need to investigate any alternative orientation technique. In the specific, we have developed an early prototype of a pedestrian navigation system for indoor environments based on dead reckoning, 2 D barcodes and data from accelerometers and magnetometers. All the sensing and computing technologies of our solution are available in common <b>smartphones.</b> The <b>prototype</b> has been further improved by a new algorithm described afterwards and now it is able to estimate the correct current position of the user, track him inside the building and provide the best path to achieve a specific destination...|$|R
