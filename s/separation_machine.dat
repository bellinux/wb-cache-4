50|$|The Condor Dense Medium Separator (DMS) is a multi-stage, high {{efficiency}} media <b>separation</b> <b>machine</b> for mineral processing {{operations at the}} rougher and scavenger stage. It is typically used in a pre-concentration duty prior to processing or milling to reject barren material. The unit is manufactured with either two or three stages of separation depending on the media {{with one or two}} valuable densities resulting, while the unit can produce up to four products from one dense medium vessel altogether. The Condor DMS can take a larger feed particle size compared to a DMS cyclone of the same diameter and capacity, and is capable of handling higher sinks or floats loading without affecting performance. The valuable dense material (or 'sinks') can be combined or separated at the final stage and is then pumped onto the next process in the circuit.Sepro Mineral Systems Corp. supplies customizable DMS Plants {{for a wide variety of}} application requirements. Sepro’s standard two product (concentrate, tailings) DMS Plant utilizes a two-stage Condor Separator and single density medium circuit, while the three product (concentrate, middlings, tailings) DMS Plant utilizes a three-stage Condor Separator and two medium circuits at high and low density.|$|E

40|$|The {{auditory}} {{system as}} a <b>separation</b> <b>machine</b> This paper is written from the hypothetical standpoint that the auditory system is designed to separate sounds rather than just detect, discriminate, or recognize them. Auditory structures and processing mechanisms are judged {{on their ability to}} produce a &quot;separable representation &quot; in which correlates of different sources can be selected or ignored. The cochlear filter is assumed to split acoustic information into band-limited channels, rather than just produce a spectral representation (Fourier transformation). Tonotopy, prevalent throughout the auditory system, is assumed to reflect the need to keep the channels apart, rather than the mere repetition of a spectral representation. Between-channel segregation is supplemented by withinchannel segregation based on time-domain processing, both binaural (cross-correlation and equalization-cancellation), an...|$|E

40|$|Recovery of edible flesh by meat/bone {{separators}} The {{production of}} fish paste {{products such as}} Kamaboko (fish paste) and chukawa (fish sausage) is an ancient tradition in Japan, {{and it is only}} recently that the industry has developed into a mass production enterprise (Tanikawa 1963). To produce the quantity of boneless, ground fish required for this industry, the Japanese have developed a range of machines by which the material can be processed, and an appropriate technology to ensure quality standards are met. These developments have proved to be very successful, and the principles developed by the Japanese are now being adopted by a number of industries throughout the world. The success of the meat/bone <b>separation</b> <b>machines</b> is largely due to their versatility, and the high yields of edible fish flesh that can be recovered. Using this process most species of fish will yield 55 % of edible material (King and Carver 1970), although flat fish may yield as little as 25 % (Tanikawa 1963) and species such as Blue Marlin may yield up to 70 % edible fish (King and Carver 1970) ...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} problems in breeding for Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance lies in the difficulty of assessing the disease. At the present time, researchers generally measure disease incidence and severity in the field, deoxynivalenol (DON) content and percentage Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK). FDK is presently measured in two ways: i) visual comparison of samples with reference samples and ii) manual separation of diseased and healthy kernels. Visual comparison of samples is a quick way of assessing FDK but is arguably too subjective. On the other hand, manual separation could be less subjective but is highly time consuming. Furthermore in manual separation, due {{to the amount of}} work that it takes, only small samples (e. g. 100 kernels) can be evaluated. This may not be an adequately representative sample size. To improve the efficiency of FDK measurement we should look for a method that: (i) reduces subjectivity, (ii) reduces the amount of work and time required, and (iii) allows increased sample size. To achieve this, two new methods are being proposed: air separation and digital photo analysis. Air separation methods have long been used in the seed industry for seed conditioning purposes and in seed labs to measure the proportion of different components of seed samples. An air <b>separation</b> <b>machine</b> was specifically developed from a Precision Machine head thresher and a Shop-Vac vacuum to separate scabb...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a basic study of the Tamarind fruit separation mechanism (Tamarindus indica sp) as a part of design process on Tamarind seedless processing machine. Initial design of Tamarind seeds <b>separation</b> <b>machine</b> was made by studying the work of slashing unit and seed separation unit. Tamarind seedless processing machine consist of slicer and peeler. The slicer function is to slice the fruit before it sent into peeler unit which contains two cylindrical peeler. The peeler unit installed parallel so it let through the fruit pulp but still hold the Tamarind seeds that had been separated by the separator unit. Tamarind seeds separation prototype model has been succesfully made. Model testing was done by measuring the rotary speed of spindle peelers on 1065 rpm which considered work effectively for the test load of 100 grams, 200 grams and 300 grams. Further, shaft torque measurements in the process of peeling showed a significant increase in value and it is proportional to the increase in load level for all treatments.

We can say it is related to field of computer–human interaction. There are different challenges in this field like understanding of natural language i. e. allowing machines to have understanding from natural language of human beings. Mostly available tasks of natural language processing are: analysis of discourse, morphological <b>separation,</b> <b>machine</b> translation, generation and understanding of natural language, recognition of named entities, part of speech tagging, recognition of optical characters, recognition of speech and analysis of sentiments etc. Current research in NLP is showing more interest on learning algorithms which are either unsupervised or semi-supervised in nature. These techniques of learning can perform this task of learning from data which is not annotated manually with required answers or by applying mixture of non-annotated & annotated data. Normally, this job is very hard as compared to learning which is supervised & usually shows little correct results for particular amount of data as input. But there is large quantity of data is available which is non annotated in nature i. e. whole contents available on world wide web and it normally produces less accurate results.

50|$|In 1995, Costner began {{developing}} oil <b>separation</b> <b>machines</b> {{based on}} a patent he purchased from the US government. The machines developed by the company were of little commercial interest until the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, when BP took six of the machines from a company in which Costner owned an interest, Ocean Therapy Solutions, for testing in late May 2010. On June 16, 2010, BP entered into a lease with Ocean Therapy Solutions for 32 of the oil-water separation devices. Although Spyron Contoguris and Stephen Baldwin previously sold their interests in Ocean Therapy Solutions in mid-June to another investor in the company, they filed a lawsuit in Louisiana District Court claiming $10.64 million for securities fraud and misrepresentation. The suit claimed that Costner kept a meeting with BP secret from them, and the secret meeting resulted in an $18-million {{down payment on a}} $52 million purchase, and that after the down payment, but before any announcement, another investor used part of the downpayment to buy out their shares, thus excluding them from their share of the profits from the total sale.

The paper investigates job re-shaping and virtual-machine resizing, the effects which the efficiency curve of the jobs has on performance, and the potential for predictability of performance under different resource allocation...|$|R
