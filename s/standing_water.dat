5|$|The lichen {{typically}} {{grows on}} rough bark in sheltered and shaded habitats in moist and dense subtropical forests. More rarely, {{it is found}} on rocks or on leaves. In the USA it occurs in hammocks (hardwood forests) and swamps which have <b>standing</b> <b>water,</b> {{at least part of}} the year. It is also common in oak or oak-pine scrub vegetation. The species is often associated with Cryptothecia striata in the USA.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} vector control, {{a number of}} novel methods {{have been used to}} reduce {{mosquito}} numbers with some success including the placement of the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) or copepods in <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> to eat the mosquito larvae. There are also trials with genetically modified male A.aegypti that after release into the wild mate with females, and render their offspring unable to fly.|$|E
5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of <b>standing</b> <b>water,</b> either {{natural or}} {{man-made}}, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E

5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. <b>Standing</b> <b>water</b> {{can cause}} the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward. Out at sea, ships {{take advantage of their}} known characteristics by navigating through their weaker, western half.|$|E
5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use the flowing and <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is {{native to}} the Northern Hemisphere, and {{distributed}} across Eurasia, North America and the British Isles, where there is open bog, heath, wetland and moorland, with <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> and calcareous peat or acidic soil.

The resulting mess would coat every surface, converting the city into a toxic marsh until water could be drained. Some experts said that it could take six months or longer to pump all the water out of the city.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the main Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions each lasted ninety minutes. The third session was held on Saturday morning and lasted an hour. The first practice session was initially held in wet-weather conditions before less rain fell and drivers were required to adapt to changing levels of grip. Full wet tyres {{were used in the}} session's opening period before the field utilised intermediate tyres in its closing minutes. The conditions prevented the teams from collecting data on how the dry-compound tyres would perform. Adrian Sutil was the fastest driver with a time of 1:25.701 seconds, ahead of Massa who spun several times and had the fastest time until Sutil's lap. Jenson Button was third-fastest despite complaining about his car's handling, ahead of Rubens Barrichello (who spun at high-speed at turn three after driving into a large amount of <b>standing</b> <b>water)</b> and Vitaly Petrov. Rosberg and Sébastien Buemi were sixth and seventh-fastest. Nico Hülkenberg, Vitantonio Liuzzi and Pedro de la Rosa rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. Hamilton drove over <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> at the exit of the turn three left-hander twenty minutes before the session ended and slid sideways into the turn four tyre barrier, heavily damaging his car.|$|E
5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E

40|$|A multimetric fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was {{composed}} {{to assess the}} biotic integrity of Flandrian water bodies. As fish communities differ substantially between <b>standing</b> <b>waters,</b> running waters of the bream zone and running waters of the barbel zone, eight candidate metrics {{for each of these}} water types or zones were identified, representing three major classes of biological attributes. These are species richness and composition, fish condition and abundance, trophic composition. The metrics were tested and modified where needed. The IBI was applied throughout Flanders on 104 locations in <b>standing</b> <b>waters,</b> 500 locations in waters of the bream zone and 257 locations in waters of the barbel zone. <b>Standing</b> <b>waters</b> scored substantially different from running <b>waters.</b> <b>Standing</b> <b>waters</b> rarely contained no fish at all, but their fish communities were very often poor to very poor. Waters of the bream and barbel zone were often fishless (respectively 40 % and 35 % of all locations contain no fish), but the locations with fish usually scored reasonable to poor. Only 18. 5 % of all locations were classified as reasonable to excellent (IBI classes 4 or lower on a scale from 1 to 9) and were considered to satisfy the basic ecological quality demands. The Leie-, Dijle-, Dender- and Schelde-basins had a very poor quality (more than 50 % of the locations contained no fish). The Maas-, Grote and Kleine Nete-basins scored rather well, with respectively, 44 %, 48 % and 68 % of the locations achieving an IBI of 4 or lower. The IBI is a valuable and complementary tool to assess the ecological quality of water bodies as suggested in the proposal for a Water Framework Directive by the European Commission. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Damage in New Jersey was minor. The state Emergency Management office {{reported}} two gas leaks in Gloucester County. In Burlington, Temple B'nai Israel's synagogue building, built during 1801, sustained {{some water}} damage when tremor-caused {{openings in the}} roof allowed <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> to leak in, and about 20 bricks fell, damaging a congregant's car. In Camden, a vacant house partially collapsed, and government buildings were evacuated, with city workers given the option of returning home for the day. Due to damage done by the quake, the municipal government of Woodbury reported that the historic Colonel George Gill Green Opera House, which was built during 1880, would be razed, but instead it was renovated to provide housing for senior citizens. No other infrastructure damage {{was reported in the}} state.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rain {{continued}} {{to affect the}} track in the second practice session. Conditions deteriorated as the session advanced, and several cars elected not to improve their quickest times to avoid driving off the track after going through <b>standing</b> <b>water.</b> Conditions allowed the fastest LMP2 and LMGTE vehicles {{to reach the top}} five quickest overall times. Bamber recorded the fastest time at 2:25.495, nearly half a second faster than Bernhard in the sister Porsche in second. Lotterer was third-fastest and had the fastest time early in the session. Evans achieved the only time under the 2:34.500 mark in LMP2 with a lap of 2:34.370. Lietz led LMGTE Pro with No. 83 AF Corse Ferrari of Rui Águas the fastest driver in LMGTE Am.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains {{from the}} remnant {{low-pressure}} area of Bonnie led to heavy rains {{in several states}} in the Southeastern United States. Rainfall was generally minor in most areas, however in Arkansas, rains totaled up to 11.75in (254mm) at the South Arkansas Regional Airport. Several roads were washed out in Ouachita County near Elliott. A number of roads and bridges were also washed out in Union County, with damage totaling $200,000.

5|$|In Grévy's zebras and {{the wild}} ass species, adults have more fluid {{associations}} and adult males will establish large territories and monopolize the females that enter them. These species live in habitats with sparser resources and <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with non-lactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but will remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource. Some feral populations of horse exhibit features of both the harem and territorial social systems.|$|E
5|$|On August23, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{deployed}} 717 personnel, {{mainly from}} the disaster response team, to the affected regions in the United States. The following day, 564 National Guard troops were deployed in the state. In the days following the storm, many mosquitoes and other insects laid eggs in areas of <b>standing</b> <b>water,</b> causing a large increase in their numbers. Authorities sprayed insecticide to minimize the potential for disease outbreaks. By August25, all shelters opened prior to Bret were closed as residents were allowed to return home. On August26, President Bill Clinton added the counties of Brooks, Duval, Jim Wells and Webb to the major disaster declaration area. This allowed residents in those counties to receive federal funding.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} two centuries, {{tropical}} cyclones {{have been responsible for}} the deaths of about 1.9 million people worldwide. Large areas of <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> caused by flooding lead to infection, as well as contributing to mosquito-borne illnesses. Crowded evacuees in shelters increase the risk of disease propagation. Tropical cyclones significantly interrupt infrastructure, leading to power outages, bridge destruction, and the hampering of reconstruction efforts. On average, the Gulf and east coasts of the United States suffer approximately US $5 billion (1995 US $) in cyclone damage every year. The majority (83%) of tropical cyclone damage is caused by severe hurricanes, category 3 or greater. However, category 3 or greater hurricanes only account for about one-fifth of cyclones that make landfall every year.|$|E

5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It has been proved that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E
5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car but was stopped after three laps {{because of a}} large amount of <b>standing</b> <b>water</b> on the circuit. After a 45-minute delay, the race was {{restarted}} and the safety car pulled into the pit lane after thirteen laps. Pole sitter Sebastian Vettel maintained his lead going into the first corner. A second safety car deployment caused by the collision of Mark Webber and Nico Rosberg on lap nineteen closed up the field but Vettel retained the lead. Alonso maintained second position until a botched pit stop during a third safety-car period caused him to drop to third. At the restart on lap thirty-five, Hamilton ran wide at the first corner, allowing Alonso back into second place. Vettel's engine failed eleven laps later, allowing Alonso to move into the lead, which he maintained to win the race.|$|E
