[...] The Clinton administration then said that the hiring practices for household help would be examined for all of the more than thousand presidential appointments under consideration, causing the whole process to slow down significantly.

Today more than 20 years later the {{convention}} is ratified by all countries in the world except the USA. A question asked is however if the convention after 20 years of development work has in fact accomplished some positive effects for children around the world?   The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in <b>selected</b> <b>states</b> and to reach this aim some questions need to be answered:   What do the <b>selected</b> <b>states</b> do to realize {{the best interest of the}} child?

Do all children in the <b>selected</b> <b>states</b> have the same right to health and health services?

The <b>selected</b> <b>states</b> represent almost all the regions of India i. e. Kerala from South, Maharashtra from West and Bihar/Jharkhand from North-East. The districts of the <b>selected</b> <b>States</b> are ranked based on {{the values of the}} index. When the researcher compared the district level value of this index with the Human Development index value, the researcher found that the two values are highly correlated with each other for the State of Maharashtra. Hence this method can be used to study the economic conditions of the districts of the States and can be used as an alternative to HDI values as district level HDI values are not available for all states...|$|R
