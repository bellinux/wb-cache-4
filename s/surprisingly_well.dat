5|$|Some {{scholars}} have disagreed with parts of Watson's proposal, {{arguing that the}} four staple crops were already widely disseminated before that period, and that Islamic irrigation built on rather than replacing the Roman irrigation network in Spain. Against this, the historian Paolo Squatriti, reviewing Watson's paper 40 years on, noted that it had proven useful to many different historical agendas, and had held up <b>surprisingly</b> <b>well</b> {{in the face of}} new findings in archaeology and archaeobotany.|$|E

The {{reactions to the}} match were mixed; some people thought that Taylor performed <b>surprisingly</b> <b>well</b> for a non-wrestler. Others thought that the WWF pushing a football player to defeat a wrestler made professional wrestling look bad. Reviews of the event as a whole have also been mixed, and the event has been called both the worst WrestleMania of all time and the event that saved the WWF.|$|E

5|$|Modulation {{of neural}} {{responses}} may correlate with phenomenal experiences. In {{contrast to the}} raw electrical responses that do not correlate with consciousness, the modulation of these responses by other stimuli correlates <b>surprisingly</b> <b>well</b> with {{an important aspect of}} consciousness: namely with the phenomenal experience of stimulus intensity (brightness, contrast). In the research group of Danko Nikolić {{it has been shown that}} some of the changes in the subjectively perceived brightness correlated with the modulation of firing rates while others correlated with the modulation of neural synchrony. An fMRI investigation suggested that these findings were strictly limited to the primary visual areas. This indicates that, in the primary visual areas, changes in firing rates and synchrony can be considered as neural correlates of qualia—at least for some type of qualia.|$|E
5|$|Promotion for Wonderwall Music {{consisted}} of print advertising, including a full-page advertisement in the 14 December issue of Billboard magazine, and an Apple-prepared poster that superimposed details from Gill's painting onto {{a photo of}} Harrison. The album's commercial impact was lessened by its unusual position of being the soundtrack to a film that had yet to receive a general release. The album failed to chart in the United Kingdom, but performed <b>surprisingly</b> <b>well</b> in the United States. On Billboards pop LPs listings, it had a sixteen-week chart run, peaking at number 49 for two weeks in March 1969. On the US Cash Box and Record World charts, the album peaked at numbers 39 and 33, respectively. Wonderwall Music also placed in the top 30 on Canada's RPM albums chart and in West Germany, where it peaked at number 22.|$|E

5|$|Although his {{administration}} {{was marked by}} a relative absence of major military or political conflicts, Titus faced {{a number of major}} disasters during his brief reign. On August 24, 79, barely two months after his accession, Mount Vesuvius erupted, resulting in the almost complete destruction of life and property in the cities and resort communities around the Bay of Naples. The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under metres of stone and lava, killing thousands of citizens. Titus appointed two ex-consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort, while personally donating large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano. Additionally, he visited Pompeii once after the eruption and again the following year. The city was lost for nearly 1700 years before its accidental rediscovery in 1748. Since then, its excavation has provided an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of a city {{at the height of the}} Roman Empire, frozen at the moment it was buried on August 24, 79. The Forum, the baths, many houses, and some out-of-town villas like the Villa of the Mysteries remain <b>surprisingly</b> <b>well</b> preserved. Today, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Italy and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On-going excavations reveal new insights into the Roman history and culture.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson {{began his}} {{re-election}} campaign. Eugene McCarthy ran against {{him for the}} nomination on an anti-war platform.

The resulting blow to the Johnson campaign, taken together with other factors, led the President to make a surprise announcement in a March 31 televised speech that he was {{pulling out of the}} race. He also announced the initiation of the Paris Peace Negotiations with Vietnam in that speech. Then, on August 4, 1969, U.S. representative Henry Kissinger and North Vietnamese representative Xuan Thuy began secret peace negotiations at the apartment of French intermediary Jean Sainteny in Paris.|$|E

25|$|The P-40's {{lack of a}} {{two-speed}} supercharger made it {{inferior to}} Luftwaffe fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109 or the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 in high-altitude combat and it was rarely used in operations in Northwest Europe. However, between 1941 and 1944, the P-40 {{played a critical role}} with Allied air forces in three major theaters: North Africa, the Southwest Pacific, and China. It also had {{a significant role in the}} Middle East, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Alaska and Italy. The P-40's performance at high altitudes was not as important in those theaters, where it served as an air superiority fighter, bomber escort and fighter-bomber. Although it gained a postwar reputation as a mediocre design, suitable only for close air support, recent research including scrutiny of the records of individual Allied squadrons indicates that this was not the case: the P-40 performed <b>surprisingly</b> <b>well</b> as an air superiority fighter, at times suffering severe losses but also taking a very heavy toll of enemy aircraft. The P-40 offered the additional advantage of low cost, which kept it in production as a ground-attack aircraft long after it was obsolete as a fighter.|$|E
25|$|An eight-game unbeaten streak {{came to a}} gut-wrenching end in Philadelphia. Despite {{playing an}} {{unfamiliar}} midfield that included Markus Halsti and Miguel Aguilar getting their first starts ever for United, and Michael Farfan in his second start, United seemed headed to an earning a point with a scoreless draw against the Philadelphia Union. After using all three substitutions, United was suddenly shorthanded in the game's final minutes, when Silva left the match because of a hamstring injury. In the 3rd minute of stoppage time, Zach Pfeffer got the winning goal for the Union. Traveling to Foxboro the next weekend to play the New England Revolution, United seemed headed to a dispiriting second straight loss, trailing 1-0 at halftime. When two players were shown red cards {{early in the second}} half, there was reason to expect United to rally and take the 3 points. Nonetheless, the team struggled to generate good chances. Desperate to find the tying goal, Coach Olsen even turned to a new player, Facundo Coria, who had been signed only the week before. Coria reward the move, sending a pass to Kemp in the left corner, and Kemp's cross found the foot of the streaking Arrieta, who scored the equalizing goal in a 1–1 draw that kept United on top of the Eastern Conference. United finished a hugely challenging road trip, playing the 3rd straight road game over an 8-day span, against the Portland Timbers. Because of injuries and tired legs, Olsen rolled out a decidedly second-choice lineup that featured a midfield consisting of Halsti, Aguilar, Jared Jeffrey and Luke Mishu. These players had a combined two starts in prior matches. Jeffrey was making only his second appearance in 2015 for United, and Mishu was not only starting for the first time, but making his first ever appearance in an MLS match. The makeshift lineup played <b>surprisingly</b> <b>well,</b> especially in the second half, but an early turnover by Kemp led to the game's only goal, as United left Portland empty-handed, with a 1–0 loss.|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{railroad}} track {{that existed in the}} Confederacy was of simple rail-way design just meant to carry the large bales of cotton to local river ports in the harvest season. [...] These often did not connect to other rail-lines making internal shipments of goods difficult at best. While the Union had a large navy, the new Confederate Navy had only a few captured warships or newly built vessels. [...] These did <b>surprisingly</b> <b>well</b> but ultimately were sunk or abandoned as the Union Navy controlled more rivers and ports. [...] Rebel 'raiders' loosed on the Northern ships on the Atlantic did tremendous damage and sent Yankee ships into safe harbors as insurance rates soared. [...] The Union blockade of the South, however, made imports via blockade runners difficult and expensive. [...] Somewhat awkwardly, these runners didn't bring significant amounts of the war materials so greatly needed but rather the European luxuries sought as a relief from the privations of the war-time's stark conditions.|$|E

40|$|The Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian {{describes}} {{the competition between}} superfluidity and Mott insulating behavior at zero temperature and commensurate filling as {{the strength of the}} on-site repulsion is varied. Gapped insulating phases also occur at non-integer densities as a consequence of longer ranged repulsive interactions. In this paper we explore the formation of gapped phases in coupled chains due instead to anisotropies t_x ≠ t_y in the bosonic hopping, extending the work of Crepin et al. [Phys. Rev. B 84, 054517 (2011) ] on two coupled chains, where a gap was shown to occur at half filling for arbitrarily small interchain hopping t_y. Our main result is that, unlike the two-leg chains, for three- and four-leg chains, a charge gap requires a finite nonzero critical t_y to open. However, these finite values are <b>surprisingly</b> small, <b>well</b> below the analogous values required for a fermionic band gap to open. Comment: 8 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
