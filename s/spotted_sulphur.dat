50|$|Emmelia trabealis, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the <b>Spotted</b> <b>sulphur,</b> is a species of moth of the family Noctuidae.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>Sulphur</b> can {{be found}} in most of Europe, in North Africa, the Middle East and Russia to {{northern}} China and Japan. It was formerly resident in Great Britain, but has not been seen at any known breeding colonies since 25 June 1960 and is presumed extinct there.|$|E
50|$|The {{name means}} in English: sulphur wave. It {{comes from the}} <b>sulphur</b> <b>spots</b> which have {{coloured}} its sides. But there are other colours, too: green from mosses, black and blue from lava and ashes, red from iron in the earth. It {{could very well be}} the most colourful mountain of Iceland and so its picture is often found in books and calendars.|$|R
50|$|The districts around Luton in Bedfordshire and the {{neighbouring}} counties were, {{since the beginning}} of the 17th century, the British home of the straw-plait industry. The straw of certain varieties of wheat cultivated in that region is, in favourable seasons, possessed of a fine bright color and due to tenacity and strength. The straw is cut as in ordinary harvesting, but is allowed to dry in the sun, before binding. Subsequently straws are selected from the sheaves, and of these the pipes of the two upper joints are taken for plaiting. The pipes are assorted into sizes by passing them through graduated openings in a grilled wire frame, and those of good color are bleached by the fumes of <b>sulphur.</b> <b>Spotted</b> and discoloured straws are dyed either in pipe or in plait. The plaiters work up the material in a damp state, either into whole straw or split straw plaits. Split straws are prepared with the aid of a small instrument having a projecting point which enters the straw pipe, and from which radiate the number of knife-edged cutters into which the straw is to be split. The straws were put through a small mangle to flatten them. They were then braided to produce a woven strip which was sold on to the makers of hats, baskets and other wares.|$|R
