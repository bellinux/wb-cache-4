Studies show that springbok host helminths (Haemonchus, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus), ixodid ticks (Rhipicephalus species), lice (Damalinia and Linognathus species). Eimeria species mainly affect juveniles.|$|E

However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to understand the trends and research hotspots of clinical nursing in China and abroad, thereby to provide guidance for nursing practice and studies. Methods: We retrieved clinical nursing literature (excluding literature related to psychological nursing and traditional Chinese medicine nursing) cited in Wanfang Data (www. wanfangdata. com. cn) and PubMed between 2007 and 2015 and subsequently performed bibliometric analyses on article volume, journal, clustering of high-frequency keywords, and co-occurrence of keywords. Results: A total of 10374 publications, excluding those related to psychological nursing, were retrieved via a PubMed search. The literature displayed a rising trend in terms of annual publication volume. The journal distribution of clinical nursing publications overall was consistent with Bradford's Law. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2007 and 2009 included: (1) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> effects of the midwife and midwifery methods for natural childbirth; (2) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> emergency nursing care; (3) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> dementia care; (4) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> bandage dressing in trauma nursing; and (5) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> quality of life in cancer patients nursing. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2010 and 2012 included: (1) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> obstetric nurseâpatient relationships; (2) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> patients' medical team in stroke nursing; (3) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> cancer nursing methods; (4) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> nursing patients with trauma related to urinary incontinence; and (5) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> {{the quality of life of}} caregivers of dementia patients. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2013 and 2015 included (1) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> skin care and bandaging in trauma nursing; (2) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> evidence-based nursing in AIDS care; (3) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> nurses' role in obstetric nurseâpatient relationships; <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> cancer nursing methods; (4) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> nursing for Alzheimer's disease and dementia; and (5) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> caregivers and nursing of stroke patients. A Wanfang Data search retrieved a total of 85570 publications, whose volume also exhibited an annual rising trend, in particular with regard to those in core journals. However, percentage of total publication volume, mean cited frequency per article, and total ranking of clinical nursing publications overall displayed a decreasing trend. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2007 and 2009 included: (1) diabetes nursing; (2) nursing for cancer; (3) nursing for senility-related diseases; (4) nursing in the event of complications; (5) nursing for hypertension; (6) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> quality of life after nursing interventions; (7) chemotherapy nursing; (8) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> compliance after nursing interventions; (9) constipation nursing; and (10) nursing for stroke patients. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2010 and 2012 included: (1) diabetes nursing; (2) nursing for cancer; (3) nursing for senility-related diseases; (4) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> quality of life after nursing interventions; (5) nursing in the event of complications; (6) nursing for hypertension; (7) prevention nursing; (8) perioperative nursing; (9) pain nursing; and (10) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> compliance after nursing interventions. The main contents of clinical nursing literature between 2013 and 2015 included: (1) diabetes nursing; (2) nursing in the event of complications; (3) cancer nursing; (4) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> quality of life after nursing interventions; (5) nursing for stroke patients; (6) nursing for the elderly; (7) <b>studies</b> <b>on</b> compliance after nursing interventions; (8) nursing for hypertension; (9) constipation nursing; and (10) prevention nursing. Conclusions: Clinical nursing research in China is in a rapid development stage as defined by Price's law whereby there is a rapid growth in publication volume. By comparison, clinical nursing research in developed countries is in the stable development stage or maturation phase, which is characterized by a flat curve of publication volume and stable development rate. There is a gap of 25 â 30 years between China and these countries in terms of the growth phases of clinical nursing literature.
