40|$|The {{effects of}} {{preference}} revelation on allocational and Pareto efficiency are studied in a multi-attribute reverse English auction. Multi-attribute reverse auctions {{have been proposed}} as market institutions for electronic request for quotation buying processes. Preference revelation is a crucial question in multi-attribute reverse auctions {{in terms of the}} efficiency of auction outcomes. Results from a computer-based laboratory experiment are reported and auction outcomes are analyzed regarding the buyer’s and suppliers ’ surplus, efficiency, and Pareto efficiency. The results show that suppliers make more profits when preferences are revealed, but not {{at the expense of the}} buyer, and that full revelation of the buyer’s preferences significantly increases allocational and Pareto efficiency.

50|$|JDEBASE is the {{database}} middleware that provides platform-independent {{application program interfaces}} APIs for multi-vendor database access. These APIs are used in two ways. The first way is by JDE applications that dynamically generate platform-specific Structured QueryLanguage (SQL), depending on the data <b>source</b> <b>request.</b> The second way is as open APIs for advanced C language business function writing. JDE uses these APIs to dynamically generate platform-specific SQL statements. Thus, this middleware provides workstation-to-server and server-to-server database access. To accomplish this, both the legacy JDE OneWorld middleware {{as well as the}} newer JDE EnterpriseOne middleware incorporate database driver support for a variety of third-party database drivers including ODBC, for connection to Microsoft SQL server, OCI, for connection to Oracle database and Client Access 400 drivers for connectivity to IBM DB2.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Phishing emails usually {{contain a}} message from a {{credible}} looking <b>source</b> <b>requesting</b> a user to click a link to a website where user is asked to enter a password or other confidential information. Most phishing emails aim at withdrawing money from financial institutions or getting access to private information. Phishing has increased enormously {{over the last years}} and is a serious threat to global security and economy. Phishing attacks are becoming more frequent and sophisticated. There are a number of possible countermeasures to phishing. A number of anti-phishing solutions have been proposed to date. Some approaches attempt to solve the phishing problem at the e-mail level. A technique must be capable of determining whether an email is legitimate or a phishing, given only the URL and the email content. URL and textual content analysis of email will results in a highl...|$|R

40|$|ISBN 978 - 953 - 307 - 183 - 1 In {{this book}} chapter, we have {{proposed}} UEP coding theory for the flexible design of network codes for multi-source multi-relay cooperative networks.

This offers a great flexibility for the efficient design of network codes for cooperative networks, as energy consumption, performance, number of time-slots required to achieve the desired diversity gain, and complexity at the relay nodes for performing NC can be traded-off by taking into account the specific and actual needs of each source, and without the constraint of over-engineering (e. g., working in a larger Galois field or using more time-slots than actually required) the system according {{to the needs of the}} <b>source</b> <b>requesting</b> the highest diversity gain...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} call {{admission}} control in Integrated Services Networks is to offer a guarantee that Quality of Service (QoS) bounds are not violated due to the admission of new calls into the network. This is typically accomplished using the declared worst-case traffic descriptors for incoming calls, a solution which results in poor bandwidth utilization. A measurement-based admission scheme is an appealing alternative: {{not only does it}} offer adaptivity to changing traffic conditions, it also allows statistical multiplexing gains to be exploited. In this paper, we examine the problem of determining which traffic characterization a measurement-based admission control algorithm should require of <b>sources</b> <b>requesting</b> access. Building on the work of [1], we also propose an adaptive measurement-based admission control algorithm that simplifies the estimation process. We test the new algorithm under different traffic scenarios and show that it can achieve a high level of utilization without vio [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Robinson {{and others}} have {{recently}} called for dynamic and collaborative digital scholarly editions. Annotation is a key component for editions that are not merely passive, read-only repositories of knowledge. Annotation facilities (both annotation creation and display), however, require complex software, and if only for that reason {{it makes sense to}} share these facilities among edition sites. The paper argues we therefore need a protocol for requesting (and serving) annotations, and a markup vocabulary for storing annotations. The paper proposes a SANE (Scholarly ANnotation Exchange) Request Protocol (SANE-RP) and a SANE Markup Language (SANE-ML) and shows an experimental implementation of these in annotations to a digitised emblem book. The edition (the process that generates the edition HTML from the edition XML <b>source)</b> <b>requests</b> annotation information from an annotation server using SANE-RP. The annotation server serves out the annotations (created using the annotation tool EDITOR) stored in SANE-ML...|$|R
