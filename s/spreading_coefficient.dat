40|$|The {{microstructure}} of {{a contact}} line formed by a liquid and its pure vapor on a perfectly-wetted superheated smooth substrate, with the disjoining pressure {{most often in}} the form of a positive inverse cubic law (non-polar case), is routinely considered to end up in a microfilm extended over adjacent "dry" parts of the solid surface. Invoking the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> as an additional independent parameter within this framework, we argue however that a regime with a truncated microfilm is chosen instead if the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> is decreased below a positive (still perfect wetting) critical value dependent upon the superheat, in which case the extended-microfilm thickness is surpassed by that of the "pancake" introduced by de Gennes and coworkers. Conversely, for a given positive <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient,</b> there is a critical superheat above which the microfilm gets truncated, whereas for a negative one (partial wetting) the truncated regime should be preferred at any superheat. A parametric study of the apparent contact angle (a nonlinear eigenvalue of the steady microstructure problem) versus the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> is carried out. When the latter is negative, Young's law is asymptotically recovered. Microfilm fronts are shown to be advancing or receding in accordance with the selected regime. A slightly more general class of disjoining pressures is also touched upon. The analysis is based in part upon thermodynamic considerations, and in part upon a standard one-sided model of an evaporating liquid layer in the lubrication approximation.

The powders were largely hydrophobic in nature, and as such were difficult to disperse in the liquid. It was determined that dispersion was possible only if the negative <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> of water over the powder did not have a significantly larger value than the dispersion component of the water.

40|$|Keywords: emulsion, <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient,</b> surface tension, emulsifier, whipped cream, dairy foam, partial {{coalescence}} In this thesis, {{the interaction}} between emulsion droplets and expanding air/water interfaces was investigated. The objective was to deepen our knowledge concerning the physical processes that {{take place at the}} expanding air surfaces that form during aeration of emulsions. Emulsions can become aerated as a result of various processing operations, for example, stirring or pouring. Moreover, emulsions may be aerated with the intention of producing an aerated food product such as whipped cream or ice cream. Emulsion droplet/air interaction can have important consequences for emulsion stability. For example, emulsion droplet spreading at the air/water interface can initiate a collective oil spreading mechanism, resulting in the spreading of many oil droplets. This may lead to coalescence of the emulsion droplets. The tendency for an oil droplet to spread at an expanding air/water interface depends on the values of the dynamic interfacial tensions at the air/water, oil/water and oil/air interfaces. This can be expressed in terms of a dynamic spreading coefficient; when the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> is positive, oil spreads out of the droplets. Experimental results confirmed that oil indeed only spreads out of emulsion droplets if the dynamic <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> is positive. The tendency for an emulsion droplet to spread at the air/water interface could be controlled by manipulating the surface expansion rate, the protein type and concentration, and type and concentration of emulsifier in the emulsion. The presence of crystalline fat, although relevant to the stability of emulsions exposed to shear, was not found to influence the spreading behaviour of emulsion droplets at the air/water interface. The results of the emulsion droplet spreading experiments lead {{to the development of a}} model that describes the whipping time of cream in terms of the proportion of the air bubble surface for which the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> is positive. Experimental results for the whipping of model creams could be well explained by this model...|$|E

The final goal is {{to improve}} the toughness of polylactic acid (PLA). The morphology of multi-phase polymer blends is controlled by the thermodynamics of the system. The morphology of ternary blends can be predicted from the relative values of the three <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficients</b> characterising the triplet of polymers. <b>Spreading</b> <b>coefficients</b> are calculated from the values of interfacial tensions between binary components. The determination of interfacial tensions between a PLA, a poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) and a copolyamide (PA) predicts a complex dispersed morphology in the PLA matrix where PA subinclusions are partly encapsulated in the PBAT phase. This morphology was obtained by melt mixing the three components, as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In a second step, selective compatibilization was used to modify the PA subinclusion location. To this end, a PBAT-b-PLA di-block copolymer was synthesized. The presence of the di-block copolymer enables us to modify the interfacial tension between PLA and PBAT.

40|$|The {{spreading}} {{of solid}} powder over a liquid surface is a prevalent phenomenon encountered in many industrial {{processes such as}} food and pharmaceutical processes. The driving force for powder spreading over a liquid surface is not clearly understood. The Marangoni effect due to a temperature gradient and the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> for solid powder over liquid (lambda S/L) have both been proposed as causes for powder spreading over liquids. The proposed lambda S/L {{was based on the}} same form of the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> for a liquid over a solid surface (lambda L/S). Whereas lambda L/S has a clear thermodynamic definition, the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> of solid powder over liquid, lambda S/L, which was defined by simply interchanging the subscripts of the interfacial energy terms, has not been thoroughly analysed. Our experimental results showed that the spreading behaviour of solid powders over liquids cannot be explained or predicted by lambda S/L. In this study we focus on problems associated with the lambda S/L. Through a thermodynamic analysis we conclude that the existing parameter lambda S/L is unable to predict the spreading behaviour of solid powder on liquid surface, since the interfacial energy approach does not capture the actual physical process of powder spreading over liquid surface. A closer examination of the powder spreading process reveals the fundamental different between liquid spreading over solid surface and solid powder spreading over liquid. This work shows that further research is required to identify and analyse the physical mechanisms which are responsible for powder particles spreading over liquid surfaces...|$|E

The presence of this liquid film depends on the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> of cyclopentane on the solid in the presence of water. Through a systematic modification of the surface chemistry of the solid surface using two different silanes, we correlate the wettability of water and cyclopentane to the adhesion of cyclopentane hydrates.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{granulation}} of hydrophobic powders. Recently discovered hollow granules {{formed via}} spreading of hydrophobic particles around a liquid droplet appear promising {{to solve the}} problematic wetting behavior of hydrophobic powders. This new way of granulating hydrophobic powders has not been previously investigated. This thesis focuses on the nucleation stage of hydrophobic powders and investigates the spreading mechanism of particles around a liquid droplet, which is known as liquid marble. The formation of hollow granules from liquid marbles, and the mass production of hollow granules in a mixer granulator are also a main point in this thesis. An entirely physical flow mechanism for the nucleation stage of liquid marbles was proposed instead of the <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> theory. Experimental work for testing this mechanism {{was carried out by}} studying the effect of binder and powder properties as well as the effect of kinetic energy of impact on powder coverage of the drop. Based on experimental results, a proportional relationship was found between increasing kinetic energy and the percentage of liquid marble coverage. Moreover, calculation of the solid-liquid <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> and thermodynamic analysis of the existing solid-liquid <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> revealed that the existing solid-liquid <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> theory is not a predictive approach. This analysis also pointed out some serious flaws in the assumptions used in definition of the solid-liquid <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> (Rowe, 1989) in terms of simply exchanging the solid-liquid subscript in liquid-solid <b>spreading</b> <b>coefficient</b> equation, as the thermodynamic conditions taking place during spreading solid over a liquid are quite different to spreading liquid over a solid substrate. Drying of liquid marbles and the formation of hollow granules was investigated in small scale experiments by employing several types of binder with different concentrations as well as various types of powder with different particle sizes at two selected drying temperatures. Higher drying temperature, smaller or nano-sized particles and higher binder concentration tend to promote the formation of perfect hollow granules. It was found that the survival rate was directly proportional to binder viscosity for HPMC and PVP. However for HPC binder, the survival rate was essentially constant regardless of HPC concentration due to precipitation of the HPC binder above the cloud point temperature. In the next step, the insight gained in small scale experiments helped to successfully produce hollow granules in large scale experiments using a 4 L laboratory scale granulator. The optimum liquid to solid ratio (L:S) ratio for Aerosil and 5 % HPC was found by studying the effect of different liquid to solid ratio on the morphology of formed granules. At the optimum L:S ratio, more of the raw fine particles were granulated and fewer flattened or stretched hollow granules were produced. In addition, the experimental observations of different granule morphologies revealed the importance of performing X-ray tomography during hollow granule formulation. If the nucleation process starts with a preformed template droplet (e. g. spraying liquid), the final granule size increases as the L:S ratio increases as well as the amount of un-granulated fine particles decreases. Finally, a framework for liquid marble formation via solid spreading nucleation (droplet template) and via mechanical dispersion was proposed by outlining the sequential steps and possible controlling groups for each step. The first step of the framework via droplet template starts with droplet diameter (dd) > 25 particle diameter (dp) then it follows with Bo 1), granulation switches from droplet template regime to mechanical dispersion regime. Liquid marble can form successfully in mechanical dispersion regime if the contact angle is above 110 º. A framework for hollow granule formation from liquid marbles was also developed. In this framework, the importance of presence of compatible polymeric binder at the optimum concentration was emphasized as the first requirement for hollow granule formation. The optimum L:S ratio and drying temperature are additional criteria for a successful formation of single cavity hollow granule. These frameworks give {{a better understanding of the}} controlling mechanisms in granulation of hydrophobic particles and provide guidance on how to mass produce liquid marbles and hollow granules...|$|E

Since then, the influence of these parameters on the ultimate oil recovery during GAGD process has been investigated by several authors. Terwillinger et al.

In this study, a hypothesis of the microwave induced dewetting mechanism was proposed and examined. The microwave irradiation was proposed to introduce local heating at the polymer-substrate interface. The presence of local heating will speed up the oxidation of polymer during the treatment.
