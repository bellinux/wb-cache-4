All four heavier pnictogens (phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides ThH2 and Th4H15, the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. The hydrides are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.|$|E
25|$|Many metal <b>silicides</b> are known, most {{of which}} have {{formulae}} that cannot be explained through simple appeals to valence: their bonding ranges from metallic to ionic and covalent. Some known stoichiometries are M6Si, M5Si, M4Si, M15Si4, M3Si, M5Si2, M2Si, M5Si3, M3Si2, MSi, M2Si3, MSi2, MSi3, and MSi6. They are structurally more similar to the borides than the carbides, {{in keeping with the}} diagonal relationship between boron and silicon, although the larger size of silicon than boron means that exact structural analogies are few and far between. The heats of formation of the <b>silicides</b> are usually {{similar to those of the}} borides and carbides of the same elements, but they usually melt at lower temperatures. <b>Silicides</b> are known for all stable elements in groups 1–10, with the exception of beryllium: in particular, uranium and the transition metals of groups 4–10 show the widest range of stoichiometries. Except for copper, the metals in groups 11–15 do not form <b>silicides.</b> Most instead form eutectic mixtures, although the heaviest post-transition metals mercury, thallium, lead, and bismuth are completely immiscible with liquid silicon.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Silicide {{had been}} used to reduce the sheet {{resistance}} of diffusion region for almost 20 years. However, as the <b>silicided</b> re-gion becomes small, the contact resistance of silicide/silicon inter-face becomes higher than the resistance of the Si diffusion region such that current may not flow into the <b>silicide</b> layer. The effect of <b>silicide</b> thickness and contact resistivity on the total resistance of the <b>silicided</b> diffusion region was studied by two-dimensional sim-ulation. It is observed that below a threshold length, the resistance of <b>silicided</b> diffusion region is higher than the unsilicided diffusion region if the silicon consumption during <b>silicide</b> formation is taken into consideration. Thinner <b>silicide</b> and lower contact resistivity re-duce total resistance and threshold length but the threshold length is still much longer than the typical design rule of poly-Si to poly-Si distance. It is thus recommended to inhibit <b>silicide</b> formation at the common source/drain region at the metal-gate generation. Index Terms—Contact resistance, <b>silicide,</b> simulation. I...|$|R

25|$|Crystalline bulk silicon {{is rather}} inert, but becomes more {{reactive}} at high temperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2) {{that protects the}} metal from oxidation. Thus silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900nbsp&°C, but formation of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases between 950nbsp&°C and 1160nbsp&°C and when 1400nbsp&°C is reached, atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and Si3N4. Silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600nbsp&°C and gaseous phosphorus at 1000nbsp&°C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens; fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, chlorine does so at about 300nbsp&°C, and bromine and iodine at about 500nbsp&°C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and fluorinated by a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid; it readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with alkyl halides; this reaction can be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive in the liquid state, alloying with most metals to form <b>silicides,</b> and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory, unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.|$|E

2500|$|Speculation on {{silicon hydride}} {{chemistry}} started from the 1830s, contemporary {{with the development}} of synthetic organic chemistry. Silane itself, as well as trichlorosilane, were first synthesised by Friedrich Wöhler and Heinrich Buff in 1857 by reacting aluminium–silicon alloys with hydrochloric acid, and characterised as SiH4 and SiHCl3 by Charles Friedel and Albert Ladenburg in 1867. Disilane (Si2H6) followed in 1902, when it was first made by Henri Moissan and Samuel Smiles by the protonolysis of magnesium <b>silicides.</b> Further investigation had to wait until 1916 because of the great reactivity and thermal instability of the silanes; it was then that Alfred Stock began the study of silicon hydrides in earnest with new greaseless vacuum techniques, as they were found as contaminants of his focus, the boron hydrides. The names silanes and boranes are due to him, based on analogy with the alkanes. Moissan and Smiles' method of preparation of silanes and silane derivatives via [...] protonolysis of metal <b>silicides</b> is still used, although the yield is lowered by the hydrolysis of the products that occurs simultaneously, and thus the preferred route today is to treat substituted silanes with hydride reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride in etheric solutions at low temperatures.
