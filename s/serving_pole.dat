The northern and western facades facing the mountains and harbour will remain free of extra layers. Wood panels alternate with glass elements, thus the needs for both transparency and solar protection are met.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a genetic approach for shaping the dynamic responses of linear state space systems through pole placement. This paper makes further comparisons between this approach and an island approach parallel genetic algorithm (PGA) which incorporates orthogonal mutation vectors to increase sub-population specialization and decrease convergence time. Both approaches generate a gain vector K. The vector K {{is used in}} state feedback for altering the poles of the system so as to meet step response requirements such as settling time and percent overshoot. To obtain the gain vector K by the proposed genetic approaches, a pair of ideal, desired poles is calculate first. Those <b>poles</b> <b>serve</b> as the basis by which an initial population is created. In the island approach, those <b>poles</b> <b>serve</b> {{as a basis for}} n populations, where n is the dimension of the necessary K vector. Each member of the population is tested for its fitness (the degree to which it matches the criteria). A new population is created each “generation” from the results of the previous iteration, until the criteria are met, or a certain number of generations have passed. Several case studies are provided in this paper to illustrate that this new approach is working, and also to compare performance of the two approaches...|$|R
