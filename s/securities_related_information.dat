Furthermore it is clear that STMA requirements will be different in their specificities, as well as bearing different priorities in the eyes of different CSCs. Similarly CSPs will have different strategies in meeting those STMA requirements. Consequently, customizing the way in which STMA requirements and related solutions are specified appears to be more appropriate. For instance, an STMA-driven cloud service engineering could systematically support, on the one hand, the cloud consumers in specifying their STMA related requirements. On the other hand, providers would be able, through the methodology, to better appreciate what and how components should be put in place to deliver a service that meets the STMA requirements of a particular CSC.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Social media {{refers to}} the means of {{interactions}} among people in which they create, share, and exchange information and ideas in virtual communities and networks. The growth of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has resulted in an enormous volume of <b>security</b> <b>related</b> <b>information</b> present on the web largely {{when it comes to}} social media networks. Therefore, with the changing face of cyber security, although it is difficult, it was found that detecting the potential cyber-attacks or crimes is possible and feasible with the vast improvements in ICT. Cloud computing uses ICT resources that are delivered as a service over a network which has opened a promising opportunity across the globe thus resulting a greater popularity of e-commerce. The proposed framework is developed to manage risks of social media networks using the attack tree method which is used to model the risk of the system and identify the possible attacking strategies which the adversaries may launch. This paper presents the development of a Risk Management Framework by analysis of social media networks through web intelligence and security informatics using attack tree analysis based on the Hidden Markov Model for information extraction and prediction of risk factors of Social Media Networks...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an approach to}} monitoring events on {{a large number of}} servers and workstations. While modern UNIX systems are capable of logging a variety of information concerning the health and status of their hardware and operating system software, they are generally not configured to do so. Even when this information is logged, it is often hidden in places that are either not monitored regularly or are susceptible to deletion or modification by a successful intruder. Also, a system administrator must often monitor several, perhaps dozens, of systems. To address these problems, our approach begins with the modification of certain system programs to enhance their logging capabilities. In addition, our approach calls for the logging facilities on each of these systems to be configured {{in such a way as}} to send a copy of the critical system and <b>security</b> <b>related</b> <b>information</b> to a dependable, secure, central logging host system. As one might expect, this central log can see a megabyte or more of data in a single day.

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification, RFID is {{a technology}} that is used in many fields including locks. The unlimited access to the reader and the transponder has resulted in severe security weaknesses and {{made it possible to}} apply different attacks. To classify door locks as secure they must at least fulfil two main criteria: the first is the use of a challenge-response authentication protocol and the second is to deploy sophisticated and secure algorithms. MiFare classic and KeeLoq are two widely applied technologies that are still in use in many security critical applications and are considered to be secure but which have been broken by cryptanalysis and with modest efforts and cost. How secure a certain solution is depends on how expensive it is to buy the equipment that can break the system and reveal the secret key and how secure a lock should be depends on the value of what it is protecting. The dropping price of powerful computers and the availability of <b>security</b> <b>related</b> <b>information</b> on the web will lead to an increase of the number of attacks on different systems.

40|$|The {{failure of}} a {{national}} critical infrastructure may seriously impact {{the health and well-being}} of citizens, the economy, the environment, and the functioning of the government. Moreover, critical infrastructures increasingly depend on information and communication technologies (ICT) or, in short, cyber. Cyber security and resilience are therefore seen as increasingly important governance topics and major challenges for today’s societies, as the threat landscape is continuously changing. Sharing cyber <b>security</b> <b>related</b> <b>information</b> between organisations – in a critical sector, cross-sector, nationally and internationally – is widely perceived as an effective measure in support of managing the cyber security challenges of organisations. Information sharing, however, is not an easy topic. It comes with many facets. For example, information sharing spans strategic, tactical, operational and technical levels; spans all phases of the cyber incident response cycle (proactive, pre-emption, prevention, preparation, incident response, recovery, aftercare/ follow up); is highly dynamic; crosses the boundary of public and private domains; and concerns sensitive information which can be potentially harmful for one organisation on the one hand, while being very useful to others. This Good Practice on information sharing discusses many of these facets.

40|$|Most {{existent}} protocols, {{applications and}} services for Mobile Ad Hoc NET-works (MANETs) assume a cooperative and friendly network environment and do not accommodate security. Therefore, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), serving as the second line of defense for information systems, are indispensable for MANETs with high security requirements. Central to the research described in this dissertation is the proposed two-level nonoverlapping Zone-Based Intrusion Detection System (ZBIDS) which &# 64257;t the unique requirement of MANETs. First, in the low-level of ZBIDS, I propose an intrusion detection agent model and present a Markov Chain based anomaly detection algorithm. Local and trusted communication activities such as routing table related features are periodically selected and formatted with minimum errors from raw data. A Markov Chain based normal pro&# 64257;le is then constructed to capture the temporal dependency among network activities and accommodate the dynamic nature of raw data. A local detection model aggregating abnormal behaviors is constructed to re&# 64258;ect recent subject activities {{in order to achieve}} low false positive ratio and high detection ratio. A set of criteria to tune parameters is developed and the performance trade-off is discussed. Second, I present a nonoverlapping Zone-based framework to manage locally generated alerts from a wider area. An alert data model conformed to the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) is presented to suit the needs of MANETs. Furthermore, an aggregation algorithm utilizing attribute similarity from alert messages is proposed to integrate <b>security</b> <b>related</b> <b>information</b> from a wider area. In this way, the gateway nodes of ZBIDS can reduce false positive ratio, improve detection ratio, and present more diagnostic information about the attack. Third, MANET IDSs need to consider mobility impact and adjust their behavior dynamically. I &# 64257;rst demonstrate that nodes?? moving speed, a commonly used parameter in tuning IDS performance, is not an effective metric for the performance measurement of MANET IDSs. A new feature -link change rate -is then proposed as a uni&# 64257;ed metric for local MANET IDSs to adaptively select normal pro&# 64257;les. Different mobility models are utilized to evaluate the performance of the adaptive mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} security {{framework is}} proposed for detecting enterprise-wide network attacks. The proposed framework defines {{three types of}} components, namely, sensor, analysis and response. Sensor components gather evidence about security attacks. Analysis components correlate and combine pieces of attack evidence gathered by sensors, in order to detect attacks perceived on the network. Response components execute recommended responses and can be configured to assist humans in executing security countermeasures. Both schematic and formal descriptions of the framework and its components are provided and discussed. General and specific requirements of each component are outlined. To integrate components of the framework together, a lightweight signalling mechanism referred to as "security spaces" is proposed. A security space {{is a type of}} "tuple space" that allows sensor, analysis and response components to connect, contribute and communicate <b>security</b> <b>related</b> <b>information.</b> Its application to distributed sensor, and federated sensor environments is described. The detection of enterprise-wide attacks targeting computer networks is accomplished by distributing sensors across the network to collate evidence of perceived attacks, which are communicated to the analysis component for further investigation. In the analysis, a novel approach in data fusion is applied. This approach is underpinned by the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence that is utilised to collectively combine pieces of attack evidence gathered by the sensors. The fusion of sensor evidence assists to provide accurate detection of attacks perceived on the entire network. Further, to assist security administrators to visualise and mitigate perceived attacks, graph theory and graph matching algorithms are employed in the analysis. Hence, a graph model - pattern activity graph - is proposed and investigated in representing security attacks perceived on the network. Both graph isomorphism and subgraph iso-morphism are used to compare attack graph templates to data graphs obtained from security events. To validate the objectives of this research, a series of experiments were conducted on a testbed network, where live network traffic was monitored. A dataset comprising background data and attack data was gathered. Background data is normal data obtained by monitoring the testbed network. Attack data was generated through the attacks conducted on the monitored testbed LAN. The attacks were primarily network scans, network worms, web attacks, policy violations, and stealthy network scans attacks...|$|R

In other words, it is critical to improve the information security culture in organisations such that the behaviour of employees is in compliance with <b>information</b> <b>security</b> and <b>related</b> <b>information</b> processing policies and regulatory requirements. This can be achieved by assessing, monitoring and influencing an information security culture. An information security culture can be assessed by using an approach such as an information security culture assessment (ISCA). The empirical data derived from an ISCA can be used to influence the information security culture by focussing on developmental areas, of which awareness and training programmes are a critical facet. In this paper we discuss a case study of an international financial institution at which ISCA was conducted at four intervals over a period of eight years, across twelve countries. Comparative and multivariate analyses were conducted to establish whether the information security culture improved from one assessment to the next based on the developmental actions implemented. One of the key actions implemented was training and awareness focussing on the critical dimensions identified by ISCA. The information security culture improved from one assessment to the next, with the most positive results in in the fourth assessment. This research illustrates that the theoretical ISCA tool previously developed can be implemented successfully in organisations to positively influence the information security culture. Empirical evidence is provided supporting the effectiveness of ISCA in the context of identified shortcomings in the organisation’s information security culture. In addition, empirical evidence is presented indicating that information security training and awareness is a significant factor in positively influencing an information security culture when applied in the context of ISCA.
