40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> are {{the most}} popular mass {{communication}} media for the actors of virtual communities. Not harmful in their origin, <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> could be used by the criminals to disseminate harmful content, molding the individual and public opinion and bringing the threat to the national cybersecurity. The development of unified and efficient control over virtual communities to trigger their transition to the desired state is complicated by the absence of a popular classification of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> and the simultaneous use of several <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> by the same actor. The contributor suggests the definitions for the ?<b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services?</b> term and the ?actor? term. The contribution is about analyzing the <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> and classifying them hierarchically. Considered a wide class of assets {{to meet the needs of}} actors in communication, content, expression, socialization and so on. These types of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> provide integration of different types of content sharing and coordination of interaction between the actors themselves. The classification approach suggested in the contribution has the certain advantages of its consistency, capacity and accuracy. It specifies interactions between the actors of virtual communities thus enabling an efficient system of national cybersecurity. The results will be used to formalize approaches to develop control actions on the virtual community. ?????????? ????????-??????? ???????? ????? ?? ????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ???????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ?????????????? ????????. ??????, ?? ????????????? ???????????????? ?????????????? ????? ???? ???????????? ???????????????? ??? ??????????????? ?????????????? ????????. ????? ??????? ????? ????? ?????????????, ???????? ??? ??????????? ???????? ? ???????????? ?????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????????. ?????????? ??????????????? ? ??????????? ??????????? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ?????????? ??? ?? ???????? ? ????????? ????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????? ????????-????????. ? ?????? ?????? ???????? ?????? ???????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ????????-???????? ? ?????????? ?? ????????????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ???????. ????????????? ????????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????????? ???????????...|$|R

Curriculum uses of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> also can include sharing curriculum-related resources. Educators tap into user-generated content to find and discuss curriculum-related content for students. Responding to the popularity of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> among many students, teachers are increasingly using social networks to supplement teaching and learning in traditional classroom environments as they can provide new opportunities for enriching existing curriculum through creative, authentic and flexible, non-linear learning experiences. Some social networks, such as English, baby! and LiveMocha, are explicitly education-focused and couple instructional content with an educational peer environment. The new Web 2.0 technologies built into most <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> promote conferencing, interaction, creation, research on a global scale, enabling educators to share, remix, and repurpose curriculum resources. In short, <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> can become research networks as well as learning networks.|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the South African {{healthcare}} system, the Department of Health in South Africa is investing in National Health Insurance to support and deliver access to quality healthcare services within affordable boundaries. Enhanced delivery and quality of care to patients is supplemented through an increased emphasis on the adoption of eHealth technologies and systems. Within the context of efforts to improve access to quality and affordable healthcare services, there is also increasing {{awareness of the need}} to adopt a patient centred care approach as a means of caring for the patient, rather than only caring for the disease. Patient centred care emphasises the need for patients to be actively involved in the decision making process with regards to their needs and treatment. <b>Social</b> <b>networking</b> is viewed as a useful tool to support patient centred care and to improve on healthcare delivery. The use of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> beyond the healthcare context has increased exponentially. This has lead to increased interest in the application of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> in healthcare. This leads to the problem statement of this research, which is the proliferation of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> and the lack of understanding of the prospect of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> for patient centred care in South Africa.

25|$|The {{emergence}} {{and growth}} of blogs in the late 1990s coincided {{with the advent of}} web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users who did not have much experience with HTML or computer programming. Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and File Transfer Protocol had been required to publish content on the Web, and as such, early Web users tended to be hackers and computer enthusiasts. In the 2010s, the majority are interactive Web 2.0 websites, allowing visitors to leave online comments, and it is this interactivity that distinguishes them from other static websites. In that sense, blogging {{can be seen as a}} form of <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>service.</b> Indeed, bloggers do not only produce content to post on their blogs, but also often build social relations with their readers and other bloggers. However, there are high-readership blogs which do not allow comments.|$|E
25|$|A rise {{in social}} network use is {{being driven by}} college {{students}} using the services to network with professionals for internship and job opportunities. Many {{studies have been done}} on the effectiveness of networking online in a college setting, and one notable one is by Phipps Arabie and Yoram Wind published in Advances in Social Network Analysis. Many schools have implemented online alumni directories which serve as makeshift social networks that current and former students can turn to for career advice. However, these alumni directories tend to suffer from an oversupply of advice-seekers and an undersupply of advice providers. One new <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>service,</b> Ask-a-peer, aims to solve this problem by enabling advice seekers to offer modest compensation to advisers for their time. LinkedIn is also another great resource. It helps alumni, students and unemployed individuals look for work. They are also able to connect with others professionally and network with companies.|$|E

40|$|Objective of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} the antecedents of trust in <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> (SNS) and to determine their importance. Understanding the antecedents of trust is important since trust has previously been found to influence intention to use in related technologies. There {{has not been a}} comprehensive study to explain trust formation in <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> continuously evolve and the norms of usage are changing, which can affect the formation of trust. Trust is important in human interactions and it is needed in effective communication, learning and problem solving. Initial trust is based on perceptions and experience-based trust is based on past behavior of the trustee. Interpersonal trust and social trust are present in <b>social</b> networks. <b>Social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> can facilitate the formation of social capital, which increases trust. Based on previous studies, the antecedents were hypothesized to be propensity to trust, perceived trustworthiness, perceived critical mass, trust towards platform, structural assurances, access to right information, information overload, perceived risk, social networks, civic engagement, and life satisfaction. Quantitative empirical research was carried out in order to confirm the hypotheses. Data were collected with an online survey and analyzed with Partial Least Squares (PLS) method. The developed PLS model predicted 68, 9 % of trust in SNS and it was found valid and reliable. The research sample contained 104 respondents, who were active SNS users. Research findings support that perceived critical mass, social networks, civic engagement, and life satisfaction have positive effect on trust in <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services.</b> Additionally, propensity to trust and access to right information could have positive effect on trust in <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services.</b> Perceived trustworthiness could have negative effect when it reflects the evaluation of perceived trustworthiness. The most important finding was that social capital almost solely predicts trust in <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services.</b> The results apply to a post-adoptive situation where experience-based trust is present. There is further the need to study trust antecedents in pre-adoptive situations and the influence of trust on usage...|$|R
25|$|In the past, <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> {{were viewed}} as a {{distraction}} and offered no educational benefit.

In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and {{it is not uncommon to}} be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services.</b> According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. <b>Social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that <b>social</b> <b>networking</b> <b>services</b> opens the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and cyberstalking.
