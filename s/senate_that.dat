5|$|Eventually, the {{purchasing}} power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as far afield as Cairo and Alexandria. In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the <b>Senate,</b> <b>that</b> is to integrate themselves with the ruling elite. This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more. Following that phase, however, the enterprising merchants bounced back and wielded real clout during the time of the Third Crusade.|$|E

He then defeated John McCain, also a senator, in the general election to become President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} had escalated when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to the}} <b>senate</b> <b>that</b> he planned to leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped as a living god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move would have left both {{the senate and the}} Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E
5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin thread {{of the life of}} one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid {{in the minds of many}} citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the <b>Senate.</b> <b>That</b> came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E
5|$|After the Veterans' Mountain Camp {{was closed}} in the 1960s, the {{property}} was sold off to private owners, turning NY971D into {{little more than a}} private drive. Thus, the road saw little use, handling less than 10 vehicles per day on average. As a result, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) no longer considered the highway worthy of inclusion in the state highway system and began to take steps to remove the highway from the system. On February22, 1999, NYSDOT sent a memorandum to the New York State <b>Senate</b> <b>that</b> laid out the groundwork for a bill which, if passed, would allow NYSDOT to remove NY971D from the state highway system once it was able to transfer ownership and maintenance of the highway to another entity. A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March29 and eventually passed by the Senate and the New York State Assembly. The bill was signed into law by Governor George Pataki on July27, 1999. The former routing of NY971D is now officially a private drive.|$|E

5|$|Despite Chotiner's {{maneuvering}} for Nixon, {{the senator}} was still uncertain {{if he should}} take the vice-presidential slot if offered. Pat Nixon wanted her husband to decline it. Chotiner argued to the Nixons that if the Republicans lost, Nixon would retain his seat in the <b>Senate,</b> <b>that</b> if he served as Vice President and re-entered private life, {{he would have a}} lucrative legal career, but that if Nixon did not move up to the Vice Presidency, with Senator Knowland relatively young and in good health, Nixon was likely to remain merely the junior senator from California for many years to come. Eisenhower offered Nixon the position, the senator accepted, and with Knowland's re-election bid all but won, Chotiner became Nixon's campaign manager.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{took office}} on March 4, 1861. Among his first acts was to {{nominate}} Senator Salmon P. Chase of Ohio to be Secretary of the Treasury. Chase resigned his Senate seat on March 7, and {{after two weeks}} of indecisive balloting, the Ohio Legislature elected Sherman to the vacant seat. He took his seat on March 23, 1861, as the Senate had been called into special session to deal with the secession crisis. The <b>Senate</b> <b>that</b> convened {{at the start of the}} 37th Congress had a Republican majority for the first time, a majority that grew as more Southern members resigned or were expelled. In April, Sherman's brother William visited Washington to rejoin the army, and the brothers went together to the White House to meet Lincoln. Lincoln soon called for 75,000 men to enlist for three months to put down the rebellion, which William Sherman thought too few and too short a duration. William's thoughts on the war greatly influenced his brother, and John Sherman returned home to Ohio to encourage enlistment, briefly serving as an unpaid colonel of Ohio Volunteers.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Maryland Senate {{are elected}} every four years, in off-year {{elections}} {{in the middle of}} terms for Presidents of the United States.

Should a Senate seat become vacant {{in the middle of a}} term, because of death, illness, incapacitation, disqualification, resignation, or expulsion of a member of the <b>Senate,</b> <b>that</b> seat is filled by appointment. The Central Committee of the previous Senator's party in the county or counties in which the Senate district lies makes a recommendation to the Governor on whom to appoint to the seat. Within fifteen days of the Central Committee's recommendation being selected, the Governor must appoint that person to the vacant seat.|$|E

5|$|On 10 October, the High Court {{ruled that}} the act passed at the joint sitting that gave the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory two {{senators}} each was valid. A half-Senate election needed to be held by June 1976; most senators-elect would take their seats on 1 July but the territorial senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats would take their places at once. The ruling meant {{that it was possible}} for the ALP to gain a temporary majority in the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976. To do so, the ALP would have to win Field's and Bunton's seats, and one seat in each territory, and have the second ACT seat fall to either a Labor candidate or an independent, former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton, now estranged from his party. If this happened, Labor would have an effective 33â€“31 margin, would be able to pass supply if that was still an issue, and also could pass electoral redistribution laws (which had been passed by the House, though twice defeated by the <b>Senate)</b> <b>that</b> would give it an advantage at the next election.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 1861, Crittenden {{tried to}} salvage his plan by recommending {{to the full}} <b>Senate</b> <b>that</b> it be {{submitted}} {{to the people in}} referendum. It was widely believed that a referendum would recommend adoption of Crittenden's plan, and Republicans in Congress used a variety of procedures to prevent a vote on allowing it. On January 16, with procedural delays exhausted, New Hampshire Senator Daniel Clark moved to substitute for Crittenden's plan a resolution stating that constitutional amendments were unnecessary to preserve the Union, and that enforcement of the Constitution and the present laws would eliminate the need for special sectional guarantees. With the senators from southern states (both those that had seceded and those that had not) refusing to vote, Republicans were left with a majority in the chamber and passed Clark's substitute resolution, effectively killing Crittenden's proposal.|$|E
5|$|The first V-22 was {{rolled out}} with {{significant}} media attention in May 1988. The project suffered several blows. That year, the U.S. Army left the program, citing {{a need to}} focus its budget on more immediate aviation programs. In 1989, the project survived two separate votes in the <b>Senate</b> <b>that</b> could have resulted in cancellation. Despite the Senate's decision, the Department of Defense instructed the U.S. Navy not {{to spend more money}} on the V-22. When the V-22's projected development budget greatly increased in 1988, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney tried to remove funding from 1989 to 1992 in an effort to cancel it. He was eventually overruled by Congress, which provided unrequested funding for the program. Multiple studies of alternatives found the V-22 provided more capability and combat effectiveness with similar operating costs. The Clinton Administration was supportive of the V-22 and helped it attain funding.|$|E

5|$|The same <b>Senate</b> <b>that</b> had {{rejected}} the Tylerâ€“Calhoun treaty {{by a margin}} of 2:1 in June 1844 reassembled in December 1844 in a short lame-duck session. (Though pro-annexation Democrats had made gains in the fall elections, those legislators â€“ the 29th Congress â€“ would not assume office until March 1845.) Lame-duck President Tyler, still trying to annex Texas in the final months of his administration, wished to avoid another overwhelming Senate rejection of his treaty. In his annual address to Congress on December 4, he declared the Polk victory a mandate for Texas annexation and proposed that Congress adopt a joint resolution procedure by which simple majorities in each house could secure ratification for the Tyler treaty. This method would avoid the constitutional requirement of a two-thirds majority in the Senate. Bringing the House of Representatives into the equation boded well for Texas annexation, as the pro-annexation Democratic Party possessed nearly a 2:1 majority in that chamber.|$|E
5|$|Pompey {{initially}} assured Rome and the <b>senate</b> <b>that</b> {{he could}} defeat Caesar in battle should he march on Rome. However, {{by the spring}} of 49 BC, when Caesar crossed the Rubicon river with his invading forces and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Caesar's army was still under-strength, with certain units remaining in Gaul, {{but on the other hand}} Pompey himself only had a small force at his command, and that with uncertain loyalty having served under Caesar. Tom Holland attributes Pompey's willingness to abandon Rome to waves of panicking refugees as an attempt to stir ancestral fears of invasions from the north. Pompey's forces retreated south towards Brundisium, and then fled to Greece. Caesar first directed his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Iberia but following campaigning by Caesar in the Siege of Massilia and Battle of Ilerda he decided to attack Pompey in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar at the Battle of Dyrrachium in 48 BC but failed to follow up on the victory. Pompey was decisively defeated in the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered in an attempt to ingratiate the country with Caesar and avoid a war with Rome.|$|E
