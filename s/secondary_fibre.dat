Westerhuis, W. (2016) Hemp for textiles: plant size matters, PhD thesis. Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands, 234 pp. With English and Dutch summaries.   Fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) {{may be an}} alternative to cotton and synthetic fibres as a raw material for textile yarn production in the European Union. The agronomic options to manipulate plant development and crop growth with the aim to optimise hemp long fibre production were investigated. Field trials with factors sowing density, sowing date, harvest time and variety were conducted. Stems were traditionally processed by retting, drying, breaking, and scutching. Following standard protocols, almost 1500 hemp stem samples were analysed. Varieties differ widely in their fibre content, but this thesis shows that when variety and plant size are known, the amounts of fibres, wood, and retting losses are known. The dry weight of the stems at harvest, not the factors underlying this weight, are determinant. In retted stems the dry matter is split–up into fibres and wood in a fixed way. The options to manipulate this ratio by crop management, given variety, are very small and for practical reasons they can be neglected. In fibre hemp two bast fibre types occur. Primary or long fibres are valuable for yarn spinning. Secondary fibres are too short and their presence hampers the production of fine yarns. This thesis shows that the <b>secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> front height increases with plant weight. Although a causal relationship between <b>secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> formation and flowering does not exist, the <b>secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> front is found higher in flowering plants when compared to non–flowering plants of the same height. This {{is likely to be}} caused by the higher weight or momentum of flowering plants as compared with non–flowering plants of the same height. Consequently, a harvest before flowering is preferable. This was shown in a greenhouse experiment, in which the short–day response of hemp was used to create size ranges of flowering and non–flowering plants. To produce high–quality raw materials for textile production, short crops should be grown. The options to produce plants with the desired size are manifold. Since sowing density, sowing date, and harvest time do not have an additional effect on the primary fibre content besides the indirect effect through stem weight, any combination of these factors could be chosen to optimize plant size.    ...|$|E

40|$|De-inking sludge is a {{waste product}} {{generated}} from <b>secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> paper mills who manufacture recycled paper into new paper sheets; it refers directly to the solid residues which evolve during the de-inking stage of the paper pulping process. The current practice for the disposal of this waste is either by land-spreading, land-filling or incineration which are unsustainable. This work has explored the intermediate pyrolysis of pre-conditioned de-inking sludge pellets in a recently patented 20 kg/h intermediate pyrolysis reactor (The Pyroformer). The reactor is essentially two co-axial screws which are configured {{in such a way}} as to circulate solids within the reactor and thus facilitate in the cracking of tars. The potential application of using the volatile organic vapours and permanent gases evolved would be to generate both combined heat and power (CHP) located at paper making sites. The results show that de-inking sludge could be successfully pyrolysed and the organic vapours produced were composed of a mixture of aromatic hydrocarbons, phenolic compounds and some fatty acid methyl esters as detected by liquid GC-MS. The calorific value of the oil after condensing was between 36 and 37 MJ/kg and the liquid fuel properties were also determined, permanent gases were detected by a GC-TCD and were composed of approximately 24 % CO, 6 % CH and 70 % CO (v/v%). The solid residue from pyrolysis also contained a small residual calorific value, and was largely composed of mainly calcium based inert metal oxides. The application of applying intermediate pyrolysis to de-inking sludge for both CHP production and waste reduction is in principle a feasible technology which could be applied at <b>secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> paper mills. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> paper mills are {{significant}} users of both heat and electricity which is mainly {{derived from the}} combustion of fossil fuels. The cost of producing this energy is increasing year upon year. These mills are also significant producers of fibrous sludge and reject waste material which can contain high amounts of useful energy. Currently {{the majority of these}} waste fractions are disposed of by landfill, land-spread or incineration using natural gas. These disposal methods not only present environmental problems but are also very costly. The focus of this work was to utilise the waste fractions produced at <b>secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> paper mills for the on-site production of combined heat and power (CHP) using advanced thermal conversion methods (gasification and pyrolysis), well suited to relatively small scales of throughput. The heat and power can either be used on-site or exported. The first stage of the work was the development of methods to condition selected paper industry wastes to enable thermal conversion. This stage required detailed characterisation of the waste streams in terms of proximate and ultimate analysis and heat content. Suitable methods to dry and condition the wastes in preparation for thermal conversion were also explored. Through trials at pilot scale with both fixed bed downdraft gasification and intermediate pyrolysis systems, the energy recovered from selected wastes and waste blends in the form of product gas and pyrolysis products was quantified. The optimal process routes were selected based on the experimental results, and implementation studies were carried out at the selected candidate mills. The studies consider the pre-processing of the wastes, thermal conversion, and full integration of the energy products. The final stage of work was an economic analysis to quantify economic gain, return on investment and environmental benefits from the proposed processes.

The sugar release is characterized by xylose and other hemicellulose sugars and little glucose.

In the skeletal muscles of fetuses and neonatal dogs the developmental isoforms MHC-emb and MHC-neo were prevalent.

40|$|The surface {{morphology}} of chick lens fibres and epithelium was studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} at several stages of embryonic development. In common with many species of adult lens, the embryonic fibres possessed a remarkable array of interlocking devices which were present from {{an early stage of}} development.

Immediately after obliteration of the lens vesicle, 'flap' or 'finger-like' projections were seen on the primary fibres, and these increased in number during development. A pronounced change in the morphology of the primary fibres was seen between Stages 35 and 38 with the formation of large irregular, interlocking processes. <b>Secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> maturation resulted in a complex but well defined joining apparatus with 'mounds and hollows', 'finger', 'flap' and 'ball-like' projections being formed.

But while there have been numerous studies aimed at discovering the genetic networks controlling early lens development, comparatively little is known about later stages, including the differentiation of secondary lens fibre cells. The analysis of mutant zebrafish isolated in forward genetic screens is an important way to investigate the roles of genes in embryogenesis. In this study we describe the zebrafish mutant bumper (bum), which shows a transient, tumour-like hyperproliferation of the lens epithelium as well as a progressively stronger defect in <b>secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> cell differentiation, which results in a significantly reduced lens size and ectopic location of the lens within the neural retina.

Behavioural analyses demonstrate that, despite a morphologically normal retina, larval and adult bum(-/-) zebrafish are functionally blind. We further show that these fish have defects in their craniofacial skeleton with normal but delayed formation of the scleral ossicles within the eye, several reduced craniofacial bones resulting in an abnormal skull shape, and asymmetric ectopic bone formation within the mandible.

Embryos were transferred to recipient ewes (n = 60) on day 6. Singleton fetuses were collected on day 75 of gestation and placental weights, fetal body dimensions and fetal organ and muscle weights recorded. The number, type and size of muscle fibres and the dry matter, RNA, DNA and protein content in the semitendinosus muscle were determined. Maternal feed intake did not influence body dimensions, organ development or muscle weights in the fetus. However, L feed intake decreased total muscle fibre number in the fetus by approximately 20 % (P = 0. 06) compared to H feed intake. This resulted from a reduced secondary to primary fibre ratio (P < 0. 05) and indicated that <b>secondary</b> <b>fibre</b> formation occurred at a reduced rate in L fetuses. In addition, protein:DNA ratio tended to be lower in muscles of L fetuses (P < 0. 1).

Firstly, batch soda pulping of {{rapeseed}} straw (species Brassica napus L. convar. napus) {{was conducted}} without and with addition of anthraquinone {{as a catalyst}} in the cooking liquor. To characterize the chemical composition of rapeseed straw, cellulose, holocellulose, lignin, ash, and extractives were determined. For selected samples of pulp, degree of polymerization, as well as strength properties of soda and soda-AQ pulps were measured. The presence of anthraquinone in cooking liquor accelerates delignification, however, for a given H-factor, lower kappa number and total yield were achieved, compared with cooking without anthraquinone. Also, anthraquinone in cooking liquor had a positive effect upon the decrease of rejects, mainly at a lower H-factor. Secondly, pulping of rapeseed straw using sodium sulphite, blend of sodium sulphite and caustic soda and caustic soda via cold processes were conducted. The influence of varying charges of chemicals on strength properties of handsheets were studied. Moreover, {{the effect of adding}} mechanical and chemi-mechancial pulp to <b>secondary</b> <b>fibres</b> upon strength charactersitics of handsheets were determined. The results revealed that the caustic soda pulping has greater effect on bending stiffness and bending modulus of handsheets in comparison with neutral sulphite and alkaline sulphite pulping. The addition chemi-mechanical pulp and mechanical pulp into <b>secondary</b> <b>fibres</b> reduced the bending stiffness while, 25 % of chemi-mechanical pulp addition with <b>secondary</b> <b>fibres</b> increased the bending modulus of handsheets obtained from cold pulping processes. Thirdly, the mechanical and chemi-mechanical pulp was treated with various enzymes. Among all enzymes utilized, the straw treated with BLX 13839 showed higher bending stiffness for handsheets having basis weights of about 260 g m- 2 and 520 g m- 2. Similarly, the bending modulus of elasticity was the highest for the pulp leached with BZM 2555 for both levels of basis weights. Fakulta chemicko-technologick...|$|R
40|$|Porous {{structure}} both {{of natural}} skin and collagen matrix obtained by chemical {{treatment of the}} skin with alkaline and acidic solutions, tannage with a Cr 3 +-containing solution, vegetable retannage and modification with bentonite was researched using scanning and transmission electron microscopy as well as standard contact porometry. Each stripe of porogrammes has been related to elements of multilevel structure. The pores were recognized using octane as a working liquid, the results obtained by this manner {{were used to determine}} loosening-compaction and ordering-disordering at each level of the structure, which includes nanosized macromolecules, microfibrils, fibrils and primary fibres of micron size. The measurements performed in aqueous media allowed us to determine hydrophilic pores and estimate their functions, <b>secondary</b> <b>fibres</b> have been also found by this manner. As for initial skin, porometric measurements diagnosed also non-collagen hydrophobic and hydrophilic inclusions, which form their own structure between microfibrils, fibrils, primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>fibres</b> of the matrix. The structure due to these inclusions is similar to that for collagen macromolecules. Microfibrils and fibrils have been found to form both ordered and disordered structures. Contribution of porosity of each organization level into the total porosity has been estimated, changes of collagen structure caused by chemical treatment and modification of inorganic ion-exchanger have been analyzed. Recommendation dealt to obtaining of materials for sorption and membrane separation have been given. When you are citing the document, use the following link [URL]...|$|R
