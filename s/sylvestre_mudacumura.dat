50|$|The {{prosecution}} of the five suspects are separated into four cases; Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui are being tried together {{and the other three}} suspects are being tried individually. The trial of Bosco Ntaganda started in September 2015. At this moment, <b>Sylvestre</b> <b>Mudacumura</b> was still not arrested.|$|E
50|$|The ICC has {{jurisdiction}} to prosecute {{individuals who are}} accused of committing crimes defined under the Rome Statute (the treaty that established the Court) as either war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide. The Prosecutor has charged six people with committing crimes within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Court in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, Bosco Ntaganda, Callixte Mbarushimana, and <b>Sylvestre</b> <b>Mudacumura.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sylvestre</b> <b>Mudacumura</b> (born 1954 in Gisenyi, Rwanda) is {{the overall}} {{commander}} of the military wing of the rebel Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), known as the Forces Combattants Abacunguzi (FOCA). He was the deputy {{commander of the}} Presidential Guard of the Rwandan Armed Forces during the 1994 genocide. Described as being age 55 in 2009, prior to the genocide he attended [...] "the leadership academy {{of the armed forces}} in Hamburg" [...] on a two year scholarship. (This institution appears almost certainly to have been the Führungsakademie der Bundeswehr.) Following the genocide, it is believed Mudacumura's wife and children were moved to Germany with the help of FDLR political leader Ignace Murwanashyaka.|$|E
50|$|The International Criminal Court is {{conducting}} an ongoing investigation into crimes {{committed in the}} DRC during the Second Congo War and afterwards. Several military leaders {{have been charged with}} crimes of sexual violence. Germain Katanga, the leader of the Front for Patriotic Resistance in Ituri (FPRI), and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, the leader of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI), were charged and indicted with nine crimes against humanity including sexual slavery, a crime against humanity under article 7(1)(g) of the Rome Statute and a war crime under article 8(2)(b)(xxii) or (e)(vi) of the Rome Statute. Bosco Ntaganda of the Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo (FPLC) was charged with rape and sexual slavery. Callixte Mbarushimana of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), and <b>Sylvestre</b> <b>Mudacumura</b> have also been charged with rape.|$|E
50|$|The International Criminal Court {{investigation}} in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or {{the situation in the}} Democratic Republic of the Congo is an ongoing investigation by the International Criminal Court (ICC) into crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during the Second Congo War and its aftermath, including the Ituri and Kivu conflicts. The war started in 1998 and even although a peace agreement was made between combatants in 2003, conflict continued in the eastern parts of the country for several years. In April 2004 the government of the DRC formally referred the situation in the Congo to the International Criminal Court, and in June 2004, the Prosecutor of the ICC, Luis Moreno Ocampo, formally opened an investigation. To date, warrants of arrest have been issued for Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, Bosco Ntaganda, Callixte Mbarushimana, and <b>Sylvestre</b> <b>Mudacumura.</b> Lubanga is imprisoned; Katanga is convicted; Chui is acquitted; the pre-trial chamber declined to confirm the charges against Mbarushimana; Mudacumura is currently a fugitive; and Ntaganda turned himself in to the US Embassy in Kigali on 18 March 2013, requesting to be extradited to the ICC.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the situation in}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Kivu provinces {{and the role of the}} International Criminal Court in quelling the violence there. The two men under examination, Bosco Ntaganda and <b>Sylvestre</b> <b>Mudacumura,</b> are both leaders of rebel factions that are wanted for war crimes by the ICC. This work details the history that led to the present conflict and presents other examples of ICC activity, such as the warrants issued for members of the Lord’s Resistance Army of Uganda, to examine the proper course of action for those who seek justice in the area. In addition, this thesis covers the role of outside forces, principally the government of Rwanda, in the conflict. Finally, recommendations are presented on how all players should respond to the International Criminal Court’s warrants. Due to the voluntary detainment of Bosco Ntaganda late in the process of creating this work, there is also a final addendum analyzing this event in the overall structure of the argument...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} impact of International Criminal Court (ICC) prosecutions initiated during ongoing conflict on atrocities, {{with the goal of}} developing a typological theory specifying the conditions under which ICC prosecutions alternately prevent, exacerbate, or have no impact on wartime atrocities. This dissertation employs an inductive approach to theory building, using in-depth case studies of {{the impact of}} ICC action vis-à-vis two armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) whose leaders were targeted for prosecution by the ICC, the CNDP/M 23 and FDLR, to generate a set of testable hypotheses concerning the effects of ICC action. These case studies draw from over 100 original interviews with current and former members of these groups and other relevant actors in DRC, as well as statistical analysis of patterns of atrocities attributable to each group over time using data sourced from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Database. These case studies suggest variation in the impact of ICC action across stages of the legal process. In the CNDP/M 23 case, I find that the issuance of an ICC arrest warrant for senior CNDP commander Bosco Ntaganda in April 2008 initially had negligible effects but subsequently contributed to an escalation in atrocities when Ntaganda, apparently fearing arrest after the conviction of his former commander, Thomas Lubanga, by the ICC and calls for his arrest by international donors and human rights organizations, reneged on a peace deal and instigated a new rebellion, the M 23, in April 2013; however, Ntaganda’s surrender to the Court approximately one year later amidst internal tensions within M 23 contributed to the prevention of atrocities by reducing M 23 ’s capacity to perpetrate violence and contributing to its eventual military defeat. I find similar though not identical results {{in the case of the}} FDLR. First, I find that situation-level ICC action, encompassing preliminary phases before the issuance of indictments for individual leaders, had negligible effects vis-à-vis the FDLR. However, the execution of an indictment for senior FDLR political leader Callixte Mbarushimana initially exacerbated atrocities by further empowering radical leaders within the organization and provoking backlash against the ICC; in the long run, however, Mbarushimana’s arrest generated incapacitative effects that contributed to prevention. Finally, the issuance of an outstanding indictment for FDLR military commander <b>Sylvestre</b> <b>Mudacumura</b> had perverse effects, as it generated incentives for Mudacumura to spoil peace initiatives. I test the generalizability of these findings using statistical analysis of time-series cross-section data covering armed groups active in Africa from 2002 through 2010; this analysis yields three major findings, which are generally consistent with hypotheses derived from my case studies concerning the long-term effects of ICC action. First, this analysis indicates that situation-level action has negligible average effects on atrocities. Second, I find that outstanding indictments tend to exacerbate atrocities, and third, that the execution of ICC indictments contributes to the prevention of atrocities...|$|E
