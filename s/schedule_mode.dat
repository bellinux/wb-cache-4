40|$|The highest NIC bonding {{performance}} {{is achieved by}} the round-robin <b>scheduling</b> <b>mode.</b> However, {{we found that the}} performance was much lower than the theoretical limit due to out-of-order TCP packet delivery. So our work proposes a load-balanced NIC bonding scheduling approach as a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art. We pro- pose that the outgoing packets should be queued on interfaces with the least amount of packets waiting to be sent. This allows the load to be well balanced over all interfaces thereby reducing the probability of packets arriving out-of-order at their destination. This work presents an analysis of all currently available NIC bonding modes in terms of perfor- mance. A new bonding simulation framework was developed to facilitate the development of alternate scheduling algorithms and compare their performance. This helped us analyze and propose load-based scheduling as a better alternative to the most popularly used round-robin <b>scheduling</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|R

40|$|Scheduling {{engines are}} {{found at the}} core of {{software}} systems that plan and schedule activities and resources. A Request-Oriented Scheduling Engine (ROSE) is one that processes a single request (adding a task to a timeline) and then waits for another request. For the International Space Station, a robust ROSE-based system would support multiple, simultaneous users, each formulating requests (defining scheduling requirements), submitting these requests via the internet to a single scheduling engine operating on a single timeline, and immediately viewing the resulting timeline. ROSE is significantly different from the engine currently used to schedule Space Station operations. The current engine supports essentially one person at a time, with a pre-defined set of requirements from many payloads, working in either a "batch" <b>scheduling</b> <b>mode</b> or an interactive/manual <b>scheduling</b> <b>mode.</b> A planning and scheduling process that takes advantage of the features of ROSE could produce greater customer satisfaction at reduced cost and reduced flow time.

40|$|An {{approach}} to estimate feasibility of a real-time multi-task application with various combinations of the <b>scheduling</b> <b>mode</b> and the protocol {{of access to}} shared informational resources when run on a multi-core platform is described. The application structure is speciﬁed through a simple formalized proﬁle consisting of segments of three types and specifying access to informational resources shared among application tasks, {{the amount of the}} required computing resource being estimated for each segment. The approach is based on the notion of application density introduced by the authors, which characterizes the use of computational resource by this application and is derived from estimation of the application feasibility for various values of processor performance and the number of its cores in case of a multi-core platform. The overall structure of a simulation tool for estimation of the task response time (and therefore, application feasibility) is described, which provides more exact data compared to the known analytical methods where they are applicable. Two dissimilar implementations of this tool were developed and run on a number of benchmarks, including Liu-Layland conﬁgurations speciﬁed in the described formalism for application structure; the results in form of charts are presented along with their analysis and interpretation. The suggested approach allows to indentify an optimal combination of the <b>scheduling</b> <b>mode</b> and access protocol for the given multi-task application structure. </p...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} model of vehicle transactions, activity <b>scheduling</b> and <b>mode</b> choice is estimated {{based on a}} retrospective vehicle transaction survey in the Toronto Area. First a conceptual framework is presented which links long run decisions of automobile transactions with short run decisions of activity participation, travel and mode choice. The concept of activity/travel stress is introduced to represent the difference between household activity/travel with the current vehicle fleet and that associated with alternative fleets due to purchase or disposal of a vehicle. The concept of stress is operationalized with a utility-based formulation in which two measures of activity/travel stress are simulated for each household, mode choice utility gained by making a vehicle transaction, and the change in number of conflicts experienced in the household over {{a limited number of}} vehicles. These measures are simulated with multiple replications of an activity-based microsimulation model of activity <b>scheduling</b> and <b>mode</b> choice that explicitly represents household interactions of vehicle allocation, ridesharing and drop-off/pick-up of household members. The empirical analysis indicates, for both stress measures, an asymmetry associated with vehicle transactions. Households increase their activity/travel stress far more by disposing of a vehicle, than they alleviate stress by purchasing a vehicle. A nested logit vehicle transaction model shows that both measures of stress are moderately significant influences on vehicle transactions.

40|$|Due to a {{wide range}} of field {{vibration}} problems caused by flood discharge at the Xiangjiaba Hydropower Station, vibration characteristics and influencing factors were investigated based on prototype observation. The results indicate that field vibrations caused by flood discharge have distinctive characteristics of constancy, low frequency, small amplitude, and randomness with impact, which significantly differ from the common high-frequency vibration characteristics. Field vibrations have a main frequency of about 0. 5 – 3. 0  Hz and the characteristics of long propagation distance and large-scale impact. The vibration of a stilling basin slab runs mainly in the vertical direction. The vibration response of the guide wall perpendicular to the flow is significantly stronger than it is in other directions and decreases linearly downstream along the guide wall. The vibration response of the underground turbine floor is mainly caused by the load of unit operation. Urban environmental vibration has particular distribution characteristics and change patterns, and is greatly affected by discharge, <b>scheduling</b> <b>modes,</b> and geological conditions. Along with the increase of the height of residential buildings, vibration responses show a significant amplification effect. The horizontal and vertical vibrations of the 7 th floor are, respectively, about 6 times and 1. 5 times stronger than the corresponding vibrations of the 1 st floor. The vibration of a large-scale chemical plant presents the combined action of flood discharge and working machines.
