5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software on the console. This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range of depth (through computer stereo vision and <b>Structured</b> <b>light)</b> within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range of depth, although the camera could only allow a video capture of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, empty space where the camera was unable to capture video within the field of depth. Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the video capture within the view of the virtual camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works of others in the Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E

50|$|Optical sensors {{belong to}} the group of {{non-contact}} measuring, geometry-oriented sensors (Figure 1). For information retrieval, the weld groove is scanned via a radiation detector which records the emitted optical radiation of the measured object. Semiconductor image sensors are applied for the detection of radiation. The optical measuring principles are differentiated into sensors with and without active <b>structured</b> <b>lighting.</b> If there is no active <b>structured</b> <b>lighting,</b> a camera is used for signal acquisition. The camera observes the workpiece and extracts the required information from the two-dimensional halftone picture. Active <b>structured</b> <b>lighting</b> means the application of a light source for the defined lighting of specified regions of the part. For the subsequent acquisition, single photo elements, lines or arrays can be used, depending on their design.|$|R

40|$|As an {{extension}} to classical <b>structured</b> <b>lighting</b> techniques, {{the use of}} bi-dimensional pseudo-random color codes is explored to perform range sensing with variable density from a stereo calibrated rig and a projector. Pseudo-random codes are used to create artificial textures on a scene which are extracted and grouped in a confidence map to ensure reliable feature matching between pairs of images taken from two cameras. Depth estimation is performed on corresponding points with progressive refinement as the pseudo-random pattern projection is marched over the scene to increase the density of matched features, and achieve dense 3 D reconstruction. The potential of bi-dimensional pseudo-random color patterns for <b>structured</b> <b>lighting</b> is demonstrated in terms of patterns computation, ease of extraction, matching confidence level, as well as density of depth estimation for 3 D reconstruction...|$|R
