50|$|Still later, {{a variety}} of wheel rakes or star wheel rakes were developed, with 5, 6, 7 or more spring-tooth encircled wheels mounted on a frame and ground driven by {{free-wheeling}} contact as the implement was pulled forward. These rakes were variously promoted as being mechanically simpler and trouble-free, gentler on the hay than a <b>side-delivery</b> <b>rake,</b> and cheaper to operate.|$|E
40|$|The path of {{a finger}} of a {{conventional}} <b>side-delivery</b> <b>rake</b> is the volume common to an oval cylinder and two warped prisms (one vertical and one horizontal). The shape of the warred prisms depends on operating speeds and rake geometry: {{the shape of the}} oval cylinder depends only on rake geometry and is independent of speed. An experimental rake her been developed. The design ensures that, at any operating speed, the crop is moved in a straight line from the swath to the windrow. There is no chance of intermittent contact between the fingers and the crop; each finger moves {{a small portion of the}} crop the full distance from the swath to the windrow. The velocity of crop during its passage is constant. At the same time, the velocity of the fingers relative to the ground is significantly less then the velocity of the fingers of a conventional rake.

40|$|Roll-Over Protective Structure (ROPS) {{represents}} {{the state of}} art for the driver’s protection in case of tractors roll-over. Despite their real risk of overturning, the ROPS approach for the Self-Propelled agricultural Machinery (SPM) is quite recent. Due to the several SPM categories available on the market, characterized by very different mass, dimension and working functions, the fitting of a ROPS and consequently the ascertainment of its protection level is quite complicated. SPM could be preliminarily divided into at least two categories: - large SPM: combine, forage, potato, sugar-beet and grape harvesters; sprayer; etc.; - small SPM: ride-on tractor, mower, comb <b>side-delivery</b> <b>rake,</b> etc. The most followed approach at present is to check preliminarily the overturning behavior of the SPM considering its longitudinal and lateral stability; if a real risk of overturning is ascertained, {{in order to minimize}} the likelihood of driver’s injury the manufacturer often installs a ROPS. The consequent need is to provide some test criteria of them. Sprayers between large SPM, and comb <b>side-delivery</b> <b>rake</b> between small SPM were the machine types on which ROPS were tested, adopting in both cases the procedure provided by Code 4 issued by the Organization for Economic and Cooperation Development (OECD), dedicated to ROPS fitted on conventional agricultural and forestry tractors. Notwithstanding the very different dimensions of these two SPM, this standard was selected considering the predictable roll-over behavior, also in relation with the front and rear track values. On the 4950 kg mass sprayer was fitted a closed cab, while on the 690 kg mass comb side-delivery rakes a 3 -pillars frame was applied. In both cases the response of the tests was positive, so indicating a general suitability of OECD Code 4 to assure a ROPS good driver’s protection level in case of overturning. On the other hand, to ascertain more in detail the roll-over behavior of the SPM, some further questions need to be deeply examined, such as the driver’s place location, the height of the centre of gravity from the ground in different machine configurations (i. e. with crop tanks empty or full), the external silhouette, the axles mass distribution of the laden/unladen machine, etc...|$|E

40|$|Ash {{content of}} alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay {{typically}} ranges from 6 % to 8 % dry matter (DM) with ash contents > 8 % indicating hay {{that is likely}} contaminated with soil. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the effect of rake-type on ash content of alfalfa hay. Research was conducted in 2015 in Minnesota (loamy sand), Pennsylvania (silty loam) and Wisconsin (silty loam) on first cutting alfalfa hay. Treatments involved consolidating two swaths of mowed hay with a wheel rake, <b>side-delivery</b> <b>rake,</b> rotary rake or a hay merger. To show changes in ash throughout haymaking, random samples were taken from the standing forage, cut swaths, windrows made by each rake type and from bales (Minnesota and Wisconsin) or haylage (Pennsylvania). Samples were analyzed for ash content using wet chemistry procedures. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0. 05 and mean separations were determined using Tukey HSD and are presented as percent DM. Differences in ash content were found between rakes at two locations with the wheel rake resulting in the greatest amount of ash and the merger resulting in the least amount of ash. Farmers looking to reduce ash content of hay should consider using a hay merger when combining swaths...|$|E
