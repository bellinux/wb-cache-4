I was motivated to carry out to research on this topic due to the growing numbers of Service Leavers facing many problems when transitioning from the military to civilian society in the UK. This dissertation has been designed in five different chapters. The first chapter explains Gurkhas’ history and the reason for research. The second chapter deals with the literature review, gathering, underpinning knowledge on the subject area, and gives a solid foundation to the research. The third chapter explains the methodology applied and shows how the data was collected. The fourth chapter analyses the data from the research findings and finally the fifth chapter concludes with the recommendations from the analysis. The ‘Quantitative method’ was selected for a research that has proved to be the most appropriate method of research to collect data from the Serving Gurkhas and GSLs. The ‘questionnaire technique’ was used as the tool to gather data from these two groups. Despite the Gurkhas TACOS reviewed in 2007 and Immigration Rules in 2009, which allowed the retired Gurkhas to settle in the UK, the Serving Gurkhas are exempted from this rule and they are employed without any <b>settlement</b> <b>visa.</b> The MoD have ruled out this because of the Gurkha Terms and Conditions of Service (TACOS), which states the Gurkha soldiers, must remain as Nepalese citizens throughout their career in the Brigade iv of Gurkhas (BG). However, the survey findings state that obtaining ILR is not the changes of the nationality. 100 % of the GSLs who took part on the research believe that the military Chain of Command (CoC) and MoD have misinterpreted the terms ILR and naturalisation. More than 64 % of GSLs and 83 % of currently Serving Gurkhas are not fully satisfied with their TACOS. On average 126 (Gurkha Recruit Records, 2013) Gurkhas are recruited each year and similar numbers are expected to retire each year. However, in 2011 and 2012, 400 additional Gurkhas have already discharged from the Army as part of the Army Redundancy Scheme and a further 304 Gurkhas are discharging in 2013. Be it whether they have retired after a full 22 years of service or discharged from the Army under the Redundancy Scheme, the GSLs have encountered various problems because they cannot obtain ILR before they are fully discharged from the Army. Recent Service Leavers have raised their concerns through various means to their CoC in the Brigade of Gurkhas explaining how badly they have suffered when transitioning from the Army and settling into the civilian society. On the question “How long did it take to endorse ILR in their passport by the UK Border Agency?” it was found that, 52 % of the GSLs said, it took more than 8 weeks after their final discharge date to receive their passport back from the UK Border Agency. 47 % of the GSLs said, it took more than 10 weeks to receive their passport back from the Border Agency that is in total 20 weeks. From the findings, 40 % of the GSLs confirmed they were forced to stay without job for up to 2 months and 47 % said, they even had to stay without any job up to 5 months, as their prospective employers had asked for a proof of settlement status such as a work permit visa or residency visa. The findings have also proved that the GSLs have to wait far too long to receive their passport back from the UK Border Agency with ILR endorsed. 10 weeks timelines, completely different immigration rules that apply only to the Gurkhas, is very irrelevant and against the British Army’s equal and fair treatment policies, which must be corrected soonest...|$|E

This paper develops and estimates a structural model of adoption {{and use of}} payment instruments by U. S. consumers. We use a cross-section of data from the Survey of Consumer Payment Choice, a new survey of consumer behavior. We evaluate substitution and income effects. Our simulations {{shed light on the}} consumer response to the 2011 regulation of interchange fees on debit cards imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the proposed <b>settlement</b> between <b>Visa</b> and MasterCard and the Department of Justice that would allow merchants to surcharge the use of payment cards.

40|$|Data centers run organizations. Among {{the roles}} of a data center are {{generating}} revenue, storing sensitive data, and providing business-critical services. Because of their criticality and value, they are targets. Sensitive data, business applications, databases, network devices, storage, and supporting infrastructure have all long been in the crosshairs of external and internal attackers as well as auditors armed with regulatory mandates. Virtually every data center security issue and regulatory mandate has spawned a point solution. This reactive process where new point solutions are added at every turn has resulted in data center controls that are complex, numerous, expensive, and disconnected, thus overwhelming most organizations. In addition to existing requirements, new threats and trends are continually entering the fray. For example, organizations are requiring their data centers to support mobility and Web 2. 0, provide protection against targeted and opportunistic attacks, and do all this while minimizing downtime and producing frequent reports for demonstrating compliance. Heartland Payment Systems After The Breach In 2010, Heartland reached a $ 60 million <b>settlement</b> with <b>VISA</b> to resolve all potential claims {{with respect to the}} 2009 breach. A year earlier, Heartland reached a similar settlement with Amex for $ 3. 5 million. 1 Classic data center security lacks the business agility for quickly and seamlessly embracing new requirements, the security management for efficiencies and effectiveness, the availability and integrity necessary for today’s mission-critical operations, and the optimized design for cost effectiveness. Data centers have evolved to be more mission-critical than ever. Today’s IT departments are blazing new trails. We can only speculate about the next “big thing ” five years out, but if the last five years are any measure, what we thought made us secure isn’t going to keep us secure. A strategic framework is needed that helps connect the historically disparate pieces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the acculturation challenges facing Iraqi refugees in Australia, {{and the impact}} of humanitarian visa category. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Temporary Protection Visa (TPV) holders and Permanent Protection Visa (PPV) holders living in Melbourne. The findings indicate that TPV holders identify the temporary visa regime as the primary obstacle to successful integration into Australian society. The findings also suggest that TPV refugees have developed a greater level of social ties outside their ethnic groups and are less focused on issues of cultural maintenance than refugees with PPVs. The insecurity associated with the temporary protection regime appears to have led to a decreased focus on cultural maintenance, in favour of the more immediate “survival” focus on material <b>settlement</b> needs and <b>visa</b> status. While the increased social contacts of TPV refugees with some mainstream groups may be considered a partial indicator of successful acculturation, these developments cannot be equated with “settlement” as the social ties are of a temporary or unstable nature. The overriding impact of the temporary visa regime is one of creating obstacles to the effective integration of TPV refugees. <br /...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} number of countries with low incidence of tuberculosis have pre-entry screening programmes for migrants. We present the first estimates of the prevalence of and risk factors for tuberculosis in migrants from 15 high-incidence countries screened before entry to the UK. We did a population-based cross-sectional study of applicants for long-term visas who were screened for tuberculosis before entry to the UK in a pilot programme between Oct 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2013. The primary outcome was prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis. We used Poisson regression to estimate crude prevalence and created a multivariable logistic regression model to identify risk factors for the primary outcome. 476   455 visa applicants were screened, and the crude prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis was 92 (95 % CI 84 - 101) per 100   000 individuals. After adjustment for age and sex, factors that were strongly {{associated with an increased}} risk of bacteriologically confirmed disease at pre-entry screening were self-report of close or household contact with an individual with tuberculosis (odds ratio 11 · 6, 95 % CI 7 · 0 - 19 · 3; p< 0 · 0001) and being an applicant for <b>settlement</b> and dependant <b>visas</b> (1 · 3, 1 · 0 - 1 · 6; p= 0 · 0203). Migrants reporting contact with an individual with tuberculosis had the highest risk of tuberculosis at pre-entry screening. To tackle this disease burden in migrants, a comprehensive and collaborative approach is needed between countries with pre-entry screening programmes, health services in the countries of origin and migration, national tuberculosis control programmes, and international public health bodies.
