5|$|Related {{work on a}} <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the Hawker Siddeley P.1154, was {{cancelled}} in 1965. As a result, the P.1127 (RAF), {{a variant}} more closely based on the Kestrel, was ordered into production that year, and named Harrier - the name originally intended for the P.1154 - in 1967. The Harrier served with the UK and several nations, often as a carrier-based aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} skepticism about operating <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> from carrier decks. So {{in order to address}} this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long takeoff rolls, had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|E
40|$|The study {{examines}} the arguments raised {{for or against}} possessing <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircrafts</b> of the Army of the Czech Republic. The aim is to identify the arguments primarily during deciding on the acquisition of new aircrafts, because the old ones were retired in 2005. In the first part, the author analyzes various approaches to purchasing and possessing weapons systems (nuclear weapons, <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircrafts</b> and tanks) and defines three approaches, which he expects in discourse and which he will examine. The {{main part of the}} study deals with analysis of the arguments for and against the acquisition of <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircrafts</b> through discourse analysis. As a frame of reference author establishes the deputies and senators of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, the professional public and official documents of the Ministry of Defense and Army of the Czech Republic. By analyzing the discourse the author concludes that the official documents of the Army of the Czech Republic looks at <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircrafts</b> as a means of national defense strictly, professional public also looks at <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircrafts</b> this way in most of times. MPs and senators argue for acquiring <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircrafts</b> not only by defense purposes, they argue that <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircrafts</b> is mandatory purchase, because loss of the supersonic [...] ...|$|R

5|$|The {{eastbound}} {{record was}} {{set by the}} same Air France Concorde (F-BTSD) under charter to Concorde Spirit Tours in the US on 15–16 August 1995. This promotional flight circumnavigated the world from New York/JFK International Airport in 31 hours 27 minutes 49 seconds, including six refuelling stops at Toulouse, Dubai, Bangkok, Andersen AFB in Guam, Honolulu, and Acapulco. By its 30th flight anniversary on 2 March 1999 Concorde had clocked up 920,000 flight hours, with more than 600,000 supersonic, many more {{than all of the}} other <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> in the Western world combined.|$|E
5|$|The Hawker Siddeley Harrier, {{developed}} in the 1960s, {{was the first of}} the Harrier Jump Jet series of aircraft. It was the first operational close-support and reconnaissance fighter aircraft with vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) capabilities and the only truly successful V/STOL design of the many that arose in that era. The Harrier was developed directly from the Hawker Siddeley Kestrel prototype aircraft, following the cancellation of a more advanced <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the Hawker Siddeley P.1154. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) ordered the Harrier GR.1 and GR.3 variants in the late 1960s. It was exported to the United States as the AV-8A, for use by the US Marine Corps (USMC), in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|While {{financial}} backing was issued by NATO's Mutual Weapons Development Program to support {{development of the}} Pegasus engine, the British government were not forthcoming with funding. While HSA chose {{to go ahead with}} the P.1127 as a private venture, the Air Staff disagreed heavily over what requirements should be set out for a future RAF VTOL aircraft; some officers, such as the Chief of the Air Staff Sir Thomas Pike, advocated simplicity while others, such as the RAF operational requirements division, sought various performance demands of such an aircraft, particularly the capacity for supersonic flight. HSA was also interested in the prospects and feasibility of a more sophisticated development of the P.1127, knowing that a supersonic-capable VTOL aircraft would likely be more attractive to customers, there being a general perception at the time that <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> held significantly more value their subsonic counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{produced}} {{nitrogen oxides}} in its exhaust, which, despite complicated interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood {{to result in}} degradation to the ozone layer at the stratospheric altitudes it cruised. It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the layers is restricted. The small fleet meant overall ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was negligible. In 1995, David Fahey, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States, warned that a fleet of 500 <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> with exhausts similar to Concorde might produce in a 2 per cent drop in global ozone levels, much higher than previously thought. Each 1 per cent drop in ozone is estimated to increase the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer worldwide by 2 per cent. Dr Fahey said if these particles are produced by highly oxidised sulphur in the fuel, as he believed, then removing sulphur in the fuel will reduce the ozone-destroying impact of supersonic transport.|$|E
5|$|Total solar eclipses {{are rare}} events. Although they occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, it is {{estimated}} that they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years, on average. The total eclipse lasts for only a maximum of a few minutes at any location, because the Moon's umbra moves eastward at over 1700km/h. Totality currently can never last more than 7min 32s. This value changes over the millennia and is currently decreasing. By the 8th millennium, the longest theoretically possible total eclipse will be less than 7min 2s. The last time an eclipse longer than 7 minutes occurred was June 30, 1973 (7 min 3 sec). Observers aboard a Concorde <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> were able to stretch totality for this eclipse to about 74 minutes by flying along the path of the Moon's umbra. The next total eclipse exceeding seven minutes in duration will not occur until June 25, 2150. The longest total solar eclipse during the 11,000 year period from 3000 BC to at least 8000 AD will occur on July 16, 2186, when totality will last 7min 29s. For comparison, the longest total eclipse of the 20th century at 7min 8s occurred on June 20, 1955, and there are no total solar eclipses over 7min in duration in the 21st century.|$|E

25|$|A common {{analogy is}} the sonic boom of a <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> or bullet. The sound waves {{generated}} by the supersonic body propagate {{at the speed of}} sound itself; as such, the waves travel slower than the speeding object and cannot propagate forward from the body, instead forming a shock front. In a similar way, a charged particle can generate a light shock wave as it travels through an insulator.|$|E
25|$|The Javelin was {{succeeded in}} the {{interceptor}} role by the English Electric Lightning, a <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> capable of flying {{at more than}} double the Javelin's top speed, which was introduced into the RAF only a few years later.

25|$|For {{context of}} comparison, in {{supersonic}} flows, additional increased expansion may {{be achieved through}} an expansion fan, {{also known as a}} Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan. Moreover, the accompanying expansion wave may approach and eventually collide and recombine with the shock wave, which is a process of destructive interference. Thus the sonic boom associated with the passage of a <b>supersonic</b> <b>aircraft</b> is a type of sound wave produced by constructive interference.|$|E
