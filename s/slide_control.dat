40|$|In this paper, a {{multiphase}} sliding mode (MPSM) {{control method}} with a master–slave structure is proposed and analyzed {{in order to}} suppress ripples at input terminals or output terminals in DC/DC converter applications. With the proposed MPSM, the switching frequency of a multiphase DC/DC converter {{does not need to}} be operating such a high switching frequency as adopted in a conventional sliding mode control-based DC/DC converter. As a result, switching power losses could be reduced in this converter. Another advantage of this proposed method is that the master–slave multiphase <b>slide</b> <b>control</b> loop could figure out a proper phase shift between each switching phase of a DC/DC converter instead of precalculated phase shift.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the linear electromagnetic motor (LEM) {{which consists of}} two solenoids and a <b>slide</b> <b>control</b> with neodymium magnet bars placed on its end. The work of the electromagnetic motor {{is based on the}} phenomenon of electromagnetic repulsion. The device also includes an electromagnetic brake which allows to stop the slider or to hold the slider in a fixed position, without electricity supply. The range of the slider movement is up to 50 mm. The paper deals with the problem of implementation of the Genetic Algorithm GA to calculate Pareto-optimal solutions. In this process, the functions of voltage powering solenoids used to control the position of the linear electromagnetic motor are evaluated. This procedure assumes minimizing two conflicted criteria: the time of movement of the motor and the energy input. In this case the device works in the open-loop system without a feedback loop. The results of the application of the conventional PID controller are also presented, which allows precision positioning up to 1 µm.

30|$|In this paper, the {{development}} of a shared virtual presentation board (VPB) for real-time e-Meeting on the Web-based e-Learning System (WebELS) platform is introduced. WebELS is a general-purpose e-Learning system to support flexibility and globalization of higher education in science and technology. In WebELS, the Meeting module consists of online presentation and video conference system, and the combination of both allows the creation of a so-called virtual room for e-Meeting applications where participants convene via the Internet. Online presentation features synchronized <b>slide</b> <b>control</b> between the presenter and the listeners for slide changing, scrolling, zooming, cursor positioning, and playback control for video embedded on the slide. It also features online annotation that allows the presenter to write using a pen function on the slide display panel. The system has video conferencing function that provides an audio-video communication among the meeting participants. This paper discusses briefly the video conference system, and focuses on online presentation based on slide-based synchronization and {{the development}} of VPB. VPB is a shared object that resides on the server that is updated every time the presenter client makes mouse events and is periodically accessed by client system in order that listener’s presentation viewer synchronized with that of the presenter.|$|E
30|$|Bandwidth {{utilization}} {{depends on}} the data size transmitted {{over a period of}} time between the client and the server. Based on the data in Table  1, WebELS VPB data for cursor-based presentation mode does not pose high bandwidth utilization since the data size is very small and <b>slide</b> <b>control</b> events are not that frequent. For VPB data in pen-based presentation mode, the more annotation is done, the larger the data sent every mouse release. As for the Flash-based online presentation, slide image is transferred from the server to the client every slide change. Though high quality images are typically around 1 Mbytes, slide change is not that frequent that would cause high bandwidth utilization. But in screen sharing technology, there is a requirement for broadband network to achieve better quality. Among the different online presentation technologies, VPB concept works well even in narrowband Internet environment, say a 56  kbps line. On the other hand, slide synchronization delay between the presenter and listener using VPB is minimal because of its optimized data size, and delay would depend mainly on the network distance, i.e., round-trip propagation and transmission delay. Slide synchronization delay of 1 or 2  seconds is negligible in online distance presentation.|$|E
