The fibers were treated by being soaked in 5 wt. % NaOH solution at 30 &# 0176;C for 30 min. The composites with treated fiber exhibited higher thermal stability, tensile strength, sound absorption, and fiber-matrix adhesion than the composites with untreated fiber. The results of sound absorption measurements showed that the composites with higher fiber content had better sound absorption than the composites with lower fiber content.

40|$|Each year, {{millions}} {{of tons of}} agricultural residues uch as wheat straw are produced worldwide. In this paper, we describe ongoing efforts to solve technological, infrastructural, and economic challenges to using this straw for bioenergy and bioproducts. Among these challenges, silica in straw forms a low-melting point eutectic with potassium, causing excessive slagging deposits in boilers. The presence of chlorine causes corrosion beneath the slag deposits on boiler tubes. Silica fouls kilns and fines slow paper machines, limiting the usefulness of straw in linerboard production. Poor resin bonding to the waxy outer cuticle of the straw, poor resin penetration, and high resin consumption due to fines limit the use of straw for straw-thermoplastic composites and for straw particleboard. Poor cellulase penetration limits the use of straw for production of fuels (ethanol) and chemicals. Straw consists principally of stems, leaves, sheaths, nodes, awns, and chaff. Not all of these parts of straw residue are equally valuable. Leaves and sheaths are higher in silica, while chaff, leaves and nodes comprise the source of most of the fines. The predominantly fibrous <b>straw</b> <b>stem,</b> high in cellulose, is of greater value for bioenergy, biofuels, and bioproducts.

The result of unlimited consumption of fossil fuels is a severe depletion of the natural reserves and damage to the environment. Depleting fossil reserves and increasing demand for energy together with environmental concerns have motivated researchers towards the development of alternative fuels which are eco-friendly, renewable and economical. Bioethanol is one such dominant global renewable transport biofuel which can readily substitute fossil fuels. Conventionally, bioethanol has been produced from sucrose and starch rich feedstocks (edible agricultural crops and products) known as 1 st generation bioethanol; however this substrate conflicts with food and feed production. As an alternative to 1 st generation bioethanol, currently there is much focus on advancing a cellulosic bioethanol concept that utilizes lignocellulosic residues from agricultural crops and residues (such as bagasse, <b>straw,</b> stover, <b>stems,</b> leaves and deoiled seed residues). Efficient conversion of lignocellulosic biomass into bioethanol remains an area of active research in terms of pretreatment of the biomass to fractionate its constituents (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin), breakdown of cellulose and hemicellulose into hexose and pentose sugars and co-fermentation of the sugars to ethanol. The present review discusses research progress in bioethanol production from sucrose, starch and cellulosic feedstocks. Development of efficient technology to convert lignocellulosic biomass into fermentable sugars and optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis using on-site/ in-house enzyme preparation are the key areas of development in lignocellulosic bioethanol production.

Lightweight composites are preferred, especially for automotive applications due to the potential saving in energy. In this research, the effects of manufacturing parameters, such as concentrations, lengths, widths and split configurations of reinforcing materials, on the properties of composites have been studied. Compared with the jute-PP composites of the same density (0. 47 g/cm 3), composites reinforced by biological materials showed generally better properties. The composites reinforced by biological materials with optimized properties {{have the potential to}} be used for industrial applications such as the support layers in automotive interiors, office panels and ceiling tiles...|$|R
40|$|Ash {{transformation}} processes {{have been}} studied during co-firing of wheat <b>straw</b> and pine <b>stem</b> wood and softwood bark. Pilot-scale trials in a 150 kW pulverised-fuel-fired burner were performed. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were made to support {{the interpretation of the}} results. The results show that fast reactions involving gaseous ash compounds are favored at the expense of reactions where condensed components participate. Accordingly, the conditions promote gas phase reactions resulting in the formation of chlorides, sulfate and carbonates whereas reactions involving condensed reactants are suppressed. Both the slagging and fouling propensity of all co-firing mixes was reduced compared to that for pure straw. For the wood/straw mixes this was mainly due to a dilution of the ash forming elements of straw whereas for straw/bark, an additional effect from interaction between the fuel ash components was observed to primarily reduce slagging. In general it can be concluded that under powder combustion conditions equilibrium are approached selectively and that the ash matter are strongly fractionated. The general results in this paper are useful for straw-fired power stations looking for alternative co-firing fuels.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} {{study on the}} conversion of a biomass particle is carried out to quantify the effect of homogeneous volatile combustion on the biomass pyrolysis. The numerical domain consists of a particle and its surrounding and the model considers detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for reaction of pyrolysis products. A detailed pyrolysis model is employed which provides the composition of pyrolysis products. The effect of gas phase reaction on the conversion time and temperature of the particle is analyzed and it was shown that the gas phase reactions results in shorter pyrolysis time. H 2 O mole fraction and temperature above a biomass pellet from wheat <b>straw</b> (WS) and <b>stem</b> wood (SW) were experimentally measured using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) while recording the particle mass loss. The TDLAS data were used to validate the numerical model developed for biomass conversion. The results showed that by considering the gas phase reactions a good agreement between the measurement and the model prediction for mass loss and temperature can be achieved. For H 2 O mole fraction {{on top of the}} particle, on the other hand, some discrepancy between the model prediction and the experimental data was observed. Nevertheless, the difference in H 2 O mole fraction would be much larger by neglecting the gas phase reaction at the particle boundary...|$|R
40|$|Wastewaters {{from the}} fruit {{packaging}} industry contain a high pesticide load and require treatment before their environmental discharge. We provide first {{evidence for the}} potential bioremediation of these wastewaters. Three white rot fungi (WRF) (Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes versicolor, Pleurotus ostreatus) and an Aspergillus niger strain were tested in <b>straw</b> extract medium (<b>StEM)</b> and soil extract medium (SEM) for degrading the pesticides thiabendazole (TBZ), imazalil (IMZ), thiophanate methyl (TM), ortho-phenylphenol (OPP), diphenylamine (DPA) and chlorpyrifos (CHL). Peroxidase (LiP, MnP) and laccase (Lac) activity was also determined to investigate their involvement in pesticide degradation. T. versicolor and P. ostreatus were the most efficient degraders and degraded all pesticides (10 mg l(- 1)) except TBZ, with maximum efficiency in StEM. The phenolic pesticides OPP and DPA were rapidly degraded by these two fungi with a concurrent increase in MnP and Lac activity. In contrast, these enzymes were not associated with the degradation of CHL, IMZ and TM implying the involvement of other enzymes. T. versicolor degraded spillage-level pesticide concentrations (50 mg l(- 1)) either fully (DPA, OPP) or partially (TBZ, IMZ). The fungus was also able to rapidly degrade a mixture of TM/DPA (50 mg l(- 1)), whereas it failed to degrade IMZ and TBZ when supplied in a mixture with OPP. Overall, T. versicolor and P. ostreatus showed great potential for the bioremediation of wastewaters from the fruit packaging industry. However, degradation of TBZ should be also achieved before further scaling up...|$|R
