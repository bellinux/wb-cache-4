The results showed that grade sawing has the potential to substantially increase the proportion of high-value timber grades over fixed-sawpattern breakdown methods. Log positioning (no <b>taper,</b> <b>split</b> <b>taper,</b> and full taper) had little influence on grade recovery but <b>split</b> <b>taper</b> showed a clear advantage in conversion...|$|R

40|$|A {{prototype}} of planar silicon photonic structure is designed and simulated to provide narrow resonant line-width (∼ 2 nm) {{in a wide}} photonic band gap (∼ 210 nm) with broad tunable resonant wavelength range (∼ 100 nm) around the optical communication wavelength 1550 nm. This prototype {{is based on the}} combination of two modified basic photonic structures, i. e. a <b>split</b> <b>tapered</b> photonic crystal micro-cavity embedded in a photonic wire waveguide, and a slot waveguide with narrowed slabs. This prototype is then further integrated with a MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) based electrostatic comb actuator to achieve “coarse tune” and “fine tune” at the same time for wide range and narrow-band filtering and modulating. It also provides a wide range tunability to achieve the designed resonance even fabrication imperfection occurs...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of the work here presented involves three main topics: Wireless Power Transmission (WPT) technology, phased array systems, and microwave components design and modeling. The first topic presents the conceptual design of a WPT system at 2. 45 GHz with 90 % efficiency and 1 MW of DC output power. Second, a comparative study between 2. 45 and 35 GHz WPT operation is provided. Finally, the optimization of a taper distribution with reduced thermal constraints on a sandwich transmitter is realized. For a 250 - and 375 -m antenna radius, 89. 7 % of collection efficiency with 29 % reduction in maximum power density (compared to the Gaussian), and 93 % collection efficiency with 39 % reduction of maximum power density, are obtained respectively with two <b>split</b> <b>tapers.</b> The reduction in maximum power density {{and the use of}} <b>split</b> <b>taper</b> are important to alleviate the thermal problems in high power transmission. For the phased array project, the conceptual design of a small-scale system and in-depth analysis using two main approaches (statistical and field analysis) is realized. Practical aspects are addressed to determine the phased array main design features. The statistical method provides less accurate results than the field analysis since it is intended for large arrays. Careful theoretical analysis led to good correlation between statistical, field analysis and experimental results. In the components chapter, efficient loop transitions used in a patch antenna array are designed at K- and W-band. Measured insertion loss (IL) K-band loop is under 0. 4 dB. The K- and W-band antenna array measured broadside gains are 23. 6 dB at 24. 125 GHz and 25 dB at 76. 5 GHz with return loss under 9. 54 dB from 24 to 24. 4 GHz and 12 dB from 75. 1 to 77. 3 GHz, respectively. Also, a multilayer folded line filter is designed at 5. 8 GHz and compared to planar ring filters. Improved measured bandwidth from 2 GHz to 7. 5 GHz and IL of 1. 2 dB are obtained with approximately half the size of a planar ring resonator. Thirdly, a simplified switch model is implemented for use in broadband phased-shifters. The model presents very good fit to the measured results with an overall total error under 3 %, magnitude error less than 8 %, and phase errors less than ? 0. 4 ?...|$|R
5000|$|The nohkan or fue' [...] ("flute") {{is made of}} <b>split</b> and <b>tapered</b> {{strips of}} smoked bamboo (susudake) or burned bamboo (yakidake), glued {{together}} to form a tapering conical bore. The smoking carbonizes the bamboo and preserves it. The split strips of bamboo are reversed to place the hard bamboo surface on the inside for improved acoustics. Some modern versions of nohkan use an interior coating of tempera paint for this. The strips are then glued together, bound with thin strips of twisted cherry bark (kabamaki) and lacquered to make the conical tube. The result is a keyless tube of 39.1 cm with an average bore width of 1.7 cm and there are 7 finger holes.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} electrode {{mounting structure}} for a {{gas tungsten arc welding}} torch having a coaxial imaging system. The electrode mounting structure includes a support having a central hub and {{a plurality of}} spokes which extend from the hub generally radially with respect to the axis of the torch into supporting engagement with the interior walls of the torch. The spaces between the spokes are optical passages for transmission of light to form the image. A tubular collet holder is threadedly engaged at its upper end to the hub and extends downwardly toward the open end of the torch. The collet holder has an inwardly tapering constriction near its lower end. An electrode-retaining, tubular collet is mounted within the collet holder and has a longitudinally <b>split</b> and <b>tapered</b> end seating against the tapered constriction. A spring seats against {{the upper end of the}} collet and forces the split end against the tapered constriction to wedge the split end radially inwardly to grip the electrode within the collet...|$|R
40|$|The pace in {{swimming}} {{is very important}} because it allows swimmers to allocate their forces accordingly, and therefore a distance to travel as quickly as possible. The training pace at different swimmingspeeds and combinations thereof, {{is an important part}} of training before the competitions. The definition and maintenance of the stable and swimmer specific speed is difficult to achieve and requires considerable effort and experience. To determine the desired rate of accuracy by the researchers and their coaches used till now, various audio and visual media. However, some of these institutions did not very accurately measure the rate and not all styles of swimming, while other aspects affect the proper swimming. In this construction, a key objective is to solve the problems occurring in the previous constructions, the modern technological development of them and the adaption of the specificities of different swimming styles. This device consists of an electro 3 / 8 of the horse, a flange, a single inverter from 3 / 8 to ½ of the horse, pulleys with <b>taper</b> <b>Bush,</b> flange axle, pulleys, platforms and a 52 meters cable. The assembly and operation is as follows: At the edge of the pool next to the platform is placed the base of pulleys, the electro setis connected to the inverter and the axle flange. Precisely opposite is positioned the other base. Along the pool «moves» the cable that connects the two bases, located 150 cm above the water. A fixed point on the cable is marked with paint in order to be visible to the swimmer during backstroke swimming while for other styles we adapt a lamination at the cable vertically inthe pool, above the surface a sheet of 15 cm which is painted with strong color that is visible from the athlete and will precede him. Setting the speed with inverter it starts from one end of the tank leading to the other, doing a circular motion. The swimmer is required to follow the marked point of the cable in the backstroke or lamination in other styles. Practical applications of the use of speed regulator: 1) Determination of constant speed (rate) of the athlete, without movement problems 2) Growth rate of change in perception of the athlete. 3) Verification ofproper technique 4) Training in the change of pace, planning and competition tactic...|$|R
50|$|Shake blocks {{are split}} into 1 inch thick slats called blanks, using either a {{hydraulic}} press with a blade attached, called a cuber, or split by hand using a froe and mallet. These blanks are uniform in thickness throughout if split {{from the same}} edge without flipping the block. Alternatively, the splitter may flip the block after a blank is taken off each edge, which results in a <b>tapered</b> <b>split</b> from end to end, called tapers or hand-split. The blanks which are not tapered require further processing before application to create this taper, and are run through a large band saw, pushed by hand to cut them from corner to corner forming a tapered shake, sawn on one face.|$|R
40|$|An {{upper bound}} {{solution}} for extrusion of “triangular” sectioned product through taper die from round sectioned billet has been developed. A simple discontinuous kinematically admissible velocity field with optimization parameter is proposed. From the proposed velocity field the upper bound solution on non-dimensional extrusion pressure are determined {{with respect to}} chosen process parameters. The theoretical results are compared with experimental result to check {{the validity of the}} proposed velocity fields. The reformulated SERR technique is used to find out the kinematically admissible velocity field applied to deformation zone surrounded by flat surfaces. This velocity field is used to compute upper bound extrusion pressure at various area of reduction. The triangular sectioned product from round sectioned billet through taper die is taken for upper bound analysis using SERR technique. As this section is symmetry about one axis with round sectioned billet only one half of section is taken as domain interest for deformation zone to calculate the velocity field. Detailed formulations of models are presented. To validate the proposed model/analysis experiments are carried out taking lead as the working material. An experimental set-up is designed and fabricated with four <b>split</b> type <b>taper</b> dies for this purpose. Experiments are carried out at dry and lubricated condition of the dies to check the friction effect. The results obtained indicate that the predictions both in extrusion load and the deformed configuration are in good agreement with the experiment under different lubrication conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Novel circularly {{polarized}} (CP) VHF SATCOM antenna {{which was based}} on Moxon antenna (bent dipole element over a ground plane) has been extended for RFID and GPS applications. A sequence of topologies starting from a single vertical element to two vertical elements of the Moxon arms, then widened strip arm elements were investigated to understand the effects on impedance match over the widened bandwidth. The logic in this evolution was to obtain maximized gain based on Fano-Chu limits, which suggests that more metallization in the radiating configuration that fill the volume would yield higher gain for electrically small antenna. Extending the width of the strip of the equivalent dipole elements lead to a wider bandwidth and improved cross-polarization ratio. Furthermore, <b>splitting</b> the <b>tapered</b> bow tie elements increased the volume filled with radiating elements leading to improved overall performance. Ultimately extended bends {{at the tip of the}} tapered sections parallel to the ground plane helped to improve overall performance. In overall, the antenna presented here produced lower physical height, higher gain, wider bandwidth, better crosspolarization and lower back lobe radiation compared to commercial counterparts such as an eggbeater currently used in SATCOM practice as well as similar antennas in RFID and GPS applications. Here, the concept is extended to cover RFID (850 - 1050 MHz) and GPS (centered at 1227 and 1575 MHz) bands leading to new applications at a significant cost and size reductions and much improved performance. Prototype antennas were built based on HFSS simulations yielded better than - 25 dB return loss. During simulations attention was paid to identify the effects of individual antenna elements as an optimization parameter on the overall input impedance matching over the extended bandwidth. Simulated and measured results yielded higher than industrial counterpart antenna gain, bandwidth and cross-polarization for much reduced physical dimensions...|$|R

Patients were functionally and radiographically evaluated using Harris Hip Scores and plain radiographs assessing postarthroplasty groin or thigh pain and radiographic signs of stem subsidence, proximal femoral fixation, stress shielding, and related calcar resorption. At followup of 5 – 10 years, the incidence of groin pain and thigh pain was 9. 1 % and 3. 6 %, respectively. This incidence improved over time. Beyond 10 years of followup, groin pain was 2. 7 % and thigh pain zero. In 89 % of cases, there was solid contact between the calcar and the undersurface of the stem collar. Five cases were revised for instability (5. 4 %). The Harris Hip Scores and the incidence of thigh or groin pain were very favorable compared to other reported press fit total hip arthroplasty stems and not significantly different across a broad age range.

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{was made to}} determine the effects of full-span and of partial-span split flaps on the aerodynamic characteristics of a tapered wing. Aerodynamic force tests were made in the N. A. C. A. 7 by 10 foot wind tunnel on a highly tapered Clark Y wing equipped with various split flaps. Two sizes of tapered-chord flaps were tested as full-span flaps, and a narrow tapered-chord flap was tested as a partial-span flap by cutting off portions first from the tip and then from the center. The investigation showed that with full-span split flaps the lift and drag characteristics of the tapered wing up to the stall are similar to those of a rectangular wing with flaps of comparable size, but that the stall of the tapered wing with full-span flaps occurs at progressively lower angles of attack with increasing flap deflection up to that for maximum lift. For partial-span <b>tapered</b> <b>split</b> flaps on a tapered wing it was found that the maximum lift is greater, and the lift-drag ratio at maximum lift is less, when the partial-span flap is located at the center of the wing than when it is located at the tip portion...|$|R
40|$|A {{recognized}} way {{of improving}} the fatigue resistance of a fastener hole is to introduce compressive tangential residual stress around it. This {{can be achieved by}} using a cold expansion method in which an oversized pin or ball is forced through the hole to produce a local plastic region surrounded by an elastic one. Once the pin or ball is removed allowing the elastic region to spring back it results in compressive tangential residual stress around the hole. In practise, however, it is found that such a cold expansion method creates a nonuniform residual stress distribution through the plate thickness and even tensile residual stress can be created at the entrance and exit faces. In this paper a new method of cold expansion is proposed. It uses a tapered pin with a mating <b>tapered</b> <b>split</b> sleeve and creates an almost uniform compressive residual stress around the hole as shown by FE method. Also, fatigue tests were carried out to verify that the method does significantly improve fatigue life. Finally the tangential residual stress distribution and fatigue life improvement of this new method were compared with those of a well-established cold expansion method and it was shown that the new method is more efficient in improving fatigue life...|$|R
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the <b>tapered</b> <b>split</b> collets in place.|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} novel {{solution}} is proposed {{to overcome the}} main beam <b>splitting</b> of the <b>tapered</b> slot antenna (TSA) fabricated on a thick substrate with high dielectric constant. It utilised arrays of metal strip gratings to reduce the undesirable surface waves. Measured result of a 10 lambda 0 long 35 GHz linear taper slot antenna (LTSA), shows a dramatic improvement in the radiation pattern and a measured front-to-back ratio of 20 dB for both the planes. Further analysis shows that the metal strip gratings help to improve the directivity and return loss of shorter LTSAs. Comparing with a basic LTSA without modification, the 4 lambda 0 LTSA has a 4. 3 dB and 14. 8 dB improvement on its directivity and return loss, respectively, which is 13. 2 dB and 22. 3 dB. In addition, the side lobe level is also suppressed from - 5. 2 dB to - 14. 4 dB. A new stepped profile formed by multiple constant slot width sections, to match the impedance between the feed and the aperture, is developed. This novel step-tapered profile increases the directivity of the antenna without increasing its length. A step-tapered slot antenna (STSA) is demonstrated at 28 GHz. It has a directivity of 7. 9 dB, a 2. 5 dB improvement over a LTSA with the same physical design, and {{shows no sign of}} main beam splitting. With the incorporation of the metal strip gratings, the directivity of the STSA further increases to 11. 0 dB with a return loss of 17. 2 dB. Finally, an improved CPW-to-slotline transition is developed for the STSA. The above work helps to open up the TSA for commercial millimetre-wave applications, such as radio-over-fibre, satellite communications and remote sensing, which previously were not feasible due to the requirements of fragile and costly ultra thin substrate or micromachining...|$|R
