50|$|The Poll Dorset is a <b>short</b> <b>wool,</b> meat {{producing}} sheep {{that was}} developed in Australia between 1937 and 1954 {{with the aim of}} breeding a true Dorset type sheep without horns. The poll gene was introduced into Dorset Horn flocks from two other polled breeds and following a strict back-mating programme achieved close to 100% of Dorset Horn blood. Its main distinguishing features are its hornless appearance, long, lean square body set on short legs, pink skin and 'spongy' short-stapled wool. The Poll Dorset produces a fleece of white, dense downs type wool of 30 microns fibre diameter and it has a white wool-free face. The breed was developed at a property called Valmore in Whitemore, Tasmania, a noted centre for pedigree livestock stud farms. The Poll Dorset resulted from the introduction of Corriedale and Ryeland blood into the Dorset Horn.|$|E
50|$|Scottish Blackface wool is a {{speciality}} wool in a {{class of}} its own. There are variations in type of fleece according to the way the sheep were bred. In general, there are a southwest type (<b>short</b> <b>wool)</b> and a central Scotland type (long wool). The southwest type is the finer, with a Bradford count of forty or so, generally classed as short or medium: ewe's fleece of 3 to 4Â½ lb, greasy. The central type is a stronger wool classed as long or deep strong; this type gives a ewe fleece of 5 to 6Â½ lb, greasy. The main markets are the mattress and upholstery trade, carpet and heavy cloth trade. Strong Blackface wool undoubtedly makes the best mattress filling there is: the demand for this is very good. The carpet trade all over the world (even New Zealand and Australia) uses large quantities of the medium class of Scottish Blackface wool.The finer wools are used for blending into many of the strong wearing clothes, over-coating,working tweeds and heavy blankets, The finest Scottish Blackface wool goes to the famous Harris tweed trade. The American Sheep Industry Association reports an average fibre diameter of 38 to 28 micrometres (or microns), and staple length of 10 to 14 in.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{melatonin}} on wool quality and thyroid function was studied. Ten ewes received a melatonin implant (M) on March 2004, and 10 ewes {{which were not}} implanted served as control (C). At monthly intervals over 12 months, f ibre length and growth were calculated, and plasma thyroxine (T 4) concentrations were measured. Wool samples (~N = 2000 fibres) were collected and fibre diameter, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of fibre diameter, spin fineness, comfort factor, 5 % of fibres Â«x Â» Âµm above the mean diameter, curve, and clean yield were measured. In summer, M ewes had significantly lower plasma T 4 concentrations than C ewes, with significant group (P < 0. 05) and season (P < 0. 01) effects. Melatonin ewes produced <b>shorter</b> <b>wool</b> than C ewes (P < 0. 001) and, in autumn, the differences were statistically significant. Fibre growth {{did not differ significantly}} between groups. Throughout the year, M ewes produced wool with a fibre diameter (mean = 26. 5 Â± 0. 2 Âµm) that was significantly (P < 0. 01) <b>shorter</b> than C <b>wool</b> (means = 27. 2 Â± 0. 5 Âµm). Overall, the melatonin treatment had a significant (P < 0. 01) effect on mean comfort factor, and the differences between groups were significant (P < 0. 05) in summer and autumn. The overall annual mean curve value of wool produced by M ewes (80. 9 Â± 1. 7) was significantly (P < 0. 01) lower than wool produced by C ewes (82. 8 Â± 1. 3) and, in winter, the difference between groups was significant (P < 0. 05).

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} study on ectoparasites of sheep (n= 738) and goats (n= 492) {{was conducted in}} Northwestern Amhara Regional State of Ethiopia from October 2009 to April 2010 to determine the prevalence of major ectoparasites of sheep and goats and the associated risk factors. Out of the clinically examined animals, 331 (44. 9 %) sheep and 214 (43. 5 %) goats were infested {{with one or more}} ectoparasites. Ectoparasites identified in sheep were Damalinia ovis (30. 9 %), Mellophagus ovinus (10. 8 %), ticks (3. 9 %), Linognathus species (3. 1 %) and flea (1. 1 %). Among goats, Linognathus species, ticks, flea and demodectic mange were identified with respective prevalence of 27 %, 17. 7 %, 2. 6 % and 2. 2 %. Sheep in midland were 3. 7 and 2. 3 times more at risk for Damalinia ovis infestation than sheep in highland and lowland, respectively and also goats in midland were 1. 8 times at risk for Linognathus species than lowland sheep (P < 0. 05). Sheep poor in body condition were 1. 9 times more at risk for Damalinia ovis than good body condition sheep and goats poor in body condition were 3. 5 times more at risk for Linognathus species than good body condition goats (P< 0. 05). Age and wool length of sheep were important predictors for the presences of Mellophagus ovinus on highland sheep. The prevalence of Mellophagus ovinus was significantly higher in young and long wool sheep than in adult and <b>short</b> <b>wool</b> sheep (P < 0. 05). The observed overall prevalence is generally high which may result in enormous economic losses through decreased production and productivity, damages to the skin and deaths of the animal which requires an immediate attention and professional intervention...|$|E
40|$|Spinosad aerosol has {{undergone}} extensive field testing to confirm its efficacy {{for the treatment}} of blowfly strike and the prevention of subsequent re-strike in sheep. Spinosad aerosol has been tested in 22 field efficacy studies on 331 sheep with fly strike. Of the 332 strikes treated, 319 resolved after treatment with spinosad aerosol, representing > 96 % cure rate, and only 12 treated strike sites (3. 6 %) were subsequently re-struck. The mean dose of spinosad delivered per strike was 191. 37 mg (range= 18. 4 - 426. 7 mg), while the mean dose per cm 2 was 6 mg (range= 0. 1 â 80 mg). Strike wounds ranged in size from 0. 1 cm 2 to 63 cm 2 with a mean of 42. 5 cm 2. Field efficacy data was supported by implant studies. In the first implant study, sheep (n= 14) were implanted with 300 recently hatched larvae of Lucilia cuprina at 4 sites 2 days before treatment. Immediately before treatment, 2 of the strikes were shorn leaving 1 cm wool over the strikes. On each sheep, a shorn and unshorn site was treated with spinosad aerosol at 2 doses delivering approximately 4 mg or 20 mg spinosad, and larval viability was assessed at 3 h and 24 h post-treatment. Each site was re-implanted with larvae at 1, 3, 8, 15 and 22 days post-treatment and larval viability assessed 24 h after implantation. The high dose of spinosad protected against re-infestation for 22 days, while the low dose provided 100 % protection against infestation in <b>short</b> <b>wool,</b> but only 64 % protection in unshorn strikes. In a similar study (n= 20), spinosad aerosol was applied to implanted sites at 2 doses (approximately 2 mg and 11 mg per strike). Of the 20 implanted sites for each treatment, spinosad successfully killed all maggots at all sites at the high dose, and at 19 sites at the low dose. Spinosad treatment at both doses prevented the establishment of implants for 7 days after treatment. By 14 days post-treatment, spinosad at the low dose was 100 % effective at preventing re-infestation, while the high dose prevented re-infestation in 85 % of sites. Spinosad aerosol is a highly efficacious treatment for L. cuprina myiasis in sheep and inhibits subsequent restrike for up to 22 days...|$|E
