The afforestation rate of the lake district of the Kashubian is quite significant in the comparison to neighbouring mesoregions; apart from the Tuchola Forest. Similarly as in other mesoregions of north-western Poland, lowland beech woods are universal in Pomeranian varieties - fertile and sour; and by the Lake Ostrzycki there are three described types of the Kashubian variety of <b>stenothermic</b> beech wood. The forests in the region are dense. The dominating species of trees, is the European beech (Fagus silvatica), oaks (Quercus robur and Quercus sessilis), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and small leaved lime (Tilia cordata). In places, there are riparian species forests in which the lofty ash tree is dominating (Fraxinus exelsior), sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and alder trees (Alnus incana and Alnus glutinosa). Among coniferous trees, the dominating is the Scots pine (Pinus silvestris) and the Norwegian spruce (Picea excelsa), in addition, the last of these kinds appearing in the region outside their natural range, mainly coming from fixing made by man. Forests are covering mainly terrain which is too difficult for farming, for example: hills, river valleys and places in which the soil is too weak for farming.|$|E

30|$|The aquatic species {{contents}} and relative abundances were then roughly determined for each aquatic habitat of the Brégnier-Cordon reach. For this purpose, {{at least one}} floristic relevé {{was carried out in}} each wetland in an area that was considered to be representative of the floristic contents of each wetland. For rivers, canals and riverine wetlands, several relevés were performed to take into account changes in water quality along the upstream/downstream gradients. For each relevé, the relative abundance of each species was estimated using the Braun-Blanquet (1932) index. Then, the trophic levels were estimated by i) multiplying the abundance of each species by its ecological profile and ii) summing the values obtained for all species of the relevé (Amoros et al. 2000). We thus obtained the affinity of the wetland for each trophic class. We considered the class presenting the highest values to indicate the most probable trophic level (Additional file 1). For groundwater inputs, each species was classified according to its affinity for <b>stenothermic</b> water. The difference between the number of species that were intolerant to <b>stenothermic</b> waters and those preferentially occurring in groundwater-fed ecosystems was determined. Then, the wetlands were mapped according to four groundwater influence classes (null: index value[*]=[*] 0; low: index value[*]<[*] 4; intermediate: index values ranging from 5 to 9; high: index value[*]>[*] 9) and four trophic level classes (oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic and hyper-eutrophic). A comparison of the two maps then facilitated the identification of several geographic areas with contrasting groundwater influences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —The {{worldwide}} {{occurrence of}} antitropical organisms is correlated with a reorga-nization of world climate {{culminating in the}} middle Miocene.

The phylogeny and distribution of the New World silversides are congruent with this inter-pretation of antitropical origins. Evidence bearing on the relationships of the American an-chovies is consistent with this paleoclimatic hypothesis as well.

The standard deviation and total metabolic costs did not vary significantly between trials undertaken at the same ambient temperature. Eurythermality in G. coeruleus is caused by fluctuations in preferred body temperature and not by fluctuations around this temperature. The metabolic cost of behavioral thermoregulation did not change with corresponding changes in reinforcement magnitude.

40|$|The {{coral reefs}} are {{distributed}} in the tropical regions and cover {{less than one percent}} of the earth’s surface, but provide habitat for many species in the marine realm. The majority of reef building corals are found in tropical and subtropical waters and typically occur between 30 ° N and 30 ° S latitudes (Fig. 1). Coral reefs are greatly valued due for their beauty, biodiversity it encompasses and the products and services they provide to human society. The coral reefs are made of calcium carbonate secreted as skeletal material by the coral polyp. Coral polyps live in association with intracellular algae (zooxanthellae), which provide additional nutrition to the coral in its life processes. The association of coral polyp with zooxanthellae, restrict its distribution in waters up to the depth of 100 meters where sunlight would be available for the photosynthetic zooxanthellae. The worldwide of zooxanthellate corals in the different distribution eco-regions is a unique underwater ecosystem and provides annual net economic benefit around 30 billion dollars (Buddemeier et al., 2004 Pew Center on Global Climate Change, 44 p).

Three stations were selected, one upstream and two at 0. 25 km and 6 km downstream from a hydropower plant which causes 7 -fold discharge increases. We collected hyporheic invertebrates for two years. Taxa diversity and abundance were reduced in the impacted sites, especially affecting the stygo-bites, which {{were significantly less}} abundant at the impacted sites, whereas stygoxene invertebrates increased exponentially. Repeated hydropeaking events alter the physical-chemical characteristics of the hyporheic habitat, resulting in the recorded faunistic pattern. The deposition of the fine sediment transported by the turbinated water downstream of the power plant {{and the absence of}} natural peak floods which remove fine sediments, probably cause a reduction of the interstitial space interstitial habitat available to stygobitic taxa. Surface water natural thermal regime is altered by the hypolimnetic discharges, and such alterations propa-gate into the hyporheic, affecting the <b>stenothermic</b> taxa. Some benthic taxa used the hyporheic habitat as a refuge to avoid catastrophic drift during hydropower production operation.

Sagitta euneritica and S. enflata were the most abundant and most frequent species with maximum abundance in July (40, 000 org/ 100 m 3 and 6100 org/ 100 m 3 respectively). Sagitta pacifica, S. regularis and S. pseudoserratodentata were <b>stenothermic</b> (21 to 25 oC), whereas {{the rest of the}} species were eurythermic (15. 5 to 29. 5 oC).

The analysis of the species assemblages (Morisita index) showed that S. pacifica and S. regularis interact more frequently in August when there is a change of the water masses that converge in this zone during summer, when the California Countercurrent predominates. The composition of taxa during winter is characterized by the dominance of S. euneritica.

Even today, confusion exists in correct identification of several European Cladocera because of poor original descriptions and subtle differences in morphology. In this context, we discuss three of the rarest Alona-like Chydoridae in the Palaearctic and their validity. 1) Alona moniezi, only reported once from Vichy area, France, has a male indistinguishable from that of A. elegans Kurz, 1875 while females show characters of A. elegans and of Coronatella rectangula. We provide a description of this taxon, with intermediate morphology and discuss the possibilities of hybridization. 2) Alona karelica is unusual {{as one of the}} few eury-thermic species of a predominantly <b>stenothermic</b> A. pulchella-group.

The age structures were measured by skeletochronology of phalanges. In the three surface populations, where winter dormancy on land causes an annual growth stop, lines of arrested growth (LAGs) were observed. LAGs in the subterranean population, where individuals stay in the water throughout the year, indicate yearly (at least cyclical) periods of arrested growth even though animals occupy a relatively constant temperature/light environment. The age structures of adults did not differ between surface populations (5 - 28 yr) and the subterranean population (7 - 16 yr). Body lengths were highest for the surface population from the lowest altitude. The age, body size and growth traits of the Subterranean population came closer to the values obtained for the surface population located at 490 in a. s. l. than for those living at higher altitudes. We hypothesize that LAGs in subterranean newts result from reduced feeding in winter and that the similarity of age and size structures of subterranean and low-altitude populations argues for a recent colonization of the hypogean environment, where populations can find remaining optimal environmental conditions favorable to these <b>stenothermic</b> and rheophilous animals...|$|E

40|$|The serial {{discontinuity}} concept (SDC; Ward and Stanford, in Ecology of River Systems, 1983) {{predicts that}} recovery of large regulated rivers over distance downstream from a dam {{is limited by}} relative tributary size; however, channel geomorphology may also influence the recovery process. We examined the spatial variation in water quality, benthic composition and ash-free dry standing biomass (AFDM) among the bedrock-defined geomorphological reaches in three turbidity segments of the Colorado River between Glen Canyon Dam and Diamond Creek, Arizona, including most of the Grand Canyon. This 387 -km long study area supported virtually no Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera or Trichoptera, probably because cold, <b>stenothermic,</b> hypolimnetic releases limited maximum aestival warming to 171 C. The benthos displayed abrupt, physically related decreases in AFDM over distance from the dam and in the varial zone. The 26 -km long clear water segment between the dam and the Paria River supported a depauperate Cladophora glomerata/epiphyte/chironomid/Gammarus lacustris/lumbricine/ Physella sp. assemblage, and ooze-dwelling oligochaetes. This segment contained 69 % of the aquatic habitat below the 140 m 3 /s (normal minimum) discharge stage of the Colorado River study area, but supported 635 % of the benthic primary producer AFDM and 87 % of the benthic consumer AFDM in the entire study area.

40|$|Prior to ca. 14, 660 yr BP, {{during the}} early Late-glacial (Oldest Dryas), larval assemblages of Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) in Gerzensee, Switzerland, were {{dominated}} by cold <b>stenothermic</b> taxa {{as well as by}} taxa typical of subalpine lakes today. This was the coldest period of the entire sequence. After ca. 14, 660 yr BP, in the Late Glacial Interstadial (Bølling–Allerød), a temperature increase is recorded by a sharp rise in the oxygen-isotope ratio in lake marl and by an increase in the organic-matter content of the sediments. Changes in the chironomid fauna then are consistent with rising temperatures. This warming trend is interrupted between 14, 070 and 13, 940 yr BP, coinciding with the GI- 1 d cold oscillation, but the change in the chironomid assemblage is more consistent with a response to increasing lake depth and density of aquatic macrophytes than falling temperature. A rise in cold-adapted chironomid taxa between 13, 840 and 13, 710 yr BP suggests that summer air temperatures may have declined. Changes in the chironomid assemblage after 13, 710 yr BP suggest a decline in submerged macrophytes coupled with a rise in lake productivity and summer temperature, although the latter is not reflected in the oxygen-isotope record. This suggests {{that there may have been}} increasing seasonality during this period when summer temperatures were rising, driven by rising summer insolation, and winters becoming cooler, which is largely reflected in the oxygen-isotope record.

The {{question is whether}} the above-ground persistence of photosynthetic structures during winter can compensate for low growth rates of evergreens when they compete with fast growing, non-evergreen species. The experiment was carried out in experimental boxes installed in a former river channel fed by <b>stenothermic</b> ground-water. Species were planted pairwise in experimental boxes in autumn, monitoring was carried out in the following year: degree of evergreenness was evaluated through number of ramets present prior to the main growing season, competitive ability of species was assessed during the growing season through cover measurements at three dates. Degree of evergreenness varied considerably between species, ranging from increase of ramet numbers during winter in Luronium over preservation of ramet numbers in Groenlandia and Hippuris to nearly complete winter die-back in Sparganium. Luronium presented the highest cover during the entire growing season. Only by the end of summer did Sparganium attain a similar cover through a high growth rate. Despite large differences in cover, growth appeared largely unaffected by the kind of treatment partner a species was confronted with. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that being evergreen can compensate for a low growth rate during the main growing season when it is associated to extensive growth outside this main growing season.

In this study, we experimentally measured temperature-dependent growth and routine swim activity in the juvenile stage of two Arctic gadids (Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida and saffron cod, Eleginus gracilis) and two North Pacific gadids (walleye pollock, Gadus chalcogrammus and Pacific cod, Gadus macrocephalus) over a 6 -week growth period across five temperatures (0, 5, 9, 16 and 20 °C). Arctic cod demonstrated a cold-water, <b>stenothermic</b> response in that there was relatively high growth at 0 °C (0. 73 % day⁻¹), near-maximal growth at 5 °C (1. 35 % day⁻¹) and negative impacts on activity, growth and survival at 16 °C.

However, despite these distinct thermal responses, walleye pollock and Pacific cod grew 2 – 3 times faster than Arctic gadids across a relatively broad temperature range above 5 °C. These results, coupled with possible northward expansion by both Pacific cod and walleye pollock, suggest Arctic cod are highly vulnerable to continued climate change in the Arctic, especially in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas where temperatures already exceed 14 °C in the summer growth period...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial {{uncoupling}} protein 1 (UCP 1) {{is known}} to be crucial in thermoregulatory processes in various endothermic animals, and its homologues are widely distributed among vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Mitochondria are essential in the adaptation of poikilothermic animals to changing environmental temperature. The increase in mitochondrial densities frequently observed in cold adapted ectotherms may contribute to higher energetic demands through mitochondrial maintenance costs and the intrinsic energy dissipation through proton leakage. To investigate whether uncoupling proteins are also involved in the thermal adaptation of ectothermic animals, we isolated and characterised the entire genes of UCP 2 for two closely related zoarcid fish species from Antarctic (Pachycara brachycephalum) and boreal (Zoarces viviparus) waters. We developed identical RNA probes for both species to compare UCP 2 mRNA expression levels at different acclimation temperatures and between muscle and liver tissues. In addition, Western Blot analysis was performed to examine thermal regulation of UCP 2 expression at the functional, ie. protein level. Zoarcid UCP 2 is a highly conserved 313 amino acid protein, belonging to the mitochondrial membrane carrier family. At both RNA and protein levels, UCP 2 expression increased considerably with acclimation temperatures above and below habitat temperatures in the two species, with the mRNA expression patterns being reflected on the protein level. Although the Antarctic eelpout P. brachycephalum, which occurs from the Antarctic Peninsula up into high Antarctic waters, is considered to be more <b>stenothermic</b> than its boreal eurythermic relative Z. viviparus, it appears to have kept the ability to regulate the expression of one of the central proteins involved in the energy metabolism at similar ratios.

The expected increase in temperature during the 21 st century will be most stressful for cold-adapted and <b>stenothermic</b> mountain species, forcing them to migrate upwards, and eventually to concentrate into either large areas with favourable climates (refugia) or small stands under locally favourable microclimates (microrefugia). We investigate potential refugia in the neotropical Guayana Highlands mountain biome (Pantepui), consisting of ~ 50 isolated table mountains (tepuis), to develop strategies for conserving biodiversity during future global warming. We predict the amount of loss of altitudinal habitats of endemic vascular flora of 26 tepuis and evaluate potential threats to these taxa with respect to species extinction, habitat loss, habitat connectivity {{and the degree of}} isolation. We compare past, present and future Pantepui landscape configurations through fragmentation analysis and identify potential in situ refugia. Spatial analysis forecasts more species isolation and declining biodiversity {{at the end of this}} century relative to current and past levels. Habitats are predicted to experience > 80 % loss, with the disappearance of 38 habitat patches. One large patch (Chimantá massif) accounts for 46 % of the predicted remaining habitat. This patch can be considered a potential refugium for future vascular flora, as it is predicted to contain some present-day resistant species from lower altitudinal levels and other species eventually persisting in microrefugia.

While these changes {{are expected to have}} implications for alpine aquatic ecosystems, little is known about potential ecological tipping points and associated indicator taxa. We examined changes in biotic communities along a gradient of glacier influence for two study systems: (1) a stream network in the French Pyrénées; and (2) a network of lakes in the Italian Alps, with the aim of identifying potential indicator taxa (macroinvertebrates and zooplankton) of glacier retreat in these environments. To assess parallels in biotic responses across streams and lakes, both primary data and findings from other publications were synthesised. Using TITAN (Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis) changes in community composition of river taxa were identified at thresholds of < 5. 1 % glacier cover and < 66. 6 % meltwater contribution. Below these thresholds the loss of cold <b>stenothermic</b> benthic invertebrate taxa, Diamesa spp. and the Pyrenean endemic Rhyacophila angelieri was apparent. Some generalist taxa including Protonemura sp., Perla grandis, Baetis alpinus, Rhithrogena loyolaea and Microspectra sp. increased when glacier cover was < 2. 7 % and < 52 % meltwater. Patterns were not as distinct for the alpine lakes, due to fewer sampling sites; however, Daphnia longispina grp. and the benthic invertebrate groups Plectopera and Planaria were identified as potential indicator taxa. While further work is required to assess potential indicator taxa for alpine lake systems, findings from alpine river systems were consistent between methods for assessing glacier influence (meltwater contribution/glacier cover). Hence, it is clear that TITAN could become a useful management tool, enabling: (i) the identification of taxa particularly sensitive to glacier retreat; and (ii) conservation efforts/resources to be better directed in alpine aquatic systems...|$|E
40|$|Walking leg closer muscle neuromuscular {{parameters}} {{were recorded}} electrophysiologically from homothermally and heterothermally acclimated Carcinus maenas (eurythermic) and Cancer pagurus (<b>stenothermic).</b> Homothermal (and immobilised) crabs of both species were acclimated to either 8 C or 22 C, whereas heterothermally acclimated crabs were acclimated to 8 C and 22 C coincidentally, exposing the animal's {{central nervous system}} (CNS) to either the warm (22 C) or cold (8 C) acclimation temperature. Thus, heterothermal acclimation exposes the CNS/endocrine system and one set of walking legs at one acclimation temperature, the contralateral walking legs are acclimated to the other acclimation temperature. This allowed {{an investigation into the}} CNS influence on the attainment of acclimation by walking legs. Comparisons of acclimation responses of the neuromuscular function of isolated walking legs from the same animal were done with respect to the walking leg and CNS acclimation temperatures experienced. Animals were acclimated for two weeks, recordings were taken of excitatory junctional potentials (EJP) etc., from dactylopodite closer muscle fibres when stimulated by the tonic motor axon over an experimental temperature range (6 - 26 C). The acclimation responses in homothermally exposed crabs of both species resulted in partial (Precht, type III) responses in resting potential, single and double pulse stimulated excitatory junctional potential amplitudes, these were interpreted as responses that allowed the maintenance of muscle function in the new thermal condition. With respect to long term thermal acclimation other electrophysiological parameters gave equivocal compensatory responses. Capacity acclimation responses were more complete in C. pagurus than C. maenas. In heterothermally acclimated animals resting potentials and EJP amplitudes revealed partial acclimation responses in a compensatory manner. Acclimation of heterothermally acclimated C. maenas and C. pagurus was determined to be independent of a CNS influence, indicating thermal acclimation was in response to the local tissue acclimation temperature...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{interaction}} between different water sources {{plays a key}} role in the structure and functioning of Arctic stream systems. Ice melt, snowmelt, groundwater and rainfall mix to produce a diverse range of physicochemical conditions. The heterogeneous habitat matrix created is home to a variety of cold <b>stenothermic</b> species. Recent trends in earth surface temperatures associated with global warming have co-in sided with a reduction in global glacier mass balance and a hastening in the onset of spring thaw. This field based study investigated the physicochemical habitat diversity within a glacierized Arctic catchment, Kårsavagge in Northern Sweden. Hydrological, meteorological and physicochemical data spanning 2007 to 2010 were collected with intensive collection during the summer melt seasons of 2008 and 2009. In conjunction with these data, macroinvertebrate and fish sampling was carried out during both of the intensive summer monitoring periods. The key focus of the sampling regime was to compare lateral and longitudinal habitat variability, investigate the extent to which this was linked to dynamic water source interactions by modeling contributions from identified sources and assess the impact of this physicochemical habitat template on the macroinvertebrate and fish communities in the light of predicted climate change. The key findings discussed within are (1) Lateral habitat and biological diversity was equivalent to that observed longitudinally. (2) The ARISE framework used for modeling different water source contributions is applicable to an Arctic scenario, however its utility decreases with increasing catchment size. (3) The key habitat variables structuring macroinvertebrate and fish distribution were concerned with mediating/ mitigating the extent of the glacial signal. A conceptual model is presented that illustrates the potential impact of loss of this glacial signal on local biodiversity. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Stream environments are {{spatially}} and temporally heterogeneous. Mainstem rivers {{are often}} wide, sunlit, warm and productive, while tributaries are shaded by riparian trees, unproductive, and remain cool in summer. Within mainstem rivers themselves {{there is substantial}} spatial heterogeneity in habitat structure and physical conditions, such as water temperature. River environments also change dramatically with season. Organisms {{that live in the}} riverine environment respond to and take advantage of such heterogeneous environments by moving between microhabitats or shifting their phenology. I studied the life cycle of a riverine mayfly, Ephemerella maculata (Ephemerellidae), in a northern California river system, its responses to spatial and temporal heterogeneity, and how its movements connect stream and riparian food webs in space and time. I discovered that E. maculata migrates between the mainstem and tributaries of rivers during its life cycle, thereby linking food webs in these two habitats, and enhancing predator growth in unproductive tributaries. The resource subsidy from productive but warm rivers to cool, unproductive tributaries associated with the mayfly migration increase the growth of <b>stenothermic</b> predators like juvenile salmonids in otherwise food-limited, cool thermal refuges, and increase their resilience to future warming. Furthermore, I examined the resilience of E. maculata to changes in water temperature using field surveys and lab rearing experiments. I discovered that different life stages of E. maculata have different thermal responses, and they shift their phenology depending on the water temperature, allowing each life stage to occur in the most desirable thermal condition. Therefore, as long as the natural seasonal pattern of the water temperature is sustained, E. maculata can resist temperature changes by shifting their phenology. Finally, I have shown that thermal spatial heterogeneity of rivers desynchronizes mayfly emergence timing, prolonging the subsidy period to riparian predators, and changing the predators’ responses to this subsidy...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Our {{aim was to}} {{document}} geographical patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages along abiotic gradients, and any differences in fish assemblage structure. We hypothesized that patterns in the body-size structure of entire lake fish assemblages are primarily temperature driven and consistent with the dominant pattern of the temperature–size rule, which suggests a decrease in adult body size with increasing developmental temperature for many ectothermic species. Location: 356 European lakes. Methods: Variation in the body-size structure of fish assemblages was explored on a continental scale along gradients of temperature, morphometry, productivity and fish assemblage structure for 356 European lakes. The mean fish assemblage body-size and individual body-size distributions were selected as size metrics. Separate analyses were conducted for lakes located within five ecoregion subsets (Borealic Uplands/Tundra, FennoScandian Shield, Central Plains, Western Plains and Western Highlands) and for lakes with different functional fish classifications (cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages). Results: Geographical patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages could be clearly discerned along a temperature gradient for both the continental dataset (356 lakes) and the smaller geographical (ecoregion) subsets. We found systematic changes in fish assemblage body-size structure across temperature gradients in correspondence with the dominant thermal fish guild. The majority of the lakes, mainly located in the warmer European lowlands, were dominated by eurythermic cool- and warmwater fish assemblages, with smaller sized individuals characterized by linear individual body-size distributions. Lakes located in colder regions and dominated by <b>stenothermic</b> coldwater salmonids with larger sized individuals were characterized by unimodal or bimodal size distributions. The mean body size of cold-, cool- and warmwater fish assemblages changed uniformly along the temperature gradient. Main conclusions: Patterns of variation in the body-size structure of European lake fish assemblages {{are consistent with the}} temperature–size rule. Temperature modifies fish assemblage size structure uniformly within the thermal fish guilds and in different ecoregions. Furthermore, our results indicate an increasing predictive power of temperature to explain variability in body-size structure when moving from warmer to colder geographical regions. ...|$|E
40|$|All of {{the members}} of the Chironomid genus Diamesa are more or less cold <b>stenothermic</b> species (BRUNDIN, 1956 : 62) and are {{particularly}} associated with cool waters in northern latitudes. The discovery of a species on Ruwenzori (FREEMAN, 1955 : 62) at heights of 10 — 13, 000 ft., bore out EDWARDS ' statement (1939 : 2) that there is a "Palaearctic " element in the Dipterous fauna of Ruwenzori in the zones above 10, 000 ft. I have now found a second species of Diamesa amongst material collected by Dr. HEINZ LÖFFLER (Vienna University) on Mt. Kenya at a height of more than 14, 000 ft. in water in contact with glaciers. The new species resembles D. ruwenzoriensis FREEMAN, but is clearly separate from it. D. ruwenzoriensis is known only from Ruwenzori, and has been redis-covered there in 1961 by an expedition from the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. It is a species with reduced antennal segmentation in the male, and without antennal plumes in that sex. The new species similarly lacks antennal plumes, but the antennae of the male possess 9 segments as compared with 7 in ruwenzoriensis and those of the female 8 segments, that is one more than in ruwenzoriensis. A further difference lies in the long anal point and curved styles of the male genitalia of kenyae. In general external appearance the two species are remarkably similar but the specific differences are quite definite. It will be interesting to see whether further collecting on the other high mountains in Africa will show the existence of other species, possibly related to these two. I should like to express my thanks to Dr. LÖFFLER for sending this material to me, and for allowing the British Museum to retain the holotype. Diamesa kenyae sp. n. Extremely similar in appearance to D. ruwenzoriensis FREEMAN, but readily distinguishable in the male by the 9 -segmented antennae, the long anal point and curved styles; in the female by the 8 -segmented antennae...|$|E
40|$|Euphausiids, {{particularly}} the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, are {{a crucial part}} of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. As the major link between primary production and higher trophic levels, variation in euphausiid abundance has important implications for predators, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem functioning. Climate variability influences euphausiids through multiple pathways, including direct effects on growth and indirect effects on primary production. Increasing ocean temperatures, declining sea ice, and other effects of climate change are likely to negatively affect E. superba. In contrast, {{little is known about the}} potential impacts of climate change on Thysanoessa macrura, a euphausiid with an abundance that likely rivals that of E. superba. In this thesis, I explore multiple aspects underlying the spatial and temporal variability of Antarctic euphausiids. In Chapter 2, I use state-dependent life history theory and stochastic dynamic programming to challenge the traditional paradigm of E. superba as a passive drifter, and find that accounting for active behavior in this species has important implications for spatial distribution, growth, and survival. In Chapter 3, I use a data-driven approach to quantifying spatial and temporal E. superba abundances near the North Antarctic Peninsula. I find that fluctuations inabundance are tied to lagged indices of climate variability, and that abundance and measures of spatial aggregation are linked in some habitats and seasons. Finally, in Chapter 4, I use temperature-dependent growth models to explore how changing temperatures may differentially affect growth in E. superba and T. macrura. I find that as ocean temperatures increase, the biomass per recruit of the <b>stenothermic</b> E. superba is likely to decline over much of the temperature range in the Southwest Atlantic. In contrast, the eurythermic T. macrura is expected to have enhanced growth over much of this range, and increases in T. macrura biomass could potentially compensate for some loss of E. superba biomass. However, this biomass may not be energetically equivalent from the perspective of a euphausiid predator...|$|E
40|$|Honeybee larvae and pupae are {{extremely}} <b>stenothermic,</b> i. e. they strongly depend on accurate regulation of brood nest temperature for proper development (33 – 36 °C). Here we study {{the mechanisms of}} social thermoregulation of honeybee colonies under changing environmental temperatures concerning the contribution of individuals to colony temperature homeostasis. Beside migration activity within the nest, the main active process is “endothermy on demand” of adults. An increase of cold stress (cooling of the colony) increases the intensity of heat production with thoracic flight muscles {{and the number of}} endothermic individuals, especially in the brood nest. As endothermy means hard work for bees, this eases much burden of nestmates which can stay ectothermic. Concerning the active reaction to cold stress by endothermy, age polyethism is reduced to only two physiologically predetermined task divisions, 0 to ∼ 2 days and older. Endothermic heat production is the job of bees older than about two days. They are all similarly engaged in active heat production both in intensity and frequency. Their active heat production has an important reinforcement effect on passive heat production of the many ectothermic bees and of the brood. Ectothermy is most frequent in young bees (<∼ 2 days) both outside and inside of brood nest cells. We suggest young bees visit warm brood nest cells not only to clean them but also to speed up flight muscle development for proper endothermy and foraging later in their life. Young bees inside brood nest cells mostly receive heat from the surrounding cell wall during cold stress, whereas older bees predominantly transfer heat from the thorax to the cell wall. Endothermic bees regulate brood comb temperature more accurately than local air temperature. They apply the heat as close to the brood as possible: workers heating cells from within have a higher probability of endothermy than those on the comb surface. The findings show that thermal homeostasis of honeybee colonies is achieved by a combination of active and passive processes. The differential individual endothermic and behavioral reactions sum up to an integrated action of the honeybee colony as a superorganism...|$|E
40|$|River {{temperature}} regulates {{nearly all}} bio-chemical processes {{and is a}} key parameter of water quality. Aquatic organisms respond to the entire temperature regime, including the absolute value, seasonal and diel ranges, rate of change and the timing and duration of significant thermal events. In recent summers, stream water temperature in unshaded locations across the New Forest has repeatedly exceed 24 oC making them unsuitable habitat for vulnerable species such as Brown Trout. Although fish are known to use cool water refuges during the summer, low flows can restrict migration and reduce the accessible habitat. The stress caused by overcrowding and the potential increased exposure to disease may also be harmful. The shade cast by riparian vegetation can exert {{a major influence on}} the freshwater thermal regime particularly in small rain-fed streams and therefore affect the ability of sensitive species to withstand extreme high temperatures. Observations across the New Forest in recent summers, have shown that water temperatures in the shaded reaches were as much as ten degrees cooler than the open sections. The problem of high temperatures is expected to get worse as a consequence of climate change; with drier summer resulting in reduced flows and average summer/autumn temperatures predicted to rise by 4 to 5 oC in southern England. Thus the cooling influence of riparian shade is likely to become increasingly important across England and Wales to protect vulnerable <b>stenothermic</b> species such as trout and salmon from thermal stress. This project was devised to determine the influence of riparian shade on stream temperature and behaviour and ecology of woodland streams in the New Forest. We will present details of riparian shade, water temperature, fish populations and community structure in three streams. We will illustrate how riparian shade affects the thermal regime and the volume of suitable habitat within the stream. Quantify the influence of land use, land cover and riparian shade on the response of water temperature to air temperature and model the impact of climate change predictions on the probably suitability of these rivers as habitat for vulnerable/threatened fish species. Habitat restoration and the removal of riparian shaded from a previously shaded stream will also be discussed...|$|E
