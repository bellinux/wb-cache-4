40|$|A brief resume of,recent {{developments}} {{in the design of}} roads is given with special reference to the increasing part played by automated methods by means of which higher degrees of optimization may be achieved. Flow charts illustrating road design demonstrate the relative importance of the determination of the transverse road section by computer. The finished transverse road section, called a template, consists of a central portion and the outer sloped cut and fill banks. The central portion covers the carriageway(s) and shoulders, the shape of which is predetermined by the geometric. design of the road surface and is independent of ground shape. The outer sloped banks, called the side-drain template, are dependent upon the position of the ground surface in relation to the predetermined central portion. When a road is to be built, the road authority usually prescribes the final transverse shape of the road by specifying a standard road template. At every point along the road a specific template can then be determined in accordance with the standard template. However, problems are experienced because certain available computer programs are unable to execute the side-drain portion of the standard road template correctly while earthwork quantities are being calculated. Several available programs are investigated with regard to the procedures adopted by them for the selection of appropriate road side-drain templates. Deficiencies in these programs are noted. A general {{solution to the problem of}} the logical determination of road sections by computer, namely, the method of the locus of the <b>slope</b> <b>stake</b> point, is introduced and elucidated. The success of the method is confirmed by the presentation of the completely operative computer program SHARM for the calculation of road earthworks quantities: The use of the program is demonstrated by a short sample run. Limitations of the method of the locus of the <b>slope</b> <b>stake</b> point and of the SHARM program are noted, and finally some future developments are discussed...|$|E
50|$|Control of {{alignment}} {{and grade}} during construction is established {{through the use}} of survey stakes. Stakes are generally made of wood in different sizes. Based {{on the use of the}} stake they are called alignment stakes, offset stakes, grade <b>stakes,</b> and <b>slope</b> <b>stakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|At age two, Desert Wine won {{the grade}} two Hollywood Juvenile Championship Stakes at six furlongs and the grade three Sunny <b>Slope</b> <b>Stakes</b> during the Oak Tree at Santa Anita meet. He also placed {{second in the}} grade one Norfolk Stakes at a mile and one sixteenth at Santa Anita and won the grade one Del Mar Futurity and the grade two Hollywood Futurity while placing third in the Hollywood Prevue Stakes.|$|R
50|$|Rentap and his followers, {{including}} the Iban Dayaks and the Malays from the Lingga and Kuching area, continued strengthening his fort in Sungai Lang. This fort at {{the headwaters of}} the Skrang River, on a hill cleared of jungle, was surrounded by steep <b>slopes</b> with high <b>stakes</b> driven into the earth forming a thick stockade.|$|R
50|$|San Antonio Creek arises at 3177 ft on the {{southwest}} <b>slopes</b> of Mount <b>Stakes</b> and descends into the San Antonio Valley. San Antonio Creek's tributaries are, in order heading downstream, Beauregard Creek on the right, Jumpoff Creek on the left, and Long Gulch on the right. Its confluence with Arroyo Bayo forms the source of Arroyo Valle. Arroyo Valle proceeds through Lake Del Valle to join Arroyo de la Laguna thence to Alameda Creek and finally terminates in San Francisco Bay. San Antonio Creek and Beauregard Creek are ephemeral.|$|R
50|$|The {{highest point}} in the park is on the northernmost boundary, at about 3560 ft elevation. This point may be {{considered}} to be on the <b>slopes</b> of Mt. <b>Stakes,</b> a mile north of the park's northern boundary. (Mt. Stakes, at 3804 ft, is the highest point in Stanislaus County). The lowest {{point in the}} park is at the Bell Station access point in the southeast; this is only a little above 300 ft in elevation. Since this is a mere strip of land along a road right-of-way, it is often not thought of {{as an integral part of}} the state park. The lowest point in the main body of the park is the place where the North Fork of Pacheco Creek flows out, at about 710 ft elevation, also in the southeast corner.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} 20 years, cassava {{agronomy}} research in China placed major emphasis on fertility maintenance, erosion control, planting methods, time of planting and harvesting, etc. Longterm fertilization trials conducted at GSCRI, CATAS and the Upland Crops Research Institute (UCRI) in Guangzhou, Guangdong, indicate that N {{was the most}} important nutrient for increasing cassava root yields during the early cropping cycles of cassava, but that K, and in some cases P, also became increasingly important. Results of soil erosion control trials conducted in Hainan and Guangxi showed that contour ridging, intercropping with peanut or the planting of vetiver grass contour hedgerows were the most effective practices for reducing soil erosion when cassava was grown on <b>slopes.</b> Planting cassava <b>stakes</b> vertically resulted in more rapid sprouting than horizontal or inclined planting, but there was not much difference in root yield among several methods of planting. Research on time of planting and harvesting cassava conducted at CATAS indicate that when cassava was harvested at 8 months after planting, highest yields were obtained when cassava was planted during the spring (Feb-May). However, when cassava was harvested at 12 months, time of planting had no consistent effect on yield. Effect of time of fertilizer application on cassava yield conducted at CATAS showed that a basal fertilizer application at 30 days after planting resulted in highest yields; {{there were no significant differences}} between a single application at 30 days and split applications at 30 and 60 days, or at 30, 60 and 90 days...|$|R
