The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of <b>sawdust</b> <b>to</b> allow the players to keep their grip. Along with the rain, humidity assisted the bowlers, particularly Lindwall, who managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
5|$|At these lower prices, ice {{began to}} sell in {{considerable}} volumes, with the market moving beyond the wealthy elite to {{a wider range of}} consumers, to the point where supplies became overstretched. It was also being used by tradesmen to preserve perishable good, rather than for direct consumption. Tudor looked beyond his existing suppliers to Maine and even to harvesting from passing icebergs, but neither source proved practical. Instead, Tudor teamed up with Nathaniel Wyeth to exploit the ice supplies of Boston on a more industrial scale. Wyeth devised a new form of horse-pulled ice-cutter in 1825 that cut square blocks of ice more efficiently than previous methods. He agreed to supply Tudor from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reducing the cost of harvesting ice from 30 cents ($7.30) a ton (901kg) to only 10 cents ($2.40). <b>Sawdust</b> <b>to</b> insulate the ice was brought from Maine, at $16,000 ($390,000) a year.|$|E

On a court mission to inspect a frontier region, Shen Kuo once made a raised-relief map of wood and glue-soaked <b>sawdust</b> <b>to</b> show the mountains, roads, rivers, and passes to other officials. He once computed {{the total number of}} possible situations on a game board, another time the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers. Shen Kuo is also noted for improving the designs of the inflow clepsydra clock for a more efficient higher-order interpolation, the armillary sphere, the gnomon, and the astronomical sighting tube; increasing its width for better observation of the pole star and other celestial bodies. Shen Kuo also experimented with camera obscura, only a few decades after the first to do so, Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039).|$|E
5|$|English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Precipitation {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} match meant the Test could not start until after midday. Yardley's {{decision}} was regarded as a surprise. Although The Oval had a reputation as a batting paradise, weather conditions suggested that bowlers would be at an advantage. Jack Fingleton, a former Test team-mate of Bradman who was covering the tour as a journalist, thought the Australians would have bowled had they won the toss. However, O'Reilly disagreed, saying the pitch was so wet it should have favoured the batsmen because the ball would bounce slowly from the surface. He further thought the slippery run-up areas would have forced the faster bowlers to operate less vigorously to avoid injuring themselves. The damp conditions necessitated the addition of large amounts of <b>sawdust</b> <b>to</b> allow the bowlers to keep their footing, because parts of the pitch were muddy. The humidity, along with the rain, assisted the bowlers; Lindwall in particular managed to make the ball bounce at variable heights.|$|E
25|$|The wildcat {{does not}} dig its own burrows, instead {{sheltering}} in the hollows of old or fallen trees, rock fissures, and the abandoned nests or earths {{of other animals}} (heron nests, and abandoned fox or badger earths in Europe, and abandoned fennec dens in Africa). When threatened, a wildcat with a den will retreat into it, rather than climb trees. When taking residence in a tree hollow, the wildcat selects one low to the ground. Dens in rocks or burrows are lined with dry grasses and bird feathers. Dens in tree hollows usually contain enough <b>sawdust</b> <b>to</b> make lining unnecessary. During flea infestations, the wildcat leaves its den in favour of another. During winter, when snowfall prevents the wildcat from travelling long distances, it remains within its den more than usual.|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of walnut nursery plants {{is a complex}} process, being dependent upon a range of factors that affect graft-take success and behaviour of walnut plants in the nursery. The experiment included two parts. Three different treatments {{were used in the}} heated room under controlled air temperature and humidity conditions: Treatment 1 -grafting without paraffin treatment of the scion and graft union, coupled with covering the graft with <b>sawdust</b> up <b>to</b> the top of the scion; Treatment 2 -grafting involving paraffin treatment of the scion and graft union, coupled with covering the graft with <b>sawdust</b> up <b>to</b> the top of the scion; and Treatment 3 -grafting involving paraffin treatment of the scion and graft union, coupled with covering the graft with both <b>sawdust</b> up <b>to</b> the top of the scion and polyethylene foil. The treatments were evaluated for their effect on graft-take success. Graft planting in the nursery was followed by two treatments: treatment without foliar fertilisation and treatment with foliar fertilisation. Under controlled conditions, treatment 3 induced a higher graft-take success as compared to the other two treatments, whereas foliar fertilisation in the nursery had a positive effect on the survival, {{production of}} class 1 plants and vegetative growth of walnut plants...|$|R

500|$|Crowd noise, {{especially}} {{coughing and}} crying babies, {{was a significant}} impediment to Sunday's preaching because the wooden tabernacles were so acoustically live. During his preliminaries, Rodeheaver often instructed audiences about how to muffle their coughs. Nurseries were always provided, infants forbidden, and Sunday sometimes appeared rude in his haste to rid the hall of noisy children who had slipped through the ushers. Tabernacle floors were covered with <b>sawdust</b> <b>to</b> dampen the noise of shuffling feet (as well as for its pleasant smell {{and its ability to}} hold down the dust of dirt floors), and coming forward during the invitation became known as [...] "hitting the sawdust trail." [...] The term was first used in a Sunday campaign in Bellingham, Washington, in 1910.

500|$|The {{journalist}} Ray Robinson {{wrote that}} [...] "of all Australian captains he came closest {{to being a}} disciplinarian". [...] Regardless, his team mates continued to select him as captain, trusting in his {{knowledge and understanding of}} the game. On a wet day during the 1899 tour, a delay in play saw some of the Australians accept an invitation to the Player's tobacco factory in Nottingham. While away, the weather cleared and play began with Darling leading a team of five Australians and five substitutes onto the field. Darling later called a team meeting that saw the culprits fined ₤5 for breaching team rules. His approach to the hard-drinking Ernie Jones was similarly tough. To ensure that the fast bowler would not drink to excess, he selected Jones as twelfth man in a match against an English county team. When Jones refused to play, a team meeting saw him facing expulsion from the team. Darling spoke to him privately and made it clear that without an apology to his team mates and a promise to curb his drinking, he would be on the next boat bound for Australia. The firm and prompt action had a lasting effect on team discipline during his time as Australian captain. Wisden noted that [...] "as a captain he inspired his men to reveal their best form." [...] As a captain he was a reformer, suggesting rule changes that included making six runs the reward for clearing the boundary rather than the entire ground, and using of <b>sawdust</b> <b>to</b> fill holes in bowler's run-ups.|$|E
