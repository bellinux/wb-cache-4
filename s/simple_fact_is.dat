500|$|Conservapedia {{hosts the}} [...] "Conservative Bible Project", a project aiming {{to rewrite the}} English {{translation}} of the Bible in order to remove terms described as [...] "liberal bias". The project intends to remove sections of the Bible which are judged by Conservapedia's founder to be later liberal additions. These include {{the story of the}} adulteress in the Gospel of John in which Jesus declares [...] "Let him who is without sin cast the first stone". The project also intends to remove Jesus's prayer on the cross, [...] "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing", since it appears only in the Gospel of Luke and since, according to Schlafly, [...] "the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that some of the persecutors of Jesus did know what they were doing. This quotation is a favorite of liberals but should not appear in a conservative Bible".|$|E
500|$|The rest of {{the family}} tries to pass the time by playing charades and various other games. They are unable to keep {{themselves}} entertained and take their frustrations out on Meg as usual. But, having dealt with their abuse for years, Meg finally turns on them, starting with Chris for mistreating her with hurtful comments. Tired of her outburst, Lois tries to tell Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else, but Meg brings up Lois's past and tells her that she is [...] "the furthest thing from" [...] the perfect mother. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns eighteen, she is considering never seeing her again. Lois is reduced to tears and profusely apologizes to Meg. Meg then confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing until she calls him a [...] "waste of a man." [...] Within moments, Peter, Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms on each other. Peter then runs away to his room crying, leaving Meg and Brian to discuss what just happened. Despite Brian complimenting her for standing up for herself, Meg concludes that her family cannot survive without a [...] "lightning rod" [...] to absorb its dysfunction, and that her enduring her family's antagonism helps keep them together. She then decides to apologize to her family and lies that she was taking her own problems out on everyone, restoring their egos and original opinions. Stewie then breaks the fourth wall by telling the audience about the dangers of drugs: [...] "Tonight's Family Guy was a very special episode about drug use, but the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> it's no laughing matter. To learn more about drugs, visit your local library. There's probably a guy behind there who sells drugs." ...|$|E

And that is why I have decided to concentrate on playing for West Ham United and that is where my focus will be." ...|$|E

2500|$|Walter Rodney states, [...] "The role {{of slavery}} in {{promoting}} racist prejudice and ideology has been carefully studied in certain situations, especially in the USA. The <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that no people can enslave another for four centuries without coming out with a notion of superiority, and when the colour and other physical traits of those peoples were quite different {{it was inevitable that}} the prejudice should take a racist form." ...|$|E
2500|$|Delaware deputy {{attorneys}} Steven P. Wood and Peggy J. Hageman, who prosecuted Red Dog, {{tried and}} failed to find a motive. [...] According to Wood, attributing Red Dog's behavior to his upbringing is too easy: [...] "There is no denying the privation Native Americans are subjected to on reservations, but the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> there are hundreds of thousands of Native Americans raised in those conditions, and precious few become multiple murders", he said, as well as that his killings were [...] "essentially motiveless".|$|E

2500|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Madden: The Inquisition was {{not born}} out of desire to crush diversity or oppress people; it was rather an attempt to stop unjust executions. Yes, you read that correctly. Heresy was a crime against the state. Roman law in the Code of Justinian made heresy a capital offense... In the early Middle Ages, people accused of heresy were judged by the local lord, many of whom lacked theological training. Madden claims that [...] "The <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that the medieval Inquisition saved uncounted thousands of innocent (and even not-so-innocent) people who {{would otherwise have been}} roasted by secular lords or mob rule" [...]|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1946, the first {{proposal}} was advanced to merge the Great Western with other railroads, {{this time with}} the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad and the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. Upon the failure of a later merger opportunity with the Soo Line Railroad in 1963, the board of the Great Western grew increasingly anxious about its continued viability in a consolidating railroad market. Testifying before the Interstate Commerce Commission in Chicago, President Reidy claimed, [...] "The <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that there is just too much transportation available between the principal cities we serve. The Great Western cannot long survive as an independent carrier under these conditions." [...] In 1965, the railroad ended passenger operations.|$|E
2500|$|Early Dublin is also {{referred}} to {{in a number of}} native sources. The Book of Invasions, a largely fabulous compilation of myths and legends, mentions Dublin when describing how two legendary kings of Ireland, Conn of the Hundred Battles and Mug Nuadat, divided the country between them. The line of demarcation, which cut the island into two symbolic halves (known as Leth Cuinn, or [...] "Conn's Half", and Leth Moga, or [...] "Mug's Half") ran along the Esker Riada from High Street in Dublin to Galway on the west coast. According to another work which draws on early sources, the Annals of the Four Masters, Fiachu Sraibtine, the king of Tara, quelled the rebellious inhabitants of Leinster in a battle fought at Dublin in 291 AD; the Annals of Dublin also record that Alphin mac Eochaid, King of Dublin, was converted to Christianity by Saint Patrick in 448 AD. But these entries were only added to the Annals, or the sources from which they were compiled, many centuries after the events they purport to record, and no reliance can be placed on them. The <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that we do not know for certain when the city of Dublin was founded.|$|E

2500|$|Clarkson {{wanted to}} {{purchase}} the Ford GT after admiring its inspiration, the Ford GT40 race cars of the 1960s. Clarkson was able to secure {{a place on the}} shortlist for the few cars that would be imported to Britain to official customers, only through knowing Ford's head of PR through a previous job. After waiting years and facing an increased price, he found many technical problems with the car. After [...] "the most miserable month's motoring possible," [...] he returned it to Ford for a full refund. After a short period, including asking Top Gear fans for advice over the Internet, he bought back his GT. He called it [...] "the most unreliable car ever made", because he was never able to complete a return journey with it. In 2006, Clarkson ordered a Gallardo Spyder and sold the Ford GT to make way for it. In August 2008, he sold the Gallardo because [...] "idiots in Peugeots kept trying to race [...] in it". In October, he announced that he had sold his Volvo XC90. In January 2009, in a review of the car printed in The Times, he wrote: [...] "I’ve just bought my third Volvo XC90 in a row and the <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> this: it takes six children to school in the morning." ...|$|E

50|$|Since {{extending}} one's {{hand was}} the common gesture for {{the invitation to}} dance, hand coolers became invaluable as during {{that time it was}} unacceptable for ladies to have hot, sweaty hands. In France during this time period, it was expected that a ladies' hand would be cool and dry when kissed in greeting by an admiring male. This <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> made all the more problematic by the fact that women wore layers upon layers of clothing as part of the Victorian Fashions, trapping in body heat. One means of dealing with this problem was the hand cooler.|$|R

40|$|Thermodynamics {{provides}} a transparent {{definition of the}} free energy of density functional theory (DFT), and of its derivatives - the potentials, at finite temperatures T. By taking the T to 0 limit, it is shown here that both DFT and spin-dependent DFT (for ground states) suffer from precisely the same benign ambiguities: (a) charge and spin quantization lead to "up to a constant" indeterminacies in the potential and the magnetic field respectively, and (b) the potential in empty subspaces is undetermined but irrelevant. Surprisingly, these <b>simple</b> <b>facts</b> <b>were</b> inaccessible within the standard formulation, leading to recent discussions of apparent difficulties within spin-DFT.

30|$|In the {{standard}} terminology used for cones in normed spaces (see, e.g., [11], Ch.  6), the property (2) {{of the previous}} lemma means that the cone A^+ in A_h is normal with normal constant equal to  1 (in this case the norm is called monotone).

6000|$|Pray do not {{suppose that}} you {{are to blame for}} my having done a little too much--a wild fancy indeed! The <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> that the rapid railway {{travelling}} was stretched a hair's breadth too far, and that I ought to have foreseen it. For, on the night before the last night of our reading in America, when Dolby was cheering me with a review of the success, and the immediate prospect of the voyage home, I told him, to his astonishment: [...] "I am too far gone, and too worn out to realise anything but my own exhaustion. Believe me, if I had to read but twice more, instead of once, I couldn't do it." [...] We were then just beyond our recent number. And it was the travelling that I had felt throughout.|$|E
6000|$|The first {{feeling is}} that of {{surprise}} at finding a people so artificial in their ordinary deportment, so chaste and free from exaggeration in their scenic representations of life. But reflection will show us that all finish {{has the effect of}} bringing us within the compass of severe laws, and that the high taste which results from cultivation repudiates all excess of mere manner. The <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> that an educated Frenchman is a great actor all the while, and that when he goes on the stage, he has much less to do to be perfect, than an Englishman who has drilled himself into coldness, or an American who looks upon strong expressions of feeling as affectation. When the two latter commence the business of playing assumed parts, they consider it as a new occupation, and go at it so much in earnest, that everybody sees they are acting.[19] ...|$|E

500|$|Thematically, {{the novel}} portrays Alabama's {{struggle}} (and hence Zelda's as well) {{to rise above}} being [...] "a back-seat driver about life" [...] and to earn respect for her own accomplishments—to establish herself independently of her husband. Zelda's writing style was quite different from Scott's. The language used in Save Me the Waltz is filled with verbal flourishes and complex metaphors. The novel is also deeply sensual; as literary scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin wrote in 1979, [...] "The sensuality arises from Alabama's awareness of the life surge within her, {{the consciousness of the}} body, the natural imagery through which not only emotions but <b>simple</b> <b>facts</b> <b>are</b> expressed, the overwhelming presence of the senses, in particular touch and smell, in every description." ...|$|R
5000|$|Since {{the limited}} {{size of the}} LGP-30 precluded a full {{implementation}} of ALGOL 60, certain of its features (arrays called by value, own arrays, strings, variable array bounds, and recursion) were omitted; but the implementers did include parameters called by name, using [...] "thunks", and integer labels. They dubbed their work ALGOL 30, since {{it was for the}} LGP-30. From this project emerged a small group of undergraduate students who were well equipped to perform further work in the development of computer languages. For instance, one student (Stephen J. Garland) discovered that compound statements and blocks could be included in the Samelson and Bauer scanning algorithm. This <b>simple</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> not published until some years later.|$|R
