40|$|Acid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> <b>deficiency</b> (ASMD), [Niemann-Pick Disease Types A and B (NPD A and B) ], is an {{inherited}} metabolic disorder resulting from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid sphingomyelinase. Accumulation of sphingomyelin in hepatocytes, reticuloendothelial cells, {{and in some}} cases neurons, results in a progressive multisystem disease that encompasses a broad clinical spectrum of neurological and visceral involvement, including: infantile neurovisceral ASMD (NPD A) that is uniformly fatal by 3 years of age; chronic neurovisceral ASMD (intermediate NPD A/B; NPD B variant) that has later symptom onset and slower neurological and visceral disease progression; and chronic visceral ASMD (NPD B) that lacks neurological symptoms but has significant disease-related morbidities in multiple organ systems.

40|$|Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is an {{autosomal}} recessive lipidosis resulting from mutations of the NPC 1 or NPC 2 gene, clinically characterized by hepatosplenomegaly and progressive neurological symptoms including vertical supranuclear ophthalmoplegia, progressive ataxia, dystonia, and dementia. Neurodegeneration in NPC shows {{a number of}} pathological features similar to those observed in Alzheimer disease. Biochemically, this disease is featured by a defect in intracellular trafficking of exogenous cholesterol {{that leads to the}} lysosomal and late-endosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol. Some reports have shown disturbance of cholesterol efflux in cells with NPC 1, or NPC 2 gene mutations, resulting in plasma lipid abnormalities including low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol as part of the phenotype in NPC. To elucidate the molecular basis for low HDL cholesterol in human plasma, mRNA expressions of 4 ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters related to lipid metabolism, ABCA 1, ABCA 3, ABCA 7, and ABCG 1, were analyzed in fibroblasts with NPC 1 gene mutations by real-time RT-PCR using hybridization probes. These analyses were performed using two fibroblasts of NPC from a patient with two novel compound heterozygous NPC 1 mutations, c. 1891 A>G and c. 581 _ 592 delinsG, and a patient with other two novel compound heterozygous NPC 1 mutations, c. 2800 C>T and c. 3418 G>A. Based on these analyses, the mRNA levels of ABCA 1 and ABCG 1 were significantly decreased in the fibroblasts. These findings suggest that secondary dysfunctions of ABCA 1 and ABCG 1 may cause impairment of cholesterol efflux in the peripheral cells, leading to low plasma levels of HDL cholesterol in NPC. Second, to clarify whether the secondary acid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> <b>deficiency</b> in NPC cells is related to the intracellular pathology of NPC, we investigated the effects of an acid sphingomyelinase inducer, butyrate, on the accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in NPC cells. The results demonstrated that correction of the secondary acid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> <b>deficiency</b> could ameliorate the extent of cholesterol accumulation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Drugs {{often use}} {{endocytosis}} to achieve intracellular delivery, either by passive uptake from the extracellular fluid or by active targeting of cell surface {{features such as}} endocytic receptors. An example is enzyme replacement therapy, a clinically practiced treatment for several lysosomal storage diseases where glycosylated recombinant enzymes naturally target the mannose- 6 -phosphate receptor and are internalized by clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME). However, lysosomal substrate accumulation, a hallmark of these diseases, has been indirectly linked to aberrant endocytic activity. These effects are poorly understood, creating an obstacle to therapeutic efficiency. Here we explored endocytic activity in fibroblasts from patients with type A Niemann−Pick disease, a lysosomal storage disease characterized by acid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> (ASM) <b>deficiency.</b> The uptake of fluid phase markers and clathrin-associated ligands, formation of endocytic structures, and recruitment of intracellular clathrin to ligand binding sites were all altered, demonstrating aberrant CME in these cells. Model polymer nanocarriers targeted to intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), which are internalized by a clathrin-independent route, enhanced the intracellular delivery of recombinant ASM more than 10 -fold compared to free enzyme. This strategy reduced substrate accumulation and restored clathrin endocytic activity to wild-type levels. There {{appears to be a}} relationship between lysosomal storage and diminished CME, and bypassing this pathway by targeting ICAM- 1 may enhance future therapies for lysosomal storage diseases...|$|R
40|$|Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) is a neurovisceral {{lysosomal}} storage disorder {{caused by}} acid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> (ASM) <b>deficiency,</b> {{which can be}} categorized as either Niemann-Pick disease type A [NPD-A], with progressive neurological disease and death in early childhood, or as Niemann-Pick disease type B [NPD-B], with a more variable spectrum of manifestations. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant sphingomyelinase is currently studied as potential treatment for NPD-B patients. The objective {{of this study is}} to characterize the clinical features of patients with ASM deficiency in the Netherlands and Belgium with focus on the natural disease course of NPD-B patients. Prospective and retrospective data on ASM deficient patients were collected in The Netherlands and part of Belgium. Patients with NPD-B that could be followed prospectively were evaluated every 6 - 12 months for pulmonary function tests, 6 minute walk test (6 MWT), imaging (bone marrow infiltration measured by QCSI, organ volumes by MRI and CT scan of the lungs) and biochemical markers. Twenty-five patients with ASM deficiency were identified (13 males, 12 females, median age 13 years, range 1 - 59 years). Nine patients had died at the time of the study, including four NPD-A patients at the age of 1, 1, 2, 3 and five NPDB patents at the age of 5, 6, 43, 56 and 60 years. There was a high prevalence of homozygosity and compound heterozygosity for the common p. Arg 608 del mutation in 43 % and 19 % of NPD-B patients, respectively. In NPD-B patients, thrombocytopenia was present in most, while anemia and leucopenia were less common (33 % and 6 % respectively). HDL cholesterol was reduced in most patients. Pulmonary disease was severe in several patients. Follow-up up to 11 years revealed a gradual decrease in platelet count. Detailed investigations in 6 NPD-B patients with follow-up in 4 patients revealed remarkable stable disease parameters up to 6 years, with some decline in pulmonary function and 6 MWT. Bone marrow fat fractions were decreased, indicating the presence of storage macrophages. Lung involvement was not related to the extent of visceromegaly, cytopenia or bone marrow involvement. In conclusion, in NPD-B patients pulmonary disease is the most debilitating feature. Disease manifestations are mostly stable in attenuated patients. Bone marrow infiltration is a less prominent feature of the disease. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Activator protein (AP), which stimulated {{fibroblast}} sphingomyelinase activity, {{was isolated}} from the spleen of a patient with Gaucher's disease type I by the combined techniques of heat and alcohol denaturation, DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, gel filtration, preparative polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and decyl-agarose chromatography. Urea/sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) /polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis showed two bands, one with an Mr of approx. 3, 000 {{and the other with}} an Mr of 5, 000 - 6, 500. Similarly, SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis performed in the absence of urea revealed the presence of two components, one of which adsorbed to a concanavalin A (Con A) column. Both components stimulated sphingomyelinase activity. On a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing Triton X- 100, four major components, two of which bound to Con A, were detected with the dye Stains-All. Cross-reacting material (CRM) to polyclonal Gaucher spleen AP antibodies was detected in normal fibroblasts and in fibroblasts from patients with <b>sphingomyelinase</b> and beta-glucocerebrosidase <b>deficiency</b> states (Niemann-Pick and Gaucher's diseases respectively). CRM in normal fibroblasts adsorbed to Con A columns and had the same mobility on SDS/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis as Con A-adsorbing Gaucher spleen AP. Normal AP was not observed in mucolipidosis type II (I-cell disease) fibroblasts; instead, extracts from these cells revealed the presence of two closely migrating bands with higher Mr values than normal fibroblast CRM. Furthermore, extracts of media from I-cell fibroblast cultures, but not from control or Gaucher fibroblast cultures, contained AP activity towards sphingomyelinase and beta-glucocerebrosidase. Fibroblasts from a patient with mucolipidosis type III (pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy) showed an intermediate pattern consisting of normal as well as the higher-Mr CRM. Our data provide evidence for the existence of AP in cultured skin fibroblasts and suggest that these proteins may be targetted to the lysosome by post-translational modification in a similar manner to that reported for lysosomal enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Splenomegaly, {{sometimes}} {{of massive}} extent, {{occurs in a}} large number of hereditary diseases, some relatively prevalent and others, rare to ultra-rare. Because physicians are often unfamiliar with the less common disorders, patients may suffer because of diagnostic delay or diagnostic error and may undergo invasive, non-innocuous procedures such as splenectomy that are potentially avoidable were the correct diagnosis suspected. In this review article, we discuss the definition and clinical ramifications of “massive” splenomegaly and describe several rare genetic disorders that are sometimes associated with marked splenic enlargement as well as four additional hereditary “splenomegalic” lysosomal storage diseases (cholesterol esterase storage disease, Niemann-Pick C disease, acid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> <b>deficiency</b> disease, Gaucher disease) in which approved or promising experimental treatments should generally obviate the need for palliative splenectomy. We also summarize current concepts about the appropriate use of splenectomy in patients with β -thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis and Gaucher disease and discuss surgical alternatives to classical total splenectomy for these disorders.   </div...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Clinical {{observations}} and molecular {{analysis of the}} SMPD 1 gene in Chinese patients with acid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> <b>deficiency</b> Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) are scarce. Methods A cohort of 27 Chinese patients diagnosed with acid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> <b>deficiency,</b> within the past five years, were collected and investigated for genotype, phenotype, and their correlations. Results The majority of our patients (25 / 27) were under 18 [*]years of age. From the cohort group, eight (30 %) fulfilled characters of type A. Four other patients experienced neurologic involvement {{after two years of}} age, these were classified as intermediate type. The remaining fifteen presented without clear neurologic involvement and were regarded as type B. One patient, from the type B group, presented with the unusual symptom of a secondary amenorrhea. Three patients, one from the type B group and two from the intermediate group, presented with pronounced proteinuria, in the late stages of the disease, indicating possible kidney involvement in NPD. Twenty-four SMPD 1 gene mutations had been identified; eighteen of these are novel ones. These included four exonic small deletions/duplications (c. 4 delC, c. 147 _ 150 del 4, c. 842 - 849 dup 8, c. 1307 - 1312 dup 6), one termination mutation (p. Glu 248 X), and thirteen exonic point mutations (p. Gly 336 Ser, p. Trp 342 Cys, p. Leu 382 Phe, p. Pro 429 Leu, p. Pro 430 Ser, p. Trp 437 Arg, p. Thr 451 Pro, p. His 461 Pro, p. Ala 484 Val, p. Ser 486 Arg, p. Tyr 500 His, p. Pro 533 Leu, p. Val 559 Leu). Notably, eight mutations had more than one occurrence with c. 4 delC and p. Glu 248 X accounting for ~ 30 % of all alleles. Correlation analysis of genotype and phenotype indicated eight mutations, c. 842 - 849 dup 8, p. Glu 248 X, p. Arg 230 Cys, p. Trp 437 Arg, p. His 461 Pro, p. Ala 484 Val p. Ser 486 Arg, and p. Pro 533 Leu,to be severe mutations. Five mutations, c. 4 delC, p. Leu 382 Phe, p. Pro 429 Leu, p. Pro 430 Ser and p. Val 559 Leu were projected to be mild mutations. Interestingly, three intermediate individuals carried combinations of a mild mutation, c. 4 delC, on one allele and a severe mutation on the other allele. Conclusions The Chinese population may have a comparably high incidence of sphingomyelinase-deficient Niemann-Pick disease type A. This study has identified some novel genotype and phenotype correlations in this rare and devastating disorder. </p...|$|E

The influence of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) {{on the amount of}} intracellular cholesterol was measured in 8 cultures of normal fibroblasts and in 7 fibroblast cultures from NPC patients. DMSO was added to the fibroblast cultures at three different concentrations (1, 2 and 4 %, v/v) and the cultures were incubated for 24 h. Sphingomyelinase activity was significantly increased in both groups of cells only when incubated with 2 % DMSO (59. 4 ± 9. 1 and 77. 0 ± 9. 1 nmol h- 1 mg protein- 1, controls without and with 2 % DMSO, respectively; 47. 7 ± 5. 2 and 55. 8 ± 4. 1 nmol h- 1 mg protein- 1, NPC without and with 2 % DMSO, respectively). However, none of the DMSO concentrations used altered the amount of cholesterol in the cytoplasm of NPC cells (0. 704 ± 0. 049, 0. 659 ± 0. 041, 0. 688 ± 0. 063 and 0. 733 ± 0. 088 mg/mg protein, without DMSO, 1 % DMSO, 2 % DMSO and 4 % DMSO, respectively). This finding suggests that <b>sphingomyelinase</b> <b>deficiency</b> is a secondary defect in NPC and shows that DMSO failed to remove the stored cholesterol.

40|$|International audienceAcid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> <b>deficiency</b> (ASMD), a rare {{lysosomal}} storage disease, is an {{autosomal recessive}} genetic disorder caused by different SMPD 1 mutations. Historically, ASMD has been classified as Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) types A (NPD A) and B (NPD B). NPD A {{is associated with}} a uniformly devastating disease course, with rapidly progressing psychomotor degeneration, leading to death typically by the age of 3 years, most often from respiratory failure. In contrast, the clinical phenotype and life expectancy of patients with NPD B may vary widely. Almost all patients have hepatosplenomegaly and an atherogenic lipid profile, and most patients have interstitial lung disease with progressive impairment of pulmonary function and hematologic abnormalities including cytopenias. Other common clinical manifestations include liver dysfunction, heart disease, skeletal abnormalities and growth delays. Some patients with ASMD who survive beyond early childhood have intermediate phenotypes (variant NPD B) characterized by combinations of non-neurologic and mild to severe neurologic symptoms. The physical and psychosocial burden of illness in patients with NPD B is substantial. Common symptoms include shortness of breath, joint or limb pain, abdominal pain, bleeding and bruising. The disease often leads to chronic fatigue, limited physical or social activity and difficulties in performing daily activities or work. Many patients die before or in early adulthood, often from pneumonia/respiratory failure or liver failure. Available treatments are limited to symptom management and supportive care. An enzyme replacement therapy currently in clinical development {{is expected to be the}} first treatment addressing the underlying pathology of the disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are essential for reducing the risk of complications. While knowledge about ASMD is evolving, more evidence about ASMD and the natural history across the disease spectrum is needed, to improve disease recognition, timely diagnosis and appropriate disease management...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Niemann-Pick {{disease is}} a rare {{autosomal}} recessive metabolic disorder caused by deficiency in the enzyme acid spingomyelinase, which leads to accumulation of sphingomyelin in lysosomes. The overall prevalence of acid <b>sphingomyelinase</b> <b>deficiency</b> (types A and B combined) {{is estimated to be}} 1 : 250, 000. Patients often present within {{the first few months of}} life with hepatosplenomegaly, feeding difficulties, and loss of early motor skills. Storage of sphingomyelin in pulmonary macrophages leads to interstitial lung disease, frequent respiratory infections, as seen in our patient, and often to respiratory failure. Loss of neurologic function is rapid and progressive. Case presentation. An 18 month old male presented to the pediatric cardiology clinic for significant hepatomegaly concerning for a cardiac cause vs storage disease. The patient’s past medical history consisted of recurrent sinusitis, rhinitis, and ear infections, restless sleep, and balance problems. Past surgical history included adenoidectomy for adenoid hypertrophy at 15 months of age. At the time of the surgery, the anesthesiologist noted the patient to have an enlarged liver and referred follow up. Labs ordered by the PCP included BUN 15, K 5. 7, CO 2 14, AST 190, ALT 114, and total bilirubin 0. 4. The patient’s symptoms at time of presentation at the cardiology office included fussiness, restless sleep, enlarged liver x 3 months, and severe itching for 2 months. The patient’s parents relayed that he was developmentally delayed, was not walking independently, had balance issues, and had limited vocabulary. Upon exam, he was noted to have firm liver 10 cm below the right costal margin, spleen passed the umbilicus, and a click at the upper left sternal border upon cardiac auscultation. An echocardiogram was ordered and revealed bicuspid aortic valve with mild aortic root dilation without aortic stenosis. Following his visit with cardiology, he was seen at the pediatric genetics department. A lysosomal enzyme panel revealed low acid sphinomyelinase indicating Niemann-Pick disease type A. This finding was confirmed with DNA analysis testing of SMPD 1 enzyme deficiency. Deviation From the Expected. Death typically occurs by two to three years of age. Bicuspid aortic valve is a relatively common abnormality. Most children with congenital valvar aortic stenosis (AS), even to moderate degrees, are relatively asymptomatic. Patients with bicommissural valves and no stenosis still require long-term follow-up, because progressive stenosis develops in approximately 75 percent of adults. Thickening and focal calcification of the bicommissural valve can be detected pathologically and on echocardiography as early as the second decade of life. Yearly echocardiography, MRI, or CT is recommended for patients with bicuspid aortic valves and dilation of the aortic root or ascending aorta. Discussion. This patient had an unusual presentation of Niemann Pick disease type A along with bicuspid aortic valve and aortic root dilation. While Niemann Pick disease type A is a condition fatal in childhood, there is no current recommendation on management of aortic valve disease in these types of patients. Conclusion. This case presents a novel finding of bicuspid aortic valve with aortic root dilation in Niemann Pick disease not previously reported. It is important to consider the management of such patients presenting with both a condition causing significantly decreased life expectancy as well as a condition that needs to be routinely followed into and throughout adulthood.
