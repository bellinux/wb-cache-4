40|$|One {{of the two}} aims of the Australian Learning and Teaching Council (ALTC) funded Define Your Discipline (DYD) {{project is}} to develop an efficient, inclusive, simple and {{systematic}} <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> process {{that can be used}} by discipline stakeholders to define their discipline. During 2010 the DYD <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> process was developed and then trialled nationally to develop a draft set of Graduate Outcomes for the environmental engineering discipline. The first part of the paper describes the DYD <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> process which uses both divergent and convergent strategies to ensure that the individual voices of the participants are captured, as well as group perspectives. Data was gathered on the tasks undertaken by graduates during their first two or three years of practice. Once the 2010 <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> workshops had been completed the data were synthesised to define a draft set of Graduate Outcomes for the discipline. Two different types of workshop are being used during 2011 to refine the draft set of Graduate Outcomes. Throughout this process each outcome remains linked to all of the identified tasks from which it was derived, and the people who submitted those tasks. Thus, the project team can review the importance of the contributions from the various groups of participants (such as academics, graduates and practitioners) {{as well as some of}} the characteristics of those groups such as location, and gender. The second part of the paper discusses the feedback received from members of the stakeholder groups who participated in the DYD <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> process: 50 of the 110 workshop participants; the project team; and the client - the Environmental Engineering College Board. Overall, the feedback from all parties was very positive. The feedback from the 2010 workshops was used to fine-tune the DYD consultation process for the 2011 workshops. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> {{is being}} adopted as {{standard}} {{practice in the}} planning and management of natural resource management programs. While the utility of stakeholder participation has been investigated for the evaluation and implementation phases of natural resource management programs, {{few studies have examined}} the utility of <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> during the initial phases of developing such programs. This paper presents a case study from a project developing a marine and coastal monitoring program for the Pilbara and Kimberley region of northern Western Australia. Via a series of workshops held in the region, stakeholders were asked to prioritise future research needs using several voting procedures. During the analyses of the results from the different voting procedures, it became apparent that there were high levels of inconsistency, poor correlation, and contradiction, between participants' responses. Despite the rigour of the selection process used to identify 'suitable' stakeholders for the workshops, these results show that stakeholders did not have the technical or broader contextual knowledge about marine ecosystems to effectively and objectively contribute to the research prioritisation and planning process. Based on the outcomes of this study, we argue that project designers need to be clear about why they are involving stakeholders in a project, particularly in light of the costs involved (financial, time, resources, costs to the <b>stakeholder)</b> in <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation.</b> <b>Stakeholder</b> involvement may be appropriate in later stages of developing natural resource management programs (implementation and management), however, stakeholder involvement is not appropriate in the initial phases of such programs, where scientific expertise is essential in formulating scientific concepts and frameworks. <b>Stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> Marine environment Coastal environment Programme development Australia Pilbara Kimberley...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{in-depth}} empirical study into recent government-led Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives in Spain. It is found, {{based on interviews}} and document analysis, that processes of <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> relating to these initiatives are characterised by debate and a plurality of different viewpoints. However, this polyphony can be contrasted sharply with the institutional outcomes of these processes. Institutional outcomes represent the viewpoints of only {{a subset of the}} actors involved in the <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> processes. It is consequently inferred that <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> processes serve problematic functions: on one level, these processes legitimise dominant discourses on CSR by giving the impression that the latter are the outcome of a democratic dialogue that is free from power relations; on another level, these processes themselves show to heretic social actors the futility of their heresy and thus encourage those actors to actively adopt the dominant discourse. We conclude that business capture of Corporate Social Responsibility is ingrained into institutional processes in that domain. This raises serious questions regarding the potential for civil society actors to engage with and move the signifier of Corporate Social Responsibility in a more challenging direction...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Built Environment Project and Asset Management [© Emerald Group Publishing Limited] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] – With the advent of the Darzi review in 2008, and more recently the White Paper “Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS” (2010), the NHS in England is being redesigned to provide high quality, person-centred services with improved capacity and performance. In this change oriented scenario, <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> has a critical role to play given the widespread advocacy in government policy and healthcare literature. In order to support informed decision making, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to: explore healthcare infrastructure planning through various approaches to <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> within English Primary Care Trusts (PCTs); and develop a conceptual approach to strategic asset management (SAM) based on the findings of <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> and engagement exercises. Design/methodology/approach – A multi-method triangulation approach including action research has been adopted to evaluate current <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> practices with a local PCT and to explore their approach to healthcare infrastructure planning through: a literature review of stakeholder engagement and theory; evaluation of a local consultation exercise; and a web based document review of consultation practices within 149 English PCTs. Findings – PCT estate managers and healthcare planners have to operate within constantly changing dynamic healthcare environments and need to reduce uncertainty and indecision that often surrounds the debate of reconfiguration of healthcare facilities and services. Consultations by the PCTs vary in: the level of detail provided to the public; sample sizes; detail and transparency of the consultation; distribution and analyses of the consultation; and techniques and approaches. Practical implications – The findings of this study can be used by healthcare policy makers to: inform how clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) could be better involved during patient and public engagement; and determine practical ways of putting patients at the heart of General Practitioners (GP) commissioning. Originality/value – The research identifies gaps within current <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> practices in English PCTs and develops a conceptual approach to SAM that accounts for stakeholder consultation; decision making levels within healthcare infrastructure planning within a wider competency based organisational view, which currently does not exist...|$|R

40|$|The clean {{development}} mechanism (CDM) {{is one of}} the Kyoto flexible mechanisms. It {{was designed}} with the dual purpose of assisting developed countries in complying with their Kyoto targets in a cost-effective way, and assisting developing countries in achieving sustainable development. Due to a lack of standardized regulations for how sustainable development contributions should be achieved and measured, the mechanism is generally thought to be underperforming with regard to this aspect of its purpose. The CDM Gold Standard is a voluntary “best practice” certification scheme for carbon reduction projects. It was established specifically to fill the regulatory gap in the CDM, and to ensure that certified projects fully complies with both aspects of the mechanism’s purpose, it relies on a set of additional rules and requirements as well as an extensive participatory <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> process. This thesis has examined the effect of the Gold Standard local <b>stakeholder</b> <b>consultation</b> process on the sustainable development impacts of 22 Gold Standard CDM projects.
