25|$|Yandangshan caldera is a round volcanic‐intrusive complex with a {{diameter}} of , of which the north-east part was destroyed by a later regional fault. Yandangshan volcano erupted in four episodes. The mountain consists of various igneous rocks: ignimbrite, rhyolite, <b>syenite</b> and tuff. The mountain shows often conspicuous layering corresponding to the four different episodes of eruptions, giving rise to terrace-like structures where flatter, forested areas are separated by vertical cliffs.|$|E
40|$|By {{using the}} {{stability}} field of amphibole in the melting experiments, {{we attempt to}} estimate the emplacement depth of amphibole-bearing <b>syenites</b> from the S∅r Rondane Mountains. The melting relationships of four <b>syenites</b> and one granite were determined in the temperature range of 650 - 900 ℃ under water pressure of 0. 1 - 0. 3 GPa and oxygen fugacities of the FMQ buffer. In two <b>syenites</b> and a granite, the maximum pressure stability limit of amphiboles in subliquidus is lower pressure than 0. 35 GPa.

40|$|The Early Cenozoic {{alkaline}} {{complex of}} Morro de Sa˜o Joa˜o intrudes the Precambrian basement {{at the eastern}} end of the Rio de Janeiro coastline. It is mostly made up of melanocratic nepheline <b>syenites</b> and nepheline <b>syenites,</b> with subordinate clinopyroxenites, shonkinites (melasyenites), and alkali gabbros. Melanocratic nepheline <b>syenites</b> and nepheline <b>syenites</b> are cross-cut by thin dykes, ranging in composition from phonotephrite to phonolite. The mafic–ultramafic rocks are meso- to orthocumulates, with mineral compositions and whole-rock chemistry suggesting crystallization from a moderately evolved batch of magmas (potassic tephrite/ phonotephrite). Melanocratic nepheline <b>syenites</b> and nepheline <b>syenites</b> likely represent magma–crystal mixtures, whereas a few finegrained rocks roughly approximate liquid compositions; alkali <b>syenites</b> are typical cumulitic rocks. Major and trace element compositions reflect a genesis of clinopyroxenitic to shonkinitic rocks from tephritic parental magmas, which evolved toward phonotephritic and phonolitic compositions. Initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and 143 Nd/ 144 Nd ratios (0. 7048 – 0. 7061 and 0. 51231 – 0. 51239, respectively) overlap the values in the analog intrusions of the Serra do Mar province, supporting a genesis from similar parental magmas and source mantle. The dominant lithospheric components of the latter may be responsible for the potassic affinity and strongly incompatible element enrichment of the derived melts...|$|R

25|$|Mont Saint-Hilaire is {{a famous}} mineral {{locality}} {{because of its}} great number of rare and exotic mineral species. Annite (iron rich biotite) from Mont Saint-Hilaire {{is among the most}} iron-rich found in nature. In the gabbro, biotite is less iron-rich, has lower manganese content, but is titanium-rich. Phlogopite is found as small metamorphic crystals in marble xenoliths within the <b>syenite.</b> Siderophyllite, a relatively rare mineral, occurs as large crystals in a metasomatised albite-rich albitite dike.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to gabbro, the second intrusive suite included nepheline <b>syenite,</b> diorite and monzonite. The third intrusive occupies {{the eastern side}} and is mainly peralkaline nepheline syenites and porphyrites. The most mineralogically interesting are the associated agpaitic (alkali rich, low aluminium and silicon) pegmatites, the intrusive breccias, and the hornfels derived from the metasomatised sedimentary wall rocks. There have been over 366 distinct species of minerals collected at Mont Saint-Hilaire, 50 of which have this site as type locality.|$|E
25|$|The fell can be {{confused}} with Red Pike (Wasdale), which is only three miles away but cannot {{be seen from the}} summit. Alfred Wainwright in his guidebook The Western Fells comments that the Wasdale Red Pike might be higher but is less suited to the name. Red Pike in Buttermere is given its rich red colouring by the presence of <b>syenite</b> in the rock and subsoil of the fell. This is particularly marked in places where surface erosion has occurred (notably the stony track by the side of Scale Force and the path from Bleaberry Tarn to the summit) and the red colouring of the paths can be seen from some distance.|$|E

25|$|Soft-paste porcelains {{date back}} from the early {{attempts}} by European potters to replicate Chinese porcelain by using mixtures of clay and frit. Soapstone and lime were {{known to have been}} included in these compositions. These wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures. As these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation, or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures, they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality. Formulations were later developed based on kaolin with quartz, feldspars, nepheline <b>syenite</b> or other feldspathic rocks. These were technically superior, and continue to be produced. Soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains.|$|E
25|$|Fishwick {{suggests}} that the images (bronze statues) and inscriptions of Strabo's account are stylistically Greek additions to the ara some time after its inauguration. The monumental altar and its 50-meter base were made in marble. It was flanked by two winged victories of gilt bronze, holding palms and gold crowns, standing on ionic capitals, set on columns assumed to be the later source for the four pillars of the transept crossing of the basilica of St-Martin-d'Ainay, which support the dome. These were made from two longer pillars of Egyptian <b>syenite,</b> recovered in the 11th century and sawn in half. The open altar {{appears to have been}} rebuilt (or adapted) as a covered temple in 121 AD, in the reign of Hadrian. The larger altar was the focus of cult to the genius of the living emperor and dea Roma. The temple was dedicated to the cult of deceased Imperial divi, and major Roman and local deities.|$|E

Visiting in the dry season, he was disappointed by the falls. He described the site as comprising a large hill of <b>syenite,</b> a course-grained igneous rock, on the south side. The northern side, made of the same material, was not as high, but steeper than the south. He described the river as having forced its course and within {{the middle of the}} river an island of slate [...] "still defies its power, and breaks the current into two narrow channels; that near the south side gives vent to a great mass of water, over which the torrent rushes with great fury and noise, as may easily be conceived".|$|E
