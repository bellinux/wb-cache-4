25|$|The Espionage Section was {{abolished}} in May 1945 after V-E Day. After the war, Felt {{was sent}} again {{to a field}} office, first to Seattle, Washington.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act is in title V, and relates to National Security Letters (NSLs). An NSL is a form of administrative subpoena used by the FBI, and reportedly by other U.S. government agencies including the CIA and the Department of Defense (DoD). It is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various records and data pertaining to individuals. They require no probable cause or judicial oversight and also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from disclosing that the letter was ever issued. Title V allowed the use of NSLs to be made by a <b>Special</b> <b>Agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> a Bureau field office, where previously only the Director or the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI were able to certify such requests.|$|E

2500|$|Having been <b>Special</b> <b>Agent</b> <b>In</b> <b>Charge</b> <b>of</b> the Albuquerque Office, Don took a {{demotion}} {{in order}} to obtain a position as Special Agent in the L.A. Field Office, but he did so to be with his family when his mother was diagnosed with cancer two years prior to the series pilot. [...] Margaret Eppes died approximately one year later, and according to the pilot, Don elicited Charlie's help on two cases between her death and the series pilot. [...] These cases involved IRS extortion and stock fraud. [...] Initially uncertain about what Charlie might actually be able to contribute, he reluctantly allows Charlie to assist with their attempts to track down a rapist and is pleasantly surprised when Charlie's math leads to the suspect's apprehension ("Pilot").|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012 the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accused Walgreens of {{endangering}} {{public safety}} and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its Jupiter, Florida, distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. [...] The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. [...] In contrast, in 2011, the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. [...] One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011 this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. [...] Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, Fla., a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. [...] Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is [...] "an imminent danger to the public safety." [...] All DEA licensees [...] "have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting {{into the hands of}} legitimate patients," [...] said Mark Trouville, former DEA <b>special</b> <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> the Miami Field Division. [...] "When they choose to look the other way, patients suffer and drug dealers prosper." ...|$|E
