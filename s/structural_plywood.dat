Each of the shearwalls was instrumented {{and subjected to}} reverse cyclic loading representative of the fundamental mode of seismic loading. Construction of the walls and their behaviour under load is described in detail, with an analysis of stiffness, strength, ductility and failure modes.

A proposed method of calculating deflected shapes gives good agreement with test results. The seismic response of multi-storey buildings is investigated.

40|$|Abstract. Considering that plywood is a layered {{cross-ply}} unidirectional {{fiber reinforced composite}} {{the development}} of innovative structural solutions require complex experimental and numerical investigation. Currently numerical simulations based on finite element method (FEM) are set as industry standard for composite industry like aerospace. Meanwhile the wood structures traditionally has been analyzed with simple analytical assumptions and approved with extensive experimental testing. Such an assumption restricts the variety of structural applications and imposes restrains on structural weight savings. On contrary comprehensive analysis by FEM can deliver tailored <b>plywood</b> <b>structural</b> solutions non dependant on neither geometrical nor loading configuration. To elaborate reliable FEM analyses, precise determining of mechanical properties of separate veneer ply is required both in longitudinal and circumferential directions. A significant scatter of wood mechanical properties obtained from cross ply specimen tests {{has been reported in}} the literature. Evidently for a single layer mechanical properties are more affected by micro cracks appearing after peeling process thus testing assessment is crucial. Roughly three hundred unidirectional specimens have been tested in longitudinal and transverse directions to elaborate the confidence bounds of mechanical properties. These properties served as input variables for simulation of corrugate core sandwich panel by FEM commercial code ANSYS. Bending test configuration according to EN 789 has been elaborated for plywood sandwich panel with corrugate core and manufactured by AS “Latvijas Finieris”. Robustness verification of numerical results versus bending tests according to EN 789 for plywood panels confirmed numerical sensitivity towards introduced mechanical properties.

Two experimental conditions were determined for two-stage fatigue of plywood specimen: one used variable applied stress {{and the other}} used variable stress, loading waveform, and loading frequency, because fatigue life of wood composite under constant load depended on loading waveform and loading frequency as well as stress level. The most famous cumulative fatigue damage theory is the Palmgren-Miner rule, which is the summation of {{the ratio of the}} applied loading cycle to the fatigue life under each loading stage. However, the applicability of this rule to the two-stage fatigue of wood composites has not been investigated.

Embedment behavior was modeled using springs arranged in parallel, and the equations for calculating resistance on individual veneers were derived. Embedment tests were conducted using <b>structural</b> <b>plywood</b> composed of sugi or karamatsu. Mechanical behaviors of individual veneers were revealed as followings. In the initial range of deformation, the slope of the resistance–deformation relationship of the veneer with grain parallel to the load direction is higher than that of the resistance–deformation relationship of the veneer with grain perpendicular to the load direction.

30|$|With {{the recent}} concern toward wood {{utilization}} in large-scale structures, increasing the strength performance of structural elements is important. Developing structural elements using board materials {{is one of}} the measures to increase the strength performance. A high-performance nailed joint to resist shear loading is necessary to increase the strength performance of wooden structural elements using board materials. This study was conducted {{in order to understand the}} shear properties of nailed joints intended for large-scale structures. Shear tests were conducted with nailed joints using <b>structural</b> <b>plywood,</b> medium density fiberboard, or particleboard. The yield resistance was determined from experimental load-slip displacement curves, and was also calculated using European yield theory (EYT). Consequently, the nailed joint specimens using MDF showed an experimental yield resistance higher than those using structural sugi plywood. The nailed joint specimens using PB also showed a high value similar to that of the joints using structural karamatsu plywood. The yield resistance of most of the joint specimen series calculated using European yield theory showed slightly higher values than the experimental yield resistance. This study observed the deformation behavior around nail the head under shear loading. No deformation was observed from the appearance at the initial region of the test. The nail head started a rotational deformation when the joint started yielding. Moreover, the side panel became partially embedded. The nail head was completely embedded at the maximum load of the specimen. Nail pull-out from the base material was not remarkably evident.

40|$|A New Zealand {{stand of}} Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden was pruned up to height 8 m and grown for 15 years at low {{stocking}} to 57 cm diameter at breast height. This stand provided 15 trees, preselected {{for a range}} of wood density. Lumber and veneer were cut from the 5 -m butt logs, veneer was peeled from the second logs from height 7 to 13 m, and each tree was evaluated for production of appearance-grade lumber and rotary-peeled veneer. Butt-log quality was good as pruning had effectively restricted the knotty core, and there was little decay from branches in either butt logs or veneer billets. Longitudinal growth stresses varied widely among trees, resulting in log end-splitting and sawlog flitch movement during sawing (spring), which led to crook in sawn timber, substantially reducing timber conversion in some trees. Collapse and internal checking were prevalent in air-dried lumber, and numbers of checks varied widely among trees. Face-checking was found in boards from all trees after kiln-drying and reconditioning, and even those with very few face checks had internal checks. Veneer thickness varied unacceptably, caused probably by incorrect knife- and pressure-bar settings. Veneer splitting also varied among trees, and was worse in butt-log than in second-log veneers. Unsatisfactory pre-heating of billets before peeling may have exacerbated splitting. Knots severely downgraded <b>structural</b> <b>plywood</b> veneer grades, < 8 % of sheets from the second logs being acceptable compared with 87 % of sheets from the pruned butt logs.

40|$|To {{enhance the}} seismic {{performance}} of conventional post-and-beam timber houses commonly built in Japan, one must provide horizontal assemblies such as floors, ceilings, and roofs with sufficient in-plane shear resistance {{as well as}} a vertical assembly of shear walls. This study examined the shear resistance of timber floors and attic horizontal planes nail-jointed with structural particleboards (PBs). Floor joist system specimens and attic beam system specimens with a dimension of 1. 82 m × 2. 73 m were manufactured form JIS (Japanese industrial standard) 18 M type PBs with thicknesses of 12 and 15 mm. The specimens were shear loaded under a cyclic mode until fracture. The effects of PB thicknesses, clearance gaps between PBs, nailing intervals, and nail types on the shear resistance were investigated. The results obtained are as follows. Horizontal planes attached with a 15 -mm-thick PB showed an initial stiffness somewhat higher than that with a 12 -mm-thick PB, whereas the maximum bearing load and ultimate load did not change. A clearance gap of approximately 4 mm between PBs was found to slightly weaken the shear resistance, and the negative effect was larger at the floor joist system than at the attic beam system. Shortening a nail interval from 150 mm to 100 mm enhanced the shear resistance by approximately 20 % and 30 % for the floor joist system and the attic beam system, respectively. Changing the nail type from JIS N 50 to JIS CN 50 strengthened the shear resistance of the attic beam system by approximately 20 %, whereas a clear positive effect was not recognized for the floor joist system.

The roof sheathing panels used are an aspen oriented strand board (OSB(A)), a Scots pine orieted strand board (OSB(P)), a phenol-formaldehyde resin bonded particleboard (PB(PF)), a methylene diphenyl diisocyanate resin bonded particleboard (PB(MDI)), a melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin bonded medium density fiberboard, and a <b>structural</b> <b>plywood.</b> The panel moisture content through the year ranged from around 6 to 11 %, which was estimated based on the equilibrium moisture contents of each panel and the attic temperature and humidity. Due to such arid conditions, there was no significant deterioration of MOR or MOE in any of the panels. There was some deterioration in IB, however, except in OSB(P) and PB(PF) which showed the largest IB reduction of 21 to 25 %. In connection with this decrease in IB, the LNR of PB(PF) exhibited a statistically significant reduction of 24 %, while other panels showed no significantly reduced by 6 to 26 % according to the panel type. The factors that affect NHPT were investigated by conducting some additional tests in terms of panel upper surface demage caused by nail-head pressing, panel lower surface damage caused by nailing, repeated heating of nails caused by high temperatures in excess of 80 ℃ on the roof surface especially in summer, and so on. From the test results it was found that part of the reduction in NHPT was explicable by the damage to the upper panel surface below the nail head, and the rest could be potentially explained by dew condensation on the nail shanks, which affects bond strength between panel elements surrounding nail shanks...|$|E
30|$|The {{relationship}} between the indoor–outdoor air temperature and electric consumption also can be expressed by a bi-linear relationship. Hockey-stick regression analysis [19] was {{used to analyze the}} effect of the indoor–outdoor air temperature difference on the increasing tendency of electric consumption. In this method, a predictor variable is used as the threshold to perform a convergent calculation to minimize the residual sum of the square of the two linear regressions line. As shown in Fig.  8, when the indoor–outdoor air temperature difference exceeded the threshold, the slope of regression line increased rapidly. The thresholds of each experimental house were 20.8  °C for Type WM, 20.7  °C for Type M, and 24.0  °C for Type I. Comparing the threshold for Type I with those of other experimental houses, it was 3  °C higher. That is, Type I tended to suppress the electric consumption associated with increases in the indoor–outdoor air temperature differences more effectively than the other houses. This result {{can be attributed to the}} effect of thermal capacity [16], air tightness, and the status of air conditioning equipment in the building. As the indoor–outdoor air temperature or vapor pressure difference increased, the indoor–outdoor air pressure difference also increased. In the winter, as cold air from the outside flowed inside, the thermal load became higher. Murakami [20] reported that walls with exposed timber columns tend to be less airtight than the stud wall-framed structure. Since Type I was a stud wall-framed structure finished on both sides, its <b>structural</b> <b>plywood</b> and wallpapering increased air tightness. On the contrary, the walls in Type WM and Type M were constructed with exposed timber columns, and gaps frequently occurred between the columns and mud walls. In addition, when the indoor–outdoor air temperature exceeded 25  °C, the electric consumption increased significantly as well as other houses. The operating characteristics of the heat pump under cold conditions likely affected these results. When the outdoor air temperature is below the freezing point, frost is generated in the heat exchanger of the heat pump. To remove this frost, warm air was blown on to the heat exchanger. It is considered that this defrost operation increased electric consumption in each experimental house when the indoor–outdoor air temperature difference was significant.|$|E
