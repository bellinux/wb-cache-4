50|$|The Clean <b>Spark</b> Spread is {{calculated}} using a gas emissions intensity factor of 0.411 tCO2/MWh. Therefore, the clean <b>spark</b> spread iscalculated by subtracting the carbon {{price per tonne}} (multiplied by 0.411) from the ‘dirty’ <b>spark</b> spread, i.e. Clean <b>Spark</b> Spread = <b>Spark</b> Spread- (Carbon Price*0.411).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{development of}} an ignition system using <b>spark</b> electrodes for application in a research explosion vessel. A single <b>spark</b> is aimed to be discharged with quantifiable ignition energy. The <b>spark</b> electrode system would enable study of flame propagation, ignitability of fuel-air mixtures and other fundamental characteristics of flames. The principle of the capacitive <b>spark</b> circuit of ASTM is studied to charge an appropriate capacitance connected across the <b>spark</b> gap through a large resistor by a high voltage from the source of power supply until the initiation of <b>spark.</b> Different <b>spark</b> energies could be obtained mainly by varying {{the value of the}} capacitance and the supply current. The <b>spark</b> sizes produced are found to be affected by the <b>spark</b> gap, electrode size, input voltage and capacitance value. S Keywords—Ignition, <b>Spark</b> Electrode, Flam...|$|R
40|$|Reliable {{operation}} of the <b>spark</b> ignition system electronics in the J 2 X Augmented <b>Spark</b> Igniter (ASI) is imperative in assuring ASI ignition and subsequent Main Combustion Chamber (MCC) ignition events are reliable in the J 2 X Engine. Similar to the manrated J 2 and RS 25 engines, the J 2 X ignition system electronics are equipped with <b>spark</b> monitor outputs intended {{to indicate that the}} <b>spark</b> igniters are properly energized and <b>sparking.</b> To better understand anomalous <b>spark</b> monitor data collected on the J 2 X development engines at NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC), a comprehensive subsystem study of the engine's low and hightension <b>spark</b> ignition system electronics was conducted at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). <b>Spark</b> monitor output data were compared to more detailed <b>spark</b> diagnostics to determine if the <b>spark</b> monitor was an accurate indication of actual <b>sparking</b> events. In addition, ignition system electronics data were closely scrutinized for any indication of an electrical discharge in some location other than the firing tip of the <b>spark</b> igniter a problem not uncommon in the development of high voltage ignition systems...|$|R

40|$|A <b>spark</b> {{energy of}} 2. 13 joules per <b>spark</b> at 1 <b>spark</b> per second {{produced}} ignition to {{an altitude of}} 50, 000 feet at a flight Mach number of 0. 6. The minimum power requirements for ignition were obtained {{from a combination of}} low <b>spark</b> repetition rates and high <b>spark</b> energy. The altitude-ignition limit was also increased by increasing spark-gap immersion, fuel temperature, inlet-air temperature, and fuel volatility, and by decreasing flight Mach number. The maximum altitude at which flame propagation was accomplished from combusters with <b>spark</b> plugs to combusters without <b>spark</b> plugs to combustors without <b>spark</b> plugs was increased about 5000 feet by increasing fuel volatility...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Formation {{mechanism}} of the micro-arc oxidation <b>spark</b> discharge is always a research problem; so far there isn’t a theoretical model for analyzing the <b>spark</b> discharge formation which is widely recognized. Based on analyzing the reaction phenomena and the coating feature in the different periods of the red <b>spark</b> discharge, the formation model of the red <b>spark</b> discharge was established. The <b>spark</b> discharge formation mechanism is shown that it causes the <b>spark</b> discharge formation that the electron bombards the gas layer wrapping the coating in the infancy of red <b>spark</b> discharge stage; at the later period the area of strong electric field generates the <b>spark</b> discharge where the coating of excessive polarization turns out easily...|$|R
40|$|<b>Spark</b> SQL {{is a new}} module in Apache <b>Spark</b> that {{integrates}} rela-tional processing with <b>Spark’s</b> {{functional programming}} API. Built on our experience with Shark, <b>Spark</b> SQL lets <b>Spark</b> program-mers leverage the benefits of relational processing (e. g., declarative queries and optimized storage), and lets SQL users call complex analytics libraries in <b>Spark</b> (e. g., machine learning). Compared to previous systems, <b>Spark</b> SQL makes two main additions. First, it offers much tighter integration between relational and procedural processing, through a declarative DataFrame API that integrates with procedural <b>Spark</b> code. Second, it includes a highly extensible optimizer, Catalyst, built using features of the Scala programming language, that {{makes it easy to}} add composable rules, control code generation, and define extension points. Using Catalyst, we have built a variety of features (e. g., schema inference for JSON, machine learning types, and query federation to external databases) tailored for the complex needs of modern data analysis. We see <b>Spark</b> SQL as an evolution of both SQL-on-Spark and of <b>Spark</b> itself, offering richer APIs and optimizations while keeping the benefits of the <b>Spark</b> programming model...|$|R

30|$|Different {{clustering}} {{techniques can}} be used for distributing computing across several nodes. AsterixDB utilizes a master–slave model, whereas <b>Spark</b> has several clustering possibilities. AsterixDB has JavaScript object notation (JSON)-based Asterix data model (ADM) for semi-structured data. Data in <b>Spark</b> is handled as parallelizable RDDs, which may also be persisted in-memory. Data in AsterixDB can be accessed with AQL, whereas <b>Spark</b> provides access with <b>Spark</b> SQL/data frames. <b>Spark</b> doesn’t have persistent storage (besides persisting in-memory), but a database may be accessed with native drivers or APIs. One example is <b>Spark</b> Cassandra connector, which provides database access to Cassandra from <b>Spark</b> [34].|$|R

For each <b>spark,</b> four quantities must be determined: the <b>spark</b> coordinates, the sound velocity, and the <b>spark</b> 'size'.

5|$|Across the Way is a 1915 American silent {{short film}} {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company under the Princess brand. The comedy-drama involves a man named <b>Sparks</b> playing a trick on his friend to make him question his sanity. The trick involves the friend's love interest being attacked by an assailant which works, but then a burglar attacks her a few days later. The friend saves his love interest from the burglar and later marries him instead of <b>Sparks.</b> The Princess comedy-dramas were not well-received {{and it was not}} long after the film's release that Edwin Thanhouser took a personal interest in the productions at the New Rochelle studio. Soon thereafter, the Princess brand was discontinued and replaced by the Falstaff brand. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
