5|$|The {{front cover}} design, a {{photograph}} of the group on a zebra crossing, was based on ideas sketched by McCartney, and taken on 8 August 1969 outside EMI Studios in Abbey Road. At 11:35 that morning, photographer Iain Macmillan was given only ten minutes to take the photo whilst he stood on a <b>step-ladder</b> and a policeman held up traffic behind the camera. Macmillan took six photographs, which McCartney later examined with a magnifying glass before deciding which of the shots would be used upon the album sleeve.|$|E
2500|$|As {{they wait}} for the fly {{to land on the}} flypaper, the two talk about their families. Walt expresses that he should have died already and tries to think of the perfect moment to have done so: after he had enough money, after Holly was born, before his surgery and before Skyler knew what he'd been doing. He finally decides the perfect moment to die would have been the night Jane died. Walt then tells Jesse of his bar {{conversation}} with Donald Margolis, Jane's father, on the day that she died. He tries to calculate the chances of meeting both father and daughter in different scenarios on the same night despite having never met either beforehand, but finds the odds too astronomical to calculate. Jesse, who is unaware of Walt's direct involvement in Jane's death, is surprised to hear this, but before he can ask more, he sees the fly up near the ceiling. He constructs a make-shift support for a <b>step-ladder,</b> asking Walt to hold it steady while he reaches for it. Walt, nearly asleep, begs Jesse to not hurt himself getting the fly. For a moment, it appears that Walt in his sleepy state is about to confess to Jesse how he stood by while Jane choked to death, but he stops at apologizing for Jane's death. Jesse tells him Jane's death was nobody's fault, but he still misses her. As Jesse begins wildly swatting at the fly, a sobbing Walt falls asleep. Jesse fails to get the fly and with Walt asleep, starts to climbs back down, but sees the fly land on the ladder. He swats and kills it.|$|E

60|$|There is a bazaar to-night in the representatives' hall. You {{people out}} in Colorado don't know anything. A bazaar is cedar and tacks and girls and raw-cake and <b>step-ladders</b> and Austin Grays and a bass solo by Bill Stacy, and net profits $2.65.|$|R
50|$|The rebuilt {{locomotives}} also underwent several minor changes. Steps were {{fitted to}} the rear of the locomotives to allow access to the roof, external door handles and <b>step-ladders</b> were fitted to the middle set of engine-room doors, and an automated handbrake system was fitted. The locomotives also had front ladders fitted to allow access to the cab windows, some of which were integrated into the sheet metal profile edge from the locomotive frame to the leading headstock. Both horns were relocated to the front of the cab, although the rebuilt DG 760 had three - two forward facing on the cab front, with one behind the cab.|$|R
60|$|I {{have often}} thought how {{interesting}} a magazine paper might be written by any author who would--that is to say, who could--detail, step by step, the {{processes by which}} any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion. Why such a paper has never {{been given to the}} world, I am much at a loss to say--but perhaps the autorial vanity has {{had more to do with}} the omission than any one other cause. Most writers--poets in especial--prefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy--an ecstatic intuition--and would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought--at the true purposes seized only at the last moment--at the innumerable glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view--at the fully-matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable--at the cautious selections and rejections--at the painful erasures and interpolations,--in a word, at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for scene-shifting, the <b>step-ladders</b> and demon-traps, the cock's feathers, the red paint, and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred, constitute the properties of the literary histrio.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you get the}} <b>step-ladder</b> for me, I will. This {{shocking}} old chimney, this abominable old-fashioned old chimney's mantels are so high, I can't reach them." ...|$|E
60|$|There was in {{the china}} closet {{a small piece of}} furniture, very {{convenient}} about a house, called a <b>step-ladder.</b> It consisted of two wooden steps, and was made and kept there to stand upon, in order to reach the high shelves. Rollo brought out the <b>step-ladder,</b> and placed it in the door-way, and then ascended it. From the top he could reach nearly {{to the top of the}} door; but then, as his tuft was at the end of the thread, it hung down, of course, some little distance below his head.|$|E
60|$|Happy thought--there was Donald, the big pack-horse! The {{last time}} Donald was ridden he had upon him a {{hair-pin}} and a pea--by which I mean--(once again to drop into poetry) you and me. Now {{he was to}} have a rider more suited to his size. He was brought up to the door--he looked a mountain. A <b>step-ladder</b> was put alongside of him. The Captain approached the <b>step-ladder,</b> and he looked an Alp. I wasn't as much afraid for the horse as I was for the <b>step-ladder,</b> but it bore the strain, and with a kind of sickening smash that you might have heard at Monterey, the Captain descended to the saddle. Now don't think that I am exaggerating, but at the moment when that enormous Captain settled down upon Donald, the horse's hind-legs gave visibly under the strain. What the couple looked like, one on top of t'other, no words can tell you, and your mother must here draw a picture.|$|E
6000|$|Up {{till now}} that father had possessed {{what was left}} of his heart by the groom, Bob, who played the concertina, and his nurse [...] "Da," [...] who wore the violet dress on Sundays, and enjoyed the name of Spraggins in that private life lived at odd moments even by {{domestic}} servants. His mother had only appeared to him, as it were in dreams, smelling delicious, smoothing his forehead just before he fell asleep, and sometimes docking his hair, of a golden brown colour. When he cut his head open against the nursery fender she was there to be bled over; and when he had nightmare she would sit on his bed and cuddle his head against her neck. She was precious but remote, because [...] "Da" [...] was so near, and there is hardly room for more than one woman at a time in a man's heart. With his father, too, of course, he had special bonds of union; for little Jon also meant to be a painter when he grew up--with the one small difference, that his father painted pictures, and little Jon intended to paint ceilings and walls, standing on a board between two <b>step-ladders,</b> in a dirty-white apron, and a lovely smell of whitewash. His father also took him riding in Richmond Park, on his pony, Mouse, so-called because it was so-coloured.|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} their {{attention}} was distracted by a noise that bore {{a striking resemblance}} to a suppressed laugh. The footman on the <b>step-ladder</b> began to rattle the skylight vigorously.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried the}} door softly, {{but it was}} locked. Then I knocked. There was no answer. Turning away, I entered the next stall and, {{mounting}} a <b>step-ladder,</b> looked over the partition.|$|E
60|$|There was no reply, {{and he was}} on {{the point}} of sending a cadet for a <b>step-ladder</b> when the door opened and in came Peleg Snuggers with the very thing wanted.|$|E
60|$|The <b>step-ladder</b> {{was placed}} in {{position}} and Snuggers mounted cautiously to the top. He could just reach the chandelier and the teeth, and it took him some time to cut the teeth loose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you come}} {{to ask me to}} go for a drive in that {{wonderful}} vehicle?" [...] she said lightly, pointing out of the window to where his dogcart was waiting. [...] "I should want a <b>step-ladder</b> to mount it!" ...|$|E
60|$|Greeting him in {{the open}} cordial way common to all Dr. May's children, Aubrey was at once recognized, {{and the old man}} came down a <b>step-ladder</b> in the {{interior}} to welcome him, and answer his question where he should find Mr. Ward.|$|E
60|$|Mr Pancks, {{being by}} that time quite ready for a start, got under steam in a moment, and, without any other signal or ceremony, was {{snorting}} down the <b>step-ladder</b> and working into Bleeding Heart Yard, before {{he seemed to be}} well out of the counting-house.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tolman turned, and beheld {{two long}} rows {{of books in}} brown-paper covers, with a short <b>step-ladder,</b> {{standing}} near {{the door of the}} inner room, by which these shelves might be reached. This pleased him greatly. He had had no idea that there was a library here.|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{the ceiling}} there hung, {{too high to}} be {{conveniently}} dusted, a few stuffed birds, and one small alligator. 'Some of these days,' said Abner to himself, 'I am goin' {{to get on a}} <b>step-ladder</b> and look at them birds and things; I never did properly know what they was.' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{made their}} way to the top of the house and were escorted by a buxom chambermaid to what was {{practically}} a <b>step-ladder</b> opening out on to a skylight. From here they crawled on to the roof, where they found Granet comfortably ensconced with his back to a chimney, smoking a cigarette.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Carey is a gentlewoman! I {{always thought}} so. You tell her, with my compliments, that I'd {{be glad to}} see you any time if she has no objection. I'll put my <b>step-ladder</b> there, and you can come over instead of the cat. But mind you don't meddle, or I might give you a toss like Tabby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop that, you!" [...] {{cried the}} oldest Rover, and then, {{rushing to the}} door, he flung it open and gave a shove to what was beyond. This was a short <b>step-ladder</b> upon which Larkspur and several others were standing, and over the ladder went with a crash, sending the hazers {{to the floor of}} the hallway in a heap.|$|E
60|$|They {{reached the}} gallery {{and the little}} <b>step-ladder</b> {{that led to a}} door that opened upon the roof, Gabriel {{preceding}} with his burden. There was another rush up the staircase without the court room, but this time there was no yielding in the door; the earthquake that had shaken the foundations and settled the walls had sealed it firmly.|$|E
60|$|Up-stairs--the stairs {{are dark}} oak, and come down {{at one end}} of the big kitchen--there is one {{beautiful}} large room, made the larger by a grand oriel window under the gable, one opening out of it, and four more over the offices; then a <b>step-ladder</b> and a great cheese-room, and a perfect wilderness of odd nooks up in the roof.|$|E
60|$|At dusk Frank and I {{set out for}} the Enderly Road, {{carrying}} a basket, a small <b>step-ladder,</b> an unlit lantern, a hammer, and a box of tacks. It was dark when we reached the Enderly Road schoolhouse. Fortunately, it was quite out of sight of any inhabited spot, being surrounded by woods. Hence, mysterious lights in it at strange hours would not be likely to attract attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, really, {{when the}} venerable abuses {{consisted}} of Hindoos praying {{to their own}} three-legged stools, and keeping sacred monkeys in honour of the ape Hanyuman, {{it was a question}} whether one could be a Christian oneself, and suffer it undisturbed. It was coming it too strong, when I was requested to lend my own <b>step-ladder</b> for the convenience of an exhibition of a devotee swinging on hooks in his sides." ...|$|E
6000|$|Demi tore downstairs, and {{returned}} with the cream, also a puckered-up face, for he had tasted it on his way, and found it so sour that he predicted the cakes would be uneatable. Mrs. Jo took this occasion to deliver a short lecture from the <b>step-ladder</b> on the chemical properties of soda, to which Daisy did not listen, but Demi did, and understood it, as he proved by the brief but comprehensive reply: ...|$|E
60|$|I ventured {{down the}} hall toward the stern, and found it opened into the stern of the Elsinore, forming a single large {{apartment}} at least thirty- five feet from side to side and fifteen to eighteen feet in depth, curved, of course, to the lines of the ship's stern. This seemed a store- room. I noted wash-tubs, bolts of canvas, many lockers, hams and bacon hanging, a <b>step-ladder</b> that led up through a small hatch to the poop, and, in the floor, another hatch.|$|E
6000|$|... "This way, Señors," [...] he said, and {{led them}} {{to the end of the}} place where a broad <b>step-ladder</b> stood. Going up it, a lamp in his hand, he opened a trap-door and called to them to follow him, which Castell did. Peter, however, first turned and said good-night to the company who were {{watching}} them; at the same moment, as though by accident or thoughtlessly, half drawing his sword from its scabbard. Then he too went up the ladder, and found himself with the others in an attic.|$|E
6000|$|Felix went up a <b>step-ladder,</b> Wilmet following; and there, sure enough, was Lance, {{lying in}} a nest of paper shavings, with head on his air-pillow. 'Oh, you've {{unearthed}} me, have you? I wish you'd let me stay here all night!' he said, with some weary fretfulness; but the next moment burst into a peal of laughter, as Wilmet's head appeared above the floor. 'Pallas Athene ascends! Oh! what a place {{it would be to}} act a play--only then all the fry would find it out! I hope they haven't! I told the Star not to tell!' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{blackberry}} lane {{was deep}} and hollow, the brambles outstretching their arching wreaths, laden with heavy clusters of shining fruit, glossy black, scarlet, or green, sometimes with a lingering pearly flower. A <b>step-ladder</b> stile led down into it from the field, and on the topmost step, {{her back against the}} rail, sat Wilmet. On the lowest, turned at right angles to the first, was John Harewood, looking up to her; while scrambling on the bank, contending with the brambles, were the younger ones; Lance, unable to help now and then sending a furtive glance through the tangle.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{waited to}} see no more. When Bob stayed up to grind, as he was doing to-night, he often sat in his room instead of {{remaining}} {{all the time in}} the mill; and this room was an isolated chamber over the bakehouse, which could not be reached without going downstairs and ascending the <b>step-ladder</b> that served for his staircase. Anne descended in the dark, clambered up the ladder, and saw that light strayed through the chink below the door. His window faced towards the garden, and hence the light could not as yet have been seen by the press-gang.|$|E
6000|$|The shapes arise! The {{shape of}} the prisoner's place in the court-room, and of him or her [...] seated in the place; The {{shape of the}} liquor-bar leaned against by the young rum-drinker and the [...] old rum-drinker; The shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod, by sneaking footsteps; The shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome couple; The shape of the gambling-board with its devilish {{winnings}} and losings; The shape of the <b>step-ladder</b> for the convicted and sentenced murderer, the [...] murderer with haggard face and pinioned arms, The sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and white-lipped crowd, [...] the sickening dangling of the rope.|$|E
6000|$|... [Picture: Candle] “Now {{you go and}} get me my hammer, Will,” {{he would}} shout; “and you bring me the rule, Tom; and I shall want the <b>step-ladder,</b> and I had better have a kitchen-chair, too; and, Jim! you run round to Mr. Goggles, and tell him, ‘Pa’s kind regards, and hopes his leg’s better; and will he lend him his spirit-level?’ And don’t you go, Maria, because I shall want {{somebody}} to hold me the light; and when the girl comes back, she must go out again {{for a bit of}} picture-cord; and Tom!—where’s Tom?—Tom, you come here; I shall want you to hand me up the picture.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then that cultured Red Man exhaled an {{arrangement}} of sounds with his mouth that made the Latin aggregation pause, with thoughtfulness and hesitations. The matter of his proclamation {{seemed to be a}} co-operation of the Carlisle war-whoop with the Cherokee college yell. He went at the chocolate team like a bean out of a little boy's nigger shooter. His right elbow laid out the governor man on the gridiron, and he made a lane the length of the crowd so wide that a woman could have carried a <b>step-ladder</b> through it without striking against anything. All Mellinger and me had to do was to follow.|$|E
6000|$|The shapes arise! [...] The {{shape of}} the prisoner's place in the court-room, and of him or her [...] seated in the place, [...] The {{shape of the}} liquor-bar lean'd against by the young rum-drinker [...] and the old rum-drinker, [...] The shape of the shamed and angry stairs trod by sneaking footsteps, [...] The shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous unwholesome couple, [...] The shape of the gambling-board with its devilish {{winnings}} and losings, [...] The shape of the <b>step-ladder</b> for the convicted and sentenced [...] murderer, the murderer with haggard face and pinion'd arms, [...] The sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent and white-lipp'd [...] crowd, the dangling of the rope.|$|E
