50|$|Light {{transmission}} (for this article, the perceivable {{visible spectrum}} between 390 nm and 750 nm is considered) through glass is diminished either by light reflection or light absorption of the <b>glazing</b> <b>material.</b> The total light transferred through the <b>glazing</b> <b>material</b> (light transmission) {{is reduced by}} reflection and/or absorption. In art framing, light reflection causes glare, while light absorption also may cause the transmitted colors to be dulled or distorted. While type of the glass substrate will affect the light absorption of the glazing, the surface treatment can affect light scattering, light reflection and in some cases, light absorption. There are various glazing options {{to achieve this goal}} as explained in the following sections on Types of Picture Framing Glass.|$|R

The results of the simulations showed a handsome potential savings, over several standard glazing types, for selective transmitters of both the fixed and switchable variety. Fixed transmitters were also excellent performers,several configurations offering savings often only slightly lower than the highest savings attained in the switchable group. The switchable transmitter group contained glazings which produced the lowest annual loads. The primary reductions were made in cooling loads without dramatic increases in lighting loads, but heating savings, resulting primarily from <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> of high thermal resistance, proved to be significant in cold climates. by William A.

5000|$|Glazes need {{to include}} a ceramic flux which {{functions}} by promoting partial liquefaction in the clay bodies and the other <b>glaze</b> <b>materials.</b> Fluxes lower the high melting point of the glass formers silica, and sometimes boron trioxide. These glass former may {{be included in the}} <b>glaze</b> <b>materials,</b> or may be drawn from the clay beneath. [...] Raw <b>materials</b> of ceramic <b>glazes</b> generally include silica, which will be the main glass former. Various metal oxides, such as sodium, potassium and calcium, act as a flux to lower the melting temperature. Alumina, often derived from clay, stiffens the molten glaze to prevent it from running off the piece. Colorants, such as iron oxide, copper carbonate or cobalt carbonate, and sometimes opacifiers such as tin oxide or zirconium oxide, are used to modify the visual appearance of the fired glaze.|$|R

50|$|He {{established}} his practice in 1878, and for 10 years worked {{in partnership with}} William de Morgan (1839-1917), for whom he designed tiles, vases, and other artefacts. He advocated the use of <b>glazed</b> <b>materials</b> to resist the polluted atmosphere of nineteenth century London. In this, he anticipated the designs of Otto Wagner in Vienna, who used coloured tiles set in the same planes as walls and piers to suggest architectural features. He designed several buildings, of which the best were the Howrah Station, gateway to Calcutta, situated in the twin city Howrah, district Howrah, West Bengal, India (1901; with a glowing exterior of brick and coloured tiles), and Debenham House in Holland Park (1905-8), completely faced with impervious <b>glazed</b> <b>materials,</b> even the roof-tiles. He was an Arts-and-Crafts architect, whose work was extraordinarily sensitive, imaginative, and original. Among his works his own house, ‘Woodside’, Graffham, near Petworth, Sussex (1905), deserves note.|$|R

40|$|Annealed {{glass is}} by far the most {{commonly}} used <b>glazing</b> <b>material</b> in building construction. The resistant properties of glazing panels to wind loading has been studied for a long time based on quasistatic modeling. More recently, the vulnerability of infrastructure and its protection against acts of terrorism has been receiving a great deal of attention, as pioneered by the work of Wu and Hao from within Australia, whereas vulnerability studies by Stewart were specific to glass facades in terrorism scenarios. Emphasis has been on modeling the blast induced pressure and impulses, as they are applied to the panels while the resistant properties of the <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> have been based on assumptions used currently in design. Research undertaken by the writers over the past two to three years have revealed scopes of possible improvements to the current models that have been used in defining the resistant properties of <b>glazing</b> <b>materials.</b> Models based on the well known Weibull distribution, although widely assumed in practice, have been found to be not fully consistent with evidence produced experimentally or by analytical simulations. The interaction of the principal stresses surrounding the crack tip and higher mode effects have also been found to have significant effects on the ultimate behavior of the panel. The accurate modeling of these phenomena is particularly important for large panels. This paper provides an update of the redevelopment of a realistic behavioral model for annealed glazing panels subject to impact action. A new simulation procedure that takes various described phenomena into account is presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study on the}} temperature field inside a passenger's compartment of a Proton Wira saloon car using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The main goal is to investigate the effects of different glazing types applied onto {{the front and rear}} windscreens of the car on the distribution of air-temperature inside the passenger compartment in the steady-state conditions. The air-flow condition in the passenger's compartment is also investigated. Fluent CFD software was used to develop a three-dimensional symmetrical model of the passenger's compartment. Simplified representations of the driver and one rear passenger were incorporated into the CFD model of the passenger's compartment. Two types of glazing were considered namely clear insulated laminated tint (CIL) with a shading coefficient of 0. 78 and green insulated laminate tint (GIL) with a shading coefficient of 0. 5. Results of the CFD analysis were compared with those obtained when the windscreens are made up of clear glass having a shading coefficient of 0. 86. Results of the CFD analysis show that for a given <b>glazing</b> <b>material,</b> the temperature of the air around the driver is slightly lower than the air around the rear passenger. Also, the use of GIL <b>glazing</b> <b>material</b> on both the front and rear windscreens significantly reduces the air temperature inside the passenger's compartment of the car. This contributes to a better thermal comfort condition to the occupants. Swirling air flow condition occurs in the passenger compartment. The air-flow intensity and velocity are higher along the side wall of the passenger's compartment compared to that along the middle section of the compartment. It was also found that the use of <b>glazing</b> <b>materials</b> on both the front and rear windscreen has no significant effects on the air-flow condition inside the passenger's compartment of the car...|$|R

In order to expand the comprehensive utilization field of red mud and develop new ceramic products with low radioactivity utilizing red mud, the exploration of preparing self-releasing <b>glaze</b> ceramic <b>materials</b> using red mud as raw material was carried out. During the exploration, the self-releasing <b>glaze</b> ceramic <b>materials</b> with low radiation level were produced by normal pressure sintering process using the main ingredients of red mud, red sandstone, barium carbonate and ball clay. The properties of the self-releasing glaze ceramic samples were investigated by the measurements of mechanical properties, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and radiation measurement. The results show that the self-releasing <b>glaze</b> ceramic <b>materials</b> have good mechanical properties (the bulk density, 3. 10 g/cm 3; the compressive strength, 78. 00 MPa).

Performance of solar collector is affected by glaze transmittance, absorptance, and reflectance which results into major heat losses in the system. Four solar collector models with different glass thicknesses were designed, constructed, and experimentally tested for their performances. Collectors were both oriented to northsouth direction and tilted to an angle of 10 ° with the ground toward north direction. The area of each collector model was 0. 72 [*]m 2 with a depth of 0. 15 [*]m. Low iron (extra clear) glass of thicknesses 3 [*]mm, 4 [*]mm, 5 [*]mm, and 6 [*]mm was used as <b>glazing</b> <b>materials.</b> As a control, all collector performances were analysed and compared using a glass of 5 [*]mm thickness and then with glass of different thickness.
