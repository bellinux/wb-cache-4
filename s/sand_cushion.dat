The properties of black cotton soil may be improved to make the soil suitable for construction purposes.

40|$|In {{the civil}} {{engineering}} practice, construction operations in loose and high compressibility soils require {{the application of}} compressed <b>sand</b> <b>cushions.</b> Recently, {{there has been a}} substantial decline in the use of compacted ground beddings in the practice of industrial and civil engineering. This can be partly explained by the weaknesses of the existing calculation methods that may often generate higher values of the size of compacted cushions (width and thickness) and, consequently, cause a substantial increase in their cost. It is noteworthy that the existing methods of calculation do not take account of strength and deformation characteristics of the cushion material in the course of identification of the cushion size and their operating bearing capacity. However, the studies implemented by different authors suggest the possibility of reducing the size of compacted soil cushions applied to loose and high compressibility soils. Therefore, the most effective are the pads reinforced by high-strength reinforcing elements (as geo-textile, geo-grids, etc.) The author elaborates on the possible methods of expanding the scope of compacted ground bedding in the practice of industrial and civil construction.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} effect of fatigue {{phenomenon}} due to the application of wetting and drying cycles with compacted soil cushion on expansive soil type in Upper Egypt. Two types of compacted soil <b>cushions</b> <b>sand</b> and the mixture of sand lime over expansive soil were used. Undisturbed specimens trimmed from large undistributed cylindrical boring samples were used in a standard odometer under different normal applied pressures. The swelling of the soil specimen was determined by observation of the dial gauge reading. Results indicated that placing of the <b>sand</b> lime <b>cushion</b> over expansive soil gives the best performance for swelling reduction compared with the case of sand. The fatigue phenomenon gained from wetting and drying cycles has a significant effect in reducing the potential of swelling pressure {{especially in the case}} of using compacted cushion under applied pressure. The higher the vertical pressure, the higher reduction of swelling pressure in case of with and without cushion under wetting and drying cycles. The application of this method is a suitable solution to prevent the damage of structures constructed over expansive soil in Upper Egypt area. Based on laboratory results, regression models using multiple regression analysis method were developed to predict the reduction of swelling potential. The merit of these models is to help site engineers in study area to estimate the numbers of cycles and applied pressure which are needed to reduce the potential of expansive soil.

Wheel punctures and tears caused by sharp rocks while traversing the plateaus led to directing the rover to traverse in valleys where <b>sands</b> would <b>cushion</b> wheel loads. This required driving across a megaripple (windblown, sand-sized deposit covered by coarser grains) that straddles a narrow gap and several extensive megaripple deposits that accumulated in low portions of valleys. Traverses across megaripple deposits led to mobility difficulties, with sinkage values up to approximately 30 % of the 0. 50 m wheel diameter, resultant high compaction resistances, and rover-based slip up to 77 %. Analysis of imaging and engineering data collected during traverses across megaripples for the first 710 sols (Mars days) of the mission, laboratory-based single-wheel soil experiments, full-scale rover tests at the Dumont Dunes, Mojave Desert, California, and numerical simulations show {{that a combination of}} material properties and megaripple geometries explain the high wheel sinkage and slip events.

Severe distress to infrastructures can be caused by the development of heave and swelling pressure in this kind of expansive shale. Among the various techniques for expansive soil mitigation, the removal and replacement technique is very popular for lightly loaded structures and shallow foundations. This paper presents the result of an experimental study conducted for evaluating the effect of type and thickness of the cushion soils on mitigation of swelling characteristics of expanded shale. Seven undisturbed shale samples collected from Al Qadsiyah district, which is located in the Tabuk town north Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, are treated with two types of cushion coarse-grained sediments (CCS); sand and gravel. Each type is represented with three thicknesses, 22 %, 33 % and 44 % in relation to the depth of the active zone.

For valid simulation, we put forward the methods and principles of simplifying foundation and <b>sand</b> <b>cushion.</b> The research results indicate that, if the ground deforms in patterns of negative curvature, tension or compression, the structure stress and the horizontal support displacement of transmission tower can be reduced by 25 % and 40 % respectively by using composite foundation compared with independent foundation. If the ground deforms in pattern of positive curvature, the tower can be also protected by using the composite foundation instead of the independent ones, but the effect is less than that in the former three deformation patterns. The research findings {{provide the basis for}} improving the design method of transmission tower foundation in mining subsidence area...|$|E
