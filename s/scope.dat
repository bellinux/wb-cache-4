40|$|Abstract Background <b>Scoping</b> reviews {{are used}} to {{identify}} knowledge gaps, set research agendas, and identify implications for decision-making. The conduct and reporting of <b>scoping</b> reviews is inconsistent in the literature. We conducted a <b>scoping</b> review to identify: papers that utilized and/or described <b>scoping</b> review methods; guidelines for reporting <b>scoping</b> reviews; and studies that assessed the quality of reporting of <b>scoping</b> reviews. Methods We searched nine electronic databases for published and unpublished literature <b>scoping</b> review papers, <b>scoping</b> review methodology, and reporting guidance for <b>scoping</b> reviews. Two independent reviewers screened citations for inclusion. Data abstraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second reviewer. Quantitative (e. g. frequencies of methods) and qualitative (i. e. content analysis of the methods) syntheses were conducted. Results After searching 1525 citations and 874 full-text papers, 516 articles were included, of which 494 were <b>scoping</b> reviews. The 494 <b>scoping</b> reviews were disseminated between 1999 and 2014, with 45  % published after 2012. Most of the <b>scoping</b> reviews were conducted in North America (53  %) or Europe (38  %), and reported a public source of funding (64  %). The number of studies included in the <b>scoping</b> reviews ranged from 1 to 2600 (mean of 118). Using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology guidance for <b>scoping</b> reviews, only 13  % of the <b>scoping</b> reviews reported {{the use of a}} protocol, 36  % used two reviewers for selecting citations for inclusion, 29  % used two reviewers for full-text screening, 30  % used two reviewers for data charting, and 43  % used a pre-defined charting form. In most cases, the results of the <b>scoping</b> review were used to identify evidence gaps (85  %), provide recommendations for future research (84  %), or identify strengths and limitations (69  %). We did not identify any guidelines for reporting <b>scoping</b> reviews or studies that assessed the quality of <b>scoping</b> review reporting. Conclusion The number of <b>scoping</b> reviews conducted per year has steadily increased since 2012. <b>Scoping</b> reviews {{are used to}} inform research agendas and identify implications for policy or practice. As such, improvements in reporting and conduct are imperative. Further research on <b>scoping</b> review methodology is warranted, and in particular, there is need for a guideline to standardize reporting...|$|R
50|$|Lexical <b>scoping</b> {{was used}} for ALGOL and has been picked up in most other {{languages}} since then. Deep binding, which approximates static (lexical) <b>scoping,</b> was introduced in LISP 1.5 (via the Funarg device developed by Steve Russell, working under John McCarthy). The original Lisp interpreter (1960) and most early Lisps used dynamic <b>scoping,</b> but descendants of dynamically <b>scoped</b> languages often adopt static scoping; Common Lisp and Scheme (with SRFI 15) have both dynamic and static <b>scoping.</b> Perl is another language with dynamic <b>scoping</b> that added static <b>scoping</b> afterwards. Languages like Pascal and C have always had lexical <b>scoping,</b> since they are both influenced by the ideas that went into ALGOL 60 (although C did not include lexically nested functions).|$|R

40|$|AbstractDeveloping a {{real-time}} {{system in}} Java requires awareness of memory behaviour {{in addition to}} software functional requirements. The Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) introduces a <b>scoped</b> memory model to avoid garbage collection delays in critical real-time applications which need to meet hard real-time constraints. <b>Scoped</b> memory management has certain advantages over garbage collection in terms of predictability. However, developing a real-time application using <b>scoped</b> memory areas (regions) may suffer from both design and runtime errors. Moreover, from a memory footprint perspective, the inability to determine precisely how many <b>scoped</b> memory areas should be used and which objects or threads should be allocated into these <b>scoped</b> memory areas makes using RTSJ problematic for developing real-time systems. In this paper, {{a survey of the}} current approaches to improve <b>scoped</b> memory management and new emerging challenges in RTSJ <b>scoped</b> memory management model are presented.
