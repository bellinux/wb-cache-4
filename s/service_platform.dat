40|$|The digitization, as the {{profound}} digital transformation of business activities, processes, competencies, and models, leads in many companies {{to the implementation}} of digital <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> as a nucleus for rapid development and the implementation of reusable digital innovations and solutions. Based on <b>service</b> <b>platforms,</b> companies strive to gain superior resource density that enables interaction with customers and partners in real-time and foster service innovation. This paper focusses on the role and purpose of <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> in value creation and in particular, the management of resources. For this, a longitudinal single-case study method is conducted that comprises three embedded case studies as units of analysis. In this context, the meta-theoretical foundations of S-D logic are reflected and, as a result, resource orchestration as a management capability of <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> is introduced and discussed. Moreover, the role of <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> in managing resources in the development of innovative service systems is examined...|$|R

To ensure context-enabled interoperation on <b>service</b> <b>platforms</b> in such a sphere, developers need to have a shared specification of objects belonging to the sphere and their roles.
