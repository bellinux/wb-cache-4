2500|$|A {{thermal fuse}} is {{often found in}} {{consumer}} equipment such as coffee makers, hair dryers or transformers powering small consumer electronics devices. [...] They contain a fusible, temperature-sensitive composition which holds a spring contact mechanism normally closed. When the <b>surrounding</b> <b>temperature</b> gets too high, the composition melts and allows the spring contact mechanism to break the circuit. The device {{can be used to}} prevent a fire in a hair dryer for example, by cutting off the power supply to the heater elements when the air flow is interrupted (e.g., the blower motor stops or the air intake becomes accidentally blocked). Thermal fuses are a 'one shot', non-resettable device which must be replaced once they have been activated (blown).|$|E
2500|$|After eating, snakes {{become dormant}} while {{the process of}} {{digestion}} takes place. Digestion is an intense activity, especially after consumption of large prey. In species that feed only sporadically, the entire intestine enters a reduced state between meals to conserve energy. The digestive system is then 'up-regulated' to full capacity within 48hours of prey consumption. Being ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), the <b>surrounding</b> <b>temperature</b> plays {{a large role in}} snake digestion. The ideal temperature for snakes to digest is [...] So much metabolic energy is involved in a snake's digestion that in the Mexican rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus), surface body temperature increases by as much as [...] during the digestive process. Because of this, a snake disturbed after having eaten recently will often regurgitate its prey to be able to escape the perceived threat. When undisturbed, the digestive process is highly efficient, with the snake's digestive enzymes dissolving and absorbing everything but the prey's hair (or feathers) and claws, which are excreted along with waste.|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, hybridization (or hybridisation) is {{a phenomenon}} in which single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules anneal to complementary DNA or RNA. Though a double-stranded DNA sequence is generally stable under physiological conditions, changing these conditions in the laboratory (generally by raising the <b>surrounding</b> <b>temperature)</b> will cause the molecules to separate into single strands.

40|$|The need is beboming {{more and}} more urgent for {{bearings}} operating at very high 	temperatures. But present-day liquid lubricants are temperature-limited owing to their 	characteristics，but solid lubricants are chemically more stable. So in pursuit of information 	concerning the performances of the angular contact type ball bearing operating in an electric 	furnace under the solid lubricant mist lubrication at high temperature，the frictional moment 	and temperature of bearing have been measured. 	The conclusion reached on the experimental results is as follows. The bearing can be 	run at <b>surrounding</b> <b>temperatures</b> up to 800 ℃ without appreciable damage. The smaller 	the particles of solid lubricants， the less frictional moments are obtained， but at very high 	temperatures the grading and consumption of solid lubricants have little influence on the 	frictional moment. Small change in frictional moment occurs in accordance with variation of 	surrounding temperature， but at high <b>surrounding</b> <b>temperatures</b> frictional moment is largely 	affected from bearing load. The moisture content of solid lubricants have little influence on 	the frictional moment. The cooling effect of air is somewhat remarkable...|$|R

5000|$|Thermoregulation is {{the ability}} of an {{organism}} to keep its body temperature within certain boundaries, even when the <b>surrounding</b> <b>temperature</b> is very different. A thermoconforming organism, by contrast, simply adopts the <b>surrounding</b> <b>temperature</b> as its own body temperature, thus avoiding the need for internal thermoregulation. The internal thermoregulation process is one aspect of homeostasis: a state of dynamic stability in an organism's internal conditions, maintained far from thermal equilibrium with its environment (the study of such processes in zoology has been called physiological ecology). If the body is unable to maintain a normal temperature and it increases significantly above normal, a condition known as hyperthermia occurs. For humans, this occurs when the body is exposed to constant temperatures of approximately , and with prolonged exposure (longer than a few hours) at this temperature and up to around [...] death is almost inevitable. Humans may also experience lethal hyperthermia when the wet bulb temperature is sustained above [...] for six hours. The opposite condition, when body temperature decreases below normal levels, is known as hypothermia. It results when the homeostatic control mechanisms of heat within the body malfunction, causing the body to lose heat faster than producing it. Normal body temperature is around , and hypothermia sets in when the core body temperature gets lower than [...]   Usually caused by prolonged exposure to cold temperatures, hypothermia is usually treated by methods that attempt to raise the body temperature back to a normal range.|$|E

The brain was found to maintain a warmer temperature when compared to carotid arterial blood supply. Researchers hypothesize three mechanisms for this finding.

They also speculate that there is an overall decrease in cerebral blood flow to the brain. Finally, they suggest that warm venous blood perfusion at the ophthalmic rete facilitates warming of cerebral blood that supplies the hypothalamus. Further research will need to be done to find how this occurs.|$|R

50|$|There {{are four}} avenues of heat loss: convection, conduction, radiation, and evaporation. If skin {{temperature}} {{is greater than}} that of the surroundings, the body can lose heat by radiation and conduction.

In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of heat is by evaporation. So, when the <b>surrounding</b> <b>temperature</b> is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise.
