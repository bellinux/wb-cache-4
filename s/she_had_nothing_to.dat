5|$|A month later, The Evil Queen appears; Rumpelstiltskin {{says that}} her {{deception}} with Belle failed, and that The Evil Queen will never be more powerful than him. She then tells him that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with Belle's actions (even though she prodded her, Belle's feelings were real) and informs him that upon Belle's return to her home, she had been shunned by her village for her association with Rumpelstiltskin and Gaston's disappearance and was subsequently imprisoned and tortured by her father. She eventually killed herself, leaping off the tower she was kept prisoner in. Rumpelstiltskin is devastated and replaces a treasured gold chalice with the chipped cup and weeps over his loss.|$|E

25|$|Starkweather {{chose to}} be extradited to Nebraska and he and Fugate arrived there in late January 1958. He {{believed}} that either state would have executed him. He was not aware that the Governor of Wyoming {{at the time was}} an opponent of the death penalty. Starkweather first claimed he had kidnapped Fugate and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with the murders; however, he changed his story several times, finally testifying at Fugate's trial that she was a willing participant. Fugate has always maintained that Starkweather was holding her hostage by threatening to kill her family, claiming she was unaware they were already dead. Judge Harry A. Spencer did not believe Fugate was held hostage by Starkweather, as she had had numerous opportunities to escape. When Starkweather was first brought in to the Nebraska penitentiary he stated that he believed that he was supposed to die and that if he was to be executed, then Fugate should be too.|$|E

[...] Hillary Clinton stated that while she was once photographed with the mother in a large group, she did not know her. Hillary Clinton was briefly deposed at the White House by the Independent Counsel regarding this matter on January 14, 1998. [...] (That same day, the same Office of the Independent Counsel staff were listening to taped conversations of Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky; the Lewinsky scandal was soon to break.) [...] In 1999, Clinton gave a sworn statement that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with Livingstone's hiring.

Various media outlets criticized Carey for continuing to heavily airbrush and [...] "recycle" [...] images of herself. In response, Carey expressed her discontent on Twitter, stating <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with the selection of the single's artwork and in turn asked for fans to send in their artwork designs as alternatives, ending the message with cause at this point IDKWTD!", an abbreviation of the song's title.|$|E

In her comments in the Letters, Bosse described with loyalty and affection Strindberg's protectiveness and his efforts to bring his young wife with him along his own spiritual paths; nevertheless, she chafed under these efforts, pointing out that she herself, at 22, was not even remotely finished with this world. Increasingly agoraphobic, Strindberg attempted to overcome his anxieties and allow his young wife the summer excursions she longed for. He planned sunny drives in hired victorias, but often the mystical [...] "Powers" [...] which governed him intervened. [...] A crisis came as early as June 1901, when Strindberg arranged, {{and then at the}} last moment called off, a honeymoon trip to Germany and Switzerland. [...] Bosse wrote in the Letters that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do but stay at home and choke down the tears while Strindberg attempted consolation by giving her a Baedeker [...] "to read a trip in".|$|E

However, I now think that designating Chelsea Manning as a Visiting Fellow was a mistake, for which I accept responsibility. … Therefore, we are withdrawing the invitation to her to serve as a Visiting Fellow—and the perceived honor that it implies to some people—while maintaining the invitation for her to spend a day at the Kennedy School and speak in the Forum. I apologize to her and to the many concerned people from whom I have heard today for not recognizing upfront the full implications of our original invitation." [...] When Elmendorf phoned Manning, a member of her support team challenged him to explain why Harvard was so concerned about the title [...] "visiting fellow."

500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Barbara Gordon, the Batwoman character and her sidekick Bat-Girl appeared in Batman-related publications, but were eventually removed at the direction of editor Julius Schwartz for being outdated and unrealistic. Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character in order to attract a female viewership to the Batman television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City's Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating [...] "Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the ’50s but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show."

500|$|The {{announcement}} dominated {{television and}} newspapers; Ferraro was besieged by {{questions regarding the}} finances as well as criticism for ethnic stereotyping. As she later wrote, [...] "I had created a monster." [...] Republicans saw her finances as a [...] "genderless" [...] issue that they could attack Ferraro with without creating a backlash, and some Mondale staffers thought Ferraro might {{have to leave the}} ticket. The Philadelphia Inquirer went even further in its investigations, seeking to link Zaccaro to organized crime figures, but most publishers avoided this topic and law enforcement officials did not treat the allegations with much seriousness. A week after her previous statement, Ferraro said Zaccaro had changed his mind and would indeed release his tax records, which was done on [...] The full statements included notice of payment of some $53,000 in back federal taxes that she owed due to what was described as an accountant's error. Ferraro said the statements proved overall that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> hide and that there had been no financial wrongdoing. The disclosures indicated that Ferraro and her husband were worth nearly $4million, had a full-time maid, and owned a boat and the two vacation homes. Much of their wealth was tied up in real estate rather than being disposable income, but the disclosures hurt Ferraro's image as a rags-to-riches story.|$|E
500|$|On {{the second}} day of the trial, Wood called Dr. Karl A. Parshall, Palsgraf's physician. He testified that he had treated Palsgraf {{occasionally}} for minor ailments before the incident at East New York, but on the day after found her shaken and bruised. He gave it as his opinion that Palsgraf's ills were caused by the accident. Grace Gerhardt, Herbert's wife, was the next witness. She testified to being hit by one of [...] "the two young Italian fellows" [...] who were racing to make the train, and how one made it unaided and the other only with the help of two LIRR employees. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> say about the scale or Palsgraf, having seen neither. Elizabeth and Lillian Palsgraf, the elder and younger daughter of the plaintiff, were next to testify and spoke of what they had seen. Wood indicated his only remaining witness was a neurologist, an expert witness, and McNamara for the LIRR moved to dismiss the case on the ground that Palsgraf had failed to present evidence of negligence, but Justice Humphrey denied it. The neurologist, Graeme M. Hammond of Manhattan, had examined Palsgraf two days before, observing her stammering, speaking only with difficulty. She told him of depression and headaches. He diagnosed her with traumatic hysteria, for which the explosion was a plausible cause, and said the hysteria was likely to continue as long as the litigation did, for only once it was resolved were the worries connected with it likely to vanish.|$|E

2500|$|In 1917, France {{had been}} badly {{shaken by the}} Great Mutinies of the French Army {{in the spring of}} 1917 {{following}} the failure of the Nivelle Offensive together with a huge strike wave, and at the time, many believed that France might simply collapse as a result of war exhaustion. In July 1917, a new government under Georges Clemenceau, aka [...] "le tigre", had come into power, utterly committed to winning the war. In this context, having one German spy for whom everything that went wrong with the war so far could be blamed was most convenient for the French government, making Mata Hari the perfect scapegoat, which explains why the case against her received maximum publicity in the French press, and led to her importance in the war being greatly exaggerated. The Canadian historian Wesley Wark stated in a 2014 interview that Mata Hari was never an important spy and just made a scapegoat for French military failures which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with, stating: [...] "They needed a scapegoat and she was a notable target for scapegoating". Likewise, the British historian Julie Wheelwright stated: [...] "She really did not pass on anything that you couldn’t find in the local newspapers in Spain". Wheelwright went on to describe Zelle as [...] "...an independent woman, a divorcee, a citizen of a neutral country, a courtesan and a dancer, which made her a perfect scapegoat for the French, who were then losing the war. She was kind of held up as an example of what might happen if your morals were too loose”.|$|E
