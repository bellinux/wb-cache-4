40|$|The {{effects of}} many {{protease}} inhibitor (PI) -selected mutations on the <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> individual PIs are unknown. We analyzed in vitro susceptibility test results on 2, 725 HIV- 1 protease isolates. More than 2, 400 isolates had {{been tested for}} <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and saquinavir; 2, 130 isolates had been tested for <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> lopinavir; 1, 644 isolates had been tested for <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> atazanavir; 1, 265 isolates had been tested for <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> tipranavir; and 642 isolates had been tested for <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> darunavir. We applied least-angle regression (LARS) to the 200 most common mutations in the data set and identified a set of 46 mutations associated with decreased PI susceptibility of which 40 were not polymorphic in the eight most common HIV- 1 group M subtypes. We then used least-squares regression to ascertain the relative contribution {{of each of these}} 46 mutations. The median number of mutations associated with decreased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> each PI was 28 (range, 19 to 32), and the median number of mutations associated with increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> each PI was 2. 5 (range, 1 to 8). Of the mutations with the greatest effect on PI susceptibility, I 84 AV was associated with decreased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> eight PIs; V 32 I, G 48 V, I 54 ALMSTV, V 82 F, and L 90 M were associated with decreased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> six to seven PIs; I 47 A, G 48 M, I 50 V, L 76 V, V 82 ST, and N 88 S were associated with decreased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> four to five PIs; and D 30 N, I 50 L, and V 82 AL were associated with decreased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> fewer than four PIs. This study underscores the greater impact of nonpolymorphic mutations compared with polymorphic mutations on decreased PI susceptibility and provides a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the effects of individual mutations on <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> the eight clinically available PIs...|$|R

Two resistance factors for three organophosphate insecticides (OPs), a resistant-type acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and a cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase (cytochrome P 450), {{have already been}} suggested to be involved within the Katsunuma population.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine previous experiences with injury and personality factors as predictors of rugby players' perceived <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> injury. In line with an individual-based approach, it was hypothesized that neuroticism and global self-esteem would be related <b>to</b> perceived <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> sport injuries over and above previous experiences with injuries. Rugby players (N = 235) were asked to report about previous experiences with injury and were administered measures of neuroticism and global selfesteem.

Analyses also supported that neuroticism and global self-esteem are of crucial importance in colouring perceptions of <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> sport-related injury, while statistically controlling for previous injuries. Of particular interest, neuroticism predicted perceived susceptibility, over and above global self-esteem and previous experiences with injury.

40|$|Cationic {{antimicrobial}} peptides (CAMPs), {{a component}} of the mammalian immune system, protect the host from bacterial infections. The roles of the Escherichia coli transcriptional regulators MarA, SoxS and Rob in <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> these peptides were examined. Overexpression of marA, either in an antibiotic-resistant marR mutant or from a plasmid, decreased bacterial <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> CAMPs. Overexpression of the soxS gene from a plasmid, which decreased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> antibiotics, unexpectedly caused no decrease in CAMP susceptibility; instead it produced increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> different CAMPs. Deletion or overexpression of rob had little effect on CAMP susceptibility. The marRAB operon was upregulated when E. coli was incubated in sublethal amounts of CAMPs polymyxin B, LL- 37 or human β-defensin- 1; however, this upregulation required Rob. Deletion of acrAB increased bacterial <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> polymyxin B, LL- 37 and human β-defensin- 1 peptides. Deletion of tolC yielded an even greater increase in <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> these peptides and also led <b>to</b> increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> human α-defensin- 2. Inhibition of cellular proton-motive force increased peptide susceptibility for wild-type and acrAB deletion strains; however, it decreased susceptibility of tolC mutants. These findings demonstrate that CAMPs are both inducers of marA-mediated drug resistance through interaction with Rob and also substrates for efflux in E. coli.

Very little is known about the genetic factors associated with <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> LRTI and so far studies have only analysed candidate gene loci. This work aimed to find genetic loci associated with <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> severe and mild LRTI. To analyse severe LRTI, a European cohort of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) sepsis patients was used. To analyse mild LRTI, patients attending primary care with a cough were recruited across Europe. Two important candidate genes for <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> severe and mild LRTI were studied. None of the four functional polymorphisms analysed in MBL 2 were associated individually or when combined with <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> LRTI or survival from severe LRTI. Rare homozygotes for rs 12252 in the IFITM 3 gene were found <b>to</b> associate with <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> mild and severe viral LRTI, particularly influenza infection. Using a combination of genome-wide and candidate gene methods, 93 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen to genotype and analyse for <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> mild LRTI. A gene region containing the MPHOSPH 8, TPTE 2, PSPC 1 and ZMYM 5 genes was found <b>to</b> associate with <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> rhinovirus infection. A functional promoter SNP in the IL 6 gene and a gene region containing the SAP 18, MRP 63 and SKA 3 genes were associated with <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> mild LRTI in smokers.

Methods: For this evaluation we used 503 Enterobacteriaceae from 18 Dutch hospitals and 21 isolates previously confirmed to be pAmpC positive. All isolates were divided into three groups: isolates with 1) reduced <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime and/ or cefotaxime; 2) reduced <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> cefoxitin; 3) reduced <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime combined with reduced <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> cefoxitin. Two disk-based tests, with cloxacillin or boronic acid as inhibitor, and Etest with cefotetan-cefotetan/cloxacillin were used for phenotypic AmpC confirmation. Finally, presence of pAmpC genes was tested by multiplex and singleplex PCR. Results: We identified 13 pAmpC producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates among the 503 isolates (2. 6 %) : 9 CMY- 2, 3 DHA- 1 and 1 ACC- 1 type in E. coli isolates. The sensitivity and specificity of reduced <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime in combination with cefoxitin was 97 % (33 / 34) and 90 % (289 / 322) respectively.
