40|$|This study {{examined}} the growth {{and development of the}} pancreas in naturally <b>suckled</b> <b>piglets</b> during the first 3 postnatal days and the effects of colostrum feeding on the pancreatic development. The results showed that in naturally <b>suckled</b> <b>piglets,</b> the absolute weight of the pancreas increased 51 % during the first day and 86 % by the 3 rd day, and the relative weight per unit body weight increased 37 % during the first day and 47 % by the 3 rd day. Associated with the rapid weight gain was a significant increase in pancreatic DNA content and enlargement of pancreatic exocrine acinar units, the latter apparently resulted from an increase in number rather than size of acinar cells. It was further shown that the rapid pancreatic growth was related to colostrum ingestion as significant pancreatic weight gain was observed in piglets bottle-fed porcine colostrum or trypsinized porcine colostrum but not in piglets bottle-fed 5 % lactose solution. Trypsinized porcine colostrum was apparently more potent than native porcine colostrum in stimulating pancreatic growth in newborn pigs. It is speculated that colostrum-borne growth factors and/or postnatal surge of gut hormones following onset of oral feeding are the major factors responsible for the rapid postnatal pancreatic growth in newborns. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Objective This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to characterize the behaviors and the body weight of <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> in different social environments. Methods Two groups of sows and <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> housed either in individual farrowing crates in separate pens (1. 8 × 2. 4 m, the control group) or in groups of three sows with their piglets in farrowing crates in a large common enclosure (5. 4 × 2. 2 m, the treatment group) were observed with the aid of video technology for 9 consecutive hours on days 1, 2, and 3, after mixing. Results Suckling, agonistic, and elimination behaviors of <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> were significantly higher in the control group than in the treatment group. Inactive behavior was higher in the treatment group than in the control group. Most {{of the effects of the}} social environment on the <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> seem to be the result of large reductions in behaviors and body weight for piglets switching from high activity to low activity. Moreover, suckling behavior and birth body weight were highly correlated with body weight at the end of the test. Conclusion The social environment that resulted from mixing, thus, had significant effects on the behavior and body weight of <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets,</b> and behavioral characteristics, therefore, should be considered when making improvements to the husbandry and care methods used in swine production...|$|E

The {{objective of the}} present study was to investigate the development of muscle IL- 15 expression in <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> and in early weaning piglets (day 14) at each level, that is, mRNA, protein, and secretion. Eight litters (eight piglets per litter) of newborn healthy piglets (Large × White × Landrace) with a similar initial weight (1618. 0  ±  140. 1 g) were chosen and divided into two groups. Group one used <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> that were killed, respectively, at days 1, 7, 14, 21, and group two used early (day 14) weaning piglets that were killed respectively, at days 15, 17, 19, 21. In group one, IL- 15 gene expression levels increased significantly (P    0. 05) among piglets at other ages. These findings indicated that increased IL- 15 mRNA expression did not result in a corresponding increase of its protein expression. In group two, which used early weaning piglets from days 15 – 19, IL- 15 mRNA and protein expression levels increased constantly (P    0. 05) compared with <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> at day 14 of age. However, IL- 15 protein expression levels in early weaning piglets at day 21 of age dropped significantly (P <  0. 05) to the levels as <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> at day 21 of age, while body weight increased (P <  0. 05) markedly to the levels as <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> at day 21 of age. In both groups, the serum IL- 15 levels of piglets decreased significantly (P <  0. 01) over time. Taken together, our results indicate that IL- 15 expression differs in <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> and in weaning piglets.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of chelated iron supplementation on gestating and lactating sows and on their suckling and weaned piglets. Reproductive traits, piglet performance, hematological parameters, and the iron concentrations in colostrum, milk, and stillborn livers were measured. Ninety-six sows were subjected to one of three treatment groups. Group T 1 comprised pregnant and lactating sows treated with diets supplemented with inorganic iron (551 mg Fe/kg) and <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> administered 200 mg of injectable iron dextran. Group T 2 was the same as T 1, except that sows after 84 days of gestation, lactating sows, and <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> were fed a diet supplemented with 150 mg Fe/kg of chelated iron, and <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> were administered injectable iron dextran. Group T 3 was the same as T 2 but without injectable iron dextran for <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets.</b> During the nursery phase, all of the weaned piglets were penned with their original groups or treatments and received isonutritive and isocaloric feeds. Piglets from the T 2 and T 3 groups also received an additional 150 mg Fe/kg of chelated iron via their feed. There were no differences among the treatments for reproductive traits or the iron concentrations in the colostrum, milk, or liver. The piglets that did not receive the injectable iron dextran showed the poorest performance during the pre-and post-weaning phases and showed the poorest hematological parameters of the <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets.</b> The chelated iron supplementation is insufficient to meet piglet demand.

We report here the complete genome sequence of SD-M. This sequence will promote {{a better understanding of}} the molecular pathogenesis of PEDV. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a member of theAlphacoronavirus genus in the family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus (11). PEDV infection is an acute and highly contagious enteric dis-ease characterized by severe enteritis, vomiting, watery diar-rhea, and a high mortality rate in swine (10, 11). Emerging in the 1980 s, the disease has become more serious and resulted in severe economic losses in China, and the complete genome sequences of many wild-type PEDV strains have been deter-mined (1 – 7).

40|$|Transcriptome {{analyses}} were conducted on the ileal mucosa of 14 - 35 day-old piglets to investigate postnatal gut development during suckling and post-weaning. The transcriptome profiles of 14 day-old <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> showed a considerably higher number of differentially expressed genes than did those of 21, 28 and 35 day olds, indicating an intensive gut development during the first 14 - 21 postnatal days. In addition, the analysis of biological pathways indicated that Chemotaxis Leucocyte chemotaxis was the most significantly affected pathway in <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> between 14 and 21 days of age. Weaning negatively affected pathways associated with acquired immunity, but positively affected those associated with innate immunity. Interestingly, pathway Chemotaxis Leucocyte chemotaxis was found positively affected when comparing 14 and 21 day-old <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets,</b> but negatively affected in 28 day-old piglets weaned at 21 days of age, when compared with 28 day-old <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets.</b> Genes CXCL 13, SLA-DOA (MHC class II), ICAM 1, VAV 1 and VCAM 1 {{were involved in the}} pathway Chemotaxis Leukocyte chemotaxis and they were found to significantly change between 14 and 21 day-old <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets,</b> and between groups of suckling and weaned piglets. The expression of these genes significantly declined after weaning at 14, 21 and 28 days of age. This decline indicated that CXCL 13, SLA-DOA, ICAM 1, VAV 1 and VCAM 1 may be involved in the development of Peyer’s patches because lower gene expression clearly corresponded with smaller areas of Peyer’s patches in the ileal mucosa of piglets. Moreover, weaning piglets prior to a period of intensive gut development i. e., 14 days of age, caused significant adverse effects on the size of Peyer’s patches, which were not reverted even 14 days post-weaning...|$|E

Gastrointestinal tissue samples were collected from newborn unsuckled piglets and <b>suckling</b> <b>piglets</b> of different ages. The localization and quantification of TGF-β receptors along the gastrointestinal tract were performed by immunohistochemical and Western blot analyses.

40|$|Worldwide {{infectious}} diarrhoea, mainly {{caused by}} rotavirus and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), accounts for {{a large part of}} deaths in children. ETEC is also the main cause of traveller's diarrhoea. Probiotics are promising for prevention and treatment of diarrhoea, but there is insufficient evidence to support the use of any specific probiotic or probiotics in general. Because of the sensitivity of <b>suckling</b> and weaned <b>piglets</b> for ETEC, piglets are a good model for infectious diarrhoea in infants and traveller's diarrhoea. Just as in human the efficacy of probiotics in diminishing diarrhoea and improving growth in <b>suckling</b> and weaned <b>piglets</b> is not uniform. A piglet model of infectious diarrhoea provides access to intestinal compartments that are not easily accessible in infants. In an in situ piglet model of secretory diarrhoea, the functional physiological response to ETEC and the concomitant host genome response to ETEC and probiotics may be tested.

From weaning to 70 d of age, all animals received ad libitum the same standard diet. Growth rates were higher (P< 0 · 05) in HP piglets than in AP piglets during formula feeding and remained higher (P< 0 · 05) only in HP male pigs thereafter. No difference in feed consumption was detected between groups during the periods examined. Carcass lipid content and the relative weight of perirenal adipose tissue did not differ between the AP and HP pigs. Whereas plasma leptin concentration was higher (P< 0 · 05) in HP pigs than in AP pigs with a marked difference in SW pigs, plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I concentration and expression of IGF system genes were not affected by the diets.

Piglets were housed with the sows in individual farrowing pens, and had access to maternal milk until weaning, at 23 days of age. Behaviours of six focal piglets per pen were scored at 6, 16 and 21 days of age. All piglets were individually weighed at 5, 15 and 20 days of age and feed intake was measured daily at the pen level.

Also, bacterial count was significantly lower in group 3 treated with the antiseptic than in group 2 treated with water alone (p< 0. 01). Accordingly, sow teat sanitation is a potential prophylactic measure during the <b>piglet</b> <b>suckling</b> period as it significantly decreased bacterial count on sow teats, thus reducing the risk of bacterial invasion of the piglet alimentary system.

40|$|Pseudorabies (PR) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} and fatal viral disease in swine. The clinical symptoms and mortality depend on the age of affected swine. However, PR infection is more often to become imperceptible in growing to finishing pigs but will induce high mortality in <b>suckling</b> and weaning <b>piglets</b> when antibody titer is impairment. For controlling this disease, vaccination of the pregnant sows can mount good protective maternal antibody to prevent <b>suckling</b> and weaning <b>piglets</b> from PR infection. In addition, Progressive atrophic rhinitis (PAR) is an important respiratory disease and causes the snout deformation, turbinate atrophy, septum deviation, and growth retardation in swine. PAR can affect all ages of swine but piglets are most susceptible. Both diseases and the following complication of porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) will induce tremendously economic loss on production in a pig farm. Multivalent vaccine is a good strategy for immunization and {{can be applied to}} reduce the stress and the cost of management during vaccination. The purpose of this project is to develop the bivalent of gE(-) PR/PAR of recombinant subunit PMT vaccine, and test its efficacy and safety in mice, rabbits, swine and field trials in order to control PR and PAR for decreasing the diseases outbreak in pig farms. 豬假性狂犬病(Pseudorabies; PR) 為高傳染性及高致死性的疾病,特別若爆發於哺乳仔豬及離乳幼豬之時期,感染後的死亡率甚至可高達 100 %. 此外,豬進行性萎縮性鼻炎(progressive atrophic rhinitis; PAR) 為豬隻重要呼吸道疾病,感染豬隻之鼻黏膜會急速壞死且造成鼻甲骨萎縮,導致呼吸系統第一道防禦機制嚴重受損,因而其他病原十分容易長驅直入,為豬隻罹患呼吸道綜合感染症(procine respiratory disease complex; PRDC) 之主因. 本計畫為預防此二種疾病發生,除可減少因PR或AR本身所造成之直接經濟損失外,亦可降低所繼發各種PRDC的發生,並大幅降低豬隻因呼吸道疾病死亡的損失及因治療或預防添加藥物所需的成本. 豬假性狂犬病與萎縮性鼻炎具有相同的免疫適期,均需藉由免疫懷孕母豬產生的移行抗體以保護仔豬免於早期之感染. 本計畫的主要目的即先以小白鼠進行免疫攻毒之安全性試驗及田間母豬隻免疫試驗,進行PR與PAR雙價疫苗免疫效力的評估. 而最終則是開發新一代的gE基因缺損PR與PAR重組次單位PMT毒素雙價疫苗,並藉由本實驗能成功移轉高安全、高效率及成本低廉並具競爭之PR與PAR雙價疫苗,以減少養豬業之經濟損失...|$|R
