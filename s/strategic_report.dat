The third and final conference was held on 28-30 June 2010 in Torino, Italy, under the title of Universities & Cyberspace: Reshaping Knowledge Institutions for the Networked Age. In several sessions, workshops and keynote speeches, more than 200 attendees {{from all over the world}} discussed such issues as: What can universities contribute to the future of the internet? How can our educational institutions promote ideals of free exchange of information yet cope with the complex intellectual property challenges presented by the Net? Video-recordings, papers and other material related to the conference are fully available on the COMMUNIA website.

5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 2005, Public Act 094-0510 called for the {{creation}} of a new Regional Planning Board to merge operations of the Chicago Area Transportation Study (CATS) and the Northeastern Illinois Planning Commission (NIPC). [...] For 50 years, CATS had been responsible for regional transportation planning as the federally designated Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Chicago region, and over the same period, NIPC was responsible for regional land-use planning. In 2006, the new organization was named the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning and submitted a legislatively mandated <b>strategic</b> <b>report</b> to the Governor and General Assembly. [...] Development of the comprehensive regional plan began in September 2007, with development of a regional vision. It continued through two years of research that culminated in 2009 with extensive public outreach that coincided with the centennial of Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. The resulting [...] "preferred regional scenario" [...] published in January 2010 preceded release of the draft plan for comment in May 2010. And the final GO TO 2040 plan was adopted unanimously by leaders from across the seven counties on October 13, 2010, at which point the agency's efforts shifted to implementation of the plan. [...] In 2016, CMAP began development of a successor plan called ON TO 2050, which is scheduled for adoption in October 2018.|$|E
40|$|The <b>strategic</b> <b>report</b> is {{the latest}} {{iteration}} of non-financial reporting in the UK. This project empirically analyses the practical implications and relevance of {{the production of a}} <b>strategic</b> <b>report</b> for shareholders and especially other stakeholders (e. g. employees, customers, suppliers, environmental agencies, social, community, and human rights bodies). The strategic reports of the FTSE 100 companies from 2015 and 2016 are scrutinised, using a methodology involving compliance coding. This study is especially significant as the practical implications and relevance of the production of a <b>strategic</b> <b>report</b> by company directors have not been discussed in depth in prior literature. This paper fills this gap by first providing empirical evidence on compliance with the relevant statutory provisions. It sheds light on the manner in which companies consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in decision-making {{and the extent to which}} disclosure represents an effective strategy for engaging stakeholders in that process. It also evaluates the type and quality of information transferred from the company to stakeholders in the form of the <b>strategic</b> <b>report.</b> This first systematic review of strategic reporting in the UK carries international implications due to the high international shareholder base in FTSE 100 companies...|$|E

Since then, several initiatives have been taken in several parts of Switzer-land to create geoparks. A first small geopark, Il Parco delle Gole della Breggia, was established in 2001 in the Canton of Tessin within a valley eroded in a stratigraphic cut repre-senting more than 80 million years of Earth History (Jurassic-Present).
