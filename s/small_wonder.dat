500|$|The {{character}} of Victor {{has been used}} as a spokesperson for the Canadian discount store Zellers and appeared in an advert for it. The commercials aired in November 1998. In the adverts, Victor breaks the proverbial fourth wall, and begins speaking to the Zellers shopper on the other side of the television screen, praising her admirable combination of style and thrift. He steps closer and squashes his nose against the camera lens. According to the website StrategyOnline, the promotional ad campaign for Zellers featuring Victor proved to be the most popular installment to date as of May 1999; the staff of StrategyOnline wrote that the campaign [...] "has garnered considerable praise in the marketing community – and <b>small</b> <b>wonder.</b> Not only does it perform the considerable task of balancing an affordability message with strong branding, it does so in a category seldom noted for the quality of strategic thinking that goes into its advertising." ...|$|E

[...] In a simultaneous review of all four MacFarlane programs, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C- stating, [...] "Turning Miley Cyrus into a <b>Small</b> <b>Wonder</b> parody was fitfully amusing, {{but the rest of the}} Hannah Montana material was ridiculously non-specific, filled with the kinds of jokes everyone made about Cyrus a few years ago." [...] VanDerWerff praised the action sequence at the end {{of the episode}}, however, calling it [...] "high quality stuff for the show."

500|$|On 22 April 1978, Easy Cure {{played their}} last gig at the Montefiore Institute Hall (in the Three Bridges {{neighbourhood}} of Crawley) before guitarist Porl Thompson was {{dropped from the}} lineup because his lead guitar style was at odds with Smith's growing preference for minimalist songwriting; the remaining trio were soon renamed [...] "The Cure" [...] by Smith. Later that month, the band recorded their first sessions as a trio at Chestnut Studios in Sussex, which were distributed as a demo tape to a dozen major record labels. The demo {{found its way to}} Polydor Records scout Chris Parry, who signed the Cure to his newly formed Fiction label—distributed by Polydor—in September 1978. The Cure released their debut single [...] "Killing an Arab" [...] in December 1978 on the <b>Small</b> <b>Wonder</b> label as a stopgap until Fiction finalised distribution arrangements with Polydor. [...] "Killing an Arab" [...] garnered both acclaim and controversy: while the single's provocative title led to accusations of racism, the song is actually based on French existentialist Albert Camus's novel The Stranger. The band placed a sticker label that denied the racist connotations on the single's 1979 reissue on Fiction. An early NME article on the band wrote that the Cure [...] "are like a breath of fresh suburban air on the capital's smog-ridden pub-and-club circuit", and noted, [...] "With a John Peel session and more extensive London gigging on their immediate agenda, {{it remains to be seen}} whether the Cure can retain their refreshing joie de vivre." ...|$|E

No Neptunes and Dre here, but plenty of low frequency throbbing and high-pitched glitch noises. Eve doesn’t reach for the dance floor often, but this is hip-hop that acknowledges EDM and dub-step.
