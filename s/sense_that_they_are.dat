At first these partial drives function independently (i.e. the polymorphous perversity of children), {{it is only in}} puberty that they become organized {{under the aegis of the}} genital organs. Lacan accepts the partial nature of drives, but 1) rejects the notion that partial drives can ever attain any complete organization: the primacy of the genital zone, if achieved, is always precarious; and 2) he argues that drives are partial in that they only represent sexuality partially not in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> a part of the whole.

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{circular}} migration {{has been described}} as a triple-win scenario, providing benefits for the host country, the home country, and the migrants themselves. Developed countries allow migrants to enter in order to fill labor shortages, but with the understanding that the settlement is not permanent, distinguishing it from immigration. Developing countries benefit in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not truly losing their skilled migrants, as these workers will return after a period of time to continue working. The migrants themselves benefit through the skills they learn abroad, as well as their increase in wages. The form of benefits in this triple-win discourse often take three forms: financial capital, human capital, and social capital. Circularity is the most beneficial whenever migrants move voluntary between locations in the pursuit of different interests, as well as when migrants have positive experiences while abroad, including financial and educational success.|$|E
25|$|If {{a problem}} X is in C and hard for C, then X {{is said to}} be {{complete}} for C. This means that X is the hardest problem in C. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C.) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P=NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π2, to another problem, Π1, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π1. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π1 would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π2. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an NP-complete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P=NP.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2005 National Indigenous Languages Survey (NILS), at {{the time}} the Australian {{continent}} was colonised, there were around 250 different Indigenous languages, with the larger language groups each having up to 100 related dialects. Some of these languages were only ever spoken by perhaps 50 to 100 people. Indigenous languages are divided into language groups with from ten to twenty-four language families identified. It is currently estimated that up to 145 Indigenous languages remain in use, of which fewer than 20 are considered to be strong in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> still spoken by all age groups.

25|$|There is a {{wide array}} of {{linguistic}} forms in the Beowulf manuscript. It is this fact that leads some scholars to believe that Beowulf has endured a long and complicated transmission through all the main dialect areas. The poem retains a complicated mix of the following dialectical forms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Early West Saxon, Kentish and Late West Saxon. There are in Beowulf more than 3100 distinct words, and almost 1300 occur exclusively, or almost exclusively, in this poem and in the other poetical texts. Considerably {{more than one-third of the}} total vocabulary is alien from ordinary prose use. There are, in round numbers, three hundred and sixty uncompounded verbs in Beowulf, and forty of them are poetical words in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> unrecorded or rare in the existing prose writings. One hundred and fifty more occur with the prefix ge- (reckoning a few found only in the past-participle), but of these one hundred occur also as simple verbs, and the prefix is employed to render a shade of meaning which was perfectly known and thoroughly familiar except in the latest Anglo-Saxon period. The nouns number sixteen hundred. Seven hundred of them, including those formed with prefixes, of which fifty (or considerably more than half) have ge-, are simple nouns, at the highest reckoning not more than one-fourth is absent in prose. That this is due in some degree to accident is clear from the character of the words, and from the fact that several reappear and are common after the Norman Conquest.|$|E

Lichtenstein's version of the scene eliminates everything but the sea and a few body parts of the subject: her head, shoulder and hand, which are barely above the water.

An orchestral diatonic cluster occurs also in the representation of chaos in the opening of Jean-Féry Rebel's 1737–38 ballet [...] From the next century-and-a-half, a few more examples have been identified, mostly {{no more than a}} fleeting instance of the form, for example in the concluding two bars of the “Loure” from J.S.Bach’s French Suite No.5, BWV816:, or the delicious collisions that result from the interaction of multiple lines [...] "locked together in suspensions" [...] in Bach’s Musical Offering: [...] However, in the Keyboard Sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757), we find a more daring and idiosyncratic use of tone clusters.

Kit Steinkellner of HelloGiggles wrote that Aurora continued the [...] "trend of passive heroines who wait around for magic to change their lives," [...] a recurring theme shared by Disney princesses who were introduced both during and prior to the 1950s. Sonia Saraiya of Nerve dubbed Aurora [...] "the apex" [...] of [...] "women who made no choices for themselves". Writing for MTV, Lauren Vino felt that the character [...] "followed the basic princess tenants of loving animals and sleeping in makeup", while About.com's David Nusair wrote that Aurora followed the [...] "pattern of kind yet helpless princesses", similar to Snow White and Cinderella. Mary Grace Garis of Bustle observed that the original trio [...] "seek out marriage as both their endgame and salvation", elaborating, [...] "It's literally their own means of escape, and their only final objective." [...] However, Aurora's dreams and fantasies are different in the <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> drawn from loneliness and isolation; the character essentially longs [...] "for human connections beyond her three fairy surrogate mothers." [...] The Walt Disney Family Museum volunteer Lucas O. Seastrom agreed that Aurora is more [...] "self-confident" [...] and [...] "more of repose than the usual naiveté of Disney heroines." [...] Observing that Aurora's actions are influenced by the decisions and opinions of those around her, while most of the film's action involves Prince Phillip, Steinkellner joked that the character is so passive that she remains asleep during the film's climax. Dubbing her [...] "a girl of reaction," [...] nerdology.org's Lisa Kaye Cunningham felt that Aurora's [...] "little screen time makes [...] difficult to classify as a feminist, but her single active decision shows great promise in the evolution of feminist Disney princesses," [...] despite the fact that her agency is constantly undermined by other characters.
