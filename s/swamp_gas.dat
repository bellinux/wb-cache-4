As such it embodies contemporary conflicts between science and scripture, superstition and belief: Swan criticises the ignorance that characterised spontaneously combusted <b>swamp</b> <b>gases</b> as walking spirits and rejects tales of many fantastic creatures but accepts the existence of fish with feet and mermaids among the 'strange fish' of the waters. The work, first published in 1635, went through four editions to 1670 (in some of which revisions Swan changed his mind on 'certain not insignificant matters') and was reprinted in 1698, but lost favour in the more exacting scientific critical climate of the eighteenth century...|$|R
5000|$|Although the eudiometer's {{invention}} {{is usually}} credited to Marsilio Landriani, {{it was truly}} pioneered by Count Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), an Italian physicist who {{is well known for}} his contributions to the electric battery and electricity. Aside from its laboratory function, the eudiometer is also known for its part in the [...] "Volta pistol". Volta invented this instrument in 1777 for the purpose of testing the [...] "goodness" [...] of air, analyzing the flammability of gases, or to demonstrate the chemical effects of electricity. Volta's Pistol had a long glass tube that was closed at the top, like a eudiometer. Two electrodes were fed through the tube and produced a spark gap inside the tube. Volta's initial use of this instrument concerned the study of <b>swamp</b> <b>gases</b> in particular. Volta's pistol was filled with oxygen and another gas. The homogeneous mixture was taped shut with a cork. A spark could be introduced into the gas chamber by electrodes, and possibly catalyze a reaction by static electricity, using Volta's electrophorus. If the gases were flammable, they would explode, and increase the pressure within the gas chamber. This pressure would be too great and eventually cause the cork to become airborne. Volta's pistol was made with either glass or brass, however due to the electricity the glass was vulnerable to exploding. Volta's extensive studies on measuring and creating high levels of electric currents caused the electrical unit, the volt, to be named after him.|$|R

There has been continuous deterioration of ambient air and human health with the in-crease in population, industrialization and urbanization. Emission of toxic pollutants such as particulate matter (PM 2. 5, PM 10 & TSP) and green house gases like ozone (O 3), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), Nitrous oxide (NO 2) etc. have further aggravated this problem. Methane from <b>swamps,</b> livestock <b>gases,</b> cholorofluorocarbons (CFCs) used in re-frigerants and aerosol propellants has further complicated the problem of deteriorating the earth’s ozone layer. There is a considerable risk to human health from these pollut-ants [1 - 7] and adequate information from the towns/cities of developing countries, where public health is a great con-cern, is required.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that many galaxies have nuclear star clusters (NCs) whose total masses correlate with the velocity dispersion σ {{of the galaxy}} spheroid in a very similar way to the well-known supermassive black hole (SMBH) M−σ relation. Previous theoretical work suggested that both correlations {{can be explained by}} a momentum feedback argument. Observations further show that most known NCs have masses ≲ 108 M⊙, while SMBHs frequently have measured masses ≳ 108 M⊙, which remained unexplained in earlier treatments. We suggest here that this changeover reflects a competition between the SMBH and nuclear clusters in the feedback they produce. When one of the massive objects reaches its limiting M−σ value, it drives the gas away and hence cuts off its own mass and also the mass of the ‘competitor’. The latter is then underweight with respect to the expected M−σ mass. More specifically, we find that the bulge dynamical time-scale is a steeply rising function of velocity dispersion, and that the NC–SMBH changeover occurs where the dynamical time is about equal to the Salpeter time. We propose that SMBHs, growing on the Salpeter time-scale, are unable to reach their M−σ mass quickly enough in small bulges. The central regions of these bulges are <b>swamped</b> with <b>gas</b> which fragments into stars, creating the nuclear clusters. The latter then limit their own growth by the feedback they produce, settling on their (offset) M−σ relation. The SMBH in such bulges should be underweight as their growth is curtailed before they reach the M−σ mass. In large bulges, on the other hand, the SMBH catches up quickly enough to settle on its M−σ relation. Nuclear star clusters may also exist in such bulges but they should be underweight with respect to their M−σ sequence. Peer-reviewedPublisher Version 847...|$|R
