40|$|Deletion of {{a subset}} of the D 4 Z 4 macrosatellite repeats in the subtelomeric region of {{chromosome}} 4 q causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) when occurring on a specific haplotype of 4 qter (4 qA 161). Several genes have been examined as candidates for causing FSHD, including the DUX 4 homeobox gene in the D 4 Z 4 repeat, but none have been definitively shown to cause the disease, nor has the full extent of transcripts from the D 4 Z 4 region been carefully characterized. Using strand-specific RTâ€“PCR, we have identified several sense and antisense transcripts originating from the 4 q D 4 Z 4 units in wild-type and FSHD muscle cells. Consistent with prior reports, we find that the DUX 4 transcript from the last (most telomeric) D 4 Z 4 unit is polyadenylated and has two introns in its 3 -prime untranslated region. In addition, we show that this transcript generates (i) small si/miRNA-sized fragments, (ii) uncapped, polyadenylated 3 -prime fragments that encode the conserved C-terminal portion of DUX 4 and (iii) capped and polyadenylated mRNAs that contain the double-homeobox domain of DUX 4 but <b>splice-out</b> the C-terminal portion. Transfection studies demonstrate that translation initiation at an internal methionine can produce the C-terminal polypeptide and developmental studies show that this peptide inhibits myogenesis at a step between MyoD transcription and the activation of MyoD target genes. Together, we have identified new sense and anti-sense RNA transcripts, novel mRNAs and mi/siRNA-sized RNA fragments generated from the D 4 Z 4 units that are new candidates for the pathophysiology of FSHD...|$|E
