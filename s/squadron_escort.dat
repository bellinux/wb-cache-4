50|$|The {{organization}} of the Navy has changed incrementally over time. During World War II administrative organization for many ship types included divisions, for example Battleship Divisions (abbreviated BatDivs), Cruiser Divisions, Destroyer Divisions, or Escort Divisions (CortDivs), usually composed of two ships, often {{members of the same}} class. These made up squadrons (e.g. Battle Squadron, Cruiser <b>Squadron,</b> <b>Escort</b> Squadron (CortRon) etc.) of several divisions. Yet the exigencies of World War II forced the creation of the task force system where ships no longer fought solely as part of same-type divisions or squadrons. This was gradually reflected in administrative arrangements; by the 1970s, formations such as Cruiser-Destroyer Groups (CruDesGrus) came into existence.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 18th-century, the {{subsequent}} new village owners Jordanów, an affluent Polish burgher family from Kraków, started a strong local persecution of Protestants. In response, an exodus resulted, 64 families and 360 individual refugees with their belongings, crossed north-west from Kozy {{over the border}} at Dzieditz (Czechowice-Dziedzice) into Prussia controlled Upper Silesia, {{on the night of}} 25 April 1770, and there founded the village Anhalt (Holdynow/Hołdunów) near Pleß (Pszczyna). The escape route was secured by a Prussian Army cuirassier cavalry <b>squadron</b> <b>escort</b> under General Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz; the resettlement was supported by the King of Prussia, Frederick the Great, who asked only whether the refugees from Poland understood German. Thus came a 200-year end in the history of evangelicalism in Kozy. Only a few, undecided inhabitants, remained in Kozy, and were subjected to further reprisals by the Jordanów landowners.|$|E

No.6 Squadron continued to be based at Richmond, though detachments were made to other airstrips along the east coast when the <b>squadron</b> <b>escorted</b> troop convoys.
