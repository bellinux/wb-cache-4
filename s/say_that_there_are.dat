25|$|Supporters of {{the theory}} include sexual {{behavior}} scientists J.

Under the theory, homosexual transsexuals are predicted to begin transitioning earlier in life, generally before turning 30, which accounts for their supposedly better adjustment. They are also more likely to come from poorer, non-white or immigrant backgrounds, have lower IQs, as well as be by definition exclusively attracted to men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are either attracted to women, exclusively or not, or asexual. They are also said under the theory to display more fetishistic or otherwise paraphilic arousal.|$|E

2500|$|During the 15th century {{opinion was}} more evenly split {{as to the}} nature of the Pyramids. [...] An {{anonymous}} traveler in 1420 speaks of going [...] "to see the most marvelous fourteen granaries of Pharaoh, five or six miles distant from Cairo." [...] He continues, [...] "you must cross the river Nile that flows from the Earthly Paradise ... and from the top [...] there is a good view of the very large city of Cairo. [...] But there, around these granaries, there is such a great colony of rats that it sometimes seems as if they cover the entire ground." [...] In 1436 the Spaniard Pero Tafur visited and left a rather fanciful account: [...] "We went to see the Granaries of Joseph, which are three leagues from the mouth of the river, in the desert. Although they <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many more further inland, there are only three here, two great ones, and one lesser one. They are diamond shaped, with the apex raised, and they must be much higher than the Great Tower at Seville. As one enters through the door there is a wall joined to another, making a circular stairway which reaches to the top, with many windows. And the beasts, when they are laden, climb up and are unloaded through those windows, and so they fill the granaries to the top. [...] Certainly I never thought that there was such a great building in the world to-day, nor have I seen the like before or since." [...] Another curious interpretation was offered by Georges Lengherand, Mayor of Mons, who visited in 1486: [...] "These granaries are very marvelous buildings and there used to be fourteen and now there are only six or seven. [...] It is impossible to enter, and they are all of dressed stone ... and are in the manner of a hill ... And while we were there, we found four wolves asleep on the stones ... And around these granaries are small little chambers, several cut into the rock; I do not know what could be their use, unless at the time theses granaries were in existence there were guards in these little chambers." [...] The German traveler Arnold von Harff paid a visit in 1497 and left a fairly objective report: [...] "We went across the Nile to these three Kassa Pharaonis. [...] As we approached near these three towers we saw that they were very strange buildings ... We climbed up outside for three full hours to the top, which is about two roods square. [...] From there we saw far out over the whole of the land of Egypt, and over the country to Alexandria and the western sea ... They say that King Pharaoh caused the towers to be built during the lean years, and kept them full of corn. [...] That is why they are called the Kassa Pharaonis. [...] But I could find no entrance.
