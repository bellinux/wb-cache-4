40|$|An {{improved}} {{knowledge of}} nuclear fuel can {{be gained from}} a better description of atomic-scale processes such as point defects behaviour under irradiation. In these perspectives, computer simulation techniques involving semi-empirical potentials can {{play a major role}} as they allow studying some of these processes separately. The range of applicability in <b>static</b> <b>calculations</b> of the available interatomic potentials for UO 2 has been previously assessed by the authors. This study complements the <b>static</b> <b>calculations</b> by including dynamical simulations of the temperature evolution of different elastic properties (lattice parameter, specific heat, bulk modulus and Gruneisen parameter) and by calculations of bulk melting temperature.

40|$|The photodynamics {{along the}} main decay paths of thymine after {{excitation}} to the lowest pi,pi* state have been studied with MS-CASPT 2 calculations and semiclassical CASSCF dynamics calculations including a surface hopping algorithm. The <b>static</b> <b>calculations</b> show {{that there are two}} decay paths from the Franck-Condon structure that lead to a conical intersection with the ground state. The first path goes directly to the intersection, while the second one is indirect and involves a minimum of the pi,pi* state, a small barrier, and a crossing between the pi,pi* and n,pi* states. From the <b>static</b> <b>calculations,</b> both paths have similar slopes. The dynamics calculations along the indirect path show that, after the barrier, part of the trajectories are funneled to the intersection with the ground state, where they are efficiently quenched to the ground state. The remaining trajectories populate the n,pi* state. They are also quenched to the ground state in less than 1 ps, but the <b>static</b> <b>calculations</b> show that the decay rate of the n,pi* state is largely overestimated at the CASSCF level used for the dynamics, Overall, these results suggest that both direct and indirect paths contribute to the subpicosecond decay components found experimentally. The indirect path also provides a way for fast population of the n,pi* state, which will account for the experimental picosecond decay component...|$|R

40|$|Dynamical {{effects of}} non-conservative forces in long, defect free atomic wires are investigated. Current flow through these wires is {{simulated}} {{and we find}} that during the initial transient, the kinetic energies of the ions are contained in {{a small number of}} phonon modes, closely clustered in frequency. These phonon modes correspond to the waterwheel modes determined from preliminary <b>static</b> <b>calculations.</b> The <b>static</b> <b>calculations</b> allow one to predict the appearance of non-conservative effects in advance of the more expensive real-time simulations. The ion kinetic energy redistributes across the band as non-conservative forces reach a steady state with electronic frictional forces. The typical ion kinetic energy is found to decrease with system length, increase with atomic mass, and its dependence on bias, mass and length is supported with a pen and paper model. This paper highlights the importance of non-conservative forces in current carrying devices and provides criteria for the design of stable atomic wires.

40|$|AbstractâHow {{the core}} {{structure}} of an interface dislocation network depends on both misfit and bond strength across the interface is investigated. It is shown that, in principle at least, {{it is possible}} to assess the bond strength by investigating the atomic structure of the dislocation cores. As examples, the misfit-dislocation structures at Ag/Mn 3 O 4, Cu/MnO interfaces formed by parallel close-packed planes of Ag or Cu and O obtained by internal oxidation were studied using HRTEM and lattice <b>static</b> <b>calculations.</b> The lattice <b>static</b> <b>calculations</b> are instrumental in indicating the possible dislocation network and their results served as input for HRTEM image simulations which are then compared with experimental HRTEM images. In addition, the influence of dissolution of a segregating element (Sb) in these systems was also studied using HRTEM. The influence on Mn 3 O 4 precipitates in Ag is distinct, namely: (i) the initial precipitates, sharply facetted by solely { 111 }, are changed into a globular shape with sometimes also short { 220 } and (002) facets, (ii) a partial reduction of Mn 3 O 4 into MnO occurs for a part of the precipitates...|$|R
