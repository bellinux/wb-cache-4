40|$|The present paper investigates {{transient}} overvoltages on ac induction motors when connected {{through a}} cable of arbitrary length to IGBT-PWM inverters. Considering classical transmission line analysis, and traveling-wave analysis with zero initial charges on cables, these transient over voltages are {{about twice the}} dc link voltage with a short rise time of about 200 ns. Nevertheless for long cables, these transient overvoltages may reach 3 or 4 p. u. The target {{of the present study}} is to define the properties of these overvoltages, their dependency on the installation parameters, and to present a combination of two measures (<b>series</b> <b>reactors</b> and capacitor-resistor termination impedance) to reduce the voltage rise du/dt and the over voltages at the motor terminals.

50|$|The {{external}} reactor coil {{method for}} a second starting stage has merit, as the voltage to the motor {{is a function of}} the motor current taken from the line. It can be seen that during a second stage with a <b>series</b> <b>reactor,</b> that during acceleration the motor voltage will rise as the line current drops. This relationship results in greater acceleration energy to a higher motor speed and less disturbance at changeover to full line voltage.|$|E
50|$|Two or more {{contactors}} {{may be used}} {{to provide}} reduced voltage starting of a motor. By using an autotransformer or a series inductance, a lower voltage is present at the motor terminals, reducing starting torque and inrush current. Once the motor has come up to some fraction of its full-load speed, the starter switches to full voltage at the motor terminals. Since the autotransformer or <b>series</b> <b>reactor</b> only carries the heavy motor starting current for a few seconds, the devices can be much smaller compared to continuously rated equipment. The transition between reduced and full voltage may be based on elapsed time, or triggered when a current sensor shows the motor current has begun to reduce. An autotransformer starter was patented in 1908.|$|E

If the TT has a high leakage reactance, the short-circuit impedance ratio is 51.66  %. Therefore, the <b>series</b> <b>reactor</b> can effectively reduce equalizing current in the mode of bilateral supply.|$|E

40|$|Network fault {{levels are}} {{reported}} to be increasing and this is often attributed {{to an increase in}} network interconnectivity and localised generation. When the fault level at a substation increases beyond the rated value of the installed equipment, a power utility traditionally responded by either (i) replacing the equipment with higher rated equipment or, (ii) installing <b>series</b> <b>reactors</b> or, (iii) replacing the existing transformers with high impedance transformers. Using a South African case study, this paper compares both the effectiveness and financial viability of a superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) against the traditional three options. When one also considers the operational or ‘energy’ cost associated with all these options it was found that a high capital cost was sometimes offset by lower energy costs over a 25 year service life.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and demonstrates}} the principle {{and efficacy of}} a novel direct current fault interruption scheme using a reactor in series with a controlled rectifier and a conventional AC circuit breaker.

In addition, the <b>series</b> <b>reactor</b> along with the filter capacitor forms an underdamped series RLC circuit which forces the fault current to oscillate about zero. This synthetic alternating current can then be interrupted using a conventional AC circuit breaker. The selection criteria for the <b>series</b> <b>reactor</b> and overcurrent protection are presented as well. Using the proposed scheme for an example case, a DC fault current magnitude is reduced from 56 [*]kA to 14 [*]kA, while the interruption time is reduced from 44 [*]ms to 25 [*]ms...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{implementation}} of a shunt active power filter with a small <b>series</b> <b>reactor</b> for a three-phase system is presented. The system consists of multiple non-linear loads, which are a combination of harmonic current sources and harmonic voltage sources, with significant unbalanced components. The filter consists of a three-phase current-controlled voltage source inverter (CC-VSI) with a filter inductance at the ac output and a dc-bus capacitor. The CC-VSI is operated to directly control the ac grid current to be sinusoidal and in phase with the grid voltage. The switching is controlled using ramptime current control, which is based on the concept of zero average current error. The simulation results indicate that the filter along with the <b>series</b> <b>reactor</b> is able to handle predominantly the harmonic voltage sources, as well as the unbalance, so that the grid currents are sinusoidal, in phase with the grid voltages and symmetrical. 1...|$|E
3000|$|It can be {{seen from}} Table  1 that if there is no <b>series</b> <b>reactor</b> (k =  0) in a direct, {{bilateral}} supply network where the voltage of power system is 220  kV and if the twin-bundled conductors are used, the impedance ratio η = 64 that is, the relative value of the equalizing current is 1 / 64. In other words, the ratio of the penetrating power of the traction network to the transmission power of the transmission lines is 1 : 64. It can be concluded that if there is no <b>series</b> <b>reactor,</b> there will be large equalizing current in the mode of bilateral supply and the penetrating power as well, resulting in a waste of traction power supply equipment capacity and causing power energy metering problem.

40|$|Series {{reactors}} {{are used}} in distribution grids to reduce the short-circuit fault level. Some of the disadvantages of the application of these devices are the voltage drop produced across the reactor and the steep front rise of the transient recovery voltage (TRV), which generally exceeds the rating of the associated circuit breaker. Simulations were performed to compare {{the characteristics of a}} saturated core High-Temperature Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (HTS FCL) and a <b>series</b> <b>reactor.</b> The design of the HTS FCL was optimized using the evolutionary algorithm.

Tests performed on a prototype 11 kV HTS FCL confirm the theoretical results. The respective transient recovery voltages (TRV) of the HTS FCL and an air core reactor of comparable fault current limiting capability are also determined.

40|$|Novel {{reaction}} engineering designs, {{also referred}} to as interference techniques, have been shown to improve the yield of heavier hydrocarbons in Fischer-Tropsch (FT) product distributions. This dissertation explores two such techniques: distributed syngas feeding and azomethane co-feeding. 	An FT reaction model is first developed as an aid in simulating and understanding the experimental results presented herein. This model also explores whether the rate constants governing the FT polymerization reaction depend upon the length of the growing surface hydrocarbon chain. 	A distributed syngas feeding strategy was employed experimentally by using two series plug flow reactors and feeding syngas into the entrances of both. The results from these experiments are compared against those from a normal feeding strategy in which syngas was fed only to the entrance of the first <b>series</b> <b>reactor.</b> A distributed feeding strategy is counterproductive to generating heavier product distributions when complete or near-complete CO conversion is effected within the first <b>series</b> <b>reactor,</b> leading to a decrease in C 5 + hydrocarbon selectivity of over 60 %. However, effecting only incremental CO conversion within the first <b>series</b> <b>reactor</b> leads to an improvement in C 5 + hydrocarbon selectivity of up to 30 % using a distributed feeding strategy. This result represents a significant finding in that the weight of an FT product distribution was increased simply by altering the location of the inlet syngas. 	Azomethane co-feeding was meant both to demonstrate a proof of concept in adding a recycled stream of activated methane to an FT reactor and to ascertain the occurrence of methyl termination steps in FT. Azomethane co-feeding experiments generated lighter product distributions compared to experiments in which deionized water was co-fed as a control – α values for C 8 -C 13 hydrocarbons were 0. 69 - 0. 70 for the water co-feeding experiments and 0. 64 - 0. 65 for the azomethane co-feeding experiments. However, the azomethane co-feeding experiments generated product distributions with greater paraffinic content than the corresponding water co-feeding experiments. These results demonstrate the likelihood that methyl termination steps take place on the surface of iron FT catalysts. Further exploration must be performed to find conditions in which a recycled, re-activated methane stream can improve heavy hydrocarbon selectivity...|$|E
