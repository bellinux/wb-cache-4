This thesis provides a detailed account of the <b>Storage</b> <b>Exchange</b> and presents three main contributions in the field of distributed storage and the process required to realise a global storage utility. The first is a taxonomy of distributed storage systems covering a wide array of topics from the past and present. The second contribution involves proposing and developing the <b>Storage</b> <b>Exchange,</b> a global trading platform for distributed storage services. The development of the <b>Storage</b> <b>Exchange</b> platform identifies challenges and the necessary work required to make the global trading and sharing of distributed storage services possible. The third and final contribution consists of proposing and evaluating Double Auction clearing algorithms which allow goods with indivisible demand constraints to be allocated in polynomial time. The process of optimally clearing goods of this nature in a Double Auction normally requires solving an NP-hard problem and is thus considered computationally intractable.

Organisations with varying storage requirements can use the SX platform to trade and <b>exchange</b> <b>storage</b> services. Organisations have the ability to federate their storage, be-it dedicated or scavenged and advertise it to a global storage market. In this paper we discuss the high level architecture employed by our platform and investigate a sealed Double Auction market model. We implement and experiment the following clearing algorithms: maximise surplus, optimise utilisation and an efficient combination of both. ...|$|R

But considering sensor networks, {{there is a need for}} an approach that allows stream models to reach also computation-capable constrained embedded devices and to implement <b>storage,</b> <b>exchange</b> and computation on those. We propose a stream model that implements sensor-device data handling. The stream processing abstraction and interface allows small motes to store and process the data locally and to route processed data to consumer streams on-demand. This eliminates the need to code motes operation in lower-level languages, allows easy configuration of operations of different types and saves communication energy. The approach is quite useful in diverse contexts, including wireless sensor networks. We describe the approach and show its advantages experimentally...|$|R
40|$|Human {{societies}} {{have adapted to}} spatial and temporal variability, such as that found in the prehistoric American Southwest. A question remains {{as to what the}} implications are of different social adaptations to long-term vulnerability of small-scale human societies. A stylized agent-based model is presented that captures small-group decision making on movements and resource use in ancient arid environments. The impact of various assumptions concerning <b>storage,</b> <b>exchange,</b> sharing, and migration on indicators of aggregation and sustainability are explored. Climate variability is found to increase the resilience of population levels at the system level. Variability reduces the time a population stays in one location and can degrade the soils. In addition to climate variability, the long-term population dynamics is mainly driven by the level of storage and the decision rules governing when to migrate and with whom to exchange...|$|R

For such purposes netCDF serves as a portable and efficient file format and program-ming interface, which is popular in numerous scientific ap-plication domains. However, the original interface does not provide a efficient mechanism for parallel data storage and access. In this work, we present a new parallel interface for writ-ing and reading netCDF datasets. This interface is de-rived with minimal changes from the serial netCDF inter-face but defines semantics for parallel access and is tai-lored for high performance. The underlying parallel I/O is achieved through MPI-IO, allowing for dramatic perfor-mance gains through the use of collective I/O optimizations. We compare the implementation strategies with HDF 5 and analyze both. Our tests indicate programming convenience and significant I/O performance improvement with this par-allel netCDF interface. 1...|$|R

40|$|Circuit {{diagrams}} and Unified Modeling Language diagrams {{are just}} two examples of standard visual languages that help accelerate work by promoting regularity, removing ambiguity and enabling software tool support for communication of complex information. Ironically, despite {{having one of the}} highest ratios of graphical to textual information, biology still lacks standard graphical notations. The recent deluge of biological knowledge makes addressing this deficit a pressing concern. Toward this goal, we present the Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN), a visual language developed by a community of biochemists, modelers and computer scientists. SBGN consists of three complementary languages: process diagram, entity relationship diagram and activity flow diagram. Together they enable scientists to represent networks of biochemical interactions in a standard, unambiguous way. We believe that SBGN will foster efficient and accurate representation, visualization, <b>storage,</b> <b>exchange</b> and reuse of information on all kinds of biological knowledge, from gene regulation, to metabolism, to cellular signaling...|$|R

Moreover, as the WFD requires a water management policy based around natural river basin districts instead of administrative and political borders and demands co-ordinated "programmes of measures", the agencies have to coordinate their work and combine their results with other agencies, possibly across national borders. On this background, the present article motivates the need to develop an IT Framework Architecture for the WFD implementation...|$|R

Furthermore, there is a demand for high-fidelity photo-realistic and non-photo-realistic visualization. This poses at least two questions: Is there a single data format standard suitable for serious GIS-based applications and computer games that supports state-of-the-art visual quality? How can computer games and serious applications benefit from each other, especially platform-wise? In this paper we will investigate both questions by taking {{a closer look at}} the CityGML standard in comparison to COLLADA and we will report on our findings in integrating CityGML with mainstream game technology. The main contribution of this paper to the field is a suggested way of integrating an important features of CityGML and Collada for high-quality visualization, i. e. programmable shader effects, and demonstrating the feasibility of employing a game console as a cheap and widely available device for geodata visualization and possibly other geodata-centric applications...|$|R
