The placement of the relay station plays {{a critical role in}} the system performance and therefore draws tremendous attention from the research community. In this paper, we study the relay station placement problem in the WiMAX network, with the cooperative communication as the relaying strategy. In particular, given a base station and a set of <b>subscriber</b> <b>stations,</b> we determine the location of a relay station, and the set of <b>subscriber</b> <b>stations</b> using the relay station. The objective is to minimize the maximum transmission power among all the <b>subscriber</b> <b>stations</b> while satisfying the data rate requirements of the <b>subscriber</b> <b>stations.</b> We develop a near-optimal algorithm to solve this problem and prove that the maximum transmission power computed by our algorithm is at most 푃 표푝 푡 + 휖, where 푃 표푝 푡 is the maximum transmission power in the optimal solution and 휖> 0 is an arbitrary constant.

The useful flow range is extended when using calibration data from the clamp-on meter to correct the measured data, making it possible to determine deviations >± 10 % in flow rates below a Reynolds number of 10 000.
