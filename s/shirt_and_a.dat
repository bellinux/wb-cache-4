5|$|Staying true to {{his word}} from earlier in the season, the match was Schmeichel's last in a Manchester United <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> month later he signed for Lisbon club Sporting Clube de Portugal. He spent two seasons in Portugal before {{returning}} to England for spells with Aston Villa and Manchester City. It was also Jesper Blomqvist's last competitive appearance for the club. After playing in all four matches of the club's pre-season tour of Australia and China in July 1999, he suffered a succession of knee injuries that ruled him out of competitive action {{for the next two}} seasons. He made two more appearances for the first team during the 2000–01 pre-season campaign, as well as three matches for the reserves in September and October 2001, before a free transfer to Everton in November that year. For Bayern Munich, substitutes Thomas Helmer and Ali Daei left the club in the summer of 1999, with Helmer moving to England to play for Sunderland and Daei remaining in Germany with Hertha BSC.|$|E

According to an interview on Parkinson, David Tennant and Russell T Davies got the idea for the Tenth Doctor's costume from an outfit Jamie Oliver had worn on Parkinson just after Tennant had taken the role. David Tennant has commented that he would vary the combination of the buttons he fastened on his jacket in different episodes. Tennant thought the look was very geek chic.|$|E
25|$|The Service Dress Blue (SDB) uniform {{consists}} of a navy blue suit coat and trousers (or the optional skirt for women) that are nearly black in color, a white <b>shirt,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> four-in-hand necktie for men or a neck tab for women. The material is generally wool or a wool blend, depending on the vendor. The men's jacket is double breasted with six gold-colored buttons, and the women's jacket has a single row of four gold-colored buttons. Rank insignia is the gold sleeve stripes for commissioned officers, while rating badges and service stripes are worn on the left sleeve by Chief Petty Officers (CPOs). The prescribed headgear is the white combination cap, although a navy blue garrison cap is optional, unless stated otherwise by the prescribing authority in some situations when the jacket is not worn. Beginning in 2016, the Navy began phasing out the female combination cap and now prescribes a cover similar to the male version for female officers and CPOs. Commissioned and warrant officers wear a cap badge of the American shield and eagle in silver upon gold crossed anchors; CPOs wear a single fouled anchor. The combination cover's chinstrap is gold for commissioned and warrant officers, narrower gold for midshipmen, and black for CPOs. Female officers and chief petty officers wear beltless slacks with the SDB, although since January 2017, belted slacks can be worn as an alternative.|$|E
