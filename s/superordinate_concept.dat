40|$|Conventional medical concept systems {{represent}} generic concept relations by hierarchical coding principles. Often, these coding principles {{constrain the}} concept system {{and reduce the}} potential for automatical derivation of subsumption. Formal reconstruction of medical concept systems is an approach that bases on the conceptual representation of meanings and that allows {{for the application of}} formal criteria for subsumption. Those criteria must reflect intuitive principles of subordination which are underlying conventional medical concept systems. Particularly these are: The subordinate concept results (1) from adding a specializing criterion to the <b>superordinate</b> <b>concept,</b> (2) from refining the primary category, or a criterion of the <b>superordinate</b> <b>concept,</b> by a concept that is less general, (3) from adding a partitive criterion to a criterion of the superordinate, (4) from refining a criterion by a concept that is less comprehensive, and finally (5) from coordinating the <b>superordinate</b> <b>concept,</b> or one of its criteria. This paper introduces a formalism called BERNWARD that aims at the formal reconstruction of medical concept systems according to these intuitive principles. The automatical derivation of hierarchical relations is primarily supported by explicit generic and explicit partititive hierarchies of concepts, secondly, by two formal criteria that base on the structure of concept descriptions and explicit hierarchical relations between their elements, namely: formal subsumption and part-sensitive subsumption. Formal subsumption takes only generic relations into account, part-sensitive subsumption additionally regards partive relations between criteria. This approach seems to be flexible enough to cope with unforeseeable effects of partitive criteria on subsumption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Assigning {{categories}} to objects allows {{the mind to}} code experience by concepts, thus easing the burden in perceptual, storage, and reasoning processes. Moreover, maximal efficiency of cognitive resources is attained with categories that best mirror {{the structure of the}} perceived world. In this work, we will explore how taxonomies could be represented in the brain, and their application in learning and recall. In a recent work, Sacramento and Wichert (in Neural Netw 24 (2) : 143 – 147, 2011) proposed a hierarchical arrangement of compressed associative networks, improv-ing retrieval time by allowing irrelevant neurons to be pruned early. We present an extension to this model where <b>superordinate</b> <b>concepts</b> are encoded in these compressed networks. Memory traces are stored in an uncompressed network, and each additional network codes for a taxo-nomical rank.

In general, there was an advantage for subordinate and basic level processing compared to superordinate level processing.

Simultaneously, in relative terms, features are less shared overall by superordinate members than by basic level members, which imply higher executive requirements and can conversely lead to superordinate deficits.

In the classical view of concept learning a concept is described by separately nec-essary and jointly sufficient properties (Smith & Medin, 1981). Those properties of the objects used in a classification rule are the defining or relevant properties, the others are the variable or irrelevant properties. Experiments designed to study concept learning in the classical tradition always used completely defined, artifi-cial concepts. The set of objects to be classified almost always consisted of a finite number of objects, particularly geometrical figures, and were used to study the external conditions of concept learning (i. e., the characteristics of the set of objects and the relationship between the characteristics).

40|$|Persons have {{different}} value preferences. Neuroimaging studies where value-based decisions in actual conflict situations were investigated suggest {{an important role}} of prefrontal and cingulate brain regions. General preferences, however, reflect a <b>superordinate</b> moral <b>concept</b> independent of actual situations as proposed in psychological and socioeconomic research. Here, the specific brain response would be influenced by abstract value systems and moral concepts. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying such responses are largely unknown. Using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) with a forced-choice paradigm on word pairs representing abstract values, we show that the brain handles such decisions depending on the person's <b>superordinate</b> moral <b>concept.</b> Persons with a predominant collectivistic (altruistic) value system applied a "balancing and weighing" strategy, recruiting brain regions of rostral inferior and intraparietal, and midcingulate and frontal cortex. Conversely, subjects with mainly individualistic (egocentric) value preferences applied a "fight-and-flight" strategy by recruiting the left amygdala. Finally, if subjects experience a value conflict when rejecting an alternative congruent to their own predominant value preference, comparable brain regions are activated as found in actual moral dilemma situations, i. e., midcingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Our results demonstrate that <b>superordinate</b> moral <b>concepts</b> influence the strategy and the neural mechanisms in decision processes, independent of actual situations, showing that decisions are based on general neural principles. These findings provide a novel perspective to future sociological and economic research {{as well as to the}} analysis of social relations by focusing on abstract value systems as triggers of specific brain responses...|$|R

Subjects were enrolled in a college-level, introductory biology course for nonscience majors (n= 25) and an advanced course in mammalogy intended for upper-division and graduate-level students (n= 25). Each subject constructed a concept map and then participated in a clinical interview, during which an exhaustive set of descriptive propositions about 20 mammals depicted in line drawings was generated. Subjects subsequently sorted the mammals into homogeneous groups. Results of concept mapping reveal that experienced students possess a substantially more extensive, complex, and integrated knowledge base characterized by significantly greater numbers of concepts, relationships, levels of hierarchy, branchings, and crosslinks. Results of clinical interviews and sorting task demonstrate that these differences {{are linked to the}} emergence of a new repertoire of implicit, <b>superordinate</b> <b>concepts</b> which orders students' understandings, the enhanced use of inferential reasoning strategies, and the development of a scientifically acceptable system of assigning class membership...|$|R
40|$|Need {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as central to social work practice, yet is equally regarded as far from unproblematic as a concept. Considerable debate has occurred at two levels: the policy/service delivery level and an abstract conceptual level which considers the nature of need. It is suggested here, however, that between these two levels lies an ‘operating concept’. This focuses on the problem of defining and identifying need in the immediate circumstances of practice. At this level, two concepts of need are put forward: a ‘deficit concept’ and a ‘differentiated concept’. It is argued that the latter provides a more coherent conceptualization of need. In this concept, need is the <b>superordinate</b> <b>concept</b> which contains within it three subconcepts: problems, supports and resources, which are connected. These are analysed, and their potential as a basis for developing a system of need classification which may be used in practice is explored...|$|E

In elementary coursebook, the vocabulary is presented in list semantic set that is semantically related items such as jobs doctor, teacher, lawyer etc. or colours: red, blue, yellow etc.). This idea is really restrictive to develop the students’ vocabulary mastery. It seems that teaching vocabulary in semantically related items is counter-productive but this idea has never been taken on board. The question is Why do students {{have to go through}} so much learning of things which they are hardly ever likely to say?. (Estatiev, 2015) and (Leoselivan, 2014) introduce the way to teach students’ vocabulary by developing the students’ idea through communicative purpose beyond the basic description. Developing alternatives in horizontal lists instead of semantic set lists will make learners find the words in which they are likely to go with (co-text) rather than with other words sharing the same <b>superordinate</b> <b>concept.</b> The easy samples are colour and animal.

Instead, <b>superordinate</b> <b>concepts</b> derived from thinking about evidence-based practice provide a more grounded focus on the practical issues faced by therapists treating PTSD. These concepts, which include competences and metcacompetences, therapist responsiveness, stages of therapy and case formulation, provide a basis for a genuinely integrative approach.

40|$|Recent {{research}} that {{looked into the}} dispositional base of job satisfaction focused on relating observed job satisfaction to core self-evaluations (CSE). This study was concerned with (a) {{the relation between the}} trait variance of job satisfaction and CSE and (b) the structure of the CSE-variables. Using a longitudinal measurement model in a secondary analysis of four waves of a longitudinal study we first tested whether CSE are sufficiently stable over time. Results indicate a high stability of CSE (. 87 across 2 years). We then performed a state-trait decomposition of job satisfaction in order to separate trait variance of job satisfaction from changing variance. The stable job satisfaction factor was regressed on CSE-variables, using different models of CSE (a collective set, a latent factor, or an aggregate concept). Results were in favor of treating the CSE-variables as a collective set, and this set explained almost all stable variance of job satisfaction (84 %). Moreover, only negative affectivity and internal locus of control had a significant impact, whereas self-esteem and self-efficacy had not. It is concluded that current conceptualisations of CSE as a <b>superordinate</b> <b>concept</b> underlying its four dimensions is possible but overly broad in job satisfaction research; collective consideration of LOC and KA is better and sufficient...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the high {{external quantum efficiency}} observed for organic light-emitting diodes using a bisanthracene derivative, BD 1, as the emitting molecule, off-diagonal vibronic coupling constants (VCCs) between the excited states of BD 1, which govern non-radiative transition rates, were calculated employing time-dependent density functional theory. The VCCs were analysed based {{on the concept of}} vibronic coupling density. The VCC calculations suggest a fluorescence via higher triplets (FvHT) mechanism, which entails the conversion of a T$_ 4 $ exciton generated during electrical excitation into an S$_ 2 $ exciton via reverse intersystem crossing (RISC); moreover, the S$_ 2 $ exciton relaxes to a fluorescent S$_ 1 $ exciton because of large vibronic coupling between S$_ 2 $ and S$_ 1 $. This mechanism is valid as long as the relaxation of triplet states higher than T$_ 1 $ to lower states is suppressed. The symmetry-controlled thermally activated delayed fluorescence (SC-TADF) and inverted singlet and triplet (iST) structure, which have been proposed in our previous studies, are the special examples of the FvHT mechanism that need high molecular symmetry. However, BD 1 achieves the FvHT mechanism in spite of its asymmetrical structure. A general condition for the suppression of radiative and non-radiative transitions in molecules with pseudo-degenerate electronic structures such as BD 1 is discussed.

On the basis of the test scores, the subjects with higher abstraction ability and those with lower abstraction ability were selected and given the categoly generalization task to assess the categorization modes or the prototype formation, Experiment I: The purpose of this experiment was to assess the categorization modes (holistic vs. analytic) in tasks with two categories of four sample exemplars in each. The faces had five dimension varying with two values in each. In the SD task, the subjects could categorize the sample exemplars based on either similarity (S) or a criterial dimension (D).

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to gain a deeper {{understanding}} of the experiences of visually impaired older people living independently at home. Background: As populations are aging globally, there is now an increase in the prevalence of visual impairment. That means for ongoing and future aging-in-place strategies that seek to enable older people to remain independent for longer, more attention needs to be given to the needs of those with visual impairment. As people develop visual impairment, they use adaptive strategies including modifying long-term homes or relocating to more suitable accommodation. In the United Kingdom, aging-in-place strategies include employing statutory lifetime home standards (LTHS) in the home or relocating to sheltered housing to live independently with support available if required. Methods: To get a better understanding of the needs of the visually impaired in the home, 12 interviews with six visually impaired occupants of LTHS homes and six from sheltered accommodation were analyzed separately using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Secondly, qualitative synthesis was used to further analyze themes generated from both samples before interview results were conceptualized in two <b>superordinate</b> <b>concepts,</b> namely, “negotiating priorities” and “understanding visual impairment. ” Results: Participants from both groups had similar needs and were willing to compromise by living with some negative features.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the self-experience of people with {{moderate}} to advanced dementia. While people with dementia are widely assumed to lose their sense of self, emotions are preserved long into dementia and some can still discuss their lives, enabling exploration of respondents’ own self-conceptualisation of experience. Design/methodology/approach: Ten people, purposively sampled, living in long-term residential or nursing care. A mixed methods design with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis approach used semi-structured empathetic interviews to explore their experience and continuing goals, using supplementary information from family and others to contextualise core data. Data analysis identified emerging themes and <b>superordinate</b> <b>concepts.</b> Findings: Sustained well-being and resistant ill-being emerged as major themes. Findings demonstrated continuity in sense of self, moral awareness and diversity of emotional reactions to living with dementia, associated with their emotional capital. Research limitations/implications: The sample was small and limited to well- and moderately funded care homes. How to provide such support in less-well-funded homes needs further research as do reasons for resistant ill-being in advanced dementia. Practical implications: Findings suggest care provision for people with advanced dementia which acknowledges individual feelings may support their sustained well-being. Psychological assessments should take closer account of multiple factors in individuals’ situations, including their emotional capital. Social implications: Findings suggest everyday care of people with advanced dementia, may sustain their sense of self, well-being and emotional capital. Originality/value: By empathically facilitating in-depth expression of individuals’ feelings and views, this research illuminates the personal self-experience of advanced dementia, hitherto little explored...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} verbs used as parallel (synonymous) {{words in}} Estonian runo songs, the semantic structures which they reflect, and {{the possibilities of}} expressing special domains of action: motion, perception and speech acts. This is a research of Estonian semantics, based on the material which represents historical and poetic language, the age of which varies from the origin of runo songs about 2000 years ago, {{to the end of}} the 19 th - beginning of the 20 th century, when the analyzed songs were written down. This material gives several possibilities to research diachronic semantics of Estonian, language with not very long literary tradition. On the other hand, in the poetic language the mental semantic structures appear more directly than in the general language, while the poetic text is further structured itself. The key poetical features determining the semantics of runo song language are alliteration and parallelism. The main unit of parallelism is a group of verses, each organized by alliteration, expressing the same or a similar situation by using the same, synonymous or analogous words which are usually in the same positions. The repetition of one idea with different words and the semantic cohesion in parallel verses may produce a result in which words that are normally non-synonymous come to be used as synonymous parallel words. Such a phenomenon has been explained as the hazing of the common word meaning: instead of words with appropriate meaning parallel verses contain words chosen for their matching sounds. My analysis indicates that there are still almost always some semantic motivation in the use of verbs in parallelism. The main units of the analysis - parallel verbs - may be defined as verbs that are used in parallel verses which describe a particular or similar action and are interchangeable with one other without impeding the meaning (although remaining connected with certain verses by virtue of alliteration and syllable structure). The main differences in the semantic structure of different action domains are those which arise due to the opposition between a human and a non-human element and the location of the language user in the environment described. In the case of motion, there is no qualitative difference between the human and non-human. Thus most of the peculiarities in that domain arise due to the speaker’s location in space: in parallelism the movements toward a deictic zero and away from it are differentiated as well as neutral motion. Motion may have a close connection to several (human) actions, thereby gaining an additional quality. Perception is a common ability among the humans and animals and here there are no qualitative differences. The nature of perception is determined by the qualities of the perceived object, and not the perceiver. But perception may also be described more generally. When there are no specific verbs for it, a <b>superordinate</b> <b>concept</b> is expressed by the subordinate verbs that are used in aggregate. The ability to speak is unique for humans, but one aspect of it - uttering sounds - humans share with the rest of the animal world. There is a qualitative difference between informative and non-informative sound and the speech acts can be divided into positive and negative. When a verb denoting a manner of speaking has a negative connotation, then the meaning of that manner will not be neutralized in parallelism as usually happens in the domains of motion and perception. The semantic analysis of parallel verbs indicates that parallelism as a poetic feature reflects clearly the structures of different semantic domains and categories, and also some older layers of the word meanings. As the verbs are more polysemous than the nominal words, in runo songs different domains of action are interweaved by several sense relations. The categories of runo song language as a sublanguage have some different boundaries than these of the general language, but the main structures of it still derive from the general language. The synonyms in the general language are mostly subordinate concepts of a basic level concept with a small difference of meaning. The runo song synonyms are basic level concepts themselves, their common concept belongs to upper level. In the use of parallel verbs there emerge several generic categories with no lexical equivalent and compound categories which open the inner structures of the concepts: the generalization is achieved without the abstract vocabulary. Besides the hierarchical relations of meaning, the selection of verbs into parallel verses is determined by the conventional relations between verbs and nouns as well as by sound associations, evoked by alliteration. Our language and thinking is structured by several associative networks - different semantic associations, polysemy nets, collocations, and also sound associations - such connections have been in the language and minds of our ancestors when they created and developed runo songs. The few cases when one can detect no semantic relationships between parallel verbs may be explained by changes in language and the weakening of the runo song tradition - as a rule, the choice of parallel words follows certain subliminal rules as the general use of language does...|$|E
40|$|Definitions {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components of any high-quality terminological resource as well as a privileged medium for knowledge representation since they offer a direct natural-language explanation of the content of a concept. The adequacy of the definitions thus largely determines the overall usefulness of the terminological resource for the user. This study has been motivated by the observation that terminological definitions often do not meet the needs of users. This is partly due to certain preconceptions about the purpose of definitions as well as the nature of meaning itself. These preconceptions thus affect how terminological definitions are created. Traditionally, defining a term has been seen as stating the necessary and sufficient characteristics that make up the meaning of the term. This approach, known as the Aristotelian definition (§ 3. 2), presupposes the existence of a stable meaning, independent of the context in which the term is used. In addition, it is assumed that meaning (or semantic knowledge) is independent of world knowledge (or encyclopedic knowledge). The key premises on which the traditional approach to definitions is based have been refuted in the field of cognitive linguistics (§ 2. 1) : i) it is not possible to determine the necessary and sufficient features of a concept because conceptual boundaries are fuzzy; ii) concepts have prototypical features not shared by all members of the category; iii) it is not possible to make a distinction between semantic and encyclopedic knowledge, nor between semantic and pragmatic knowledge. From a cognitive point of view, encyclopedic knowledge plays a central role in the study of meaning because concepts always appear embedded in frames, which are structures based on encyclopedic knowledge which attribute sense to concepts (Fillmore 1982 a). Moreover, meaning is not considered a stable entity. It is constructed in each usage event in accordance with the context (§ 2. 1. 2). As a consequence, meaning and context are inseparable. In this doctoral thesis, we apply these premises of cognitive linguistics to terminological definitions and present a proposal called the flexible terminological definition (§ 3. 6). This consists of a set of definitions of the same concept made up of a general definition (in this case, one encompassing the entire environmental domain) along with additional definitions describing the concept from the perspective of the subdomains in which it is relevant. Our proposal assumes that by eliminating the artificial boundaries between semantic and pragmatic knowledge, the representation of contextual variation in the terminological definition will no longer be a mere possibility. Given the ubiquity of context and its effects on cognition and language, the representation of the traits activated by concepts in accordance with the context becomes a necessity if one aspires to fully meet the user’s needs. This also entails the inclusion of prototypical characteristics in the definition, i. e. characteristics that are not always applicable to the concept, but which are relevant in a given context. Similarly, encyclopedic knowledge in the terminological definition is no longer forbidden. It now forms an integral part of the definition. The role that the defined concept plays in the frames it activates should be, as far as possible, part of the definition. Our proposal is specifically based on frame-based terminology (§ 2. 2), in addition to the theories of grounded cognition (§ 2. 1. 1), frame semantics (§ 2. 1. 2. 2), prototype theory (§ 2. 1. 3. 2), and the theory theory (§ 2. 1. 3. 3). We took as a starting point the application of frame-based terminology to the representation of specialized knowledge and to terminological definitions in EcoLexicon (a terminological knowledge base on the environment created in accordance with frame-based terminology). In fact, our proposal for a flexible definition was inspired by the recontextualization of EcoLexicon (§ 3. 6. 1), as a result of which conceptual maps only show the relevant information for the subdomain of the environment chosen by the user. Recontextualization in EcoLexicon represents contextual variation and avoids information overload, thus increasing knowledge acquisition by the users. EcoLexicon follows the principle proposed by Meyer, Bowker, and Eck (1992 : 159) according to which, for a terminological knowledge base to be truly useful, it must reflect the same conceptual organization as in the human brain. Since terminological definitions are a kind of knowledge representation (Faber 2002), in this doctoral thesis, we assume that the creation of terminological definitions should also be based on the organization of the human conceptual system. Since context is a determining factor in the construction of the meaning of lexical units (including terms), we assume that terminological definitions can, and should, reflect the effects of context, even though definitions have traditionally been treated as the expression of meaning void of any contextual effect. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze the effects of contextual variation on specialized environmental concepts with a view to their representation in terminological definitions. Specifically, we focused on contextual variation based on thematic restrictions (§ 3. 5. 3. 4), i. e. how the different areas of knowledge comprising the vast domain of the environment conceptualize differently the same concepts, and how this can be reflected in the definition. One of the main fundamentals of our proposal is the notion in cognitive linguistics that lexical units only have meaning in real use events (§ 2. 1. 2). Outside of any use event, a lexical unit does not have any meaning, only semantic potential. A term’s semantic potential is the raw material for its definition, not its object. The semantic potential is not the object because this would mean that defining a term would involve describing all the conceptual content that the term could activate. This is not viable since a term’s semantic potential corresponds to a vast, immeasurable quantity of information that is never fully activated in real events. Lexical units have not only semantic potential, but also associated conventional and contextual constraints. These constraints cause some conceptual content to be activated more often than others, giving rise to what Croft and Cruse (2004 : 110) call pre-meanings. Pre-meanings are conceptual units that appear between the semantic potential and the meaning in the conceptualization process. The object of the definition is thus a subset of the semantic potential that corresponds to a pre-meaning. The pre-meaning that becomes the object of a given definition depends on the contextual constraints applied to the definition. In all cases, this subset always corresponds to a portion of a single concept and the frames that it can activate. By contextual constraints, we mean any situational factors that affect meaning construction and, indirectly, the content of terminological definitions. Given that the object of the definition (the pre-meaning) is an abstraction of the meanings that a lexical unit has under certain contextual constraints, we can state that the context associated with a pre-meaning is also a sort of abstraction from real contexts. As a consequence, we gave the name pre-context to the set of contextual restrictions that limit the semantic potential of a lexical unit in a relatively predictable way, giving rise to pre-meanings. Context comprises the linguistic context, discursive context, sociocultural context, and spatial-temporal context. The pre-context for terminological definitions includes linguistic constraints, thematic constraints, cultural constraints, ideological constraints, and diachronic constraints. Thematic constraints (i. e. discourse topic) allow for more accurate predictions about the way that the semantic potential of a given lexical unit is restricted than other contextual factors. Thematic constraints reduce the semantic potential of a lexical unit according to the topic at issue during a communicative act and the point of view taken. Our proposal of a flexible terminological definition relies on these types of constraint. Domains, in terms of a knowledge field, allow for the systematic characterization of thematic constraints in terminological definitions. They can be understood as macroframes that guide knowledge organization and categorization in a given conceptual area. In this doctoral thesis, we have used a simplified version of the domain classification that was created specifically for EcoLexicon. This work focuses on the phenomenon of contextual variation as opposed to lexical ambiguity (polysemy and homonymy). Contextual variation is the phenomenon that occurs when a concept does not always activate the same traits in use events and the relevance of these traits varies. For its part, lexical ambiguity is the phenomenon that occurs when a lexical unit is associated with more than one concept (Cruse 2011 : 100). To accomplish the objectives of this doctoral thesis, we conducted an empirical study (§ 5) consisting of the analysis of a set of contextually variable concepts and the creation of a flexible definition for two of them. Each of these two concepts presented different contextual profiles. To select the concepts to be analyzed, a terminological extraction was performed on 14 corpora of different environmental subdomains, specifically compiled for this doctoral thesis (§ 4. 1. 2. 1). The extraction was limited to simple nouns, and the results were compared so as to retain only those terms appearing (with a set frequency) in more than three domains. Polysemic terms were discarded manually. To extract the knowledge needed for the conceptual analysis and the writing of the flexible terminological definitions, the methodology of frame-based terminology (with certain additions) was followed (§ 4. 2. 2). This methodology consists of a combined top-down and bottom-up approach. The top-down method includes mainly the analysis of definitions from other terminological resources, whereas the bottom-up approach comprises corpus analysis. For more efficient knowledge extraction from the corpora, we employed hypernymic knowledge patterns (Meyer 2001 : 290) coded as word-sketches for SketchEngine. This allows for the extraction of <b>superordinate</b> <b>concept</b> candidates for the choice of genus in definitions. Moreover, we created a word-sketch for the extraction of contextonyms, which are the lexical units that tend to co-occur with a given lexical unit in linguistic contexts (Ji, Ploux, and Wehrli 2003; Ji and Ploux 2003). In this work, the analysis of contextonyms was used to determine the semantic traits activated by a concept in a given domain. As a result of the first part of our empirical study (the analysis of all the terms in our working list) (§ 5. 1), we divided our notion of domain-dependent contextual variation into three different phenomena: i) modulation (similar to Cruse’s modulation (§ 3. 5. 3. 5. 2)); ii) perspectivization (related to Cruse’s ways-of-seeing (§ 3. 5. 3. 5. 3)); iii) subconceptualization (akin to Cruse’s microsenses and local sub-senses (§ 3. 5. 3. 5. 4)). These phenomena are additive in that all concepts experience modulation, some concepts also undergo perspectivization, and finally, a small number of concepts are additionally subjected to subconceptualization. Modulation (§ 5. 2. 1) is the type of contextual variation that only alters minor characteristics of a concept which are neither necessary nor prototypical. These alterations are not represented in a terminological definition. For its part, perspectivization (§ 5. 2. 2) results in the change in the level of prototypicality of certain traits for a concept in relation to the general environmental premeaning. Finally, subconceptualization (§ 5. 2. 3) is the type of contextual variation in which the extension of the concept in relation to the general environmental premeaning is modified. In the second part of our empirical study (§ 5. 4), we created two flexible terminological definitions, one for a concept with subconceptualizations (POLLUTANT) and another for a concept with perspectives (CHLORINE). In this section, we presented guidelines on how to build them, from the extraction of knowledge to the actual writing of the definition. These guidelines ensure that the definition actually reflects how the defined concept is construed in different environmental domains, which might differ from the viewpoint adopted in the environment as a whole or other environmental subdomains. This doctoral thesis contributes to the improvement of the quality of terminological definitions because, with our approach, the user is presented with a definition tailored to the domain that he/she has chosen, thus multiplying the probabilities that the definition will offer him/her the information he/she needs. Furthermore, flexible terminological definitions provide a knowledge representation that better resembles the human conceptual system than traditional terminological definitions. As a consequence, a flexible definition not only provides more relevant information, but it also accomplishes this in a way that potentially facilitates and enhances knowledge acquisition...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the self-experience of people with {{moderate}} to advanced dementia. While people with dementia are widely assumed to lose their sense of self, emotions are preserved long into dementia and some can still discuss their lives, enabling exploration of respondents' own self-conceptualisation of experience. Design/methodology/approach - Ten people, purposively sampled, living in long-term residential or nursing care. A mixed methods design with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis approach used semi-structured empathetic interviews to explore their experience and continuing goals, using supplementary information from family and others to contextualise core data. Data analysis identified emerging themes and <b>superordinate</b> <b>concepts.</b> Findings - Sustained well-being and resistant ill-being emerged as major themes. Findings demonstrated continuity in sense of self, moral awareness and diversity of emotional reactions to living with dementia, associated with their emotional capital. Research limitations/implications - The sample was small and limited to well- and moderately funded care homes. How to provide such support in less-well-funded homes needs further research as do reasons for resistant ill-being in advanced dementia. Practical implications - Findings suggest care provision for people with advanced dementia which acknowledges individual feelings may support their sustained well-being. Psychological assessments should take closer account of multiple factors in individuals' situations, including their emotional capital. Social implications - Findings suggest everyday care of people with advanced dementia, may sustain their sense of self, well-being and emotional capital. Originality/value - By empathically facilitating in-depth expression of individuals' feelings and views, this research illuminates the personal self-experience of advanced dementia, hitherto little explored...|$|R

40|$|At present {{there is}} no outcome measure {{suitable}} for use across different health conditions seen within Clinical Health Psychology (CHP) settings which satisfactorily capture the main aspects relevant to service user outcomes. Several types of measure have previously been developed according to different assumptions about what {{and how best to}} measure outcomes. Measures may broadly be divided into symptom-focussed, theory-driven or pragmatically approached. Considering these in the context of psychological theories and the Recovery Approach suggests that <b>superordinate</b> <b>concepts,</b> such as distress; psychological mechanisms; satisfaction with functioning; the therapeutic alliance; and concepts such as hope, supportive relationships, empowerment and finding meaning, are relevant to CHP outcomes. The aim {{of this study was to}} begin to develop a global outcome measure for use in CHP. Consensus was sought regarding the most relevant concepts to measure by conducting a literature review and clinician interviews. Concepts were formed into items using a set of principles to ensure they were accessible and relevant to a broad range of service users. This item pool was refined, both conceptually and linguistically, using clinician feedback over three iterations of an online Delphi survey. Qualitative data was analysed thematically. Elicited themes were compared to those concepts thought to be relevant to CHP outcomes immediately before the Delphi study, in order to provide a quality control check on their relevance. Some consensus was reached by the end of the Delphi study, which provides partial support for the hypothesis that rather than each condition having its own unique psychological profile, concepts are shared across conditions. The lack of complete agreement may have been due to differences in service users’ presentations, differences in concepts identified by clinician participants, or different interpretations of the language used to convey concepts. Whilst item construction may have been biased by subjective judgement, the Delphi methodology likely mitigated the effect of this on the final item pool. Recommendations are offered for how this pilot outcome measure may be developed into a final version...|$|R
