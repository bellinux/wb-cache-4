5|$|In 2010, Saran {{made her}} Malayalam debut with Pokkiri Raja, {{in which she}} {{appeared}} opposite Mammootty and Prithviraj. The film was declared a super hit in the first week, breaking the record in Malayalam cinema for opening week gross income, {{though it was not}} received well critically. It was said of Saran that all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> look pretty. She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. In the opinion of some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E
25|$|Shirley's biggest {{trademark}} was her hair, {{which was}} also the subject of rumors. A rumor circulated that she wore a wig. More than once, fans yanked her hair to test the theory. She later said she wished all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> wear a wig. The nightly process she went through {{in the setting of}} her curls was tedious and grueling, with once a week vinegar rinses burning her eyes. Rumors also spread about her hair color, namely that she wasn't a natural blonde. During the making of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, news spread {{that she was going to}} do extended scenes without her trademark curls. During production, she also caught a cold, which caused her to miss a couple of days. As a result, a false report originated in Britain that all of her hair was cut off.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not on your life," [...] {{he laughed}} jubilantly. [...] "All she'd done {{was to put}} a washtub on the ground square under the {{demijohn}}. Then she got out her old rifle an' shot the demijohn to smithereens, an' all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> lap the whisky outa the tub." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{the little}} girl stayed on. Jerry never dreamed of how much <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his future life.|$|R
60|$|That was Florence all over. Even {{when she}} patted {{you on the}} head, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with her knuckles.|$|R
60|$|Everyone looked rather {{blank and}} amazed, except the Story Girl. She knew what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and <b>she</b> did it.|$|R
60|$|Pauline, to {{whom the}} {{brothers}} now looked, shook her head. Never before, she said, had she occasion to trouble her brain about a light. When she wanted one in England, all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to call for one, or strike a match. What was {{to be done in}} their present circumstances she had not the smallest conception.|$|E
60|$|She was {{to sing in}} one of {{the most}} fashionable salons in England: that was very pleasant. The Prince of Wales would hear and see her! that opened out a vista of {{delightful}} possibilities! And all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to act a part dictated to her by Citizen Chauvelin, to behave as he directed, to move in the way he wished! Well! that was easy enough, since the part which she would have to play was one peculiarly suited to her talents.|$|E
60|$|The Nugget {{was sitting}} on the floor, gaping feebly, and awed for the moment into silence. Audrey, in the far corner, looked pale but composed. Her {{behaviour}} was perfect. There was nothing for her to do, and she was doing it with a quiet self-control which won my admiration. Her manner seemed to me exactly suited to the exigencies of the situation. With a super-competent dare-devil like myself in charge of affairs, all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to wait and not get in the way.|$|E
60|$|She locked {{her door}} and opened her writing-desk. Knowing what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>she</b> tried <b>to</b> collect herself and do it.|$|R
5000|$|Remember: In {{this example}} Alice picks only one bit b and signs it. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{that for every}} single bit in her message ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{lucky to}} live in an age when you can do so. Your mother, for instance, couldn't. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> her {{thinking}} at home--under inspection." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} a cold, damp face (Grizel was always in such a hurry) {{when she opened her}} most {{precious}} drawer and took from it a certain glove which was wrapped in silk paper, but was not perhaps quite so conceited as it had been, for, alas and alack! it was now used as a wrapper itself. The ring was inside it. If Grizel wanted to be engaged, absolutely and at once, all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to slip that ring upon her finger.|$|E
60|$|Despite our {{refusal to}} grant {{permission}} to do the deed, she went on with it. Now Anna Roylston was a fascinating woman. All <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to beckon a man to her. She broke the hearts of scores of our young comrades, and scores of others she captured, and by their heart-strings led into our organization. Yet she steadfastly refused to marry. She dearly loved children, but she held that a child of her own would claim her from the Cause, {{and that it was}} the Cause to which her life was devoted.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{followed}} the fateful interview. The lady was satisfied {{that she had}} got hold of the right person at last--the {{one in the world}} who would be able to save her precious little one [...] "from to die," [...] the poor pining infant on whose frail little life so much depended! She would feed it from her full, healthy breasts and give it something of her own abounding, splendid life. Martha's own baby would do very well--there was nothing the matter with it, and it would flourish on [...] "the bottle" [...] or anything else, no matter what. All <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to go back to her cottage and make the necessary arrangements, then come to stay at the mansion.|$|E
6000|$|... "But tell me, {{what can}} <b>she</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> I thought you London ladies <b>had</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but <b>to</b> sit {{with your hands}} before you {{entertaining}} company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. What we {{want for}} Salome is {{sweetness}} and delicacy and refinement; for <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> rather a bold thing, and yet keep herself a lady." ...|$|R
60|$|I then {{showed her}} a small plan of Harmer Place, which I had drawn from my {{recollection}} of it, and Sarah understood perfectly what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|Sophy {{commenced}} her new {{duties in}} earnest, and Father Eustace very soon {{had reason to}} congratulate himself on his change of domestics, and on the advent of this quiet, respectable-looking woman {{in the place of}} his former garrulous and slatternly old servant; and he soon felt a great increase of comfort in his domestic arrangements. This new servant was scrupulously neat and tidy. What little cooking <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>was</b> sure to be well done; and above all, she was always at home, and, come in when he would, she was there at her work, instead of gossiping about the village, as he had frequently found it the case before: his only regret was that the change had not taken place years earlier.|$|E
6000|$|Cornelia was tempted. She {{could see}} how he had wrought himself up to this pitch, and she {{believed}} that he would keep his word; we believe such miracles of those we love, before life has taught us that love cannot make nature err against itself. In his absence the duty <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> hard; in his presence it seemed impossible, now when he asked her not to do it. She had not expected ever to see him again, or to be tried in this way. She had just written it all to him, but she must speak it now. She had been weak, and had brought on herself the worst she had to tell, and should she be false, even though he wished it, and not tell? ...|$|E
6000|$|More tears flashed into Mrs. Durgin's eyes, {{but they}} were tears of wrath now. [...] "I would 'a' done it," [...] she said, [...] "if I thought {{every single one of}} 'em would 'a' left the house the next minute, for there a'n't one that has the first word to say against me, any other way. It wa'n't that I cared whether she thought my son was good enough to eat with her or not; I know what I think, and that's enough for me. He wa'n't invited to the picnic, and he a'n't one to put himself forward. If she didn't want him to stay, all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to do nothin'. But to make him up a plate before everybody, and hand it to him to eat with the horses, like a tramp or a dog--" [...] Mrs. Durgin filled to the throat with her wrath, and the sight of her made Westover keenly unhappy.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{been sent}} for, {{on the very}} face of it, to work right in. All <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> after all, was {{to be nice to}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quite {{disgusted with}} her, papa,' said Fanny. 'I really don't see what <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with my marriage. Let her keep {{to her own}} matrimonial projects--if <b>she</b> <b>has</b> any.' ...|$|R
50|$|Terry <b>had</b> <b>to</b> drop {{a couple}} of pounds {{in the last couple}} of hours to make her desired weight class, which has taken a toll on her. If she can come in at 118 lb, she can compete as a {{lightweight}} and put her up against women her size. If she comes in at over 118 lb, she will compete as a middle weight, which is not her desired weight class. She never said what she <b>did</b> in order <b>to</b> get down to her preferred weight, but said <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
6000|$|And she {{had promised}} him. He needed her. The words {{she had spoken}} to Madge, not dreaming then of their swift application. They came back to her. [...] "God has called me. He girded His sword upon me." [...] What right had she to leave it rusting in its scabbard, turning aside from the pathway pointed out to her because of one weak, useless life, {{crouching}} in her way. It was not {{as if she were}} being asked to do evil herself that good might come. The decision had been taken out of her hands. All <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to remain quiescent, not interfering, awaiting her orders. Her business was with her own part, not with another's. To be willing to sacrifice oneself: that was at the root of all service. Sometimes it was one's own duty, sometimes that of another. Must one never go forward because another steps out of one's way, voluntarily? Besides, she might have been mistaken. That picture, ever before her, of the woman pausing with the brush above her tongue--that little stilled gasp! It may have been but a phantasm, born of her own fevered imagination. She clung to that, desperately.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} upon nettles {{to hear what}} your reverence would say," [...] {{continued}} Dame Glendinning, [...] "respecting this matter--There is nothing I would not do for the Lady of Avenel and her family, {{and that has been}} proved, and for her servants to boot, both Martin and Tibb, although Tibb is not so civil sometimes as altogether I have a right to expect; but I cannot think it beseeming to have angels, or ghosts, or fairies, or the like, waiting upon a leddy when she is in another woman's house, in respect it is no ways creditable. Ony thing <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> always done to her hand, without costing her either pains or pence, as a country body says; and besides the discredit, I cannot but think that there is no safety in having such unchancy creatures about ane. But I have tied red thread round the bairns's throats," [...] (so her fondness still called them,) [...] "and given ilka ane of them a riding-wand of rowan-tree, forby sewing up a slip of witch-elm into their doublets; and I wish to know of your reverence if there be ony thing mair that a lone woman can do in the matter of ghosts and fairies?--Be here! that I should have named their unlucky names twice ower!" ...|$|E
60|$|No female {{heart was}} ever {{less prone to}} {{suspicion}} than the heart of Florence Burton. Among those {{with whom she had}} been most intimate nothing had occurred to teach her that men could be false, or women either. When she had heard from Harry Clavering the story of Julia Brabazon, she had, not making much accusation against the sinner in speech, put Julia down in the books of her mind as a bold, bad woman, who could forget her sex, and sell her beauty and her womanhood for money. There might be such a woman here and there, or such a man. There were murderers in the world--but the bulk of mankind is not made subject to murderers. Florence had never considered the possibility that she herself could become liable to such a misfortune. And then, when the day came that she was engaged, her confidence in the man chosen by her was unlimited. Such love as hers rarely suspects. He with whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> Harry Clavering, and therefore she could not be deceived. Moreover, she was supported by a self-respect and a self-confidence which did not at first allow her to dream that a man who had once loved her would ever wish to leave her. It was to her as though a sacrament as holy as that of the church had passed between them, and she could not easily bring herself to think that that sacrament had been as nothing to Harry Clavering. But nevertheless there was something wrong, and when she left her father's house at Stratton, she was well aware that she must prepare herself for tidings that might be evil. She could bear anything, she thought, without disgracing herself; but there were tidings which might send her back to Stratton a broken woman, fit perhaps to comfort the declining years of her father and mother, but fit for nothing else.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it?" [...] said Cornelia, not so {{much with}} preoccupation, perhaps, as with indifference. She thought it rather a nice name, {{but she did not}} know what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lor', no, miss; {{she told}} Andrew {{that she was}} only six months up from the country, and they don't pay her but eight pounds a year, and pretty hard work <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{nine years}} old <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the {{housework}} and be a mother to the other two, besides going to school. This is all because Lady Malloring has conscientious scruples about marriage with a deceased wife's sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|As Captain Poke and myself, {{notwithstanding}} our {{having taken}} different stands in politics, still {{continued to live}} together, I had better opportunities to note {{the workings of the}} obscuration on the ingenuous mind of my colleague than on that of most other persons. He early began to keep a diary of his expenses, regularly deducting the amount at night from the sum of eight dollars, and regarding the balance as so much clear gain. His conversation, too, soon betrayed a leaning to his personal interests, instead of being of that pure and elevated cast which should characterize the language of a statesman. He laid down the position, pretty dogmatically, that legislation, after all, was work; that [...] "the laborer was worthy of his hire"; and that, for his part, he felt no great disposition to go through the vexation and trouble of helping to make laws, unless he could see, with a reasonable certainty, that something was to be got by it. He thought Leaplow had quite laws enough as it was--more than she respected or enforced--and if she wanted any more, all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> to pay for them. He should take an early occasion to propose that all our wages--or, at any rate, his own; others might do as they pleased--should be raised, at the very least, two dollars a day, and this while he merely sat in the house; for he wished to engage me to move, by way of amendment, that as much more should be given to the committees. He did not think it was fair to exact of a member to be a committee-man for nothin', although most of them were committee-men for nothin'; and if we were called on to keep two watches, in this manner, the least that could be done would be to give us TWO PAYS. He said, considering it in the most favorable point of view, that there was great wear and tear of brain in legislation, and he should never be the man he was before he engaged in the trade; he assured me that his idees, sometimes, were so complicated {{that he did not know}} where to find the one he wanted, and that he had wished for a cauda, a thousand times, since he had been in the house, for, by keeping the end of it in his hand, like the bight of a rope, he might always have suthin' tangible to cling to. He told me, as a great secret, that he was fairly tired of rummaging among his thoughts for the knowledge necessary to understand what was going on, and that he had finally concluded to put himself, for the rest of the session, under the convoy of a God-like. He had been looking out for a fit fugleman of this sort, and he had pretty much determined to follow the signal of the great God-like of the Parpendic'lars, like the rest of them, for it would occasion less confusion in the ranks, and enable him to save himself a vast deal of trouble in making up his mind. He didn't know, on the whole, but eight dollars a day might give a living profit, provided he could throw all the thinking on his God-like, and turn his attention to suthin' else; he thought of writing his v'y'ges, for he understood that anything from foreign parts took like wild-fire in Leaplow; and if they didn't take, he could always project charts for a living.|$|E
50|$|The privileged owner {{need not}} go to Church to say his prayers or plead for salvation; all he or <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> open the {{shutters}} of the tabernacle {{in an act of}} private revelation. Duccio and his contemporaries inherited early pictorial conventions that were maintained, in part, to tie their own works to the authority of tradition.|$|E
5000|$|Turan, who had granted Tommy Troy {{the power}} to become the Fly, gave Kim a ring with a fly-shaped emblem. By rubbing the ring and saying [...] "I wish I were Flygirl," [...] she {{exchanged}} bodies with the Fly People's dimension and became a costumed superheroine. To return to her own identity, all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> utter her name.|$|E
60|$|She laughed again. I {{wanted her}} to go on talking, because her laugh was so delightful. But we had reached the road, {{and she said she}} must go back: there were so many things <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|All <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{at present}} was {{to listen to}} Miss Bracy, who was sure that Mrs. Rivers thought Mary and Blanche were not improved, and was afraid she was ungrateful for all the {{intended}} kindness to her sister.|$|R
60|$|Could she {{with her}} hands fight {{the face of the}} earth, beat the hills in their places? Yet her breast wanted to fight, to fight the whole world. And these two small hands were all <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it with.|$|R
