50|$|Upon {{completion}} of refitting, Bowfin got underway on 1 November {{and headed for}} the South China Sea. From time to time during this patrol, she again cooperated with Billfish. On 8 November, Bowfin picked up the trail of a group of five schooners.

After staying down until dark, Bowfin surfaced and resumed patrolling. Before long, she discovered and opened fire upon a large sailing ship which went down after suffering hits by two four-inch shells. Two days later, she found her next victims, a pair of small <b>steamers</b> <b>heading</b> for Tawi-Tawi Bay, and set both ablaze with gunfire.|$|R

25|$|EXCURSION TO MIDDLE HARBOUR – About 150 persons {{proceeded}} on an excursion on Saturday afternoon by the Steamer Herald to {{the head}} of Middle Harbour. The magnificent scenery which surround the placid waters of this beautiful lake-like locality is very little known by the general public, many of whom fancy that the Spit {{is the head of the}} navigation, whereas a steamer of a light draught, such as tho Herald, can proceed several miles beyond. The Herald left the Circular Quay at half-past 1 pm on Saturday, and, after calling at Woolloomooloo Bay, reached Bates at half-past 4. Mr. George Hall was on board, and to that gentleman some of the excursionists were indebted for his courtesy in pointing out objects of interest met with on the passage. After a delay of about a quarter of au hour, during which time several of the passengers went on ashore in search of flowers, the <b>steamer's</b> <b>head</b> was turned for Sydney, where the party was landed in good time and thoroughly well pleased with their trip.|$|R

[...] Halsted, his students, and fellow physicians experimented on each other, and demonstrated that cocaine could produce safe and effective local anesthesia when applied topically and when injected. [...] In the process, Halsted became addicted to the drug. [...] His close friend Harvey Firestone recognized the gravity of the situation, and arranged for Halsted to be abducted and put aboard a <b>steamer</b> <b>headed</b> for Europe. [...] In the two weeks it took to complete the voyage, Halsted underwent an early, crude form of detoxification. [...] Upon his return to the United States he became addicted again, and was sent to Butler Sanatorium in Providence, Rhode Island, where they attempted to cure his cocaine addiction with morphine. [...] Although he remained dependent upon morphine for the remainder of his life, he continued his career as a pioneering surgeon; many of his innovations remain standard operating room procedures.|$|R

From the natives then in possession of the camp, the searchers learned that the Polaris crew had departed the previous June in boats constructed of materials salvaged from the ship and that Polaris herself sank soon thereafter. Tigress crew gathered what papers and instruments they found in the camp and reembarked.|$|R
