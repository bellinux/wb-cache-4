25|$|Silk moths {{lay eggs}} on {{specially}} prepared paper. The eggs hatch and the caterpillars (silkworms) are fed fresh mulberry leaves. After about 35 days and 4 moltings, the caterpillars are 10,000 times heavier than when hatched and {{are ready to}} begin <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon.</b> A straw frame is placed over the tray of caterpillars, and each caterpillar begins <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> by moving its head in a pattern. Two glands produce liquid silk and force it through openings in the head called spinnerets. Liquid silk is coated in sericin, a water-soluble protective gum, and solidifies on contact with the air. Within 2–3 days, the caterpillar spins about 1 mile of filament and is completely encased in a cocoon. The silk farmers then heat the cocoons to kill them, leaving some to metamorphose into moths to breed {{the next generation of}} caterpillars. Harvested cocoons are then soaked in boiling water to soften the sericin holding the silk fibers together in a cocoon shape. The fibers are then unwound to produce a continuous thread. Since a single thread is too fine and fragile for commercial use, anywhere from three to ten strands are spun together to form a single thread of silk.|$|E
25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} singly {{in a cell}} in a wax honeycomb, {{produced}} and shaped by the worker bees. Using her spermatheca, the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on into which cell she is laying. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are haploid, while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are diploid. Larvae are initially fed with royal jelly produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on royal jelly, which will develop into a queen bee. The larva undergoes several moultings before <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> within the cell, and pupating.|$|E
500|$|The Silk Pavilion, an {{installation}} designed in 2013, was {{noted for its}} fabrication method as much as its final form. [...] It was woven by 6,500 free-ranging silkworms on a nylon-frame dome. [...] Experiments with the silkworms identified how they would respond to different surfaces, and what would encourage them to spin onto an existing structure rather than <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon.</b> [...] The frame of a large polyhedral dome was loosely woven by a robotic arm out of thin nylon threads, and suspended in an open room. [...] The dome was designed with gaps {{where it would be}} warmest. [...] Silkworms were released onto the frame in waves, where they added layers of silk before being removed. [...] This involved engineering, sericulture, and modelling sun in the room. [...] The resulting installation art was hung so that people could stand inside it.|$|E

25|$|Most moth {{caterpillars}} <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> made of silk {{within which}} they metamorphose into the pupal stage. Most butterfly caterpillars, {{on the other}} hand, form an exposed pupa, also termed a chrysalis.|$|R
50|$|By early summer, a larva has {{consumed}} all of {{its provisions}} and begins <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> around itself and enters the pupal stage; the adult, flying mother dies off as the season progresses.|$|E
50|$|The {{life cycle}} of the moth {{is typical of the}} Saturniidae species, and typical of the Ceratocampinae. It burrows into the ground to pupate in an earthen chamber, rather than <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon.</b>|$|E

50|$|The larvae feed on Salix species, {{including}} Salix repens. They <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> leaf {{of their}} host plant, forming an enclosed pod or cone from inside which it feeds. Full-grown larvae <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> amongst the leaf litter {{in which it}} overwinters. Pupation takes place within this cocoon.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Knautia arvensis and Scabiosa species. They feed in the seedheads {{of their}} host plant.

5000|$|... ==Overview== Sclerogibbidae are ectoparasitoids of Embioptera. The female wasp oviposits an egg on {{the abdomen}} of a host. Once the larva emerges, it {{attaches}} itself to its host. After the host is consumed, the larva detaches {{itself from the}} carcass and <b>spins</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... == Biology == Hybrizon {{is unusual}} {{in that it is}} an endoparasitoid of ants. Female wasps oviposit into larval ants while they are being transported outside of the nest by worker ants. Oviposition is carried out very quickly, in less than one second. Immature Hybrizon pupate within the ant nest without <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Flea larvae {{metamorphose}} {{through four}} stages before <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> and entering the pupal stage. The cocoon is adhesive, and quickly acquires {{a coat of}} camouflage from surrounding dirt and dust. Pupation depends heavily on temperature and moisture, and takes {{a week or more}} to complete, though a fully pupated adult can remain inside of its cocoon in a state of semi-dormancy (called the [...] "pupal window") awaiting signs of the presence of a host.|$|E

50|$|Spongillafly larvae {{leave the}} water and go to hidden places nearby to pupate, {{choosing}} locations like beneath rocks or behind tree bark. They <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> for pupation, but in temperate climates they overwinter in the cocoon as larvae, pupating only the following spring.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 6 - 8 mm. Adults are on wing {{from the}} end of June and from the beginning to the end of August. Larvae of the autumn generation <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> at the beginning of November and hibernate. The adults appear in May of the following year. There are three generations per year.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{weeks of}} {{hatching}} the larva has probably consumed {{all of its}} provisions and begins <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> around itself and enters the pupal stage, and the adult matures either in the fall or winter, hibernating inside its insulatory cocoon. Most Osmia species are found in places where the temperature drops below 0°C for long durations and they are well-adapted to cold winters; chilling {{seems to be a}} requirement for maturation. [...] Some species of mason bees are semi-voltine, meaning that they have a two year maturation cycle, with a full year (plus) spent as a larva.|$|E

The larva undergoes several moultings before <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> within the cell, and pupating.|$|E
5000|$|The {{luna moth}} pupates after <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon.</b> The cocoon is thin and single layered. Shortly before pupation, the final, fifth instar {{caterpillar}} will {{engage in a}} [...] "gut dump" [...] where any excess water, food, feces, and fluids are expelled. The caterpillar will also have an underlying golden reddish‐brown color and become less active. As a pupa, this species is particularly active. When disturbed, if it feels threatened the moth will wiggle within its pupal case, producing a noise. Pupation takes approximately two weeks unless the individual is diapausing. The mechanisms for diapause are generally a mixture of genetic triggers, duration of sunlight or direct light during the day, and temperature.|$|E
5000|$|Young larvae {{eat their}} way through the royal jelly in a {{circular}} pattern until they become crowded, then they stretch out lengthwise in the cell. Soon they begin to <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon,</b> and their older sisters cap the cell as they go into the pupa stage. These cells collectively are called [...] "capped brood." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> grayish <b>cocoon</b> in bark crevices {{and incorporate}} setae in it. The moths emerge after 2 weeks.|$|R
25|$|In {{preparation}} to this, it eats a circular {{hole through the}} shell in February and closes it again with a silken plug. This is to enable the jawless adult moth {{to escape from the}} seed. After completion of the exit hole it <b>spins</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> within the seed, with a passageway leading to the door. During the following pupal stage the larva will not move any more.|$|R
5000|$|One Sunday morning, a red-faced {{caterpillar}} hatches from an egg, {{and begins}} to look for some food. He eats through increasing quantities of fruit on the following five days, one apple on Monday, two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, four strawberries on Thursday, and five oranges on Friday, and then, on Saturday, he has an enormous feast. By the end of Saturday, the inevitable happens and he is ill. After recovering from a stomach-ache, he returns to a more sensible diet by eating through a large green leaf before <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> in which he remains for the following 2 weeks. Later, the [...] "big fat caterpillar" [...] emerges as a beautiful butterfly with large, gorgeous, multi-coloured wings.|$|E

40|$|Relational epistemologies and ontologies of {{indigenous}} populations {{call into question}} the legitimacy of colonial sovereign foundations. Referring to Derrida's sketch of the impossible, Watson writes: 'My suggestion is that the moment of 'impossibility' in recognizing the sovereignty of Aboriginal laws, is the moment which provides Australians with the opportunity to 'take responsibility' {{in order to have a}} future' (2006, p. 26). Nevertheless the colonial law that presumes settled foundations continues to deny any need to address its own legitimacy. Derrida (2005) argues that progressive reason consigns to forgetting its historical and subjective origins, likening this to a spider <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> of autoimmunity to preserve its right to reason determinately rather than boldly traversing its web. Is it possible for reason to speculate reasonably with itself? (p. 127 - 140) ...|$|E
50|$|Mutilla europaea {{are mainly}} parasitoids of the resting stage of {{bumblebees}} (Bombus spp.), but occasionally visits honey bee (Apis mellifera) hives and Polistes wasps nests, ovipositing inside the cocoons. The larva of this wasp eats the immature bumblebee larva and nymphs and {{feed on the}} host honey and pollen stores. Then the larva of Mutilla <b>spins</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> inside the cell of its host.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Aster alpinus, Aster amellus and Aster bellidiastrum. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine starts with a very shallow lower-surface corridor, {{continuing}} as a large full depth tentiform mine. The upper surface shows a distinct keel. Within this keel the larva <b>spins</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon,</b> in which it retires during feeding pauses. Pupation takes place outside of the mine.|$|R

40|$|Details of {{the biology}} of the braconid {{subfamily}} Sigalphinae, based on rearings of Acampsis alternipes (Nees), are provided for the first time. A. alternipes is a solitary, koinobiont larval endoparasitoid of the geometrid moth Alsophila Hübner, though there is an external feeding phase prior to <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> and pupation. Two features are of potential phylogenetic significance indicating {{a close relationship with}} the subfamily Agathidinae: (1) eggs are deposited in the host's nerve ganglia, and (2) the first-instar larva is polypodiform. A. alternipes completes development in the autumn and overwinters as a fully eclosed adult within its cocoon, enabling it to emerge and search for hosts early in spring. The posterior of the eclosed adult within the cocoon is immersed in a viscous liquid that also surrounds the meconium. Chemical analysis of this liquid revealed that it comprises at least 25...|$|E
40|$|Host {{manipulation}} by parasites {{not only}} captures the imagination but has important epidemiological implications. The conventional {{view is that}} parasites face a trade-off between the benefits of host manipulation and their costs to fitness-related traits, such as longevity and fecundity. However, this trade-off hypothesis remains to be tested. Dinocampus coccinellae is a common parasitic wasp of the spotted lady beetle Coleomegilla maculata. Females deposit a single egg in the haemocoel of the host, and during larval development the parasitoid feeds on host tissues. At the prepupal stage, the parasitoid egresses from its host by forcing {{its way through the}} coccinellid's abdominal segments and begins <b>spinning</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> between the ladybird's legs. Remarkably, D. coccinellae does not kill its host during its development, an atypical feature for parasitoids. We first showed under laboratory conditions that parasitoid cocoons that were attended by a living and manipulated ladybird suffered less predation than did cocoons alone or cocoons under dead ladybirds. We then demonstrated that the length of the manipulation period is negatively correlated with parasitoid fecundity but not with longevity. In addition to documenting an original case of bodyguard manipulation, our study provides the first evidence of a cost required for manipulating host behaviour...|$|E
50|$|The {{advanced}} art {{has eight}} levels {{and at the}} highest level would allow the practitioner to <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> around his body.

5000|$|Mason bees host {{a number}} of {{different}} parasites. The kleptoparasitic pollen mite Chaetodactylus krombeini is found especially in wetter parts of its range; it can starve the Osmia larvae by consuming the larval pollen mass. The Sapygid wasp, Sapyga sp, is also a kleptoparasite, with the larvae feeding on the pollen. Stelis montana is a cuckoo bee that sometimes invades nests. Both Stelis and Sapyga larvae <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> and develop in the Osmia nest.|$|R
50|$|The beetle is {{omnivorous}} but favors plant material. It {{can live}} {{for up to}} 3 years but most individuals die after breeding during their first year. The larvae feed on freshwater snails of the family Lymnaeidae, drilling holes into the shells to feed on the animals. The grubs can then reach 7 centimeters long before pupating in the mud. In the spring, the adult female <b>spins</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon,</b> fills it with eggs, and sets it afloat.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Eulychnia acida and Trichocereus chiloensis. They feed on {{and within}} the fruit of their host plant. They enter the fruit at the base and tunnel into the seed cavity. When an infested fruit rots, the larvae move to an {{adjacent}} fruit. When full grown, the larvae lower themselves to the ground by <b>a</b> thread and <b>spin</b> <b>a</b> <b>cocoon</b> among the debris where pupation takes place. The larvae are blue to blue green.|$|R
