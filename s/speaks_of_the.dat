On arriving in Meluha and consuming the Somras (a potion), his throat turns blue making him the Neelkanth of the Meluhan legend, which <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appearance of Neelkanth as a destroyer of evil. The Meluhans end up believing that Shiva would be their saviour.|$|E
5|$|The ballad <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wabash River, which {{flows through}} Indiana, and reminisces about events that {{occurred}} there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Roman Empire, Barbarians plundered the region around Klis. First it was ruled by Odoacer, and then by the Theodoric the Great, after he {{eliminated}} Odoacer, and set up an Ostrogothic Kingdom. After Justinian I fought an almost continual war for forty years to recover the old Roman Empire, he seized Dalmatia, and Klis was from 537, a part of Byzantine Empire. The name of Klis (Kleisa or Kleisoura) was first described in chapter 29 of Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus' De Administrando Imperio. While describing the Roman settlement of Salona, Constantine VII <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stronghold, which may have been designed or improved, to prevent attacks on the coastal cities and roads by Slavs.|$|E
5|$|In 1835, Smith {{encouraged}} some Latter Day Saints in Kirtland {{to purchase}} rolls of ancient Egyptian papyri from a traveling exhibitor. Over {{the next several}} years, Smith worked to produce what he reported was a translation {{of one of these}} rolls, which was published in 1842 as the Book of Abraham. The Book of Abraham <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founding of the Abrahamic nation, astronomy, cosmology, lineage and priesthood, and gives another account of the creation story. The papyri from which Smith dictated the Book of Abraham were thought to have been lost in the Great Chicago Fire. However, several fragments were rediscovered in the 1960s, were translated by Egyptologists, and were determined {{to be part of the}} Book of the Dead with no connection to Abraham.|$|E
5|$|Less {{relevant}} is {{the other}} 6th-century source, Jordanes' Romana. Of Gothic ancestry, Jordanes served as a notarius for a Byzantine Master of the Soldiers before entering {{into the ranks of}} the Catholic clergy and writing his two surviving books, the Romana and the Getica. The latter is a summary of Gothic history, while the lesser known Romana is an abridged account of Roman history written in 551 or 552. According to James O'Donnell, the two works share a pessimistic view of human life in which all secular accomplishments are insignificant compared to religious goals. Jordanes does not explicitly mention Thurisind in the Romana, but <b>speaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third Lombard–Gepid War, in which Thurisind participated, in the last passages of the work.|$|E

The Meluhans end up believing that Shiva would be their saviour. Shiva searches for the source of Evil, and deciding that it is Somras which would destroy India, he declares war to eradicate the drink completely. His deeds and accomplishments in saving India from its dangers makes him the Mahadev (Great God).|$|E

50|$|Contrary {{to what is}} {{sometimes}} believed, Jean-Jacques Rousseau never used the phrase noble savage (French bon sauvage). However, <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> noble savage appeared in French literature at least as early as Jacques Cartier (coloniser <b>of</b> Québec, <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iroquois) and Michel de Montaigne (philosopher, <b>speaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tupinamba) in the 16th century.|$|R
