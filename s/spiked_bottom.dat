50|$|The current {{coat of arms}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina {{presents}} the typical straight top, oval sides, and <b>spiked</b> <b>bottom.</b> The coat of arms has two background colors, dark blue and gold. Both colors are seen in the coat of arms between 1992 and 1998. Even though the current coat of arms does not directly relate with Bosnian-Herzegovinian history, the colors that were used were the ones from the former coat of arms. The top right corner forms a yellow triangle symbolizing the shape of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the blue covering the remaining portions of the flag portraying the sky, rivers and lakes.|$|E

30|$|We {{continue}} the iterative procedure until a converged solution has been obtained. In {{the first three}} panels of Figure  1, {{it can be seen}} that subsequent simulations with higher precision shift the curve to lower values of δ. Superposed on the steady growth of the error are sharp spikes, where the error grows by several orders of magnitude, after which the error restores again (Miller 1964). These spikes are dominated by errors in the velocity, as can be deduced by comparing the magnitude of the spikes in position and velocity-space. Eccentric binaries which are out of phase when comparing two solutions cause large, periodic errors in the velocity. We finish the procedure when a solution is obtained for which the criterion for convergence is fulfilled, considering the magnitude of the error between the sharp <b>spikes</b> (<b>bottom,</b> black curves).|$|R

50|$|Because {{baseball}} {{shoes are}} <b>spiked</b> on the <b>bottom,</b> sliding with the spikes up increases {{the probability of}} injury to the defensive player covering the base. Knowledge of this fact can often increase the defensive player's fear of the possible contact from an impending slide and thus increase his distraction while attempting to make a play. Ty Cobb developed nine different ways to slide into a base.|$|R
50|$|The shield {{features}} {{the arms of}} the state of Maryland, which historically derives from the quartered arms of the Calvert and Crossland families. Its main color is blue, highlighted with silver. Beneath the shield is a scroll in blue, displaying the motto Timete Deum Solum et Ignominiam ("Fear Only God and Dishonor") inscribed in gold letters. This is all superimposed upon a trident wreathed in laurel decorated with seven stars. The trident's <b>bottom</b> <b>spike</b> is flanked by two dolphins.|$|R
50|$|Borgentreich's civic {{coat of arms}} has as one {{charge a}} rather unusual cross with a <b>spike</b> on the <b>bottom.</b> The old arms, which simply showed in gules a cross pattée Or, had this same spiked cross, {{although}} {{all four of the}} cross's arms were the same length. This kind of cross can also be seen in Verden's coat of arms, and may derive from the arms borne by the princely bishopric of Paderborn. The old composition is known from a town seal from 1341.|$|R
5000|$|Barney Bear finds a small {{clearing}} in {{the woods}} and begins to set up camp. He starts off by inflating a [...] "Snuggly Wuggly Air Mattress Sleeping Bag", then gets changed to his pyjamas, with all the animals watching him. Barney scares them off, puts on his PJs and throws his boot at a noisy wolf, only to have it thrown back at him. Unbeknownst to him, a porcupine had snuck under Barney's covers. He finally goes to bed and runs up a tree when the porcupine <b>spikes</b> his <b>bottom.</b> Barney gets back down and sets up bear traps and mouse traps around his camp, only to fall for them himself when a squirrel wakes him up with the radio. Barney falls asleep after hearing a lullaby, but accidentally pumps a lot more air into his sleeping bag, blowing it up. Rain then begins to pour and cause a flood, to which Barney decides to sleep under.|$|R
5000|$|The Kpinga (also {{called the}} Hunga Munga) was a bladed {{throwing}} knife {{used by the}} Azande of Nubia. It would have been about 22 inches in length and had three different shaped blades projecting at different angles to maximize damage to the enemy. It is said that the <b>bottom</b> <b>spike</b> is meant to resemble a man's penis. They were classed as [...] "Court Metal", being produced under the patronage of the powerful Avongara clan, and distributed only to professional warriors and considered status symbols. It was {{also part of the}} dowry that a man must pay to the bride's family.|$|R
5000|$|Dark {{blue and}} gold are the colors {{traditionally}} associated with the United States Navy. The arms of Maryland hail the state's historical roots, while the submarine indicates the present-day Maryland is an Ohio-class submarine. The trident represents U.S. Navy weaponry and sea prowess; its <b>bottom</b> <b>spike</b> points to the ocean depths, the area of Marylands operations. The heraldic dolphins symbolize speed, intelligence, {{and the ability to}} penetrate the deep. The laurel wreath is emblematic of excellence and accomplishment; its seven stars commemorate both the seven battle stars that battleship [...] earned in World War II and that the state of Maryland was the seventh state to be admitted to the Union.|$|R
5000|$|The rebab (ربابة, rabāb, {{variously}} spelled rebap, rabab, rebeb, rababa and rabeba, {{also known}} as [...] jawza or joza in Iraq) {{is a type of}} a bowed string instrument so named no later than the 8th century and spread via Islamic trading routes over much of North Africa, the Middle East, parts of Europe, and the Far East. The bowed variety often has a <b>spike</b> at the <b>bottom</b> to rest on the ground (see first image to the right), and is thus called a spike fiddle in certain areas, but plucked versions like the kabuli rebab (sometimes referred to as the robab or rubab) also exist.|$|R
5000|$|The {{four stars}} on the {{submarines}} bow indicate that Louisiana the fourth U.S. Navy ship to bear the name. The laurel symbolizes each crew member's commitment to honorable service to their country and ship. The tridents symbolize naval weaponry, both past and present, and sea prowess. Their <b>bottom</b> <b>spikes</b> pierce the Louisiana state motto, anchoring it, while pointing toward the ocean depths where the ship patrols. An iris with three petals was once the armorial emblem of French sovereigns, and it is often used {{as a symbol of}} the state of Louisiana; here it represents France's strong influence on the State of Louisiana. The banner with the inscription [...] "Union, Justice, and Confidence" [...] proclaims the Louisiana state motto. Wrapping the banner around the ship symbolizes the crew's strong esprit de corps with the people of the state of Louisiana. The crawfish further symbolizes the cultural heritage of the people of the state of Louisiana.|$|R
5000|$|The longest running {{point of}} {{contention}} is the refusal by the Opera House Trust to allow the orchestra to drill small holes into the concert hall stage to allow proper seating of the endpins (<b>spikes</b> on the <b>bottom)</b> of their cellos and double basses, which is believed to give a better resonance to these instruments. The orchestra seats their endpins in planks of wood placed on the stage, as the Opera House Trust maintains that the entire building is heritage-listed under Australian law and that such work would therefore be illegal. Edo de Waart was particularly critical of this during his tenure as Chief Conductor in the 1990s, arguing in the press that the building had been specifically constructed for the orchestra {{and that it was}} a scandal that the orchestra was being forced to accept a reduced sound quality. However, the Opera House Trust has refused to bend and as of 2012 the orchestra was still using the planks of wood.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{portion of}} the cross, which is now mounted on a much later stand, is 15.75 inches high and 11.81 inches wide, excluding the <b>spike</b> at the <b>bottom</b> for fitting into its stand. The cross was restored in 2009; it has been altered and restored at several points in its history, including reducing its size. [...] The front of the cross has no figurative images: in the centre is a medallion containing the relic, which is itself displayed as cross-shaped. The centres of the arms carry the inscriptions, and {{the edges of the}} arms jewels in set in gold, with four jewels hanging from the arms as pendilia. The reverse side is decorated in repoussé silver, and shows an interesting transitional stage in the decoration of the cross. At the period the church was starting to encourage representation of the human figure of Christ on the cross, making a crucifix, which had previously not been usual. The central medallion shows the Lamb of God, a common older formula. Above and below this are images in medallions of Christ (the lower one may be John the Baptist instead). The upper one shows Christ holding a book, representing the Gospels, which was to become a standard feature of the image of Christ Pantocrator; in the lower one Christ or John has a blessing gesture. At the ends of the arms, where the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist would often be found in later crucifixes, are instead portraits in medallions of Justin and his empress Sophia. [...] Between the medallions there are decorative foliage scrolling motifs, on the upright centred on onion-like plants probably intended as palm-trees.|$|R
40|$|Large sized dried spikes (LSD) are a {{fundamental}} {{part of the}} fissile material control of irradiated nuclear fuel. They are applied to measure the uranium and plutonium content of dissolved fuel solutions from reprocessing plants using isotope dilution mass-spectrometry (IDMS). Since the first batch of LSDs was produced, the concept of directly spiking samples of the solution with dissolved irradiated nuclear fuel for later dilution and measurement of the isotopic contents of uranium and plutonium has been developed successfully. In the method employed at IRMM, very high quality isotopically enriched metals of uranium (natural and high-enriched) and plutonium are dissolved into a single large solution in nitric acid. Individual spikes are then made by aliquoting weighed amounts of the solution into penicillin vials and drying carefully. A light cellulose layer is dried on the spike material to retain the <b>spike</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of the vial during transport to {{where it will be}} used. The spikes are prepared in large batches (1000 units) under rigorous conditions. Each spike then has a certified mass of uranium (235 U and 238 U) and 239 Pu with an associated uncertainty derived by a rigorous procedure (following the GUM) from the measured and certified parameters of all starting materials and solutions. The plutonium component is highly enriched in 239 Pu and is used to measure the Pu content in the fuel. The uranium component is a mixture of two uranium source materials, natural uranium and a highly enriched uranium component. These materials are mixed to arrive at a final enrichment of just under 20 % in 235 U, significantly simplifying transport and handling of the spikes. A series of verification measurements are carried out during the process and the final spikes are certified from the masses of the metal starting materials, the certified assay (purity) values of uranium and plutonium in the starting materials, the mass of the solution, the mass aliquoted into each vial and the isotopic abundances of each of the starting materials.

50|$|The first humans {{arrived in}} the {{mountains}} after the ice retreated {{at the end of}} the last ice age, about 9000 years ago. This may have been the ancestors of the Sami, a nomadic people living in the Northern Scandinavia. They initially lived by hunting and gathering, the reindeer possibly being their main resource. Sharpening stones, ceramics and clubs have been found at the village of Ammarnäs, quartz shards, arrowheads were found near Tjulträsk and fragments of a stone knife were discovered near Forsavan, south the Tärnasjön. Traces of stone age dwellings can be seen near lakes Biellojaure, Överuman and Stor-Laisan. All these traces and artifacts date back to at least 4,000 to 5,000 years ago. Reindeer pitfall systems have also been discovered in the mountains, in areas where reindeer used to roam during their annual migrations. This was most often set up as holes of about two by three meters, to a depth of one or two meters, often spaced apart twenty or thirty meters from each other. They were covered with grass or leaves, and there were probably <b>spikes</b> at the <b>bottom</b> to kill the animal during its fall. Several complexes of this type traps are present in the reserve. Traps were most often made at the limit of birch forests, however a rare higher altitude trap has been found at Vindelkroken. Some traps were still used up 700-800 years ago, after which the Sami people changed their lifestyle and began to follow domesticated reindeer transhumance rather than trapping wild reindeer. Ten ancient Sami graves have been discovered in the reserve. They were often placed higher up, in order to have a view of the surrounding landscape. Two tombs are located well north of Lake Tärnasjön on a small hill overlooking the bogs. South of Lake Tärnasjön, there are also graves on the islands, dating from the eighteenth and nineteenth century, probably placed there to protect them from predators.|$|R
40|$|The SM- 2 core {{lifetime}} {{was calculated}} and stuck rod criteria formulated. The control system could shutdown the core {{under the most}} adverse conditions with any single rod stuck out. The one-half-inch Eu/sub 2 /O/sub 3 / flux supressors adequately supressed the power <b>spike</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of the core. The nuclear effects of increasing the dimensione of the fuel matrix were calculated. A new analysis of various reactivity measuremerts performed durirg the SM- 2 critical experiments was made to test {{the validity of the}} calculational modes. Twodimensional temperature distributions for the stainless steel vessel shell and flange and for the SM- 2 control rod plates were plotted. The loss of flow experiment was completed on the SM- 1 at Fort Belvoir, and the results agreed with analytical predictions. The SM- 2 fuel element, control rod, core support structure, and vessel designs were completed. Three steel mills indicated they could supply low cobalt, low tantalum type 347 stainless steel. Corrosion testing of irradiated boron-stainless steel was reactivated. Corrosion and impact testing of nut end bolting materials was scheduled. Dysprosium oxide was considered as an alternate absorber material. Two modified SM- 2 fuel aesemblies were fabricated for testing in the Westinghouse Test Reactor loop, and two fuel elements were fabricated for insertion in the SM- 1 core. Work on controlled addition of a burnable poison, such as ZrB/sub 2 /, in fuel plates was continued. Procedures for welding fuel plates to side plates were completed. Automatic weld sequence timing was adopted for improvirg product quality. Pressure losses through the complete flow circuit in the reactor were recalculated and the pressure drop analysis brought up to date. Good flow distribution in the control rod fuel element was obtained in a single element rig. Methods of temperature regulation and corrosion control were established. Extended SM- 2 critical experiments were initiated. Core support design modifications necessary for an accurate flow. divider mockup were completed. Effects of flux suppression upon reactivity and neutron flux {{at the bottom of the}} core were measured. Gamma dose rates were measured over the core support plate and along the control rod basket guide. Prototype testing of the control rod drive mechanism was started. The blocked channel method of measuring fuel element internal temperature in SM- 2 Core I instrumental fuel assembly was selected as the reference design. (M. C. G. ...|$|R
