5|$|Production of the {{new version}} of the opening episode took place in what was to have been a three-week break for the cast between {{production}} blocks. Gina McKee was initially very concerned about having her character's early life story changed when <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> based elements of her later performance on the previously-established version. Eccleston was also unhappy about the sudden changes. However, McKee felt that the new version of episode one eventually made for a much stronger opening to the story.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Carey {{lived with}} her mother Patricia in a small {{apartment}} on Long Island, New York. They were poor and had to move several times as Patricia found different jobs.

5|$|During the war, Hammond {{spent much}} of his leave with Ness-Harvey in South Africa. In 1945, she {{followed}} him back to England, but did not like it.

5|$|Funding was {{a problem}} from the outset. No {{producer}} was willing to finance the film, as it lacked stars, songs and action scenes.

The widow declined as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> permitted Ray to make the film. The estimated budget for the production was 70,000 (about US$14,613 in 1955). One producer, Rana Dutta, gave money to continue shooting, but had to stop after some of his films flopped.|$|E

For example, a person that knows to be too anxious and that anxiety would paralyze her decisions or action, or a person that is phobic of certain conditions, has the goal to avoid to receive Inf that might activate that reaction.|$|R

Maria Theresa's ally, the Elector of Saxony, now became her enemy and GeorgeII declared the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg to be neutral. The Queen {{was once again}} {{in need of help}} from Hungary. In order to obtain it, she granted favours to the Hungarian noblemen and flattered them without conceding to all of their demands. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> won their support when she appeared in Pressburg in September 1741, hoping to persuade the Diet to call a mass conscription and recognise Francis Stephen as co-ruler. Upon achieving both goals, she showed her gift for theatrical displays by triumphantly holding her son and heir, Joseph, before the Diet, thereby gaining sympathy of the noblemen.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Carey was {{discovered}} by Tommy Mottola, CEO of Columbia Records, and was promptly signed to the label. Carey's self-titled debut studio album, released the following year, focused on re-recording and mastering several songs <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>already</b> written in high school alongside classmate, Ben Margulies.
