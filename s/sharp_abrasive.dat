50|$|Preliminary {{excavations}} at {{the beginning}} of January 1961 began near a remote valley named Taruga near the village of Takushara. The trial excavations took place during a period of eight days. The finds included objects of wrought iron, a quantity of iron slag, fragments of tuyere, pottery, figurine fragments, red ocher, quartz hammer-stones, and small concentrations of charcoal. The most famous finds at the site were the pottery graters which were shallow, flat-bottomed dishes which were deeply scored inside with diced patterns to produce a <b>sharp</b> <b>abrasive</b> surface. These pottery graters were probably used for food preparation. In the preliminary excavation a proton magnetometer survey was used to try and locate furnaces. The survey revealed a total of 61 magnetic anomalies which were mostly located in a flat, central area which probably indicated the limits of actual occupation. Twenty of the anomalies revealed concentrations of slag and nine of them contained in situ structures of furnace walls and bases. The most common type of artefact found was domestic pottery which can be divided into two different types. One type are bowls or shallow basins without lips and the other are globular pots which have averted lips. Because of this preliminary excavation, the Nok Culture would start being regarded as belonging to the Iron Age.|$|E
40|$|In {{returning}} {{humans to}} the Moon, the Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Advisory Group (LADTAG) must address many {{problems faced by}} the original Apollo astronauts. Major among these is control of the fine dust (< 20 microns) that makes up approx. 20 wt% portion of the lunar surface. This ubiquitous, clinging, <b>sharp,</b> <b>abrasive,</b> glassy dust caused a plethora of problems with seals, abrasion, and coatings, in addition to possible health problems, including lunar dust hayfever. The lifetime of reactive sites on the surfaces of irradiated lunar dust grains is of interest to those studying human health because of the free radicals and toxic compounds that may be formed and may not passivate quickly when exposed to habitat/spacecraft air...|$|E
40|$|Grinding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{versatile}} methods of removing material from machine parts by the cutting action of the countless hard and <b>sharp</b> <b>abrasive</b> particles of a revolving grinding wheel. It works by forcing the abrasive grains into the surface of the workpiece so that each grain cuts away a small bit of material in the form of chips. Abrasive grinding wheel is an expendable wheel that carries an abrasive compound on its periphery. They are made of small, sharp and very hard natural or synthetic abrasive minerals, bonded together in a matrix to form a wheel. The paper presents a review of some of the characteristics as well as theoretical considerations of operations of abrasive grinding wheel. The relationships among the various grinding parameters; the radial force f, the force on individual grit of grinding wheel F, velocity of grinding wheelg Vg, velocity of work piecew Vw, the wheel diameterg Dg, and the diameter of the work piece Dw were established for given grinding operations. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} first study on the {{mechanical}} behavior of lithium metasilicate glass-ceramic using nanoindentation and in situ scanning probe imaging techniques. Indentation contact hardness, H-c, and Young's modulus, E, were measured at 10 mN peak load and 0. 1 - 2 mN/s loading rates to understand the loading rate effect on its properties. Indentation imprints were analysed with the in situ scanning probe imaging to understand indentation mechanisms. The average contact hardness increased by 112 % with the loading rate (ANOVA, p 0. 05). A strain rate sensitivity model was applied to determine the intrinsic contact hardness. Extensive discontinuities and largest maximum, contact and final depths were also observed at the lowest loading rate. These phenomena corresponded to inhomogeneous shear-band flow and densification leading to the material strain softening. The in situ scanning probe images of indentation imprints showed plastic deformation at all loading rates and shear band-induced pileups at the lowest loading rate. With the increase in loading rate, the induced pile-ups decreased. The continuum model predicted the largest densified shear zone at the lowest loading rate. Finally, these results provide scientific insights into the abrasive machining responses of lithium metasilicate glass-ceramic during dental CAD/CAM processes using <b>sharp</b> diamond <b>abrasives...</b>|$|R
40|$|Electric shovels {{are used}} in surface mining {{operations}} to achieve economic production capacities. The capital investments and operating {{costs associated with the}} shovels deployed in the Athabasca oil sands formation are high due to the abrasive conditions. The shovel crawler shoes interact with <b>sharp</b> and <b>abrasive</b> sand particles, and, thus, are subjected to high transient dynamic stresses. These high stresses cause wear and tear leading to crack initiation, propagation and premature fatigue failure. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a model to characterize the crawler stresses and deformation for the P&H 4100 C BOSS during propel and loading using rigid-flexible multi-body dynamic theory. A 3 -D virtual prototype model of the rigid-flexible crawler track assembly and its interactions with oil sand formation is simulated to capture the model dynamics within multibody dynamics software MSC ADAMS. The modal and stress shapes and modal loads due to machine weight for each flexible crawler shoes are generated from finite element analysis (FEA). The modal coordinates from the simulation are combined with mode and stress shapes using modal superposition method to calculate real-time stresses and deformation of flexible crawler shoes. The results show a maximum von Mises stress value of 170 MPa occurring in the driving crawler shoe during the propel motion. This study provides a foundation for the subsequent fatigue life analysis of crawler shoes for extending crawler service life...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{describes}} modelling of fracture wear in vitrified cBN grinding wheels. Design/methodology/approach: The {{approach used}} in the paper is based on using finite elements to model fracture wear processes in vitrified cBN grinding wheels. The approach used models fracture wear processes and ignores abrasive wear of the abrasive grains. Findings: The findings show that during grinding the grain is subjected to forces that create fracture initiation zones in the <b>sharp</b> <b>abrasive</b> grains where tensile and compressive stresses dominate {{in certain parts of}} the abrasive grains. Research limitations/implications: The findings show that further research is required that prevents the formation of crack initiation zones and considers the effects of wear flats on the magnitude of stresses in the abrasive grains. Practical implications: The results imply that abrasive fracture wear is the dominant wear mechanism when grinding with sharp vitrified cBN grinding wheels. Originality/value: The originality of this paper is reflected in {{the fact that this is}} the first time that fracture wear has been modelled in sharp vitrified cBN grinding wheels. The results presented in this paper will illuminate the need for accurate modelling of the wear of vitrified superabrasive grinding wheels...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} loading rate {{effect on the}} {{mechanical}} behavior of zirconia using nanoindentation and in situ scanning probe imaging techniques. Nanoindentation tests were performed at a peak load of 10 mN and 0. 1 – 2 mN/s loading rates. The {{results show that the}} contact hardness increased by 31 % with the loading rate while the Young׳s modulus was loading rate independent (ANOVA, p> 0. 05). A strain rate sensitivity model was applied to determine the strain rate sensitivity and the intrinsic contact hardness. A pressure-sensitive idealized yield criterion model was applied to analyze the pressure hardening coefficient and the intrinsic compressive yield stress. Extensive discontinuities and largest maximum and contact depths were also observed on the force–displacement curves at the lowest loading rate. These phenomena corresponded to nanoindentation-induced strain softening. The in situ scanning probe images of indentation imprints showed plastic deformation without fracture at all loading rates and dislocation-induced pileups around indentation imprints at the low loading rate. The amount of pileups decreased with increase in loading rate. Finally, these results provide scientific insight into the submicron material removal mechanisms for zirconia during <b>sharp</b> <b>abrasive</b> machining...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{mechanical}} properties and material behavior of pre-sintered zirconia using nanoindentation with in situ scanning probe microscopy. Indentation contact hardness, Hc, and Young's modulus, E, were measured at loading rates of 0. 1 – 2 mN/s and 10 mN peak load to understand the loading rate effect on its properties. Indentation imprints were analyzed using in situ scanning probe imaging to understand the indentation mechanisms. The average measured contact hardness was 0. 92 – 1. 28 GPa, independent of the loading rate (ANOVA, p> 0. 05). Young's moduli showed a loading rate dependence, with average 61. 25 GPa and a great deviation at a low loading rate of 0. 1 mN/s, which was twice the average moduli at the loading rates of 0. 5 – 2 mN/s. Extensive discontinuities and the largest maximum penetration, final and contact depths were also observed on the load–displacement curves at the lowest loading rate. These phenomena corresponded to microstructural compaction (pore closure and opening) and kink band formation, indicating the loading rate dependence for microstructural changes during nanoindentation. The in situ scanning probe images of indentation imprints show plastic deformation without fracture at all loading rates, compaction at the low loading rate and pore filling at the high loading rate. The mechanical behavior studied provides physical insight into the abrasive machining responses of pre-sintered zirconia using <b>sharp</b> diamond <b>abrasives...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This study {{examined}} the performance of abrasive jet polishing (AJP) on SKD 61 mold surfaces using wax-coated SiC abrasives fabricated by gas atomization and the comparison of surface quality achieved by revealing significant surface roughness reduced with wax-coated abrasives. The wax coating of SiC <b>abrasives</b> smooth the <b>sharp</b> surfaces of <b>abrasive</b> powders and provides a cushioning buffer. These two features contribute and improve the direct impact of heavy peening, thus preventing surface hardening, superficial embedment or deep scratches. Furthermore, compound additives including water wax and water {{were added to the}} wax-coated # 3000 SiC abrasives at a mix proportion of 500 : 1000 : 1500 (water wax: wax-coated SiC: water) for polishing micro-channels surfaces. The experimental results show that the compound additives provide addition cushioning effect facilitate the sliding and grinding of abrasives, resulting in fine polishing and good surface quality. The reflection properties of both linear and curved micro-channels were much enhanced by AJP using wax-coated # 3000 SiC abrasives with the compound additives...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{particle}} erosion-wear {{experiments on}} as-prepared mullite-SiC composite refractories by nitriding reactive sintering were performed at elevated temperatures, using <b>sharp</b> black SiC <b>abrasive</b> particles at an impact speed of 50 [*]m/s {{and the impact}} angle of 90 ° in the air atmosphere. The effects of silicon powder addition and erosion temperature on the erosion-wear resistance of mullite-SiC composite refractories were studied. The test results reveal that Si powders caused nitriding reaction to form β-sialon whiskers in the matrix of mullite-SiC composite refractories. The erosion-wear resistance of mullite-SiC composite refractories was improved {{with the increase of}} silicon powder addition and erosion temperature, and the minimum volume erosion rate was under the condition of 12 % silicon added and a temperature of 1400 °C. The major erosion-wear mechanisms of mullite-SiC composite refractories were brittle erosion at the erosion temperature from room temperature to 1000 °C and then plastic deformation from 1200 °C to 1400 °C...|$|R
40|$|On April 14, 2010, when meltwaters {{from the}} Eyjafjallajökull glacier mixed with hot magma, an {{explosive}} eruption sent unusually fine-grained ash into the jet stream. It quickly dispersed over Europe. Previous airplane encounters with ash resulted in sandblasted windows and particles melted inside jet engines, {{causing them to}} fail. Therefore, air traffic was grounded for several days. Concerns also arose about health risks from fallout, because ash can transport acids as well as toxic compounds, such as fluoride, aluminum, and arsenic. Studies on ash are usually made on material collected far from the source, where it could have mixed with other atmospheric particles, or after exposure to water as rain or fog, which would alter surface composition. For this study, {{a unique set of}} dry ash samples was collected immediately after the explosive event and compared with fresh ash from a later, more typical eruption. Using nanotechniques, custom-designed for studying natural materials, we explored the physical and chemical nature of the ash to determine if fears about health and safety were justified and we developed a protocol that will serve for assessing risks during a future event. On single particles, we identified the composition of nanometer scale salt coatings and measured the mass of adsorbed salts with picogram resolution. The particles of explosive ash that reached Europe in the jet stream were especially <b>sharp</b> and <b>abrasive</b> over their entire size range, from submillimeter to tens of nanometers. Edges remained sharp even after a couple of weeks of abrasion in stirred water suspensions...|$|R
