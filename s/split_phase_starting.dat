40|$|In this paper, {{an image}} {{segmentation}} method based on directed image region partitioning is proposed. The method {{consists of two}} separate stages: a <b>splitting</b> <b>phase</b> followed by a merging <b>phase.</b> The <b>splitting</b> <b>phase</b> <b>starts</b> with an initial coarse triangulation and employs the incremental Delaunay triangulation as a directed image region splitting technique. The triangulation process is accomplished by adding points as vertices one by one into the triangulation. A top-down point selection strategy is proposed for selecting these points in the image domain of grey-value and color images. The merging phase coalesces the oversegmentation, generated by the <b>splitting</b> <b>phase,</b> into homogeneous image regions. Because images might be negatively affected by changes in intensity due to shading or surface orientation change, we propose homogeneity criteria which are robust to intensity changes caused by these phenomena for both grey-value and color images. Performance of the image segmentation method has [...] ...|$|R

40|$|A vector {{controlled}} {{scheme is}} described for an induction motor with <b>split</b> <b>phase</b> windings. Such a motor is obtained by <b>splitting</b> the <b>phase</b> windings {{of a conventional}} three phase motor with an angular separation of 30 electrical degrees between the axes of the two halves. In the proposed scheme the motor is run as a three phase machine by connecting the <b>split</b> <b>phase</b> windings in series. An appropriate <b>split</b> <b>phase</b> induction motor model based on space phasor notations is proposed. From this space phasor model of the <b>split</b> <b>phase</b> machine, a simple technique for measuring the equivalent circuit parameters for the motor is presented. Based on the proposed model a method for acquiring {{the position of the}} rotor flux is developed. The scheme is based only on the voltage and current measurements, without the need for position encoders. It is also independent of machine resistance values. Results from computer simulation as well as from an experimental prototype drive are presented and discussed...|$|R

We first classify these protocols into four categories based on their principles of operation: Dedicated Control Channel, Common Hopping, <b>Split</b> <b>Phase,</b> and Parallel Rendezvous protocols. We then {{examine the effects of}} the number of channels and devices, channel switching times, and traffic patterns on the throughput and delay of the protocols. Here are some of the conclusions of our study: 1) Parallel Rendezvous protocols generally perform better than Single Rendezvous protocols, 2) the Dedicated Control Channel protocol can be a good approach with its simplicity when the number of channels is high and the packets are long, and 3) the <b>Split</b> <b>Phase</b> protocol is very sensitive to the durations of the control and data phases. Our study focuses on a single collision domain...|$|R

40|$|Single phase {{induction}} machines {{have been}} the subject of many researches in recent times. The voltage and torque equations which describe the dynamic characteristics of these machines have been quoted in many papers, including the papers that present the simulation results of these model equations. The way and manner in which these equations are solved is not common in literature. This paper presents a detailed procedure of how these equations are to be solved with respect to the splitphase induction machine which is one of the different types of the single phase induction machines available in the market. In addition, these equations have been used to simulate the start-up response of the <b>split</b> <b>phase</b> induction motor on no-load. The free acceleration characteristics of the motor voltages, currents and electromagnetic torque have been plotted and discussed. The simulation results presented include the instantaneous torque-speed characteristics of the <b>Split</b> <b>phase</b> Induction machine.
