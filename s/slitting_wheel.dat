40|$|This report {{outlines}} {{the results of}} the STIS <b>Slit</b> <b>Wheel</b> Repeatability Test. The <b>slit</b> <b>wheel</b> repeatability was found to be +/- 7. 5 milli-arcseconds in the direction of rotation and +/- 2. 5 milli-arcseconds in the radial direction, as projected onto the sky. This is well below the performance requirement of +/- 20 milli-arcseconds...|$|R
40|$|The work {{covers the}} cutting {{operation}} of blanks of semiconductor and dielectric materials into the plates. The {{aim is to}} increase the efficiency of the blank cutting operation into the plates by means of rational applying lubricant-coolant, stabilization of the cutting edge in <b>slitting</b> <b>wheels</b> and combined machining of the plates. The relations for design of the plate deflection for determination of te height parameters of plates cutted by a stabilized wheel and thickness of the disturbed layer after combined machining have been obtained firstly by an analytical way. The rational conditions of cutting blanks of the non-metallic materials into the plates have been determined; the role of technological inheritance in the defects of cutted plates by the finished bases has been revealed; the new process for stabilization of the <b>slitted</b> <b>wheels</b> has been developed. The technological recommendations and device for tension degree check of AKVR wheels have been introduced in 1993 in the leading enterprise (Production Enterprise "Itil"). The efficiency is expressed in the increase of cutting productivity (1, 5 - 2 times) at keeping yield of the finished plates and in the prevention of rejection caused by AKVR breakdown at their tension.

50|$|The IRTF {{staff are}} {{currently}} developing iShell. This {{will be a}} high resolution (R=80,000) 1.1-5.2 µm cross dispersed spectrograph that will replace CSHELL. By using a larger array and a cross disperser, iShell will have much larger wavelength coverage per setting than CSHELL. Like SpeX, iShell will also have an infrared slit viewing guider and pupil imager. iShell will use a silicion immersion grating to achieve a high dispersion with a relatively small grating, which in turn allows the optics and the whole instrument to be much smaller than if it used a conventional grating. Despite having much higher spectral resolution than SpeX, iShell will be slightly smaller. Like SpeX, iShell will have an IR slit viewer/guider, an image rotator, and a <b>slit</b> <b>wheel.</b> There will be two immersion gratings, one optimized for K band and one optimized for L band. Due to the silicon grating, iShell will not be sensitive to light shorter than 1.1 µm. All of the K-band window {{can be observed in}} four settings of the cross disperser.|$|R
