5|$|Construction of the {{motorway}} {{began in}} 1990, lbut a decade-long hiatus between the mid-1990s and 2004 caused by funding {{issues and the}} setting up of a separate company to develop and operate the motorway meant it was not completed until 2007. As of July 2011, the entire motorway route is completed, consisting of a dual-carriageway and four traffic lanes, except for a relatively short segment which is still a <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>road.</b> The motorway is currently operated by Autocesta Zagreb - Macelj.|$|E
5|$|The village {{stretches}} primarily along a <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>road</b> {{known as}} The Street. The north-eastern end of The Street is a designated Conservation Area. The lack of development stems from its {{position within the}} Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a Site of Nature Conservation Interest, which influences local planning laws and limits permission to build new housing. All development is subject to {{a high level of}} scrutiny; any development that would adversely affect the natural beauty of the landscape will automatically be resisted, and large-scale development proposals must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment. The last major development was that of the residential cul-de-sac Draysfield.|$|E
5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual {{carriageway}} from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then another section of <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>road,</b> {{coming out of the}} valley and up to the crest of the Great Ridge, before a further section of dual two lane road down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more to single carriageway.|$|E

5|$|Albany Highway commences at The Causeway, a river {{crossing}} that connects to Perth's central business district. The highway heads south-east through Perth's metropolitan region, and continues through the southern Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions to Albany {{on the south}} coast of Western Australia. Albany Highway is generally a two-lane <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>road,</b> but with additional lanes and dual-carriageway sections in Perth and Albany. The highway is allocated State Route30, except for bypassed sections in Perth, and the southernmost portion in Albany. The part bypassed by Kenwick Link is allocated Alternate State Route30, and a short length in Arthur River is concurrently allocated State Route107. Albany Highway also carries sections of Heritage Country Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive205) and Great Southern Tourist Way (Tourist Drive356).|$|E
25|$|Grantham, with Stamford, {{had been}} {{earmarked}} for a bypass {{before the war}} in 1939. There were 60 serious accidents a year, with three to four deaths. After the war, on 21 November 1945, {{there was a meeting}} at the Guildhall about the proposed bypass of the London-Edinburgh-Thurso trunk road for Grantham and Great Gonerby. This was the first enquiry into a trunk road scheme in the country after the war. The proposed route followed the current line, from Little Ponton to College Farm, except {{it was to be a}} <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
25|$|SH 1 has varied road conditions. For most of {{its length}} it is a two-lane <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>road</b> with {{at-grade}} intersections and access, sealed with chipseal in rural areas or asphalt in urban and high-traffic areas. The highway has frequent passing lanes on these sections, to allow traffic to pass other vehicles safely. Parts of the road are steep by international standards. Most steep sections having a combination of passing lanes (uphill), and crawler lanes or stopping bays (downhill) to allow heavy and slow vehicles {{to pull out of}} the way to let other vehicles pass.|$|E
5000|$|Green markers [...] - [...] These {{are used}} where slip-roads (US: off ramp) leave {{and join the}} main {{carriageway}} on dual carriageways. In some countries they are also used across the entrances of minor roads or accesses onto major <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>roads.</b>|$|R
5000|$|London has a {{hierarchy}} of roads ranging from major radial and orbital trunk roads down to minor [...] "side streets". At the top level are motorways and grade-separated dual carriageways, supplemented by non-grade-separated urban dual <b>carriageways,</b> major <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>roads,</b> local distributor roads and small local streets.|$|R

500|$|The most {{controversial}} upgrade of the A303 has been improvement {{to the road}} through the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, where it remains a congested <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>road.</b> There were minor improvements in the 1960s, including closing the road for a month in 1967 for levelling and resurfacing. A proposal to fully dual the A303 past Stonehenge was announced in the mid-1970s, but was criticised as being [...] "an environmental disaster" [...] and comparable to driving a dual carriageway through Westminster Abbey. A more comprehensive solution was discussed in 1989's Roads for Prosperity programme, which included upgrading the road to dual carriageway and bypassing Winterborne Stoke. In 1993, the Minister for Roads, Kenneth Carlisle, announced plans for either a [...] tunnel or a diversion of the A303 a mile from Stonehenge, costing £44 million and £22 million respectively. Although the new Labour government cancelled many road schemes after coming to power in 1997, there was still general support for a tunnel at Stonehenge.|$|E

2500|$|When a <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>road</b> is {{converted}} into dual carriageway {{by building a}} second separate carriageway alongside the first, it is usually referred to as duplication, twinning or doubling. [...] The original carriageway is changed from two-way to become one-way, while the new carriageway is one-way in the opposite direction. In {{the same way as}} converting railway lines from single track to double track, the new carriageway is not always constructed directly alongside the existing carriageway.|$|E
2500|$|The Pylon {{was built}} as a {{symbolic}} gateway to Brighton and was intended to extend a welcome to travellers approaching from the north along the A23. [...] They were commissioned by Sir Herbert Carden, a local councillor, and were unveiled on 30 May 1928. [...] He paid £2,255 towards them, and the public raised a further £993. [...] They stand either side of what was, {{at the time of}} construction, a <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>road.</b> [...] Because the road is now a dual carriageway, one pylon now [...] "stands forlornly in the central reservation, although a third is planned".|$|E

50|$|Bedford {{lies on the}} A6 road, and two of {{the most}} {{important}} north-south routes in Great Britain, the A1 and the M1 motorway pass a few miles to the east and west respectively. The A421 link the town to the M1 and A1 via dual carriageway. This will significantly improve access to the town, which currently requires the use of frequently congested <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>roads.</b> Bedford has a southern bypass along the A421.|$|R
50|$|The tunnel itself, {{and most}} of the {{connecting}} road between Aosta and Martigny are only <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>roads,</b> and for most relevant city destinations in Switzerland and Italy the toll free St Gotthard Tunnel and Simplon Pass offer more direct or at least faster routes. This and the toll ensure that the Grand San Bernard Tunnel rarely suffers from the levels of holiday season congestion that plague the more popular Alpine crossing routes, however.|$|R

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the UK Department of Transport's Highway Link Design (HLD) guidelines for <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>roads</b> was to develop layouts, making it clear to drivers where overtaking is possible and where it is undesirable. This paper presents recent overtaking data, and reassesses the overtaking sight distances specified in HLD. Data were collected on a 1175 m overtaking section, forming part of a 7. 3 m wide standard <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> with a design speed of 80 kph; the section was almost straight and level. For each overtaking manoeuvre, many parameters of overtaking behaviour were measured from video recordings; the 30 hours of recorded data provided 1143 overtaking manouevres of different types. It was found that the HLD values for full overtaking sight distance (FOSD) and abort overtaking sight distance (ASD), for design speeds ranging from 80 kph to 120 kph, were less than the values calculated by applying the observed data to models previously developed by the authors. These methods were substantially different from those used for deriving and calculating the HLD values. The authors consider that the HLD values' apparent underestimates may lead to increased accident risk on overtaking sections, and reduce the efficiency of <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>roads,</b> because their overtaking sections provide too few overtaking opportunities.

50|$|Buckinghamshire's {{road network}} is still largely {{composed}} of <b>single</b> <b>carriageway</b> <b>roads,</b> {{with a few}} exceptions. The M40 and M1 motorways both pass through the county on their routes from London to the north, serving High Wycombe and Milton Keynes respectively. The A41 connects Oxfordshire to London through Buckinghamshire. Between Aylesbury and London this road is a grade-separated dual carriageway, essentially a motorway but with more curves and no hard shoulder. Aylesbury {{is the focal point}} of Buckinghamshire's road network; the A413, A418, A41 and A4010 roads all converge on the town. However all enter the town as <b>single</b> <b>carriageways</b> and none has a bypass. Consequently, Aylesbury suffers from serious traffic congestion problems during peak hours.|$|R
50|$|Groups {{most likely}} to speed {{excessively}} are those driving in a work related capacity, members of high income households and young males.
