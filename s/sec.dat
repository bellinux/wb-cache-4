5|$|Alabama {{earned their}} third <b>SEC</b> {{championship}} since {{the inception of}} the <b>SEC</b> Championship Game in 1992, and their 22nd <b>SEC</b> title. The victory over Texas gave Alabama their 13th national championship in football (their eighth wire service title since the AP Poll began in 1936) and their ninth perfect season since 1925. The season included victories over the previous three national champions: Florida, Louisiana State University (LSU), and Texas.|$|E
5|$|By 1933, Alabama again {{switched}} conferences, {{joining the}} <b>SEC</b> as a charter member.

After winning five national championships and nine conference championships through 1946, Alabama saw a decline between 1946 and 1957 and captured a single conference title. After they only won four games {{over a period of}} three seasons, Bear Bryant was hired as head coach in 1958. Under his guidance Alabama won thirteen <b>SEC</b> championships and national championships in the 1961, 1964, 1965, 1973, 1978 and 1979 seasons. After the retirement of Bryant in 1982, Alabama had two coaches, and won one <b>SEC</b> championship before Gene Stallings was hired in 1990. Stallings coached Alabama for seven years, won a national championship in 1992 season, an <b>SEC</b> championship that same season, and four <b>SEC</b> West Division titles. His retirement was followed by a succession of four coaches who only won one <b>SEC</b> championship among them.|$|E
30|$|Suppose {{the relay}} picks up at 23.303 A {{secondary}} (M = 9.71). Using (1), the operating {{time of the}} relay is 0.2040 <b>secs.</b> As per Fig.  6, 51 P has a curve timing accuracy of ±[*] 4 % of the operating time and ±[*] 1.5 cycle. For an operate time of 0.2040 <b>secs,</b> the curve timing accuracy equals 0.0331 <b>secs</b> (4 % × 0.2040 + 0.025 <b>secs).</b> Therefore, the relay is expected to operate within 0.1709 and 0.2372 <b>secs</b> (t 1 = 0.2040 ± 0.0331 <b>secs).</b>|$|R

The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Gators to 20–14 (21–14 without the NCAA vacation of the 2005 victory).

The expansion made the <b>SEC</b> the first 12-school football conference and thus the first eligible to hold a conference championship game under NCAA rules (the first game was held in 1992). The <b>SEC</b> enjoyed increased television ratings and revenue through the 1990s and by 2003 was earning over $100million annually, with revenues shared out among member schools.|$|E

30|$|<b>SECs</b> play an {{important}} networking role on their campuses, where they inform and unify institutional efforts, serving to elevate their visibility and importance both internally and externally.

Additionally, <b>SECs</b> act as an internal resource for faculty and instructors providing programs and training to foster the application of EBIPs in STEM courses. Several <b>SECs</b> provide the infrastructure for broader impact activities, and act as an external funding resource.|$|R

30|$|In {{studying}} these <b>SECs,</b> {{we identified}} {{some areas of}} challenge that may influence their ability to have a sustained impact on their institutional environments. These include reliance on external funding; specialized fields of science, technology, engineering, and math, collectively grouped homogenously as “STEM”; and competition with other centers and STEM departments for institutional funding. Our study did not explore these in any depth. However, they provide insight for institutions seeking to add or strengthen an existing center structure, and suggest possible directions for future research. First, institutions rely on their <b>SECs</b> to provide resources through externally funded awards rather than directly allocating institutional resources to these priority areas. Institutions appear to be slow to commit to the institutionalization of programs and initiatives shown to be successful. This hampers the ability of <b>SECs</b> to provide staffing to expand successful programs. Three of the <b>SECs</b> studied share concerns for retaining qualified staff due to their reliance on external funding. Second, STEM is a collective term used to encompass very specialized disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and math. To work closely with faculty and departments {{within each of the}} disciplines, <b>SECs</b> require staff with diverse STEM backgrounds, and/or affiliated faculty {{from a wide variety of}} disciplines, to broaden their support to each of those fields. Our cases show that <b>SECs</b> had engagement in STEM departments that were either aligned, or closely aligned, with their director’s area of expertise. Each of the <b>SECs</b> was actively focused on expanding their reach across the many diverse STEM disciplines. This presented a challenge, because <b>SECs</b> had a limited number of staff, therefore all STEM fields were not equally engaged and able to benefit from center resources. Some <b>SECs</b> address this challenge by establishing partnerships with a wide variety of disciplinary faculty. However, these <b>SECs</b> also reported difficulties in gaining departmental release time for these faculty. Additionally, at four of the six institutions, organizational structures placed <b>SECs</b> in direct competition with STEM departments, and/or other Centers (e.g., a center for diversity in engineering) for institutional funding; this impacts potential collaborations, making it difficult to unify efforts. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the challenges faced by <b>SECs,</b> but rather those that we identified as common to three or more cases during our analysis.|$|R
