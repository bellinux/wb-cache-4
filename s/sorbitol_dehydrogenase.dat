Xylitol dehydrogenase is a heteronuclear multimetal protein that forms homotetramers and contains 1 mol of Zn 2 + ions and 6 mol of Mg 2 + ions per mol of 37. 4 kDa protomer. Treatment with chelating agents such as EDTA {{results in the}} removal of the Zn 2 + ions with a concomitant loss of enzyme activity. The Mg 2 + ions are not essential for activity and are removed by chelation or extensive dialysis without affecting the stability of the enzyme. Results of initial velocity studies at steady state for d-sorbitol oxidation and d-fructose reduction together with the characteristic patterns of product inhibition point to a compulsorily ordered Theorell-Chance mechanism of xylitol dehydrogenase in which coenzyme binds first and leaves last. At pH 7. 5, the binding of NADH (Ki approximately 10 microM) is approx. 80 -fold tighter than that of NAD+. Polyhydroxyalcohols require at least five carbon atoms to be good substrates of xylitol dehydrogenase, and the C- 2 (S), C- 3 (R) and C- 4 (R) configuration is preferred.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{studies on}} the biochemical properties and regulation of L-arabinose metabolism and arabinan degrading enzymes of Aspergillus niger. We focused on {{the investigation of the}} catabolic pathway, firstly by isolating pathway specific regulatory mutants using a newly developed selection system and, secondly, by purifying the enzymes and characterising their kinetics for use in metabolic control analysis. Finally, by cloning genes encoding these enzymes we were able to analyse expression of these genes. Using a D-xylulose kinase deficient strain we developed a mutant selection system that identified genes involved in pentose catabolism and their regulation. The A. niger strain carrying the xkiA 1 mutation lacks D-xylulose kinase and cannot grow on pentoses, such as D-xylose and L-arabinose, but these sugars still repress the use of other carbon sources such as D-gluconate. We used this genetic background to select for pentose-derepressed mutants on media containing combinations of gluconate with xylitol, L-arabinose or D-xylose. A subset of these mutants was further analysed and turned out to have rather interesting properties as described in chapters two and three. One of the mutants isolated using this method carried a mutation called xtlA 36 and is described in chapter two. This mutation results in a severe decrease in xylitol consumption, suggesting that xtlA 36 inactivates a xylitol transporter and opens the way of isolation of genes encoding the corresponding genes. Two other A. niger mutants, carrying araA and araB are specifically disturbed in the regulation of the arabinanase system in the presence of L-arabinose. Expression of three arabinanolytic genes, abfA, abfB and abnA, is substantially decreased or absent in the araA and araB, strains compared to the wild-type when incubated in the presence of L-arabinose or L-arabitol. In addition, the intracellular enzyme activities of L-arabitol dehydrogenase and L-arabinose reductase, involved in L-arabinose catabolism, were decreased in the araA and araB strains. L-arabitol, most likely the true inducer of the arabinanolytic and L-arabinose catabolic genes, accumulates to a high intracellular concentration in the araA and araB mutants. This indicates that the decreased expression of the arabinolytic genes is not due to lack of inducer accumulation. Therefore, we propose that araA and araB are mutations in positively acting components of the regulatory system involved in the expression of the arabinanase encoding genes and the genes encoding the L-arabinose catabolic pathway. Chapter four describes cloning of the A. niger D-xylulose kinase encoding gene (xkiA) by direct complementation of the strain deficient in D-xylulose kinase activity. This enabled us to investigate the expression of xkiA in the presence of L-arabinose, L-arabitol, and D-xylose. Although XKI is part of the D-xylose catabolic pathway, expression of xkiA appeared not to be mediated by XLNR, the xylose-dependent positively acting xylanolytic regulator. Expression of xkiA is subject to carbon catabolite repression (ccr) but the wide domain regulator CREA is not directly involved. Using the araA and araB strains described in chapter three, we showed that xkiA is under control of the arabinanolytic regulatory system. Overexpression of xkiA enabled us to purify the encoded D-xylulose kinase enzyme. The molecular mass, determined using Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI-MS) concurred with the calculated molecular mass of 62816. 6 Da. The activity of D-xylulose kinase is highly specific for D-xylulose. Kinetic parameters were determined, including K m (D-xylulose), 0. 76 mM and K m (ATP), 0. 061 mM. In a D-xylulose kinase deficient strain a higher accumulation of intracellular arabitol and xylitol correlated to increased transcript levels of the genes encoding arabinan and xylan degrading enzymes, respectively. This supports the suggestion that L-arabitol may be the specific low molecular weight inducer of the genes involved in arabinan degradation. It also suggests a possible role for xylitol in the induction of xylanolytic genes. Overproduction of XKIA did not reduce the size of the intracellular arabitol and xylitol pools, and had no effect on expression of genes encoding xylan and arabinan degrading enzymes. This suggests that the enzymes preceding D-xylulose kinase in the L-arabinose/D-xylose catabolic pathway probably have more control on the flux through this pathway than D-xylulose kinase itself. In chapter five, we cloned the genes encoding A. niger L-arabitol dehydrogenase (ladA) and xylitol dehydrogenase (xdhA), and produced the enzymes in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the substrate specificity showed that LADA is most active on L-arabitol and also has significant activity on xylitol, but only low activity on D-sorbitol and galactitol. XDHA has the highest activity on xylitol, significant activity on D-sorbitol, but very low activity on L-arabitol. The higher activity on sorbitol for XDHA is in agreement with the amino acid similarity of the different enzyme classes, since a phylogenetic tree of L-arabitol dehydrogenases, xylitol <b>dehydrogenases</b> and <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> (SDH) suggests that xylitol dehydrogenases are more similar to <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> than L-arabitol dehydrogenases. Expression analysis of the pentose catabolic pathway genes confirmed the model in which an arabinose specific regulator activates the expression of all genes required for the conversion of L-arabinose to D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate. In addition, XLNR regulates the first step and, to a lesser extent, the other steps of the conversion of D-xylose into D-xylulose- 5 -phosphate. Using dye-affinity chromatography we isolated enzymes of the L-arabinose and D-xylose catabolic pathways that had not been described previously. Using the complete set of kinetic parameters a metabolic model was constructed which we used to perform steady state metabolic control analysis (chapter six). The metabolic model was used to analyse flux and metabolite concentration control of the L-arabinose catabolic pathway. The model predicts that flux control does not only reside at the enzyme following the intermediate with the highest concentration, L-arabitol, but is distributed over the first three steps in the pathway, preceding and following L-arabitol. Flux control appeared to be strongly dependent on the intracellular L-arabinose concentration. At 5 mM intracellular L-arabinose, a level that resulted in realistic intermediate concentrations in the model, flux control coefficients for L-arabinose reductase, L-arabitol dehydrogenase and L-xylulose reductase were 0. 68, 0. 17 and 0. 14 respectively. This analysis {{can be used as a}} guide to identify targets for metabolic engineering aiming at either flux or metabolite level optimisation of the L-arabinose catabolic pathway of A. niger. In chapter seven the results from chapters two through six are discussed in light of possible engineering applications and recent scientific developments such as genomics...|$|R

50|$|Cells use glucose for energy. This {{normally}} occurs by phosphorylation via {{the enzyme}} hexokinase. However, if {{large amounts of}} glucose are present (as in diabetes mellitus), hexokinase becomes saturated and the excess glucose enters the polyol pathway when aldose reductase reduces it to sorbitol. This reaction oxidizes NADPH to NADP+. <b>Sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> can then oxidize sorbitol to fructose, which produces NADH from NAD+. Hexokinase can return the molecule to the glycolysis pathway by phosphorylating fructose to form fructose-6-phosphate. However, in uncontrolled diabetics that have high blood glucose - more than the glycolysis pathway can handle - the reaction's mass balance ultimately favors the production of sorbitol. Activation of the polyol pathway results in a decrease of reduced NADPH and oxidized NAD+; these are necessary cofactors in redox reactions throughout the body, and under normal conditions they are not interchangeable. The decreased concentration of these NADPH leads to decreased synthesis of reduced glutathione, nitric oxide, myo-inositol, and taurine. Myo-inositol is particularly required for the normal function of nerves. Sorbitol may also glycate nitrogens on proteins, such as collagen, and the products of these glycations are referred-to as AGEs - advanced glycation endproducts. AGEs are thought to cause disease in the human body, one effect of which is mediated by RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) and the ensuing inflammatory responses induced.

AutoDock Vina was to be used to verify the results from laboratory work. Experimental work has been done in the laboratory, using spectrophotometric methods to find the maximum rate, Vmax, and the affinity value KM of the reaction where D-sorbitol is oxidized to D-fructose, both in the presence of paracetamol and without, at pH 9. 9. Four series of 10 reaction samples were made, where the series had an increasing paracetamol concentration, and the 10 reaction samples of each series had increasing D-sorbitol concentration. In addition to D-sorbitol and paracetamol, each reaction sample contained 50 mM NAD+ and glycine buffer (pH 9. 9). The initial reaction rate for each of the reaction solutions was estimated by measuring the change in absorbance by NADH at 340 nm over a period of ten seconds, shortly after the enzyme was added to the reaction solution.

The results from the docking in AutoDock Vina verifies that paracetamol has a great binding affinity to the active site of <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase,</b> where it binds, along with the coenzyme NAD+/ NADH, towards the catalytic zinc atom. It is not clear given the results what kind of inhibition the paracetamol present to the <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> However, they might indicate that there is a form of mixed inhibition...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> from sheep liver shows {{similarities}} to mammalian and yeast alcohol dehydrogenases. Comparisons based on peptides from segments of <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> reveal that homologous regions with 38 % identity include two ligands to the active site zinc atom in liver alcohol dehydrogenase, {{as well as}} further important residues. Similarities in in other regions are less extensive, exactly as they are between different alcohol dehydrogenases. In all aspects, <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> appears as a typical member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family. On the other hand, alcohol dehydrogenase from Drosophila, which has a shorter subunit, is not closely related to either of these enzymes, except for a region that probably corresponds to {{the first part of}} the coenzyme binding domain in many dehydrogenases. Instead, Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase in its supposed catalytic region shows {{similarities to}}ward Klebsiella ribitol dehydrogenase, which also has a small subunit. It may be concluded that both alcohol and polyol dehydrogenases show two types of protein subunit, reflecting an early subdivision of polypeptide types into "long" and "short" subunits rather than into different enzymatic specificities or quaternary structures. The relationships explain known properties of all these enzymes and provide insight into functional mechanisms and evolutionary interpretations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo new {{dehydrogenase}} structures, the 354 -residue {{polypeptide chain}} of <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> (from sheep liver) and the 500 -residue polypeptide chain of cytoplasmic aldehyde dehydrogenase (from human liver), have blocked N-termini. The N-terminal peptides were purified by reverse-phase {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} and submitted to mass spectrometry after derivatization. They were also analyzed by dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase digestion, utilizing gas chromatography-mass spectometry for dipeptide identifications. Results are consistent and establish that <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> has N-terminal acetylalanine and aldehyde dehydrogenase N-terminal acetylserine in amino acid sequences that are compatible with estimates from chemical analyses. The two N-terminal residues found are typical of acetylated proteins in general, extend the group of known acetylated dehydrogenases, and show that these intracellular proteins are frequently N-terminally acetylated...|$|E
40|$|The {{substrate}} specificity of sheep liver <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> {{has been studied}} by steady-state kinetics over the range pH 7 - 10. <b>Sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> stereo-selectively catalyses the reversible NAD-linked oxidation of various polyols and other secondary alcohols into their corresponding ketones. The kinetic constants are given for various novel polyol substrates, including L-glucitol, L-mannitol, L-altritol, D-altritol, D-iditol and eight heptitols, {{as well as for}} many aliphatic and aromatic alcohols. The maximum velocities (kcat) and the {{substrate specificity}}-constants (kcat/Km) are positively correlated with increasing pH. The enzyme-catalysed reactions occur by a compulsory ordered kinetic mechanism with the coenzyme as the first, or leading, substrate. With many substrates, the rate-limiting step for the overall reaction is the enzyme-NADH product dissociation. However, with several substrates there is a transition to a mechanism with partial rate-limitation at the ternary complex level, especially at low pH. The kinetic data enable the elucidation of new empirical rules for the substrate specificity of <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> The specificity-constants for polyol oxidation vary as a function of substrate configuration with D-xylo> D-ribo > L-xylo > D-lyxo approximately L-arabino > D-arabino > L-lyxo. Catalytic activity with a polyol or an aromatic substrate and various 1 -deoxy derivatives thereof varies with -CH 2 OH > -CH 2 NH 2 > -CH 2 OCH 3 approximately -CH 3. The presence of a hydroxyl group at each of the remaining chiral centres of a polyol, apart from the reactive C 2, is also nonessential for productive ternary complex formation and catalysis. A predominantly nonpolar enzymic epitope appears to constitute an important structural determinant for the substrate specificity of <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> The existence of two distinct substrate binding regions in the enzyme active site, along with that of the catalytic zinc, is suggested to account for the lack of stereospecificity at C 2 in some polyols...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Two enzymes are {{involved}} in the polyol pathway: an aldose reductase that reduces glucose in sorbitol followed by its oxidation in fructose by <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> It has been previously shown that both enzymes are presented in the bovine epididymis, where they are associated with membranous vesicles called epididymosomes. Based on the distribution of these enzymes, it has been hypothesized that the polyol pathway can modulate sperm motility during the epididymal transit. In the present study, polyol pathway was investigated in semen and along the epididymis in humans in order to determine if sperm maturation can be associated with this sugar pathway. Western blot analysis shows that both aldose reductase and <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> are associated with ejaculated spermatozoa and prostasomes in humans. These enzymes are also associated with epididymosomes collected during surgical vasectomy reversal. Western blot, Northern blot, and reverse transcription– polymerase chain reaction analysis show that aldose reductase and <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> are expressed at the transcriptional and translational levels along the human epididymis. Unlike what occurs in the bovine model, distribution of these enzymes is rather uniform along the human excurrent duct. Immunohistological studies together with Western blot analysis performed on epididymosomes preparations indicate that the polyol pathway enzymes are secreted by the epididymal epithelium. These results indicate that the polyol pathway plays a role in human sperm physiology...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} an aqueous extract of the plant Scoparia dulcis (200 mg/kg) on the polyol pathway and lipid peroxidation were {{examined}} in the liver of streptozotocin adult diabetic male albino Wistar rats. The diabetic control rats (N = 6) presented {{a significant increase in}} blood glucose, <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase,</b> glycosylated hemoglobin and lipid peroxidation markers such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and hydroperoxides, and a significant decrease in plasma insulin and antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and reduced glutathione (GSH) compared to normal rats (N = 6). Scoparia dulcis plant extract (SPEt, 200 mg kg- 1 day- 1) and glibenclamide (600 µg kg- 1 day- 1), a reference drug, were administered by gavage for 6 weeks to diabetic rats (N = 6 for each group) and significantly reduced blood glucose, <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase,</b> glycosylated hemoglobin, TBARS, and hydroperoxides, and significantly increased plasma insulin, GPx, GST and GSH activities in liver. The effect of the SPEt was compared with that of glibenclamide. The effect of the extract may have been due to the decreased influx of glucose into the polyol pathway leading to increased activities of antioxidant enzymes and plasma insulin and decreased activity of <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> These results indicate that the SPEt was effective in attenuating hyperglycemia in rats and their susceptibility to oxygen free radicals...|$|E
40|$|Xylitol {{production}} from lactose was investigated by a three step biotransformations series that were: (1) breakdown of lactose to Darabitol by Kluyveromyces lactis NBRC 1903, (2) oxidation of Darabitol to D-xylulose by Gluconobacter oxydans NBRC 3172, and (3) reduction of D-xylulose to xylitol by Candida shehatae IAM 12953 {{in the presence}} of a high concentration ethanol or by cell free <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase.</b> Overall production rate and overall fractional yield of xylitol from lactose were 1. 69 mmol L- 1 h- 1 and 0. 141, respectively, when <b>sorbitol</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> was utilized in the third reaction.
