40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of sorghum for silage production in two experimental conditions (sorghum sown in the year and annual regrowth). A randomized blocks design with five replications was used, evaluating four soughum genotypes and two experimental conditions in a 4 x 2 factorial scheme. Number of plants per hectare was higher in regrowth compared to sorghum of the year. Regarding green matter production, dry matter production and digestible dry matter, the best results were observed in sorghum of the year. The average height ranged from 1. 77 to 2. 35 m, being the tallest plants found in sorghum of the year. Under the experimental conditions, the highest leaf percentages were observed for sorghum of the year. Panicle percentage was the same in both experimental conditions. The highest percentages of stem were observed in regrowth. The evaluated genotypes, as regrowth or sorghum of the year, have the potential for silage production for presenting appropriate productive characteristics. The use of <b>sorghum</b> <b>regrowth</b> may be an alternative for silage production...|$|E
