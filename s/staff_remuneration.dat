40|$|Background: Poor {{retention}} of health workers {{is a significant}} problem in rural and remote areas, with negative consequences for both health services and patient care. Objective: This review aimed to synthesise the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of retention strategies for health workers in rural and remote areas, {{with a focus on}} those studies relevant to Australia. Design: A systematic review method was adopted. Six program evaluation articles, eight review articles and one grey literature report were identified that met study inclusion/exclusion criteria. Results: While a wide range of retention strategies have been introduced in various settings to reduce unnecessary staff turnover and increase length of stay, few have been rigorously evaluated. Little evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of any specific strategy is currently available, {{with the possible exception of}} health worker obligation. Multiple factors influence length of employment, indicating that a flexible, multifaceted response to improving workforce retention is required.

30|$|Another {{organization}} design {{issue for}} divestitures concerns {{the construction and}} management of any post-divestiture links that may exist between the selling parent and the divested unit (Seward and Walsh 1996; Semadeni and Cannella 2011; Feldman 2015 c). This impacts organizational structure and governance issues {{on both sides of}} the transaction—be it for the selling firm and the acquirer of its former unit, or for the selling firm and its former unit as an independent spun-off entity. Post-divestiture connections may be initiated due to the needs of the selling parent firm. For example, in spite of the sale, the parent may still rely on the former unit for the supply of a particular good or service, or for the continued use of intellectual property or specialized human capital. When IBM divested its microelectronics business to GlobalFoundries, the companies agreed that GlobalFoundries would provide IBM with certain server processor semiconductor technology for a 10 -year period. In other cases, the reverse may be true, wherein the parent provides the former unit (or its acquirer) with resources and (quite commonly for spinoffs) infrastructure and functional support (such as in IT, HR, and accounting). A single divestiture may have numerous post-divestiture links associated with it, and the many organization design choices associated with these linkages—including their monitoring, <b>staffing,</b> financial <b>remuneration,</b> arbitration, and duration, among other factors—may have major implications for the overall success of the divestiture.|$|R

This human resource crisis has led to profound adjustments of the antiretroviral treatment care delivery model in several countries in the region. It also inspired some governments to take swift measures to substantially increase human resources capacity. This article draws on the experience of Malawi and Ethiopia, which have been able to successfully increase their health workforce over a relatively short period, allowing scaling up of antiretroviral treatment. Additional international HIV funding and strong political commitment made possible this exceptional response. Both countries implemented a combination of measures to tackle the human resource crisis: the delegation of medical and administrative tasks to lower health cadres and lay workers, the introduction of new health cadres, the reinforcement of preservice training, and improving health <b>staff</b> <b>remuneration.</b> In particular, the involvement of community and lay health workers in HIV-related service delivery substantially increased the health workforce. The involvement of lay cadres has important long-term implications. To sustain results, continued political commitment, ongoing training and supervision to maintain quality of care, and strategies to avoid attrition among lay cadres will be essential. Although task shifting and involvement of lay cadres allowed bridging of the human resource gap in a short time, other strategies have to be considered simultaneously, and all interventions must be maintained over a longer period to yield results...|$|E
40|$|In Nigeria, the {{government}} is implementing the Free Maternal and Child Health Care Programme (FMCHCP). The policy is premised {{on the notion that}} financial barriers {{are one of the most}} important constraints to equitable access and use of skilled maternal and child healthcare. In Ebonyi State, Southeastern Nigeria the FMCHCP is experiencing implementation challenges including: inadequate human resource for health, inadequate funding, out of stock syndrome, inadequate infrastructure, and poor <b>staff</b> <b>remuneration.</b> Furthermore, there is less emphasis on community involvement in the programme implementation. In this policy brief, we recommend policy options that emphasize the implementation of community-based participatory interventions to strengthen {{the government}}’s FMCHCP as follows: Option 1 : Training community women on prenatal care, life-saving skills in case of emergency, reproductive health, care of the newborn and family planning. Option 2 : Sensitizing the community women towards behavioural change, to understand what quality services that respond to their needs are but also to seek and demand for such. Option 3 : Implementation packages that provide technical skills to women of childbearing age as well as mothers’ groups, and traditional birth attendants for better home-based maternal and child healthcare. The effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated in a number of community-based participatory interventions, building on the idea that if community members take part in decision-making and bring local knowledge, experiences and problems to the fore, they are more likely to own and sustain solutions to improve their communities’ health...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Identify {{similarities}} and/or {{differences in}} the distribution of Value Added characterizing family businesses as opposed to non-family held firms, and analyse productivity by linking the distribution of the wealth generated by the company to a variety of related agents or stakeholders (employees, providers of loan capital, and shareholders). Design/methodology: A data series consisting of VA distribution in a sample of 8, 609 Spanish companies, of which 5, 109 are family firms and another 3, 500 companies which are not, for the period comprising 2008 to 2013 was employed for this study. The data from the financial statements pertaining to these companies was taken from the SABI system (a privately-funded database analysing the financials of Spanish and Portuguese firms, operated by INFORMA, SA), selecting only those companies that employ standardized financial reporting practices. Findings and results: The work shows the existence of significant differences between family and non-family businesses {{in the distribution of}} value added among the different stakeholders. Given that, although both types of company spend most of the value added to remunerate staff, the family company spends a higher proportion thereof on self-financing as compared to non-family businesses, which spend a higher percentage on the remuneration of firm ownership. On the other hand, the lower labour productivity of family businesses is apparent, a result that can be explained both by the lower <b>staff</b> monetary <b>remuneration,</b> as well as the use of production technologies that are also less capital-intensive. Limitations: The study included only medium and large companies. These are companies that report financial statements offering more disaggregated data (through use of the standard forms). This owes to the legal requirement of these companies to file a cash flow statement, a necessary source for deriving information on dividends paid by the company. Added value: This is the first study in which the workings of added value are used to analyse the presence of measurable management differences in a large sample of companies using family ownership as the main criteria for differentiation...|$|R

However, non-profit sports clubs have a distinctive economic structure and own rationality.

Data {{for much of the}} developing world are often unavailable, but given the prevalence of poor socioeconomic factors, the incidence is likely to be greater. In Sub-Saharan Africa, economic and manpower factors dictate a conservative approach to therapy in most instances.

Hemodialysis (HD) remains the most common modality of management, with a very few units offering peritoneal dialysis (PD). Limitations to regular maintenance HD include the paucity of dialysis units, restriction of those units to urban centers, and the absence of government funding or subsidy and health insurance to cover the relatively high costs of dialysis. The few available units are bedeviled with multiple problems: old machines frequently break down, absence of adequate maintenance technical support and spare parts, and frequent power outages. <b>Staff</b> motivation and <b>remuneration</b> are equally poor with consequent disruption of services due to industrial action and emigration of trained staff to the Middle East and Western world.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to propose {{effective}} changes in performance management in hotels in the Czech Republic. The thesis {{is focused on the}} employee performance. Performance management is a modern and effective approach to human resource management. This approach has evolved from the original classic staff evaluation and instruments such management by objectives. Unlike this classical tools, performance management is not focused on the past and finding the state, but is directed more to the future. It is a comprehensive, continuous and self-renewing process which includes the evaluation of workers, setting development plan and training, providing feedback and remuneration based performance. The emphasis in this process is placed on the evaluation of the workers and their personal development and remuneration. However, according to the recent research, <b>staff</b> <b>remuneration</b> is usually not based on track record. Although their performance is evaluated {{at least once a year}} and their personal development plans are not set. Deficiencies in performance management can also be found in the fact in that their personal development plans are not reviewed, adjusted. For the development of theoretical and empirical parts the methods of: analysis and synthesis were used. To determine the relevance of the respondents' views, the methods of observation, structured interview, questionnaire survey and statistical evaluation were used. On the basis of qualitative and quantitative research, the majority of hoteliers focus on evaluating the work of their staff, particularly through the evaluation interviews, MBO or mystery shopping. Personal development planning and remuneration based on performance is usually neglected. To increase the effectiveness of performance management in hospitality, frequent and shorter forms of assessment rather than traditional annual evaluation interviews are recommended. The conclusions obtained from the above studies suggest an emphasis on personal development and getting frequent feedback from employees during the period. The effective performance management should be focused more on salaries based on job performance, evaluation of employees and working approach. The performance salary should be included in most of the remuneration systems in hotels...|$|E
40|$|Attracting {{physicians}} {{to serve in}} isolated areas, often with marginal facilities, support <b>staff,</b> and <b>remuneration,</b> {{has long been a}} problem of the Indian Health Service (IHS). Until recently the physician draft was instrumental in motivating {{physicians to}} accept such assignments. Realizing that this "negative incentive" would no longer operate when the draft ended as of July 1, 1973, in the fall of 1972 the IHS staff launched some major "positive" efforts to recruit physicians. The mass media and other communication techniques were used to try to sell U. S. physicians and medical students on what the Service could offer them in terms of adventure, challenge, personal fulfillment, idealism, and the opportunity {{to be part of a}} progressive, comprehensive health system. Such efforts assisted in recruiting 69 physicians to begin service in July 1973. These 69 were in addition to approximately 100 who had already been recruited from among persons who had expressed interest in joining the Indian Health Service or who had applied to it before inception of this major recruitment effort. As of July 1, 1973, however, the Service was still approximately 30 physicians short of filling 200 vacancies. In June and July of 1973, an evaluation was done to determine what had motivated the 169 physicians to join the Indian Health Service. They were asked an open ended question: What prompted you to seek employment with the Indian Health Service? Whether physicians listed personal, subjective motivators or recruitment techniques was of as much interest as the specific answers they gave. More than 75 percent (100 of 129) mentioned recruitment techniques, such as magazine advertisements, rather than personal motivating factors, such as challenge. Personal contact with a present or former IHS physician seemed to be especially influential in attracting physicians. The present state of the recruitment art does not provide the means to adequately identify, qualify, quantify, and rank the multiple motivators that prompt physicians to join a program such as that of the Indian Health Service; nor does it allow for meaningful, predetermined identification of a limited pool of physicians who would have a high probability of joining such a program. At present, the best recruitment strategy appears to be to saturate the entire physician "marketplace" stressing with a variety of techniques the positive aspects of IHS employment. Physicians then select themselves for such employment by exhibiting a more than casual interest in the Indian Health Service...|$|R

Enfin, l’importance de prendre en considération le secteur industriel dans l’analyse du lien entre la complémentarité et la performance organisationnelle est soulevée afin de poser {{par la suite}} les objectifs et hypothèses de la recherche. Les résultats indiquent que l’accroissement de la complémentarité des pratiques de GRH est lié à une augmentation de la productivité et de l’efficience, au positionnement concurrentiel de l’organisation et à l’acquisition de clients et d’une part du marché. For {{more than}} ten years, much published material has argued that human resource management (HRM) can {{play a major role}} in improving organizational performance. Several researchers claim that to exert a significant impact on organizational performance, HR practices need to be integrated or complementary with each other. However, the concept of complementarity suffers from a lack of operational clarity and has been essentially approached from a statistical standpoint that has limited our understanding of the architecture of the overall system of HR practices. On the other hand, several authors assert that the complementarity of HR practices cannot be studied outside its organizational context, especially in the industrial sector. They argue that differences in the nature of activity between service organizations and manufacturing companies are likely to have implications on which practices are adopted and how these practices impact the human and corporate performance of the organizations in question. In its first phase, this study proposes an operational definition of the concept of complementarity that can be used to select which practices to include in an organization’s HRM system. This complementarity has been defined as “the set of practices originating from various areas of HRM activity whose combined application can be rationally justified and empirically demonstrated to have a synergistic effect on organizational performance in a given sector. ” Thus, on the basis of this definition, the authors developed a number of “complex items,” incorporating HRM practices from four major operational areas : <b>staffing,</b> <b>remuneration,</b> training and performance assessment. Each of these combinations embodies a link of complementarity between practices, and the additional impact of each combination is our way of measuring its complementarity. This study has the dual purpose of first verifying the hypothesis that “the more practices from different areas of HRM are complementary, the more they will improve organizational performance” (H. 1) and, second, that “it is likely that the impact of complementary practices will vary depending on whether the organizations concerned belong to the manufacturing or service sector” (H. 2). The items to measure organizational performance come from a previous study. These data were derived from questionnaires completed by 177 Canadian firms and the internal reliability varies from. 77 to. 90. To measure the degree of complementarity between HRM practices, 22 items were developed with an internal reliability of. 84. The data were obtained from 238 manufacturing companies and 325 service organizations. The results corroborated Hypothesis 1, indicating that the complementarity of HR practices was responsible for a significant increase in productivity/efficiency, competitive positioning and client acquisition/growth. The results also corroborated Hypothesis 2, showing that, when the two different economic sectors are compared in terms of dependant variables, a higher degree of complementarity is particularly associated in service companies with increased productivity and efficiency, better competitive positioning and a greater number of clients and increased market share. In the case of manufacturing companies, the results indicate that the higher degree of complementarity has particular impact on the first two factors. The results are discussed in the light of current research and the limitations of the research are presented. El articulo presenta en un primer momento una visión rápida del rol y la importancia de la complementaridad de practicas de gestión de recursos humanos (GRH) en la predicción del resultado organizacional. Después de haber explicado el concepto de racimos de prácticas, los autores resaltan los límites respecto a las diferentes concepciones para medir la complementaridad. Se discute la importancia de combinar las prácticas sobre una base racional y se propone una definición y un método en este sentido. Finalmente, se destaca la importancia de tomar en consideración el sector industrial en el analisis del nexo entre complementaridad y resultado organizacional para proponer a continuación los objetivos e hipotesis de la investigación. Los resultados indican que el incremento de la complementaridad de prácticas de GRH está vinculado a un aumento de la productividad y la eficiencia, a la ubicación competitiva de la organización y a la adquisición de clientes y partes de mercado...|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{problem which}} faces {{higher education institutions}} in Indonesia is that {{of being able to}} generate staff’s commitment notwithstanding the inability of the institutions to provide their <b>staff</b> with comparable <b>remuneration.</b> This research sought to ascertain the potential of alternatives to extrinsic rewards in facilitating staff’s commitment in the Indonesian Catholic higher education institutions context. Two ethics-related variables, namely, institutional ethical climates and staff’s ethical ideology were chosen as the possible predictors. The choice was deemed relevant in respect of the endeavours of the institutional leaders to introduce codes of ethics to their institutions. A conceptual model delineating the relationships between organisational commitment, ethical climates, and ethical ideology was developed and tested in this research. A twostep structural equation modelling procedure was used as the main statistical technique to test the hypothesised relationships. This research built upon the work of Cullen, Parboteeah, and Victor (2003) by focusing on the relationships between ethical climates and organisational commitment through an examination of the nexus between ethical climates types, not only with affective but also with continuance and normative commitment. Additionally, ethical ideology was put to the examination to test the potentiality of this variable for mediating the relationships. The research involved permanent staff of nine Catholic higher education institutions in seven cities on the island of Java, Indonesia. It was conducted during the period of July to September 2005. A cross-sectional survey was employed as the primary method to collect the data. The fieldwork comprised the distribution of a self-administered questionnaire to potential respondents through direct contact. A purposive or judgmental sampling was used to identify and invite respondent participation. A total of 1, 000 questionnaires were distributed of which 642 were usable, representing the overall response rate of 68. 15...|$|R
