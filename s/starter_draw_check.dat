40|$|Abstract—Because {{wireless}} microsystems {{can only}} incorporate tiny batteries, they typically exhaust stored on-board energy quickly. Fortunately, harvesting ambient energy {{is a viable}} means of extending their operational lifetimes, except starting and re-starting miniaturized microwatt harvesters from nocharge conditions is difficult. The challenge is drawing usable energy from millivolt signals under micro-scale constraints. This paper proposes a nonlinear on-chip starter that borrows the harvester's steady-state inductor to start the system from nocharge conditions. Simulations show that the <b>starter</b> <b>draws</b> power from 250 – 500 mV to charge 100 pF to 3 V in 48 µs. The 100 -pF temporary supply then powers the harvester's 1 -V, 4 -µA controller to charge 100 nF by 100 mV in 65 -µs cycles until the 100 -nF battery charges enough to supply the system.

60|$|There {{is a form}} {{of credit}} {{transactions}} (4) by checks on bankers, and transfers in a banker’s books, which is exactly parallel in every respect to bank-notes, giving equal facilities to an extension of credit, and capable of acting on prices quite as powerfully. A bank, instead of lending its notes to a merchant or dealer, might open an account with him, and credit the account with the sum it had agreed to advance, on an understanding that he should not draw out that sum in any other mode than by <b>drawing</b> <b>checks</b> against it in favor of those to whom he had occasion to make payments. These checks might possibly even pass from hand to hand like bank-notes; more commonly, however, the receiver would pay them into the hands of his own banker, and when he wanted the money would <b>draw</b> a fresh <b>check</b> against it; and hence an objector may urge that as the original check would very soon be presented for payment, when it must be paid either in notes or in coin, notes or coin to an equal amount must be provided as the ultimate means of liquidation. It is not so, however. The person to whom the check is transferred may perhaps deal with the same banker, and the check may return to the very bank on which it was drawn.|$|R
