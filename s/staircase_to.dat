5|$|The second-floor {{served as}} the main {{sleeping}} quarters. It consists of a few simple bedrooms, all historically without closets. The upstairs hall contains a door which once accessed a <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the widow's walk, {{what remains of the}} space {{has been used as a}} closet for over a century.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} home to a museum {{collection}} displaying furniture originally made for the tower, alongside paintings, prints and objects illustrating William Beckford’s life as a writer, collector and patron of the arts. Visitors can climb the spiral <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the restored belvedere below the lantern and experience panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{staircase}} exits: two {{going up to}} the northeastern corner of the intersection of Grand and Chrystie Streets, and one {{going up to the}} northwestern corner. The station originally only had the two street stairs to the northeastern corner of the intersection, but due to growing ridership over the years—mainly by commuters from various Brooklyn neighborhoods to Manhattan's Chinatown—the third <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the northwestern corner was added in 1999.|$|E

5000|$|The station's main {{entrance}} is a mezzanine above the platforms and tracks {{at the south}} end. It has two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> the Manhattan-bound platform and one to the Bay Ridge-bound one at the extreme south end, a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions, turnstile bank, token booth, and two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> the northern corners of 45th Street and 4th Avenue. The mezzanine contains some of the original mosaic directional and arrow signs. The one by the <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> the southbound platform says [...] "Down Town trains" [...] while the one by the Manhattan-bound platform staircases says [...] "Up Town Trains." ...|$|R
25|$|From the mezzanine, {{there are}} three <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> each active platform, a {{turnstile}} bank, a token booth, and two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> the streets. One leads to {{the northeast corner of}} Schermerhorn and Hoyt Streets, is built within the front entrance of 250 Schermerhorn Street, and connects to fare control via a corridor. The other <b>staircase</b> leads <b>to</b> the northwest corner of Bond and Schermerhorn Streets and is built inside a building housing the Goodwill Store and Donation Center.|$|R
5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to the ground floor of the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, {{the manor}} house was {{destroyed}} by fire, news of which was carried in The Illustrated London News. The estate passed into the Court of Chancery and was purchased by Daniel Higford Davall Burr. In 1848, Burr commissioned {{the building of a}} neoclassical mansion to the south west of the original building. Burr saved the 17th-century manor's wooden staircase, though all that remains of the building is a <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the cellar (which is now home to a colony of bats). By 1851 the new building was complete, costing £20,000 and having a Tudor-like appearance. Burr held the estate until his death 50 years later, when was inherited by his son, who sold it in 1893.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{was designed}} to commemorate the Duke of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo. Construction of the original design commenced in 1817; a revised and cheaper design was eventually used, though, and building was completed in 1854. It is now owned by the National Trust, who closed the monument {{to the public in}} 2007, owing to safety concerns. Surveys have shown that extensive renovation work will be needed to reopen the internal <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the viewing platform. As of 2015 the work is still ongoing.|$|E

5|$|The spiral <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> {{the second}} floor is original. The floor {{continues}} the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement {{with only a few}} surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. The fireplace and windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century wooden door to the floor. Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a display {{on the history of the}} tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} pediment depicts {{sculptures of}} plants and geometrical figures. The staircase has nine unusually high steps— high, about {{twice as high as}} the average height of stairs. Tananyan suggests that the unusually high stairs compel a person ascending the <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar. On the both sides of the staircase there are roughly square pedestals. Atlas, the Greek mythological Titan who held up the earth, is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders. It is assumed that, originally, pedestals held up altars (sacrificial tables).|$|E
5|$|There {{is a red}} marble step to the chancel end of the {{crossing}}. The crossing has a chamfered north east angle for a tower stair, with a door at the foot. Two small windows {{light the}} <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the ringing chamber. There is a complex oak roof in nine panels with heavy beams and pendant bosses. The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view the crossing. The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century.|$|E
50|$|There are two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> {{the upper}} levels {{at either end}} of the north side of the building.|$|R
50|$|The station's only entrance/exit is an {{elevated}} brick station house beneath the tracks. It has a turnstile bank, station agent booth, waiting area {{that allows a}} free transfer between directions, two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> each platform at the center, and two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> either side of Rockaway Freeway between Beach 35th and Beach 36th Streets. The two southern street stairs {{are connected to the}} station house with a large canopied overpass.|$|R
5000|$|The station's main {{entrance}} has two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> each platform {{and one to}} each northern corner of Fourth Avenue and 53rd Street. The mezzanine allows transfer between directions and contains some of the original mosaic directional and arrow signs. The one by the <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> the southbound platform says [...] "Ft. Hamilton & Coney Island" [...] while the one by the Manhattan-bound platform staircases says [...] "Down Town Trains." ...|$|R
5|$|When Engine Co. 22 arrived, it {{was ordered}} to pump water on the {{warehouse}}. The company's firefighters entered the warehouse and dragged a hose up a <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> direct water onto the fourth floor. When heavy black smoke began coming down the stairway, Foreman Garrett B. Lane ordered his firemen to evacuate. Fireman Francis Hart, Jr., became trapped while trying to collect the hose {{and was forced to}} flee to the roof and escape over neighboring rooftops.|$|E
5|$|From November 1984 to June 1987 the DeKalb County Courthouse {{underwent}} {{an interior}} restoration, which {{was completed in}} time for the sesquicentennial celebration for DeKalb County. The restoration, at an approximate cost of $100,000, was undertaken by Conrad Schmitt Studios of New Berlin, Wisconsin. The modern front doors to the courthouse hide the original, beveled glass front doors from view. Once inside the modern doors, the nonfunctional original doors can be seen, standing wide open, to be admired; each door weighs several hundred pounds. Past the doors, in the building's main lobby, is the large, marble <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the second floor. The staircase, as well as the lobby's wainscoting, is done in gray Tennessee marble. Most of the first floor is original to the building, including the hexagonal marble flooring, stained glass windows and two original, first floor courtrooms. The plasterwork along the walls and ceilings of the lobby is ornately decorated.|$|E
5|$|The {{central and}} largest {{room in the}} house is the great hall which was the {{original}} dining room and the accompanying screens passage which gave access to the hall from the service rooms. The <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the north of the hall was added in the 18th century. The state room on the western side of the first floor was damaged by fire in 1882; the oak panelling around the fireplace was brought from the Eltons' former house in Queen Square, Bristol. The chapel on the first floor has a rectangular window with reticulated tracery, which dominates the front of the house. The stained glass in the window was added after the 1882 fire. The justice room has had a variety of uses but takes its name from its function as the manorial court until the 18th century. The house contains many family portraits and other pictures as well as collections of Eltonware and Nailsea Glass and prints of bridges and railways.|$|E

50|$|The {{part-time}} Quentin Road station house, located to {{the east}} of the embankment, has a turnstile bank, part-time booth, and two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> each platform. It was built after the station's opening to accommodate growing passenger flow as evidenced by its newer-style tiling and signage. Platform extensions are clearly present {{at the north end of}} the station. It has a token booth, turnstile bank, and two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> each platform with the southbound side requiring a short walk.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} appears {{to consist of}} a large hall with a gallery, with <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> the first floor at the front and rear.|$|R
5|$|The {{ground was}} lowered by a full {{story on the}} south and east sides of the station, exposing what had {{formerly}} been the basement to improve access for taxis and private automobiles. A marquee to shelter arriving and departing passengers spanned the seven central bays of the lower level, with a more ornate version on {{the north end of the}} pedestrian tunnel. The lower waiting room was expanded, a ticket office constructed, and a larger <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the main waiting room was built. The floor was covered with terrazzo and green marble, with white marble wainscoting on the walls. Three bays were added to the west wing for additional functional space, removing direct track access from the ramp. Cast iron streetlights with the PRR Keystone motif in their base were located around the driveway and grounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{riverside}} façade {{is formed}} by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The {{main part of the}} façade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost. The library wing {{was not part of the}} original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great <b>Staircase</b> <b>to</b> {{the east of the}} Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E
50|$|The {{full-time}} mezzanine is at {{the eastern}} end has three <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> each platform and two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> the street, one to either eastern corner of Broadway and 65th Street. Both sides had fare controls and former booths at platform levels at the far western end, {{at the opposite end}} of the current mezzanine. They have since been sealed. Signs at the northeast exit as well as the Manhattan-bound platforms are for Rowan Street, the former name of 65th Street.|$|R
50|$|Loading bridges {{restrict}} aircraft parking to spots immediately {{adjacent to}} the terminal. Thus, airports use mobile <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> facilitate disembarking at hardstands (remote parking positions).|$|R
50|$|The fare {{control area}} on the Manhattan-bound side has a {{full-time}} turnstile bank, token booth, and two perpendicular <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> {{the northeast corner of}} Church and Nostrand Avenues and one staircase and one elevator to the southeast corner. The Flatbush Avenue-bound platform's fare control is unstaffed, containing three exit-only turnstiles and one HEET turnstile. This exit has two perpendicular <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> the northwest corner of Church and Nostrand Avenues and one staircase and one elevator to the southwest corner. Both elevators, installed in Spring 1999, make this station fully ADA-accessible.|$|R
25|$|The churchyard, with <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the Rua da Sé was {{repaired}} in 1845 towards Rua do Salinas.|$|E
25|$|The staircases, made of wood, {{provided}} {{access to}} {{all levels of the}} temple, with a landing at each floor. The southwest staircase was completely finished, but the staircase in the northwest corner was never completed—it was roughed in with temporary boards resting on the risers. Workmen used this <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> gain access to the building during its construction, especially during the winter of 1845–1846, when persons were using the other <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> reach the attic for ordinance work.|$|E
25|$|The station house {{formerly}} had {{two more}} staircases leading to either eastern corner, {{as well as}} another <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the northwestern corner. In June 2011, they were replaced by the in-system transfer to the underground platforms, which added a new <b>staircase</b> <b>to</b> the former southeast corner of the intersection. As part of the project, a short strip of 45th Road between 23rd Street and Jackson Avenue was de-mapped, while the adjacent Albert Short Triangle was renovated.|$|E
5000|$|This {{station has}} a {{full-length}} mezzanine above the platforms and tracks with <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> each side {{at regular intervals}} that connect the two fare control areas. The full-time one is at the north (geographical east) end. It has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two <b>staircases</b> going up <b>to</b> the western corners of Nostrand and Lafayette Avenues. The fare control area at the south (geographical west) end of the mezzanine is unstaffed, containing just full height turnstiles and two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> either eastern corners of Bedford and Lafayette Avenues. The two staircases on the western corners are exit-only and signed as [...] "No Entry". They had been previously boarded-up, with a gate sealing off the passageway towards the stairs.|$|R
50|$|The station's sole exit is two <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> either western {{corner of}} Livonia Avenue and Ashford Street via an elevated, wooden mezzanine/station house under the far {{eastern end of}} the platform.|$|R
50|$|The station's only entrance/exit is an {{elevated}} station house beneath the tracks. Inside the turnstile bank, {{there are two}} <b>staircases</b> <b>to</b> each platform at the center and a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and two <b>staircases</b> going down <b>to</b> the southwest and northeast corner of Elder and Westchester Avenues.|$|R
