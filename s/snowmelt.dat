5|$|Given the {{importance}} of <b>snowmelt</b> to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial <b>snowmelt</b> models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between {{the air and the}} snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute Qm, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to Qm.|$|E
5|$|Scientists study snow at a {{wide variety}} of scales that include the physics of {{chemical}} bonds and clouds; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of <b>snowmelt</b> to river hydraulics and ground hydrology. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by engineers, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by agronomists, who address the availability of <b>snowmelt</b> to agriculture, and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is avalanches, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for movement of deposited snow: drifting of unsintered snow, avalanches of accumulated snow on steep slopes, <b>snowmelt</b> during thaw conditions, {{and the movement}} of glaciers after snow has persisted for multiple years and metamorphosed into glacier ice.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike many {{mine fire}}s, the Carbondale mine fire lacked [...] "noxious odors". There are, however, {{irregular}} <b>snowmelts</b> in the area, which {{is typical of}} mine fires.|$|R
25|$|Female wolverines burrow into snow in February {{to create}} a den, which is used until weaning in mid-May. Areas {{inhabited}} nonseasonally by wolverines are thus restricted to zones with late-spring <b>snowmelts.</b> This fact has led to concern that global warming will shrink the ranges of wolverine populations.|$|R
5000|$|Edward Gertler {{states in}} his book Keystone Canoeing that Huntington Creek is ideal for novice canoers. It is {{possible}} to canoe on the creek during <b>snowmelts</b> or within several days of heavy rain. Gertler describes the creek's scenery as [...] "good". A total of 17.1 mi of the creek are possible for canoeing.|$|R
5|$|After Lee's death, {{his wife}} Emma {{continued}} {{to operate the}} ferry for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below {{the confluence of the}} Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee's Backbone segment. However, this route could not be used in the summer months due to dangerous high water levels from <b>snowmelt.</b> In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family. In 1896 the ferry was transferred to Jim Emett, who installed a cable across the Colorado River {{to reduce the risk of}} boats washing downstream during high water.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after <b>snowmelt.</b> Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Many rivers {{originating}} in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive {{a significant portion}} of their flow from <b>snowmelt.</b> This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of Iran and Afghanistan, very low flow {{for the rest of the}} year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.|$|E
50|$|Earlier {{and more}} rapid <b>snowmelts</b> could {{contribute}} to winter and spring flooding, and more intense summer storms could {{increase the likelihood of}} flash floods. Although Nevada is extremely dry, intense rains can produce torrents of water and debris. Residential and industrial developments on valley floors and near the foothills are especially vulnerable during flash floods.|$|R
50|$|Proponents for snowmelters {{claim that}} these {{essentially}} {{speed up the}} natural <b>snowmelting</b> process. They discharge the melt water into storm drains and sewer systems where the water is treated and released back into the local water systems. However they consume {{substantial amount of energy}} and the burning flames produce carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to canoe on at least 13.5 mi of Pine Creek during the winter, during <b>snowmelts</b> or soon after heavy rains. Edward Gertler describes the creek as a [...] "diminutive novice run" [...] in his book Keystone Canoeing. Gertler describes the scenery along the creek as [...] "good". However, there are electric fences and deadfalls on it.|$|R
5|$|The Colorado {{is joined}} by over 25 {{significant}} tributaries, of which the Green River is the largest by both length and discharge. The Green takes drainage from the Wind River Range of west-central Wyoming, from Utah's Uinta Mountains, and from the Rockies of northwestern Colorado. The Gila River is the second longest and drains a greater area than the Green, but has a significantly lower flow because of a more arid climate and larger diversions for irrigation and cities. Both the Gunnison and San Juan rivers, which derive most of their water from Rocky Mountains <b>snowmelt,</b> contribute more water than the Gila did naturally.|$|E
5|$|About 23 Ma, in the Pleistocene, {{continental}} ice sheets {{expanded from}} the polar {{regions of the}} globe to cover lower latitudes far north of the region, starting a series of cold glacial periods that were interrupted by warmer interglacial periods. <b>Snowmelt</b> from alpine glaciers on the nearby Sierra Nevada during glacial periods fed rivers that flowed into the valleys of the region year round. Since the topography of the Basin and Range region was largely formed by faulting, not by river erosion, many of the basins have no outlets, meaning they will fill up with water like a bathtub until they overflow into the next basin. So during the cooler and wetter pluvial climates of the glacial periods, much of eastern California, all of Nevada, and western Utah were covered by large lakes separated by linear islands (the present day ranges).|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or <b>snowmelt.</b> Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the test {{observation}} of radio isotope snow gauge at Kariyasu Pass in the source region of Kurobe River are discussed. The total winter precipitation {{at this point is}} as large as that in summer and does not change year to year as snowfall on lowlands. In case of heavy snow, snowfall distribution on mountains and coast is affected by stability of airflow. Runoff in spring from <b>snowmelting</b> is closely related to rainfall...|$|R
50|$|The {{most crucial}} part of a {{successful}} tube based hydronic heating system depends on proper tube spacing and layout. It is recommended to lay the tubes in a spiral or serpentine pattern to help distribute the heat evenly. Specification for spacing will vary between manufacturers. A faster rate of <b>snowmelting</b> will require closer spacing of tubing, typical spacing is 6-8". Another key factor {{is the amount of}} insulation used under the slab.|$|R
5000|$|The average {{discharge}} of Miller Run averages approximately , {{but can be}} considerably higher, sometimes over [...] The stream exhibits highly unusual hydrologic behavior during rainstorms and <b>snowmelts.</b> In typical streams the discharge in the upper reaches peaks before that of the lower reaches. However, in Miller Run, this pattern is reversed and the discharge sometimes even peaks more than once. This is caused by large amounts of water flowing into it from storm drains and runoff-impervious surfaces.|$|R
5|$|Located in the Northern Rockies, Missoula has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter, rapid <b>snowmelt</b> on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank swallows, northern rough-winged swallows and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging for insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks. The parks also host a variety of snakes such as racers, garter snakes, and rubber boa.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} {{vegetation}} in two principal ways, vegetation {{can influence the}} deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from <b>snowmelt</b> can scour terrain of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The SNRA is {{the primary}} {{destination}} for mountain climbers and rock climbers within the forest. Thompson Peak and Hyndman Peak are two popular peaks to hike to, and Mount Heyburn is a popular rock climbing destination. Opportunities for rafting and kayaking on the upper Salmon River with conditions range from flatwater to class IV whitewater. Water levels are highest during <b>snowmelt</b> in spring and early summer. The large lakes in the Sawtooth Valley, including Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, have developed boat accesses. Redfish Lake has a lodge with a marina, restaurant, and various activities. There are numerous hot springs distributed across the forest and open to public use. A few have developed tubs, including those in the Baumgartner Campground.|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{variations}} of full-size ceiling insulation model and roof insuration model are measured and observed to prevent melting and freezing {{of snow on}} the roof during winter. As a result, roof insulation model with ventilated air space is quite effective to prevent the problem caused by <b>snowmelting</b> on the roof since the temperature inside the ventilated air space follow the outside temperature well. On the other hand, ceiling insulation model leaves much room for improvement on ventilaion method in attic space because of the bad followrity of temperature inside the attic space...|$|R
40|$|An optical/thermal {{model for}} dusty snowpacks at {{temperate}} Martian latitudes {{is used to}} investigate the possibility of valley network formation by liquid water that was provided by <b>snowmelts,</b> assuming insolation absorption under clear-sky conditions. The mean-annual surface temperatures for snow and the atmospheric exchange terms of the surface energy balance are constrained by global climate model results. Under favorable conditions, liquid water is generated at atmospheric pressures as low as 30 - 100 mbar, provided that the substrate is composed of regolith; this condition {{is in keeping with}} the cratered terrain expected in an ancient Martian surface...|$|R

However, it is only possible to canoe on the creek downstream of the plateau of North Mountain. A total of [...] of the creek is canoeable. The difficulty rating of Muncy Creek for canoeing ranges from 1+ to 2.|$|R
5|$|The Trinity River is a {{predominantly}} rain-fed river, {{with the highest}} flows occurring between December and April and the lowest from August through October. The water level can rise quickly in the winter when large Pacific storms strike California's north coast. Almost no precipitation occurs in summer, when {{the primary source of}} flow is <b>snowmelt</b> from the higher elevations of the Klamath Mountains and groundwater base flow. In addition, diversion of water to the Central Valley has greatly reduced the total flow of the river since the 1960s, though conversely, a required minimum dam release for protection of migrating salmon results in a flow rate during the dry season that is higher than it naturally would be.|$|E
5|$|Mid-March brought warmer air to {{the country}} which thawed the snow lying on the ground. This <b>snowmelt</b> rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused {{widespread}} flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10per cent of the year's industrial production, 10to 20per cent of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The ruling Labour Party began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party in the 1950 election. That winter is also cited {{as a factor in}} the devaluation of the pound from $4.03 to $2.80, Britain's decline from being a superpower, and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

40|$|One {{special feature}} in the Swedish nature, mainly in the county of Uppland is one {{distinctive}} kind of dip, which can be distinguished from its fast and unaccounted drainage. These dips are called “glupar” and can mainly be found in coarse-grained pebbled moraine under the highest shoreline (HK). During spring, and particularly when <b>snowmelting</b> occur, the wateramliptude fluctuates a lot until late summer or the beginning of fall comes; these dips are then often almost fully drained. During winter however, the waterlevel stands high. Therefore, “glupar” can for some time be falsely interpreted as a small pond.
