500|$|The German {{government}} began a propaganda campaign [...] during World War I {{to discredit the}} United Kingdom's currency in India. The Germans convinced Indian citizens that British banknotes in that country could not be redeemed for silver. This led to a run on the British supply of silver. In response, United States Democratic senator Key Pittman of Nevada introduced legislation in 1918 that was intended to offer financial relief to the British government. The bill, passed on April 22, 1918, stated that [...] "sales of silver bullion under authority of this act may {{be made for the}} purpose of conserving the existing stock of gold in the United States, of providing silver for <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coinage</b> and for commercial use, and of assisting foreign governments at war with the enemies of the United States". The Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to melt up to 350,000,000 silver dollars, and this commenced immediately after the Act's passage. The U.S. eventually melted a total of 270,232,722silver dollars. Of that amount, 259,121,554 were sold to the United Kingdom at the cost of one dollar per troy ounce.|$|E
5000|$|The {{monetary}} law of 11 May 1871 replaced the peso with the venezolano at par. The Latin Monetary Union bimetallic standard was adopted, with the silver venezolano (venezolano de plata or fuerte) of 25g [...]900 fine {{and a gold}} venezolano of 1.612 g [...]900 fine. The <b>subsidiary</b> silver <b>coinage</b> was only [...]835 fine, legal tender {{to a maximum of}} 40 venezolanos per transaction.|$|R
50|$|The Pittman Act was a United States {{federal law}} {{sponsored}} by Senator Key Pittman of Nevada and enacted on April 23, 1918. The act authorized {{the conversion of}} not exceeding 350,000,000 standard silver dollars into bullion and its sale, or use for <b>subsidiary</b> silver <b>coinage,</b> and directed purchase of domestic silver for recoinage of a like number of dollars. Under the Act, 270,232,722 standard silver dollars were converted into bullion (259,121,554 for sale to Great Britain at $1.00 per fine ounce, plus mint charges, and 11,111,168 for <b>subsidiary</b> silver <b>coinage),</b> {{the equivalent of about}} 209,000,000 fine ounces of silver. Between 1920 and 1933, under the Act, the same quantity of silver was purchased from the output of American mines, at a fixed price of $1 per ounce, from which 270,232,722 standard silver dollars were recoined. The fixed price of $1 per ounce was above the market rate and acted as a federal subsidy to the silver mining industry.|$|R
6000|$|There are, then, the {{following}} kinds of legal tender in the United [...] States in 1884: (1) Gold coins (if not below tolerance); (2) the [...] silver dollar of 412-½ grains; (3) United States notes (except for [...] customs and {{interest on the}} public debt); (4) <b>subsidiary</b> silver [...] <b>coinage,</b> {{to the amount of}} five dollars; and (5) minor coins, to [...] the amount of twenty-five cents.|$|R
6000|$|III. After our {{previous}} experience, {{the impossibility of}} retaining [...] both metals in the coinage together, on equal terms, now came to [...] be generally recognized, and was accepted by Congress in the [...] legislation of 1853. This act made no further changes intended to [...] adapt the mint to the market ratios, but remained satisfied with [...] the gold circulation. But hitherto no regard had {{been paid to the}} [...] principles on which a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coinage</b> is based, as explained by [...] Mr. Mill in the last section (§ 2). The act of 1853, while [...] acquiescing in the single gold standard, had for its purpose the [...] readjustment of the subsidiary coins, which, together with silver [...] dollar-pieces, had all gone out of circulation. Before this, two [...] halves, four quarters, or ten dimes contained the same quantity of [...] pure silver as the dollar-piece (371-¼ grains); therefore, when it [...] became profitable to withdraw the dollar-pieces and substitute [...] gold, it gave exactly the same profit to withdraw two halves or [...] four quarters in silver. For this reason all the subsidiary silver [...] had gone out of circulation, and there was no “small change” in [...] the country. The legislation of 1853 rectified this error: (1) by [...] reducing the quantity of pure silver in a dollar’s worth of [...] subsidiary coin to 345.6 grains. By making so much less an amount [...] of silver equal to a dollar of small coins, it was more valuable [...] in that shape than as bullion, and {{there was no reason for}} melting [...] it, or withdrawing it (since even if gold and silver changed [...] considerably in their relative values, 345.6 grains of silver [...] could not easily rise sufficiently to become equal in value to a [...] gold dollar, when 371-¼ grains were worth only 104 cents of the [...] gold dollar); (2) this over-valuation of silver in subsidiary coin [...] would cause a great flow of silver to the mint, since silver would [...] be more valuable in subsidiary coin than as bullion; but this was [...] prevented by the provision (section 4 of the act of 1853) that the [...] amount or the small coinage should be limited according to the [...] discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury; and, (3) in order [...] that the overvalued small coinage might not be used for purposes [...] other than for effecting change, its legal-tender power was [...] restricted to payments not exceeding five dollars. This system, a [...] single gold standard for large, and silver for small, payments, [...] continued without question, and with great convenience, until the [...] days of the war, when paper money (1862-1879) drove out (by its [...] cheapness, again) both gold and silver. Paper was far cheaper than [...] the cheapest of the two metals.|$|E

50|$|The French {{began their}} Indo-Chinese empire in 1862 with Cochin-China {{which is the}} area around the Mekong delta and Saigon, and which is {{nowadays}} the extreme southern part of Vietnam. This empire very quickly expanded to include Cambodia which had been a vassal state of the Kingdom of Siam. In 1875, the French introduced a Cambodian franc to Cambodia. Although these francs were minted in Belgium between 1875 and 1885, they always bore the date 1860. The French also began to introduce a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coinage</b> in 'cents' into Cochin-China in the late 1870s. These cents were actually <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coinage</b> of the Mexican dollar unit as opposed to being <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coinage</b> of the French franc.|$|E
500|$|H. R. 8742 was {{transmitted}} to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. That committee's chairman, Oklahoma's Robert L. Owen, reported it back with {{an amendment to the}} full Senate, where the bill was considered on May 21, 1918. The House-passed bill had said the laws relating to the minor coinage of the United States (the cent and nickel) would apply to the coin; this was changed to state that the laws relating to the <b>subsidiary</b> silver <b>coinage</b> (which the half dollar was) would apply. The bill was passed as amended without objection. Later in the day, Illinois Senator James Hamilton Lewis made a statement which was inserted in the Congressional Record at this point, applauding the passage of the honor to his home state, and noting that [...] "more than a hundred thousand of her sons" [...] were then being deployed to the battlefields of World War I.|$|R

50|$|To {{control the}} money supply in French Indochina in 1885, the French {{introduced}} a new silver Piastre de commerce and associated <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coinage</b> throughout the entire Indo-Chinese colonies {{in order to increase}} monetary stability. The piastre was initially equivalent to the Mexican peso. The piastre was therefore a direct lineal descendent of the Spanish pieces of eight that had been brought to the Orient from Mexico on the Manila Galleons. It was initially on a silver standard of 1 piastre = 24.4935 grams pure silver. This was reduced to 24.3 grams in 1895.|$|E

5000|$|This almost {{forgotten}} statute {{is one of}} the most significant measures in American currency history. After resisting for sixty years every attempt to introduce any form of fiduciary silver coinage, Congress adopted a subsidiary silver coin as an adjunct to the postal service, without realizing that the first step had been taken in the relegation of silver to the status of a subordinate monetary material. The new piece was the first silver coin in the history of the United States that was not legal tender for an unlimited amount. <b>Subsidiary</b> <b>coinage</b> had been established, but in a trivial way, by an unworkable law, and at a time when the entire silver currency was flowing out of the country.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the French in Indo-China {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, cash coins similar to those used in the provinces of China {{circulated}} in the area that is nowadays known as Vietnam. There was also a silver milled dragon coin and associated <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coinage</b> in circulation. The dragon coin is believed to have been in imitation of the Spanish and Mexican silver dollars which also circulated widely in the region at that time, however the dragon dollars were worth less because the fineness of the silver was less than that in the Spanish and Mexican dollars. In the region that is nowadays Cambodia and Laos, the Siamese coinage circulated and Cambodia had its own regional varieties of the Siamese Tical (Thai Baht).|$|E

50|$|By 1858, the British {{government}} gave up {{all attempts}} to influence the currency situation in Canada, and by the 1860s {{it came to the}} same realisation in Hong Kong: that {{there was no point in}} trying to displace an already existing currency system. In 1863, the Royal Mint in London began issuing special <b>subsidiary</b> <b>coinage</b> for use in Hong Kong within the dollar system. In 1866, a local mint was established at Sugar Street in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island for the purpose of minting Hong Kong silver dollar and half dollar coins of the same value and similar likeness to their Mexican counterparts. The Chinese did not however receive these new Hong Kong dollars well, and in 1868 the Hong Kong Mint was closed down with a loss of $440,000. The machinery at the Hong Kong mint was sold first to Jardine Matheson and in turn to the Japanese and used to make the first Yen coins in 1870. In the 1860s, banknotes of the new British colonial banks, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and the Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China, denominated in dollars, also began to circulate in both Hong Kong and the wider region.|$|E
