5000|$|Socialthing was {{an early}} <b>social</b> <b>aggregator</b> that let users manage {{multiple}} social networking feeds from a single Web dashboard. The company was founded by Ben Brightwell, Brian DeWitt, and Matt Galligan, and {{was part of the}} inaugural TechStars startup accelerator program in Boulder in 2007. Socialthing launched a private beta with support for Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Vimeo, Pownce, and LiveJournal in early 2008. [...] Socialthing differentiated itself from Friendfeed and other aggregators through the use of an algorithm that determined users' friends—at the time, competing services required users to define a list of friends for each service. CEO Matt Galligan described Socialthing's advantage to users as [...] "simply just being able to see what all of your friends on all of your networks are doing without ever having to add them, and then being able to communicate with them, all without ever leaving the same site." ...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} how societies should be partitioned into classes if individuals express their views about who should be put with whom in the same class. A non-bossiness condition makes the <b>social</b> <b>aggregator</b> dependent only on those cells of the individual partitions the society members classify themselves in. This information is used to construct for each profile of views an opinion graph. By means of natural sovereignty and liberalism requirements, we characterize the non-bossy aggregators generating partitions in which the social classes are refinements of the connected components in the opinion graph.

40|$|Many {{factors such}} as the {{tendency}} of individuals to develop rela-tionships based on mutual acquaintances, proximity, common in-terests, or combinations thereof, are known to contribute toward evolution of social networks. In this paper, we analyze an evolving online <b>social</b> <b>aggregator,</b> FriendFeed, which collates content gen-erated by participating individuals on a variety of Web 2. 0 services and allows easy dissemination of the aggregated content to other participants of the aggregator. Analyzing data collected between September 2008 and May 2009, we find that although preferen-tial attachment captures the evolution of the network, its influence varies significantly based on how long ago a user joined the ser-vice. In particular, preferential attachment does not appear to ap-ply to new entrants of the FriendFeed service. Analysis suggests that proximity bias {{plays an important role in}} link formation. We study the influence of common foci and find that individuals have a greater affinity toward those with similar interests...|$|E

The aggregation is enabled by APIs provided by social networks, so that people may have control on the data the aggregation platform can access.|$|R
40|$|Housing has {{represented}} {{one of the}} most ancient aspects in the social life of humankind. The need of a shelter has developed through millennia from the basic forms of dolmen to the current deconstructivist and emotional architectures that contribute to the identification of cities, countries and cultures. Although the new architectural styles have deeply developed from their basic solutions, they still respond to the same needs of housing, <b>social</b> <b>aggregator</b> and icons. Nonetheless, the transformation the architecture has encountered in the centuries can be divided in four main groups, depending on features like architectural composition, material use and energy requirements. These groups can be defined as sustainable primitive solutions, technology dependent architectures,passive architectures and finally the active architectures that have arisen in the last years. The thesis research analyzes the development of these four groups through the investigation of those forces and principles that have contributed and enforced the development of the peculiarities of the built forms of the respective period. In particular, the research focuses on the development of active housing in regard to the current economical and energetic crises, highlighting the transformation of housing from a pure architectonic process to a wider concept of sustainable energy producer. On a further stage, the research underlines the opportunities that active architectures offer in terms of energy production while overtaking the “NYMBism” that is often correlated with energy facilities. Finally, it analyses the development of smart grids, water management and biogas production as important tools {{for the development of a}} network of architectures that become diffuse small energy facilities and sustainable resource consumers...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{the work}} of Walter Benjamin is {{examined}} for relationships to developments in internet culture and societies. Beginning with Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s use of allegories in illuminating the growth of bourgeois culture in 19 th century Paris, particularly the flaneur, the feuilletonist, and the sandwichboardman, this thesis then moves to discuss the relationship between Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s method {{and how they can}} show structures in the formation and attraction of <b>social</b> <b>aggregator</b> websites (also known as social bookmarking) and social networking. The first part of the thesis discusses social aggregators, in particular the websites reddit, Digg, and MetaFilter. This section examines the history and development of these sites, how they work, and what the community response to them has so far been, before moving into a discussion of how these structures affect the individual user. The individual user on these sites is seen as analogous to the flaneur, who in strolling through the crowds served an economic purpose of making their consumption public. In this manner, the user turns 2 ̆ 2 slack 2 ̆ 2 (as the site reddit puts it) into economic work. The transformation of this slack into economic benefit is seen as belonging to an economic cycle first developed by Benjamin to explain {{the work of}} the feuilletonist and the decline of the visual aspect of this cycle from the extravagant flaneur to the destitute sandwichboardman. The second part of the thesis explores the history and technology of social networking, in particular the websites LiveJournal, MySpace, and Facebook. Here the sites are discussed in light of Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s elucidation of the development of the bourgeois individual, particularly in the aspects of the bourgeois collector and the evolution of the private interior. In particular, the arcades of 19 th century Paris are seen as being instructional as to how to be a modern, urban individual; the social networking site is seen as serving an analogous purpose for training individuals how to be modern, digital citizens. Finally, Benjamin 2 ̆ 7 s technique of the allegory, while useful in highlighing certain trends in social networking is seen as being pushed to its limits in addressing the rhetoric of a dominant ideology in digital life, that of technolibertarianism/transhumanism...|$|E

30|$|One of {{the main}} {{hindrance}} in this field {{is the lack of}} datasets enabling the analysis of the single individual’s behavior across different sites. This criticality can be ascribed to a variety of motivations. First of all, people are unwilling to make all information about their online social life public and, secondly, social site providers have less of an interest in providing tools to integrate other social platforms. To overcome the data problem, in this paper we rely on the services offered by <b>social</b> media <b>aggregators.</b> A <b>social</b> media <b>aggregator</b> is a Web service which allows users to collect and manage different social site accounts through a single application. Most of these services offer to their users a private space, where they can share a content simultaneously on multiple media. Among these services, we retrieve data about users and their social sites from Alternion 2, because allows users to make information about their social sites public, unlike most of <b>social</b> media <b>aggregators.</b> Thus, it is possible to collect data about their profiles with personal public information and the posted contents.|$|R

Under this lens, four primary access function classes were established: 1) access to newspapers; 2) information search; 3) information clippings, and 4) content aggregation. For each of these classes, several sub-types are described and analyzed, including directories, newspaper archives, historical press archives, press data bases, press clippings, online clipping, social network clipping, manual and automatic <b>aggregators,</b> and <b>social</b> <b>aggregators.</b> The article also provides several illustrative Spanish- and English-language examples...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} general {{framework}} for analyzing {{a class of}} functions called <b>social</b> <b>aggregators,</b> which map profiles of linear orders {{to a set of}} binary relations. This class of aggregators includes aggregators that yield a preference relation (social welfare functions) and those which yield a choice of an alternative (social choice functions). Equipped with this framework, I identify a property called Preference Reversal (PR) such that any Pareto efficient aggregator having this property must be dictatorial. This allows me to state a general impossibility theorem, which includes Arrow’s Theorem and the Gibbard Satterthwaite Theorem as two special examples. Furthermore, I show that monotonicity and IIA are closely linked, by demonstrating that both are actually special cases of PR in specific environments. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2004...|$|R

40|$|Museum is {{much more}} than a place for {{preserving}} artifacts and objects. Indeed, throughout history, the museums, flexible and adaptive places, have been designed as <b>social</b> <b>aggregators,</b> to house objects and collections in which community could identify. They have always represented powerful means of communication through their ability to convey knowledge and to involve its audience (tourists and local residents). For over half a century, museums have become an important design topic, accompanied by a sharp increase in the creation of new architectural formal configurations. Also the role of museum has been changing: museum is not only a place for exhibiting, also the container itself has become an artwork. Nowadays, with the triumphal entry of computer into architectural design, the digital expressiveness gains the upper hand and architects have the freedom to fully play with morphology in relation to museums, often characterized by impressive dimensions. This paper aims to explore how in the Digital Age the museums are changing in their role and in their architectural shapes, both interior and exterior, and are becoming an instrument of urban and cultural renewal. We will analyse and report as examples several recent case-studies designed by worldwide architectural firms, that had much claim and publicity in international architecture magazines in the last years...|$|R
