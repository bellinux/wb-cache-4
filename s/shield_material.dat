40|$|Electromagnetic {{shielding}} is popularly used {{to suppress}} electromagnetic noise generated from electronic equipments. It {{is important to}} know the shielding mechanism in designing the effective shielding. In this paper, the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of a horizontal multilayered medium with either a magnetic or an electric dipole source was calculated theoretically by a Sommerfeld integral, in which a spherical wave radiated from the dipole source is expanded into a large number of cylindrical waves. The integration formulas are derived and they are numerically calculated for investigation of shielding effectiveness and Poynting flux.

5000|$|This {{presented}} a new method of attacking enemy nuclear reentry vehicles (RVs) while still at long range from their targets. X-rays hitting the warhead's outermost layer will react by heating {{a thin layer}} of the material so rapidly that shock waves develop that can cause the heat <b>shield</b> <b>material</b> {{on the outside of the}} RV to separate or flake off. The RV would then break up during reentry. The major advantage of this attack is that it takes place over long distances, as great as 30 km, which covers the majority of the threat tube containing the warhead and the various radar decoys and clutter material that accompanies it.

5000|$|Passivation, in {{physical}} chemistry and engineering, {{refers to a}} material becoming [...] "passive," [...] that is, less affected or corroded by the environment of future use. Passivation involves creation of an outer layer of <b>shield</b> <b>material</b> that is applied as a microcoating, created by chemical reaction with the base material, or allowed to build from spontaneous oxidation in the air.

Passivation can occur only in certain conditions, and is used in microelectronics to enhance silicon. The technique of passivation strengthens and preserves the appearance of [...] In electrochemical treatment of water, passivation reduces the effectiveness of the treatment by increasing the circuit resistance, and active measures are typically used to overcome this effect, the most common being polarity reversal, which results in limited rejection of the fouling layer.

5000|$|The {{ablative}} {{heat shield}} functions by lifting the hot shock layer gas {{away from the}} heat shield's outer wall (creating a cooler boundary layer). The boundary layer comes from blowing of gaseous reaction products from the heat <b>shield</b> <b>material</b> and provides protection against all forms of heat flux. The overall process of reducing the heat flux experienced by the heat shield's outer wall {{by way of a}} boundary layer is called blockage. Ablation occurs at two levels in an ablative TPS: the outer surface of the TPS material chars, melts, and sublimes, while the bulk of the TPS material undergoes pyrolysis and expels product gases. The gas produced by pyrolysis is what drives blowing and causes blockage of convective and catalytic heat flux. Pyrolysis can be measured in real time using thermogravimetric analysis, so that the ablative performance can be evaluated. [...] Ablation can also provide blockage against radiative heat flux by introducing carbon into the shock layer thus making it optically opaque. Radiative heat flux blockage was the primary thermal protection mechanism of the Galileo Probe TPS material (carbon phenolic). Carbon phenolic was originally developed as a rocket nozzle throat material (used in the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster) and for re-entry vehicle nose tips.|$|E
