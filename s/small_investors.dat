5|$|For {{more than}} eight decades, the Toronto Argonauts Football Club was the sole {{property}} of its namesake rowing club. By the 1950s, the team's complex management structure made the arrangement increasingly awkward. Facing overdraft and with wealthy suitors knocking, the Argonaut rowers finally sold the team to a consortium led by John Bassett, Eric Cradock, and Charlie Burns in 1957. Each held about 20% share in the company, with the balance made up by <b>small</b> <b>investors</b> who had some affinity with the club; the initial agreement called for a long-term debenture of $400,000 {{to be set up}} that would sustain the rowing club in the absence of its football income. Bassett was the operating head of the franchise and is often given sole credit for the initial purchase of the Argos, but Cradock was also instrumental in spearheading the drive. He would sell his share to Len Lumbers just two years into his tenure in part because of Bassett's controlling nature. Bassett arranged a complete buyout of the other shareholders for $2.31 million in 1971 through his holdings in Baton Broadcasting.|$|E

25|$|The crisis led to {{questioning}} of the business model of the investment bank without the regulation imposed on it by Glass–Steagall.
