40|$|This {{document}} is the user's {{guide for the}} method developed earlier for predicting the slipstream wing interaction at subsonic speeds. The analysis involves a subsonic panel code (HESS code) modified to handle the propeller onset flow. The propfan <b>slipstream</b> <b>effects</b> are superimposed on the normal flow boundary condition and are applied over the surface washed by the slipstream. The effects of the propeller slipstream are to increase the axial induced velocity, tangential velocity, and a total pressure rise {{in the wake of}} the propeller. Principles based on blade performance theory, momentum theory, and vortex theory were used to evaluate the <b>slipstream</b> <b>effects.</b> The code can be applied to any arbitrary three dimensional geometry, expressed in the form of HESS input format. The code can handle a propeller alone configuration or a propeller/nacelle/airframe configuration, operating up to high subcritical Mach numbers over a range of angles of attack. Inclusion of a viscous modelling is briefly outlined. Wind tunnel results/theory comparisons are included as examples for the application of the code to a generic supercritical wing/overwing Nacelle with a powered propfan.

40|$|Oil {{price has}} rapidly {{increased}} in the past centuries and made the fuel consumption a hot topic in the transport business. This was also emphasized by a study made by the heavy duty vehicle manufacturer, Scania CV AB, who concluded that one third of their operational cost {{could be related to}} the fuel consumption. An alleviation to this problem might be to form a platoon of vehicles. This will not only increase the capacity of the traffic flow but also decrease the fuel consumption due to the <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect</b> that occurs behind traveling objects. Control has already been developed to handle fixed intermediate distances within a platoon of vehicles and is referred to as Automatic Intelligent Cruise Control in the vocabulary of the manufacturers. However none of these existing regulators are taking the <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect</b> into concern and is therefore not suitable for the purpose of fuel reduction by vehicle platooning. By paying regards to this particular effect the complexity of the dynamics is increased and new more sophisticated regulators are necessary. In this thesis a new distributed regulator is proposed which is able to take the <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect</b> into concern using linear quadratic regulation. This regulator maintains the present informational topology where each vehicle is able to measure the distance as well as the velocity to the vehicle ahead. Through simulations it is shown that the regulator is able to cope with realistic scenarios, a systematic decrease of error throughout the platoon has been observed and robustness has been proven...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented work is to investigate the <b>slipstream</b> <b>effects</b> on the flow properties and thrust performances of a full-length and truncated annular plug nozzle of a small rocket launcher during a suborbital flight. The nozzle flow properties are investigated for three characteristics flow conditions (M∞ = 1. 3, 2. 59 and 9. 7), using CFD simulations. When the rocket launcher flies through the atmosphere, the body geometry produces a slipstream with conditions in the nozzle area that {{are different from the}} undisturbed environment. The in-flight behavior of the truncated plug nozzles is complicated and affected also by recirculation regions that take place behind the shroud and plug base. In this paper special emphasis is given to investigate the <b>slipstream</b> <b>effects</b> between the hot exhaust plume from the rocket engine and the external coaxial supersonic/hypersonic air flow and their influence on the slope and position of different shocks generated in the separated flow region (realignment shocks, recompression shocks, plug base lip shock and trailing shocks).

40|$|As the {{aviation}} industry continues {{to strive for}} improvements in fuel efficiency throughout the entire aircraft design, interest has been renewed in propeller engines. New research into advanced turboprop engines, so-called open rotor engines, seems promising as they combine the inherent high propulsive efficiency of ordinary turboprop engines, with the capability of delivering higher thrust. Unfortunately, the implementation of propeller engines does have significant implications on the stability and controllability of an aircraft. These implications are primarily caused by the propeller slipstream, the complex streamtube behind the propeller with strong gradients in various flow quantities both in streamwise and radial direction. The objective of this thesis was to develop, implement, and validate a prediction method for the propeller <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect</b> on the longitudinal stability and control of conventional aircraft configurations in the Initiator. During {{the investigation of the}} propeller <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect,</b> an existing prediction method was found which was based on calculating the four major effects caused by the propeller slipstream on the longitudinal stability and control. These four effects are, an additional normal force at the propeller disk, an increase in lift over the wing due to the slipstream, a change in the tail-off pitching moment, and a change in tail contribution to the pitching moment due to increased downwash and dynamic pressure. This method seemed ideal as it not only gives relatively accurate results, but does so with computationaly inexpensive calculations. During the implementation of this method in the Initiator, additional changes were made to calculate aerodynamic variables which were previously estimated using an extended vortex lattice method program. This implemented prediction method was validated using the only available wind tunnel data for the Fokker 50 and a special Saab 340 with T-tail configuration. Through this validation, the prediction method proved to maintain an acceptable accuracy for all configurations with minimal computation time. Further analysis of the results showed that the propeller <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect</b> reduces the tail effectiveness due to an increase in downwash angle at the tail. This was especially the case for the Fokker 50, which due to its low wing configuration, has a further increase in downwash caused by an inflow effect of the outer flow into the streamtube.

This investigation was undertaken to provide information {{on the effects of}} propeller operation on longitudinal stability characteristics for the XF - 84 H airplane and to provide an indication of <b>slipstream</b> <b>effects</b> that might be encountered on similar swept-wing configurations. Effects of propeller operation were generally destabilizing for all conditions investigated; however, the over-all stability characteristics with power on were greatly dependent on the power-off characteristics. With flaps and slats retracted, longitudinal instability was present at moderate angles of attack both with the propeller off and with power on. The longitudinal stability with flaps and slats deflected, which was satisfactory without power, was decreased by propeller operation, but no marked pitch-up tendency was indicated. Significant improvement in the power-on stability with flaps retracted was achieved by use of either a wing fence at 75 percent semispan, a leading-edge chord-extension from 65 to 94 percent semispan, or a raised horizontal tail located 65 percent semispan above the thrust line...|$|E

40|$|Plug nozzles {{are usually}} {{designed}} to achieve altitude adaptation {{in a wide}} range of chamber/ambient pressure ratios. In actual in-flight operations of plug nozzles, this phenomenon must take place in a flowing airstream, which can affect the performance. To understand the flow behavior in such conditions and to evaluate the departure from the ideal nozzle performance, an investigation is carried out with a validated numerical tool based on the solution of turbulent Navier– Stokes equations and on shock fitting. A sample rocket plug nozzle is analyzed parametrically to evaluate the effect of varying Mach number at constant pressure and the effect of varying pressure ratio at constant Mach number. The results indicate that the interaction with a flowing airstream reduces the pressure of the external air, as seen from the nozzle exhaust jet, yielding a reduction of the performance. In particular, a dramatic decrease of nozzle performance may take place in the transonic region if the <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect</b> is neglected in the design. The results also provide useful indications on how the Mach number and the shroud shape can affect the value of ambient pressure where the transition from open to closed wake takes place...|$|R

The data were applied to an assumed airplane with four propellers and a wing loading of 50 pounds per square foot. Also included is {{an examination of the}} stability and control problems that may result in the landing and take-off speed range of such a vehicle. The results indicated that the landing and take-off distances could be more than halved by the use of highly effective flaps in combination with large amounts of engine power to augment lift (STOL). At the lowest speeds considered (about 50 knots), adequate longitudinal stability was obtained but the lateral and directional stability were unsatisfactory. At these low speeds, the conventional aerodynamic control surfaces {{may not be able to}} cope with the forces and moments produced by symmetric, as well as asymmetric, engine operation.

A control concept has been proposed {{in order to take}} advantage of the fast response characteristics of the ordinary small engine/propeller propulsion systems in such aircraft, as well as replacing the complex rotors used previously in VTOL concepts for small unmanned aircraft. The simulation model has been established on the basis of the proposed concept so that it can also be used to study the feasibility of this idea. An Object-based methodology has been introduced so as to reduce the amount of aerodynamic required data for the simulation model.

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{computational}} {{study of}} the low Reynolds number aerodynamics for MAV applications. The emphasis of the research is to design the optimal MAV model that has a simple geometrical structure but superior in its performances. For a better understanding on the low Reynolds number flow structures, this work started with {{an investigation of the}} laminar separation bubble (LSB) on both a two dimensional aerofoil and a three dimensional wing planforms, including rectangular, trapezoidal, Zimmerman and inversed-Zimmerman wing planforms. The fuselage effects on aerodynamics were also studied, and it degraded the overall aerodynamic performance due to the aerodynamic interaction between the wing and fuselage. However, it improves the overall static longitudinal stability for all wing planforms. The aerodynamic comparisons show that the Zimmerman wing-fuselage model has a better static longitudinal stability than other models. The propeller <b>slipstream</b> <b>effects</b> for the Zimmerman wing-fuselage model was also carried out. The overall aerodynamics is improved. The swirl flow from the propeller, however, modifies the overall flow structure on both the upper and lower wing surfaces. The LSB forms on both the lower wing sides (a long bubble is formed on the down-going blade side, and a short bubble is found on the up-going blade side). Flow separation takes place at both sides of the fuselage. The longitudinal stability margin improves almost twice than that on the isolated wing-fuselage model. The static lateral stability shows that the MAV without the vertical stabilizer is statically laterally unstable, whereas the MAV with vertical stabilizer is statically laterally stable. Finally, the fluid-structure interaction effect on aerodynamics for the Zimmerman wing-fuselage model is also investigated, showing that the separation region on the upper wing surface is reduced significantly due to wing flexibility. This results in a significant upwards shift of the lift curve, with a much higher CLmax. The flexible wing also shows a longer working range for lift than the rigid wing model. In other words, the flexible wing model has the capability to carry more payload...|$|E
40|$|An {{inviscid}} nonuniform axisymmetric transonic {{code was}} developed for applications in analysis and design. Propfan <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect</b> on pressure distribution for a body with and without sting was investigated.

Increasing nonuniformity magnitude made pressure coefficient more negative and moved the shock rearward. Design study was conducted with the CONMIN optimizer for an ellipsoid and a body with the NACA- 0012 counter.

40|$|During the 509 th Colloquium of the Euromech society, {{held from}} March 24 th & 25 th at TU Berlin, fifty leading {{researchers}} {{from all over}} europe discussed various topics affecting both road vehicle as well as railway vehicle aerodynamics, especially drag reduction (with road vehicles), cross wind stability (with trains) and wake analysis (with both). With the increasing service speed of modern high-speed railway traffic, aerodynamic aspects are gaining importance. The aerodynamic research topics comprise both pure performance improvements, such as the continuous lowering of aerodynamic drag for energy efficiency, as well as safety relevant topics, such as cross-wind stability. The latter topic was most recently brought to attention when a swiss narrow-gauge train overturned during the severe storm Kyrill in january 2007. The shape of the train head usually has largest influence on cross wind stability. <b>Slipstream</b> <b>effects</b> of passing trains cause aerodynamic loads on objects and passengers waiting at platforms. The strength of the slipstream is determined by both the boundary layer development {{along the length of}} the train and the wake developing behind the tail of the train. Since high-speed trains can be considered to be as smooth as technically possible, attention is drawn to the wake region. The wake of the train again is also one important factor for the total drag of a train. Due to the fact that trains are bidirectional, optimisation of the leading car of a train with respect to drag and cross wind performance while simultaneously minimising the wake of the train for drag and slipstream performance is a great challenge. Modern optimisation tools are used to aid this multi-parameter multi-constraint design optimisation in conjunction with both CFD and wind tunnel investigations. Since many of the aerodynamic effects in the railway sector are of similar importance to road vehicles, the aim of the colloquium is to bridge the application of shape optimisation principles between rail- and road vehicles. Particular topics to be addressed in the colloquium are: Drag, Energy consumption and emissions: Due to increase in energy cost, drag reduction has gained focus in the past years and attention will grow in the future. Pressure induced drag is of common importance for both rail- and road vehicles. The optimisation of head- and tail shape for road vehicles as well as for bi-directional vehicles (trains) is in the focus. Interference drag between adjacent components shall also be treated. Slipstream Effects: Are a safety issue for high-train operation (Prams sucked into track due to train-induced draught flows) when trains passing platforms at high speeds. For Road vehicles, the ride stability of overtaking cars is influenced by the wake of the leading trucks and busses. Common interest is the minimisation of wake effects for both rail and road vehicles. Cross-Wind Safety, Ride stability under strong winds: Both are safety issues for rail- and road vehicles.

40|$|Vertical Takeoff-and-Landing (VTOL) Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) {{provide a}} {{versatile}} operational platform which combines {{the capabilities of}} fixed wing and rotary wing MAVs. In order to improve performance of these vehicles, {{a better understanding of}} the rapid transition between horizontal and vertical flight is required. This study examines the flow structures around the Mini-Vertigo VTOL MAV using flow visualization techniques. This will gives an understanding of the flow structures which dominate the flight dynamics of rapid pitching maneuvers. This study consists of three objectives: develop an experimental facility, use flow visualization to investigate the flow around the experimental subject during pitching, and analyze the results. The model used for testing features a low aspect ratio (AR), low Reynolds number (Re) Zimmerman planform wing with two contra-rotating propellers in a tractor configuration. The experimental facility, located at the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at The University of Arizona, consists of: a closed loop open test section wind tunnel capable of airspeeds up to 15 m/s and controlled with a variable frequency drive (VFD); a power source and wire to generate vapor from a mixture of turbine oil, petroleum jelly, and iron powder, which is placed across the wind tunnel nozzle outlet; a five axis robotic arm mounted below the test section capable of controlling the experimental subject for pitching maneuvers; and, a pair of video cameras capable of recording the flow visualization at 600 frames per second. The flow within the wind tunnel was carefully examined in order to insure that the experimental subject was placed within a region of flow unaffected by boundary effects and that there were no significant disturbances or oscillations within the flow. The flow around the experimental subject was studied in both static and dynamic testing. For the static tests, the angle of attack (AOA) of the experimental subject was varied across a range of AOA from 15 to 70 degrees. For each range of AOA, the Re was varied to 10700, 22600, and 35500, and advance ratio (J) was varied from undefined, 0. 60, to 0. 47. Several conclusions can be drawn from the static testing. The flow is dominated by the propeller <b>slipstream</b> <b>effects.</b> The slipstream drastically delayed leading edge (LE) separation and vortex shedding. It also causes flow to be either deflected downward into the slipstream or to deflect outward towards the wing tip before passing over the LE. The slipstream strength also increases the turbulence in the slipstream and relative velocity of the flow at the wing surface compared to freestream. The Re affects the LE (visible only without slipstream) and trailing edge (TE) vortex shedding frequencies, increased Re increases the frequency. Additionally, it appears that the non-dimensional LE and TE vortex shedding frequencies are constant at a value of 0. 216, irrespective of both Re and advance ratio. This is important because it means that these observations are likely valid across a broad range of flight conditions. Dynamic testing also varied the advance ratio and the Re. It also varied the reduced frequency. Both positive and negative pitching was examined. Many of the conclusions drawn were the same as those from static testing. Increasing the Re increased the vortex shedding frequency. The slipstream delayed LE separation and caused significant deflection downward and towards the wingtip, as well as increasing turbulence and relative flow speed at the top surface prior to separation. Dynamic testing also found that in the presence of the slipstream, increased Re decreases the AOA of LE separation, while without the slipstream, increased Re increases the AOA of LE separation. In addition, the pitching rate has several effects on the flow. For positive pitching, increasing the pitch rate decreases the AOA of separation and for negative pitching; increasing the pitch rate has no apparent effect on the AOA of separation. This is contrary to expectations. Previous study 1 has shown that increasing the pitching rate delays stall and nose down pitching hastens stall. Additionally, greater positive pitching rate slightly increases the TE vortex shedding frequency. In the absence of a slipstream, LE and TE vortex-shedding frequency are generally the same. Some interesting phenomena were found at the LE. In the presence of a pulsating slipstream from the propellers, the LE separation bubble oscillates in both height and length. It does so at the same frequency as the propeller rotation and is due to variation in the flow speed at the LE. During pitch down maneuvers, the flow reattaches at the LE first and then the region of attached flow moves aft, opposite of the characteristics of pitch up. With only minimal variation, the non-dimensional TE vortex shedding frequency remains constant at an average value of 0. 229. However, it appears that increasing the pitching rate increases this value slightly. Re and advance ratio have no appreciable effect on this data. It is therefore possible to extend this result to a large range of flight conditions. A comparison of the static and dynamic testing resulted in several findings that correlated very well with previous research on this model. During positive, nose-up, pitching, the increase in lift found previously was due to the increased downward deflection of the flow and the delay of stall was due to the delay in LE separation. The opposite effects were found in negative, nose-down, pitching. There was disagreement in the findings based on the size of the turbulent separation wake and the increase and decrease in drag. Positive pitching was found to increase the drag on the model however positive pitching reduces the size of the turbulent separation wake which should decrease drag. The increase in downward flow deflection caused by pitching rate was significantly less than that due to the slipstream. Therefore the increase in lift due to the slipstream is greater than that due to pitching. The flow around the Mini-Vertigo VTOL MAV is dominated by the slipstream from its propellers. The slipstream delays LE separation and causes drastic deflection in the flow. While the frequency of the vortices shed from the LE and TE varies with flow speed, the non-dimensional frequency does not. It does, however, vary slightly with the pitching rate. These results are applicable across a wide range of flight conditions...|$|E

5|$|Giovinazzi quickly caught Marciello and overtook him (with {{the help}} of DRS and drafting) {{at the start of}} lap 18 to take over the lead. Giovinazzi began to pull away from Maricello. The safety car was {{deployed}} for the fourth (and final) time after Nato attempted to pass teammate King around the inside and retired from the race having been squeezed into the turn three barrier by him. The area was cleared of Nato's damaged car over the next five laps which meant the race would finish under a time limit. Giovinazzi accelerated as late as possible to limit the <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect</b> and remained the leader at the lap-25 restart despite locking-up his tyres heading into the first turn. King retired from the race following contact with Eriksson. Giovinazzi remained the leader for the remaining two laps to clinch his first, and his team's maiden, victory in the GP2 Series. Siroktin overtook Rowland for third place and clinched second position from Marciello by drafting behind him on the start/finish straight. Rowland finished in fourth place, ahead of Evans and Matsushita whom he defended from in the final two laps. Gelael, de Jong, Ghiotto, and Malja rounded out the point-scoring positions. Eriksson and King were the last of the classified finishers. The attrition race was high, with ten drivers reaching the end of the race.|$|R
50|$|Aleksei Dudukalo had pole for Race 2, {{but it was}} Tom Coronel who led {{the early}} stages of the race. At the end of the first lap, Muller and Huff were seventh and eighth, but using the <b>slipstream</b> <b>effect</b> and their {{superior}} top speed, picked off the cars in front rapidly. On lap 4, Muller passed Coronel to take the lead, Huff took second a lap later and Menu who had lost out to his teammates at the start moved into third at half-distance. The second half of the race was strewn with punctures for the front-wheel drive Chevrolets and SEATs. Tiago Monteiro, Alex MacDowall and Menu all crashed out as a result of punctures, whereas Dudukalo, teammate Gabriele Tarquini and Pasquale Di Sabatino were forced to pit for new rubber. Muller and Huff had broken clear of the rest of the pack, but were then told by the team to back off and hold station. However, Muller's left front tyre punctured on the last lap with four corners left, Huff took the lead only to suffer the same fate at the last corner. Coronel in second got held up behind the slowing Chevrolet, and Stefano D'Aste swept around the outside of both Huff and Coronel to take the overall win along with the Yokohama win. Huff held off Coronel on the line to take second, and with Muller limping home in eighth place, was able to cut Muller's championship lead down to eight points.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with mathematical modelling and optimal control of constrained systems. Each of the systems under consideration {{is a system that}} can be controlled by one of the variables, and this control is subject to constraints. First, we consider middle-distance running where a runner's horizontal propulsive force is the control which is constrained to be within a given range. Middle-distance running is typically a strategy-intensive race as <b>slipstreaming</b> <b>effects</b> come into play since speeds are still relatively fast and runners can leave their starting lane. We formulate a two-runner coupled model and determine optimal strategies using optimal control theory. Second, we consider two applications of control systems with delay related to R&D expenditure. The first of these applications relates to the defence industry. The second relates to the pharmaceutical industry. Both applications are characterised by a long delay between initial investment in R&D and seeing the benefits of R&D realised. We formulate models tailored to each application and use optimal control theory to determine the optimal proportion of available funds to invest in R&D over a given time horizon. Third, we consider a mathematical model of urban burglary based on the Short model. We make some modifications to this model including the addition of deterrence due to police officer presence. Police officer density is the control variable, which is constrained due to a finite number of police officers. We look at different control strategies for the police and their effect on burglary hot-spot formation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
