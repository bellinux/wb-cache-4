500|$|The storyline began {{on-screen}} when Nicole {{started dating}} Elliot Gillen (Paul Pantano). He had a vendetta against Roman and kidnapped Nicole and Geoff {{and left them}} stranded out at sea. They washed up on a deserted island and were forced to survive without food and clothing. Describing the effect it had on Nicole and Geoff, James stated: [...] "They have no food, shelter or clothing. [...] They find moments to make each other laugh, though, and realise how much they mean to one another." [...] Geoff had strong religious views and {{did not believe in}} premarital sex. However, the environment they were in caused him to let his guard down and they slept together. Lewis told TV Week that all the pair could think of whilst trapped was being rescued and their feelings for one an other. He added that [...] "the fact they were both pretty much naked didn't help". He concluded the fact they were both kids, trying to keep warm - that then [...] "stuff happens". Geoff was left [...] "guilt-ridden" [...] because he gave into temptation. He did not regret it, but acknowledged that he wanted to save his virginity until marriage. Therefore, Geoff saw no other option but to propose to Nicole. Lewis stated, [...] "He's not 100% <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> either, but he feels that if they're going to have sex, a wedding is the only solution." [...] Describing Nicole's reaction he said that she was [...] "dumbfounded" [...] by his offer, as she had believed he was acting strange because he wanted to dump her. Nicole refused when she realised his reasons for proposing. According to James, the moment managed to ruin their passion, she also commented that: [...] "Nicole has liked Geoff for ages and was so happy to have got together with him - but now he's spoiled it." [...] James also admitted she was trilled to learn Nicole would turn down his proposal. James later opined that Nicole was [...] "the one" [...] for Geoff, but did not believe that Geoff was [...] "the one" [...] for Nicole.|$|E

2500|$|Stylistically, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son {{developed}} the sounds first heard on Somewhere in Time, although, on this occasion, the synth effects {{were created by}} keyboards rather than bass or guitar synthesisers. According to Dickinson, the band decided not to hire a keyboard player, with the parts being [...] "mainly one-finger stuff from , Steve, the engineer or whoever had a finger free at the time." [...] Harris was fond of the development, {{in spite of the}} fact that the record did not sell as well as its predecessor in the United States; [...] "I thought it was the best album we did since Piece of Mind. I loved it because it was more progressive—I thought the keyboards really fitted in brilliantly—'cause that's the influences I grew up with, and I was so pissed off with the Americans, because they didn't really seem to accept it. Everyone said afterwards that it was a European-sounding album. I'm not so <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> What's a European-sounding album? To me, it's just a Maiden-sounding album." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Water Babies, a {{fairy tale}} for a land baby by Charles Kingsley (serialised in Macmillan's Magazine 1862–63, {{published}} in book form, with additions, in 1863). Kingsley had been among first to give a favourable review to Darwin's On the Origin of Species, having [...] "long since... learnt to disbelieve the dogma of the permanence of species", and the story includes a satire on the reaction to Darwin's theory, with the main scientific participants appearing, including Richard Owen and Huxley. In 1892 Thomas Henry Huxley's five-year-old grandson Julian saw the illustration by Edward Linley Sambourne (right) and wrote his grandfather a letter asking: Dear Grandpater– Have you seen a Waterbaby? Did {{you put it in}} a bottle? Did it wonder if it could get out? Could I see it some day?– Your loving Julian. Huxley wrote back: My dear Julian– I could never make <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Water Baby... My friend who wrote the story of the Water Baby was a very kind man and very clever. Perhaps he thought I could see as much in the water as he did– There are some people who see a great deal and some who see very little in the same things.When you grow up I dare say you {{will be one of the}} great-deal seers, and see things more wonderful than the Water Babies where other folks can see nothing.|$|E

40|$|Many {{cities around}} the world are facing the {{challenges}} of sustainable living and development and are exploring ways to enhance their ability to manage an uncertain future.

There is no clear cut, ‘best’ solution for the avoidance of catastrophic flood events or even how to ‘live with (all) floods’.

50|$|The authors noticed sex {{divisions}} {{were different}} in observed countries except in nursing and teaching. Pharmacology and dentistry in France and Sweden became feminine fields of work. In the USA, {{it was in}} finance, insurance and real estates (44% of women in UK work in this field) (p. 76). These conditions resulted from local conditions and traditions. One thing the authors were <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> was <b>that</b> the choice made by women was “strongly influenced by the role they hope to play in family” (p. 77). In the future women will constitute {{a good portion of}} the labor market and it will permit women to soon do “more heart-searching when choosing a career” (p. 156) and obviously it is still important that they continue to fight for equality of rights between men and women.|$|R

40|$|It is a clouded {{crystal ball}} into which we peer {{to see the}} future of our {{universities}} and colleges, cloudy because of the uncertainties of the development of the new technologies of information and communication. The only thing we can be <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> is <b>that</b> these developments will have large and cumulative effects on our universities and colleges. This essay attempts to identify some defining characteristics of these technologies and their effects. It explores some of the sources of a continuing growth of demand for higher education in many if not all advanced societies that will accelerate the introduction of ICTs. The future will see a combination of traditional and distance learning rather than the replacement of traditional forms. This perspective is supported by the differential effects of ICTs on the varied functions of higher education...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to adoption, {{the infant}} would often {{be placed in}} {{temporary}} and state-mandated foster care {{for a few weeks}} to several months until the adoption was approved. This would also help ensure that he or she was healthy, that the birthparent was <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> relinquishment, and <b>that</b> nothing was overlooked at the time of birth. Nowadays, this practice is discouraged, as it prevents immediate bonding between the mother and child. Also, much better medical testing is available, both prenatally and postnatally. Many children also developed orphanage-type behavior including head banging, rocking and hand flapping. Many adopted adults still retain this rocking behavior especially when tired.|$|R
50|$|The prepronominal prefixes {{express a}} variety of {{concepts}} and ideas. The first concept we cover is modality, which expresses the degree of urgency, certainty or likelihood of the event. There are three modal prefixes in Onondaga. The modal prefixes only appear with the punctual aspect. They also appear {{if there is a}} modalizer suffix. The first of these is commonly called the future modal prefix (FUT). This prefix expresses events that have not yet taken place at the time the speaker is talking. The second is the factual modal prefix (FACT). This prefix indicates that the speaker knows the event happened for a fact. It typically has a past tense reading (since we are normally only <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> events <b>that</b> happened in the past). The third is optative modal prefix (OPT). This prefix expresses the idea that the event should or ought to take place. It is also used to express untrue events or events that might have taken place but have not. Here are some examples.|$|R

5000|$|White {{has most}} often been criticised for his bullish outlook in defence matters, {{especially}} {{in relation to}} armaments. Writing in the Australian Review, political scientist Graham Cheeseman argued {{the authors of the}} 2000 Defence White Paper was [...] "more about politics than policy, driven in large measure by the desires and vested interests of the major actors within the defence establishment and those, primarily within industry and government, who stand to gain from the $160 billion to be spent on Australia’s defence over the coming decade". He also believed the White Paper was much more aggressive than its preoccupation with peaceful solutions was designed to suggest. This same criticism was taken up by ASPI commentator Peter Jennings. A strategist at the University of New South Wales at the Australian Defence Force Academy, James Goldrick, argued in 2015 that White's bellicosity must be measured against the price of war, stating that [...] "what we have to be <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> is <b>that</b> the end justifies the means".|$|R
40|$|Modeling and {{simulating}} complex {{natural systems}} is a demanding task. With multi-agent simulation a rather new {{modeling and simulation}} method is available {{that is based on}} a set of interacting autonomous agents. However, designing a multi-agent simulation is very effortful due to the increased amount of parameters of the model. Thus a modeler has to be <b>sure</b> <b>about</b> the advantages <b>that</b> he gains from it. This question is addressed based on an example of a bee recruitment model.
