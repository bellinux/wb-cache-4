It hosts three other roads and the <b>service</b> <b>entrance</b> to a large shopping plaza. Boom barriers line the railway crossings. The landscaped central island bisected by the tracks was originally curbed/kerbed, but 18-wheelers had trouble negotiating the roundabout, so the curbs were replaced with painted concrete strips. The roundabout {{was built in the}} early 2000s and improved traffic flow, although long freight trains often cause delays.|$|E
25|$|In plan form, the six-story hotel, {{which was}} opened in 1932 as the first, modern, luxury hotel in Jerusalem, had an I-shape, {{with a long}} central axis {{connecting}} wings {{to the north and}} south. Julian's Way, a main road, ran parallel and close to {{the west side of the}} hotel. An unsurfaced lane, where the French Consulate was situated and from where access to the <b>service</b> <b>entrance</b> of the hotel was gained, ran from there past the north end of the hotel. Gardens and an olive grove, which had been designated as a park, surrounded the other sides.|$|E
25|$|At the {{northern}} end of the transverse corridor were a few more chambers and a passageway to the court surrounding the main pyramid. In addition, there was a stairway to the roof terrace of the temple. The southern end of the transverse corridor similarly led to a few chambers, which in turn led to the main pyramid {{as well as to the}} small courtyard of the cult pyramid. There lay a small portico in the enclosure wall with two inscribed granite columns.

25|$|In {{his early}} years Callaghan was known as Leonard, when he entered {{politics}} in 1945 he decided to be known by his middle name James, {{and from then on}} became known as James or Jim. After his father's death in 1921, his mother was left without an income, and the family was plunged into poverty, forced to rely on charity to survive. Their financial situation was improved in 1924 when the first Labour government was elected, and introduced changes allowing Mrs Callaghan to be granted a pension, on the basis that her husband's death was partly due to war service. He attended Portsmouth Northern Secondary School (now Mayfield School). He gained the Senior Oxford Certificate in 1929, but could not afford entrance to university and instead sat the civil <b>service</b> <b>Entrance</b> Exam.|$|E
25|$|Electrical wiring {{distributes}} {{electric power}} inside residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, boats, and substations at voltages up to 600 V. The {{thickness of the}} wire is based on amperage requirements in conjunction with safe operating temperatures. Solid wire is used for smaller diameters; thicker diameters are stranded to provide flexibility. Conductor types include non-metallic/non-metallic corrosion-resistant cable (two or more insulated conductors with a nonmetallic outer sheath), armored or BX cable (cables are surrounded by a flexible metal enclosure), metal clad cable, <b>service</b> <b>entrance</b> cable, underground feeder cable, TC cable, fire resistant cable, and mineral insulated cable, including mineral-insulated copper-clad cable. Copper is commonly used for building wire because of its conductivity, strength, and reliability. Over {{the life of a}} building wire system, copper can also be the most economical conductor.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} {{takes advantage}} of the sloping site to include a sub-floor dining room which runs the length of the stand beneath the front seating. This is accessed via stairs at the front which lead to a number of sets of entrance doors just below ground level. This dining room has been refurbished, with new entrance doors, new leadlight windows and a false ceiling. Most of the original arched leadlight windows at each end have been sheeted over. Behind the dining room, cut into the slope of the land, is a long kitchen. At the southeast end of the kitchen is a store room and a steep timber stair leading up to the <b>service</b> <b>entrance.</b> There are also toilets at the sub-floor level, accessed externally. The men's toilet is located at the southeast end of the building and the women's at the northwest end.|$|E

25|$|At one point, the Dixmont campus {{contained}} over 80 structures. However, in {{an effort}} to modernize the hospital, many of the unused and obsolete buildings were demolished in 1967. These included the Men's Annex (which housed many of the patients who were trusted with work details in the further reaches of the property), greenhouses, stables, barns, garages, and many cottages. To the left of Reed Hall stood the maintenance building which housed the carpenters', electrical, and machinist shops, as well as a basketball and shuffleboard court on the upper level. The four-story Industrial Arts building (sometimes referred to as the Garment Building) was built in 1933 and allowed patients to manufacture textiles, shoes, and furniture. Behind the Hutchinson building was the Rosenzweig House, an old white house that originally was home to the hospital's superintendents, but was later used as the security office. Near the <b>service</b> <b>entrance</b> on Ohio River Boulevard was the boiler building, reservoir/water treatment building, coal storage building, laundry building, and the iconic smoke stack. A sewage treatment plant was located adjacent to Tom's Run and still remains today.|$|E

The addition has a twelve-story atrium and melds {{historical and contemporary}} design with art deco references such as setbacks, central tower, symmetrical projecting wings, pyramidal roof and abstract cascade and scallop lobby design. Between the original and new buildings, where there was formerly a street, a wide street-level walkway connects the plaza on LaSalle Street to Van Buren Street in what would ordinarily be the building's first floor. Passing over the Van Buren Street elevated tracks, a green glass-enclosed steel-frame bridge connects the lower southwest corner of the 23story addition to the Chicago Board Options Exchange (although this bridge was closed to pedestrian traffic {{in the wake of}} the September 11, 2001 attacks for security reasons).|$|E
2500|$|A {{few weeks}} after the Chateau Madrid ambush, Arnold Rothstein was found fatally wounded near a <b>service</b> <b>entrance</b> to the Park Central Hotel.

Supporting this {{is the fact that the}} first person McManus called after killing Rothstein was Schultz's attorney, Dixie Davis. After the call to Davis, Bo Weinberg picked up McManus and drove him away from the murder scene. McManus was later cleared of the killing.|$|E

On {{either side of the}} central doorway are <b>service</b> <b>entrances,</b> still retaining their original two-over-two windows, which have been painted over. The mansard roof, unique among known extant buildings by John F. Jackson, was, according to Kate Reggev, most likely chosen for its ability to function as a roof as well as provide ample ceiling heights and dormer windows on the top floor and to distinguish the building from its neo-Classically detailed, metal-corniced residential neighbors.|$|R

The cans were to be placed by the main columns supporting the wing where the majority of the offices used by the British authorities were located. [...] The columns were in a basement nightclub known as the Régence. [...] In the final review of the plan, it was decided that the attack would take place on July 22 at 11:00, a time when there would be no people in the coffee shop in the basement in the area where the bomb was to be planted. It would be possible to enter the hotel more easily at that time as well.|$|E

2500|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide three electrical {{connections to the}} supply conductors. These are termed neutral, line and earth. [...] Both neutral and line carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually at or very near to earth potential, being earthed either at the substation or at the <b>service</b> <b>entrance</b> (neutral-to-earth bonding is not permitted in the distribution board/consumer unit). Line (commonly, but technically incorrectly, called live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral. The [...] protective earth connection allows the exposed metal parts of the appliance {{to be connected to}} earth, providing protection to the user should those exposed parts inadvertently come into contact with any live parts within the appliance. [...] Historically, two-pin sockets without earth were used in Britain, but their use is now restricted to sockets specifically designated for shavers and toothbrushes.|$|E

2500|$|Bethell {{says that}} all of the British {{witnesses}} who were {{in the vicinity of the}} hotel at the time of the explosion confirmed what Shaw said. None of them had any knowledge of a warning having been sent in time to make evacuation of the hotel possible. They said that, like themselves, Shaw had not known about the bomb beforehand and that he bore no responsibility for putting colleagues' lives at risk immediately before the explosion. The only criticism made was that Shaw should have closed the Régence restaurant and put guards on the <b>service</b> <b>entrance</b> weeks before. Shaw agreed that not having done this was a mistake. The decision not to do it had been made because [...] "everyone was under orders to preserve the semblance of normality in Palestine", [...] "social life had to be allowed to continue" [...] and because nobody had believed that the Irgun would put the whole of the Secretariat, which had many Jewish employees, in danger.|$|E
2500|$|Natural gas {{dispensed}} in {{a residential}} setting can generate temperatures in excess of 1100°C (2000°F) making it a powerful domestic cooking and heating fuel. In much of the developed world it is supplied through pipes to homes, where it is used for many purposes including ranges and ovens, gas-heated clothes dryers, heating/cooling, and central heating. Heaters in homes and other buildings may include boilers, furnaces, and water heaters. Both North America and Europe are major consumers of natural gas. Boilers use low pressure, usually 6 to 7 inches of water (6" [...] to 7" [...] WC), which is about 0.25 psig. The pressures in the supply lines under the streets vary, either utilization pressure (UP, the aforementioned 6" [...] to 7" [...] WC) or elevated pressure (EP), which may be anywhere from 1 psig to 120 psig. Systems using EP have a regulator at the <b>service</b> <b>entrance</b> to step down the pressure to UP.|$|E
2500|$|Born into {{an aristocratic}} family, of Han ethnicity, {{originally}} from Qixian (present-day Qi County in Shanxi province), Wang Wei's father moved {{east of the}} Yellow River to Puzhou, part of the historic Hedong Commandery (today's Yongji, Shanxi). Known for his youthful precocity, Wang Wei, the eldest of five brothers, set off for the imperial capital {{at the age of}} nineteen, in order to study and take the jinshi civil <b>service</b> <b>entrance</b> examination. In the period while residing in Chang'an, before taking the test, Wang's proficiency at poetry and his musical proficiency with the pipa helped him to achieve popularity at the royal court. He passed the jinshi examination, in 721, with the first class award (Zhuangyuan), which started his potentially lucrative civil service career. Wang Wei's career as an official had its ups and downs. His first appointment was as a court musician, or [...] "Deputy Master of Music"; however, he was then demoted to a position of being in charge of a granary in the former province of Jizhou (now the name of a different town Jizhou, in Hebei). The reason for this demotion, according to tradition, was Wang's breach of etiquette by performing a lion dance. In any case, this was only a minor setback to his career, and it had a compensation in that it did allow him to travel. Then, a series of promotions following this demotion was apparently attributable to a relationship with the prominent governmental minister, poet, and literary scholar Zhang Jiuling, at least until Zhang's 727 demotion to a post in Jingzhou. By 728, Wang Wei was back in Chang'an, where he entertained the poet Meng Haoran, who was to become a close friend and poetic colleague. At this point, Wang seems to have achieved the rank of Assistant Censor, and then a subsequent governmental promotion, but then later being demoted back to Assistant Censor, with the loss in imperial favor of Zhang Jiuling and the rising political ascendency of Li Linfu. After his wife's death in 731, he never remarried. It was in his role as a government official that Wang Wei was dispatched to Liangzhou, which was then the northwestern frontier of the Chinese empire, and the scene of constant military conflicts. By invitation of the local commander, Wang served in this location until returning to Chang'an in 738 or early 739.|$|E

The next two floor levels are clad with smooth limestone and contain long horizontal bands of windows. At the fourth floor level, the elevation changes character. The southern half, the 16-story tower, consists of a projecting glass and steel curtain wall that appears to be supported by projecting metal brackets. The curtain wall is divided horizontally by the same projecting fins at the floor plates and intermediate window mullions. The curtain wall is divided vertically by a central recessed channel. A bracketed vertical metal fin, rising from the 4th through the 15th floors, accentuates this channel. The 16th-floor level is set back from the plane of the elevation, creating another open-air rooftop terrace covered by an open canopy which is an extension of the building's vaulted metal roof.|$|R
