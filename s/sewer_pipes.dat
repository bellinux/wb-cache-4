5|$|On September15, {{the eye of}} Choi-wan passed within 10km (5mi) of Alamagan {{and brought}} winds of up to 230km/h (145mph) to the island. The most recent storm of Choi-wan's {{intensity}} to strike the islands was Typhoon Chaba in 2004. That storm caused severe damage and widespread flooding. Unlike Chaba, relatively little rainfall fell due to Choi-wan, and no flooding was reported. The main effects from the typhoon in Saipan were downed trees which littered streets across the islands. Power lines were downed and <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes</b> were broken; however, crews began repairing damage once Choi-wan passed. In Garapan, the major shelter on the island sustained minor damage and repair work on it would take roughly a week.|$|E

40|$|The {{essential}} work of sewer rehabilitation is a sewer inspection through {{diagnoses of}} <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects. At present, image processing and artificial intelligence techniques {{have been used}} to develop diagnostic systems to assist engineers in interpreting <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects on CCTV images to overcome human's fatigue and subjectivity, and time-consumption. Based on the segmented morphologies on images, the diagnostic systems were proposed to diagnose <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects. However, the environmental influence and image noise hamper the efficiency of automatic diagnosis. For example, the central area of a CCTV image, where is always darker than the surrounding due to the vanishing light and slight reflectance, causes a difficulty to segment correct morphologies. In this paper, a novel approach of morphological segmentation based on edge detection (MSED) is presented and applied to identify the morphology representatives for the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects on CCTV images. Compared with the performances of the opening top-hat operation, which is a popular morphological segmentation approach, MSED can generate better segmentation results. As long as the proper morphologies of <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects on CCTV images can be segmented, the morphological features, including area, ratio of major axis length to minor axis length, and eccentricity, can be measured to effectively diagnose <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> defects...|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{stormwater}} enters properties: backup through <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes,</b> toilets and sinks into buildings; seepage through building walls and floors; the accumulation of water on property and in public rights-of-way; and the overflow of water from water bodies such as rivers and lakes.

40|$|Piping erosion {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of failure of flood defences. The {{occurrence}} of this failure mechanism is difficult to predict and it can be triggered during a flood event. The inclusion of hard structures under flood defences will change the probability of occurrence of this erosion process. The present study aimed at understanding the effect of an embedded <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> under the flood defence foundation in its safety assessment for piping erosion failure. This was done by setting a probabilistic analysis framework based on emulation of finite element models of porous media flow and the fictitious permeability approach. The effects of size and location of the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> were evaluated via a deterministic safety factor approach. Afterwards, emulators of the most safe and unsafe models were trained and used for probabilistic assessments. The results showed that the embedment of a <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> in the flood defence foundation has a significant effect on its safety. The magnitude of the effect is highly dependent on the size and location of the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe.</b> Furthermore, the foundation permeability uncertainty shows a conditional effect with respect to the <b>sewer</b> <b>pipe</b> size and location...|$|R
25|$|Urban {{flooding}} is the inundation of land {{or property}} in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas, caused by rainfall overwhelming {{the capacity of}} drainage systems, such as storm sewers. Although sometimes triggered by events such as flash flooding or snowmelt, urban flooding is a condition, characterized by its repetitive and systemic impacts on communities, that can happen {{regardless of whether or}} not affected communities are located within designated floodplains or near any body of water. Aside from potential overflow of rivers and lakes, snowmelt, stormwater or water released from damaged water mains may accumulate on property and in public rights-of-way, seep through building walls and floors, or backup into buildings through <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes,</b> toilets and sinks.|$|E
25|$|On the Lac du Bourget, {{with several}} {{thousand}} people in addition {{to tens of thousands}} of tourists, the water quality had gradually deteriorated from the 1950s to 1970 in a major phenomenon of eutrophication, since the lake at the time was the natural outlet of all <b>sewer</b> <b>pipes,</b> with in particular, Chambéry and Aix-les-Bains. Many motor vehicles of the time were also highly polluting, spitting their fumes which partially dissolved in the waters and spilt oil which was also found in the lake.

A remediation action has been engaged since the mid-1970s, in order to reduce the eutrophication of the lake, the aim being to arrive at the same results as for Lake Annecy.|$|E

The southern side contains the Albert Embankment, from the Lambeth end of Westminster Bridge to Vauxhall.

The Embankment project was seen as being nationally important and, with the Queen unable to attend because of illness, the Victoria Embankment was opened by the Prince of Wales in July 1870.
