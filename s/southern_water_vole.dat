50|$|The southwestern {{water vole}} or <b>southern</b> <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> (Arvicola sapidus) is a large amphibious vole found in most of France and south-westwards through Spain and Portugal. Although {{historically}} {{considered to be a}} member of the same species as the Eurasian water vole, Musser and Carleton (2005) considered it distinct enough to warrant full species status. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as vulnerable. It is threatened for many of the same reasons as the northern water vole, and a campaign is currently underway to seek protection for the species, both at a national level and at European Union level.|$|E

40|$|Investigating the {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} species is critical for understanding the evolution of biodiversity and for its conservation. Towards this goal, molecular approaches are becoming increasingly powerful with the incorporation of recent theoretical and analytical advances. Here, we apply an isolation-with-migration coalescent-based model to control region and cytochrome b mitochondrial sequences to investigate {{the evolutionary}} history of European (Arvicola terrestris) and <b>Southern</b> (Arvicola sapidus) <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> throughout Eurasia. We date {{the time of the}} split of the common ancestor of European and <b>Southern</b> <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> around the fourth Mindel glacial (c. 252 000 BP), a date similar to that estimated by classical phylogenetic methods (c. 241 000 BP). Although postglacial expansions brought these species into secondary contact in Iberia and France, our results do not contain evidence of subsequent mitochondrial gene ﬂow between descendant groups or current hybridization. We also estimate the effective population sizes of A. sapidus and Arvicola terrestris scherman on c. 199 000 and 52 000 individuals, respectively. This study illustrates the utility of modern coalescent-based genetic tools to investigate recent species and population divergences and sheds some light on the evolution of the genus Arvicola in EurasiaPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the habitat}} {{use by the}} {{threatened}} Cabrera vole, Microtus cabrerae, was assessed in an agricultural landscape of SW Portugal,in order to evaluate agricultural management practices that might favour its populations. Despite the patchy distribution and the sensitivity in relation to human management, average colony size was 1928 m 2, and mean nearest neighbour distance was 363 m. Within the selected habitats, the Cabrera vole’s activity was concentrated in sites with dense and tall herbs, though appearing to avoid areas where <b>southern</b> <b>water</b> <b>voles,</b> Arvicola sapidus, were present. Activity of Cabrera voles was higher during the winter, confirming the adverse effect of the dry periods for this species. Conservation of the Cabrera vole in agricultural landscapes would require {{the maintenance of a}} network of tall and dense herbaceous patches, which could possibly be established along field margins, road verges, and ditches, and supported by agri-environment subsidy schemes...|$|R
50|$|The trust {{carried out}} {{the first and second}} {{national}} <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> surveys in 1989-1990 and 1996-98. These surveys identified the crash in the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> population in Britain. Following the publication of the first survey, the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> was given a degree of legal protection in 1998 under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act. In 2008, a greater level of protection was given in England and Wales. The long-term decline of the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> resulted from a loss of habitat and changes in farming practices, but the acceleration in the rate of this decline in the 1980s was down to increasing predation by feral American mink. The status of the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> is now monitored annually by the PTES through the National <b>Water</b> <b>Vole</b> Monitoring programme and is based on those sites originally surveyed by the trust.|$|R
40|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> (Arvicola sapidus Miller, 1908) is an {{endangered}} rodent whose conservation guidelines should preserve the current genetic variability. We analyze {{the structure and}} organization of the mitochondrial control region (CR) in A. sapidus. The CR of this species {{is characterized by a}} low guanine-cytosine content, the absence of any repetitive motif within the two hypervariable regions, and the presence of the two extended termination-associated sequences and conserved sequence blocks. Nucleotide diversity comparisons between A. sapidus and the European water vole (Arvicola terrestris) revealed differences in the distribution of genetic variation. Furthermore, we provide primers for the amplification of short and highly polymorphic fragments of CR and cytochrome b especially designed for degraded materials. These markers offer molecular tools to assist in the establishment of future conservation and management guidelines, and will also facilitate studies at different spatial and evolutionary scales of this species.

40|$|Habitat specialists inhabiting {{scarce and}} {{scattered}} habitat patches pose interesting {{questions related to}} dispersal such as how specialized terrestrial mammals do to colonize distant patches crossing hostile matrices. We assess dispersal patterns of the <b>southern</b> <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> (Arvicola sapidus), a habitat specialist whose habitat patches are distributed through less than 2 % {{of the study area}} (overall 600 km 2) and whose populations form a dynamic metapopulational network. We predict that individuals will require a high ability to move through the inhospitable matrix in order to avoid genetic and demographic isolations. Genotypes (N = 142) for 10 microsatellites and sequences of the whole mitochondrial Control Region (N = 47) from seven localities revealed a weak but significant genetic structure partially explained by geographic distance. None of the landscape models had a significant effect on genetic structure over that of the Euclidean distance alone and no evidence for efficient barriers to dispersal was found. Contemporary gene flow was not severely limited for A. sapidus as shown by high migration rates estimates (. 10 %) between non-neighbouring areas. Sex-biased dispersal tests did not support differences in dispersal rates, as shown by similar average axial parent-offspring distances, in close agreement with capture-mark-recapture estimates. As predicted, our results do not support any preferences of the species for specific landscape attributes on their dispersal pathways. Here, we combine field and molecular data to illustrate how a habitat specialist mammal might disperse like a habitat generalist, acquiring specific long-distance dispersal strategies as a...|$|E
40|$|Failure {{to detect}} a species at sites where it is present (i. e. {{imperfect}} detection) is known to occur frequently, but this is often disregarded in monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. Here we modelled {{for the first time}} the probability of patch occupancy by a threatened small mammal, the <b>southern</b> <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> (Arvicola sapidus, while accounting for the probability of detection given occupancy. Based on replicated presence sign surveys conducted in autumn (November–December 2013) and winter (February–March 2014) in a farmland landscape, we used occupancy detection modelling to test the effects of vegetation, sampling effort, observer experience, and rainfall on detection probability. We then assessed whether occupancy was related to patch size, isolation, vegetation, or presence of water, after correcting for imperfect detection. The mean detection probabilities of water vole signs in autumn (0. 71) and winter (0. 81) indicated that false absences may be generated in about 20 – 30 % of occupied patches surveyed by a single observer on a single occasion. There was no statistical support for the effects of covariates on detectability. After controlling for imperfect detection, the mean probabilities of occupancy in autumn (0. 31) and winter (0. 29) were positively related to patch size and presence of water, and negatively so, albeit weakly, to patch isolation. Overall, our study underlined the importance of accounting for imperfect detection in sign surveys of small mammals such as water voles, pointing out the need to use occupancy detection modelling together with replicate surveys for accurately estimating occupancy and the factors affecting it...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} patchy populations {{to persist in}} human-dominated landscapes is often {{assessed}} using focal patch approaches, in which the local occurrence or abundance of a species {{is related to the}} properties of individual patches and the surrounding landscape context. However, useful additional insights could probably be gained through broader, mosaic level approaches, whereby whole land mosaics with contrasting patch-network and matrix characteristics are the units of investigation. In this study we addressed this issue, analysing how the <b>southern</b> <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> (Arvicola sapidus) responds to variables describing patch-network and matrix properties within replicated Mediterranean farmland mosaics, across a gradient of agricultural intensification. Patch-network characteristics had a dominant effect, with the total amount of habitat positively influencing both the occurrence of water voles and the proportion of area occupied in land mosaics. The proportions of patches and area occupied by the species were positively influenced by mean patch size, and negatively so by patch isolation. Matrix effects were weak, although there was a tendency for a higher proportion of occupied patches in more intensive, irrigated agricultural landscapes, particularly during the dry season. In terms of conservation, results suggest that water voles may be able to cope well with, or even be favoured by, the on-going expansion of irrigated agriculture in Mediterranean dry-lands, provided that a number of patches of wet herbaceous vegetation are maintained within the farmland mosaic. Overall, our study suggests that the mosaic-level approach may provide a useful framework to understand the responses of patchy populations to land use change...|$|E
40|$|Roads {{are widely}} {{recognized}} {{to represent a}} barrier to individual movements and, conversely, verges can act as potential corridors for the dispersal of many small mammals. Both barrier and corridor effects should generate a clear spatial pattern in genetic structure. Nevertheless, the effect of roads on the genetic structure of small mammal populations still remains unclear. In this study, we examine the barrier effect that different road types (4 -lane highway, 2 -lane roads and single-lane unpaved roads) may have on the population genetic structure of three species differing in relevant life history traits: <b>southern</b> <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> Arvicola sapidus, the Mediterranean pine vole Microtus duodecimcostatus and the Algerian mouse Mus spretus. We also examine the corridor effect of highway verges on the Mediterranean pine vole and the Algerian mouse. We analysed the population structure through pairwise estimates of FST among subpopulations bisected by roads, identified genetic clusters through Bayesian assignment approaches, and used simple and partial Mantel tests to evaluate the relative barrier or corridor effect of roads. No strong evidences were found for an effect of roads on population structure of these three species. The barrier effect of roads seems to be site-specific and no corridor effect of verges was found for the pine vole and Algerian mouse populations. The lack of consistent results among species and for each road type lead {{us to believe that}} the ability of individual dispersers to use those crossing structures or the habitat quality in the highway verges may have a relatively higher influence on gene flow among populations than the presence of crossing structures per se. Further research should include microhabitat analysis and the estimates of species abundance to understand the mechanisms that underlie the genetic structure observed at some sitesPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|In the U. K. {{the impact}} of {{introduced}} American mink Mustela vison, on <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> Arvicola terrestris, may be exacerbated by habitat loss and fragmentation. Pristine wetlands in Belarus, which American mink invaded in the early 1990 s, provide a three-pronged opportunity to test this hypothesis. First, we examine the evidence that, even in the unmanaged wetlands of our Belarussian study site, American mink have reduced <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> populations. Second, we ask whether habitat size, type and isolation mitigate {{the impact of}} American mink predation. Thirdly, we explore whether <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> {{are at greater risk}} of predation from American than European mink because of their patterns of habitat use. Following the invasion of American mink, <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> were most abundant in small, still-water sites, far from river banks, while American mink were most active in large, running-water sites. Small mammal remains were found in a higher percentage of American than European mink scats, and of these, more were <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> in American mink scats. The occurrence of <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> in scats of both mink species declined after the American mink invaded and established. Our results provide at least circumstantial evidence that American mink limit <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> populations even in unmanaged wetland eco-systems, and that they have a greater impact than their European congener at least partly because they make greater use of isolated marshes, Although by no means providing complete protection, the configuration and dispersion of available habitat mitigated the impact of American mink on <b>water</b> <b>voles.</b> This raises the possibility that habitat restoration, especially through the establishment of isolated enclaves, could help reduce the effect of American mink in the U. K. These observations are of broader interest in the context of assessing the effect of multiple pressures on vulnerable species...|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} several studies done on the habitat of the vole, given its very {{specific}} requirements, {{to find out if}} grazing or precipitation levels affect the vole populations so that we can protect them. It has been found that higher precipitation levels create increased availability of usable habitat for <b>water</b> <b>voles.</b> In years of that are wetter than usual it has been observed that young <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> become reproductively active sooner, and therefore can have more offspring. The mean number of pups in each litter increased as well. It has also been found that grazing affects the <b>water</b> <b>vole</b> populations as well. In areas of light or moderate grazing not as many young survived, and the population sizes tended to be much smaller than other colonies. Where there was severe grazing it affected the stream bank to an extent that it was no longer a suitable habitat. The presence of livestock presents numerous detrimental changes to the <b>water</b> <b>vole’s</b> habitat: altered abiotic characteristics, compacted soil, increased runoff, fractured stream banks, erosion, as well as loss of vegetation as protective cover and a food source. The abundance of ferns, mosses and shrubs are imperative as ground cover to protect <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> from predation, and in areas of grazing these plants were scarce or non-existent, and therefore <b>water</b> <b>voles</b> weren't often found in these areas.|$|R
