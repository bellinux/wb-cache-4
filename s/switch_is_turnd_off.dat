40|$|Abstract: We study linearised massive gravity on the de Sitter background. With a smallenough {{graviton}} mass {{this may}} have had relevance to inflation, or the present-day cosmic acceleration. Higuchi has shown that this theory has a ghost {{as long as the}} dS curvature exceeds the graviton mass, 2 H 2 > m 2; this would entail rapid instabilities. In this work we extend the model and observe that the helicity- 0 mode which is a ghost, can <b>be</b> <b>turnd</b> into a positive energy state via kinetic mixing with the conformal mode. The latter gets restricted here by the requirement that the Bianchi identities be satisfied. This eliminates the ghost from the linearized theory. However, the spectrum still contains scalar tachyonic instabilities with the time scale ∼ 1 /H. This would have been problematic for the early univesre, however, may be acceptable for the present-day accelerated expansion as the tachyon instability woul...|$|R
50|$|The term cold {{switching}} {{indicates that}} a <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> activated with no signal applied. Therefore, no current will flow when the <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> closed, and no current will be interrupted when the <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> opened. In contrast, in hot <b>switching,</b> voltage <b>is</b> present and current will flow immediately once the contacts close.
