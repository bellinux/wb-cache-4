40|$|Purpose: This {{document}} is intended solely {{as a quick}} reference guide for use by public health and environmental officials in evaluating data collected from structures in which mercury pressure regulating devices for natural gas meters were moved from inside to outside the structures {{as part of a}} modernization process. It does not provide detailed justifications for environmental sampling requirements, as health consultations or environmental sampling plans may do. In the past, ATSDR has been reluctant to provide a list of <b>suggested</b> <b>action</b> levels such as this because of the site specific nature of exposures. ATSDR has recognized that action levels can differ according to differing populations, exposure durations, concentrations, and specific hazards. However, the immediacy and extent of the potential health risk associated with mercury contamination in the present situation require publication of this guide. Many parts of the country may be affected by the possible exposure to mercury resulting from re-positioning of mercury-containing gas pressure regulators and the subsequent response efforts of gas utilities, public health and environmental officials. Moreover, the involvement of multiple health and environmental jurisdictions creates a need for consistency in presenting health risk information. Therefore, ATSDR, at the request of a state health department and an U. S. EPA regional office, is attempting to provide <b>suggested</b> <b>action</b> levels for various response activities under different exposure scenarios. Background: In this context, an action level is an indoor air concentration of mercury vapor, which should prompt consideration of the need to implement a recommended response by public health and environmental officials. The various <b>suggested</b> <b>action</b> levels provided in this document are intended as recommendations, not as regulatory values or cleanup values, although some may correspond to present or future values adopted by regulatory authorities. The <b>suggested</b> <b>action</b> levels presented in this document recognize that an individual must be exposed to a sufficient concentration over some specific period of time in order for mercury vapor to cause adverse health effects. The <b>suggested</b> <b>action</b> levels also recognize that while individual susceptibility may vary, developing fetuse...|$|E

The Multi Agent Planning System (MAPS) assesses the player's situation by looking at its local vision and then decides upon an appropriate course of action. While MAPS is able to react to change, it is more a strategy-based intelligence, which is not always the best solution when reacting to a real time environment. The aim of this thesis is to take the <b>suggested</b> <b>action</b> and either implement the <b>suggested</b> <b>action</b> or react to its own local vision by implementing a different course of action. This is necessary as the game is played in a real-time dynamic environment...|$|E

40|$|Objective Comparison of {{provider}} {{performance is}} commonly used to inform health care decision-making. Little {{attention has been paid}} to how data presentations influence decisions. This study analyzes differences in <b>suggested</b> <b>actions</b> by decision-makers informed by league tables or funnel plots. Design Decision-makers were invited to a survey and randomized to compare hospital performance using either league tables or funnel plots for four different measures within the area of cancer care. For each measure, decision-makers were asked to <b>suggest</b> <b>actions</b> towards 12 – 16 hospitals (no action, ask for more information, intervene) and provide feedback related to whether the information provided had been useful. Setting Swedish health care. Participants Two hundred and twenty-one decision-makers at administrative and clinical levels. Intervention Data presentations in the form of league tables or funnel plots. Main outcome measures Number of <b>actions</b> <b>suggested</b> by participants. Proportion of appropriate actions. Results For all four measures, decision-makers tended to <b>suggest</b> more <b>actions</b> based on the information provided in league tables compared to funnel plots (44 % vs. 21 %, P < 0. 001). Actions were on average more appropriate for funnel plots. However, when using funnel plots, decision-makers more often missed to react even when appropriate. Conclusions The form of data presentation had an influence on decision-making. With league tables, decision-makers tended to <b>suggest</b> more <b>actions</b> compared to funnel plots. A difference in sensitivity and specificity conditioned by the form of presentation could also be identified, with different implications depending on the purpose of comparisons.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy {{technology}} {{continues to}} advance and {{the expectation of}} improved outcomes requires greater accuracy in various radiotherapy steps. Different factors affect the overall accuracy of dose delivery. Institutional comprehensive quality assurance (QA) programs should ensure that uncertainties are maintained at acceptable levels. The International Atomic Energy Agency has recently developed a report summarizing the accuracy achievable and the <b>suggested</b> <b>action</b> levels, for each step in the radiotherapy process. Overview of the report: The report seeks to promote awareness and encourage quantification of uncertainties {{in order to promote}} safer and more effective patient treatments. The radiotherapy process and the radiobiological and clinical frameworks that define the need for accuracy are depicted. Factors that influence uncertainty are described for a range of techniques, technologies and systems. Methodologies for determining and combining uncertainties are presented, and strategies for reducing uncertainties through QA programs are suggested. The role of quality audits in providing international benchmarking of achievable accuracy and realistic action levels is also discussed. RECOMMENDATIONS: The report concludes with nine general recommendations: (1)  Radiotherapy should be applied as accurately as reasonably achievable, technical and biological factors being taken into account. (2)  For consistency in prescribing, reporting and recording, recommendations of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements should be implemented. (3)  Each institution should determine uncertainties for their treatment procedures. Sample data are tabulated for typical clinical scenarios with estimates of the levels of accuracy that are practically achievable and <b>suggested</b> <b>action</b> levels. (4)  Independent dosimetry audits should be performed regularly. (5)  Comprehensive quality assurance programs should be in place. (6)  Professional staff should be appropriately educated and adequate staffing levels should be maintained. (7)  For reporting purposes, uncertainties should be presented. (8)  Manufacturers should provide training on all equipment. (9)  Research should aid in improving the accuracy of radiotherapy. Some example research projects are suggested...|$|E
