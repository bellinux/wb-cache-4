5|$|Zahir's rule radically {{changed the}} {{landscape}} of Galilee. With the restoration and re-fortification of Acre {{and the establishment of}} the <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> city of Haifa, Galilee significantly strengthened its ties with the Mediterranean world. Following Zahir's death, his successor Jazzar Pasha maintained the cotton monopoly Zahir had established and Galilee's economy remained almost completely dependent on the cotton trade. The region prospered for decades, but with the rise of the cotton market in the southern United States during the early-mid 19th century, European demand shifted away from Palestine's cotton and because of its dependency on the crop, the region experienced a sharp economic downturn from which it could not recover. The cotton crop was largely abandoned, as were many villages, and the peasantry shifted its focus to subsistence agriculture.|$|E

2500|$|Carburetion {{had five}} {{separate}} circuits. Suzuki used peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but {{are known to}} have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage Mikuni carburetor. An 18mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the five throttle cables, providing smooth low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small primary ports. Indirectly involved with carburetion is the unique [...] "port valve". This small butterfly valve pivots in the rotor housing inside the <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> and is directly controlled by another of the throttle cables. Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> would fill with traces of exhaust gasses whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port {{at the end of the}} exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with exhaust gasses causing a momentary misfire and felt as a dead spot or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from exhaust gasses. Carburetor tuning involves adjusting cables controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, illustrated by Suzuki Service Bulletin Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.|$|E

40|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} ports handle French deep-sea cargo: global ports of Northern Range and Marseilles serve {{a great number}} of overseas regions (forelands) and <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> mainly serve niche markets. In this paper we demonstrate that global ports serve also larger hinterlands, but their superiority over <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> depends on the types of cargo handled. The results of a spatial interaction model demonstrate that most of types of cargo flows are strongly distance-constrained. This evidence indicates that, despite a deep transformation on forelands, the <b>secondary</b> <b>ports</b> subsist because they partly depend on niche markets and local economies generating substantial amounts of non-containerised cargo flows. Some implications of this finding are suggested...|$|R

50|$|After the {{construction}} of Galle Fort in the 17th century, Galle Port was a major port in the Indian Ocean for more than 200 years, which was an important anchorage for boats and ships traveling between Europe and Asia.

50|$|Because FTP uses {{a dynamic}} <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> (for data channels), many {{firewalls}} {{were designed to}} snoop FTP protocol control messages {{in order to determine}} which secondary data connections they need to allow.

50|$|The city of Komenda, {{part of the}} Kingdom of Eguafo, {{had become}} a major trade port in the later parts of the 17th century.

The Dutch, in contrast simply saw it as a <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> to support its other operations in the area. In this situation, Cabess moved to Komenda in the 1670s to work with the British attempts to establish trade relationships in the port. The primary African merchant to the British in the port was a trader named Captain Bracon in the 1670s; however, by 1686, Cabess had taken over this position.|$|E

5000|$|Craney Island was one {{of several}} {{strategic}} landmarks in the 7th Transportation Group exercise called [...] "Resolute Shamrock '95." [...] The battalion-sized training event involved about 500 soldiers, collectively, from the group's four battalions. They included the 6th, 10th and 24th Trans. battalions from Fort Eustis, and the 11th Trans Bn. from Fort Story, Virginia, whose 309th Transportation Company is the only active-duty unit in the Army that operates the LARCs, the Army's only amphibious vehicles at that time. About 100 soldiers from the U.S. Army Transportation School at Fort Eustis also participated in the exercise. Resolute Shamrock began 6 March, when the 24th Transportation Battalion was alerted to a simulated crisis situation. Within 24 hours, it had set up a processing center at Fort Eustis, where soldiers received shots and updated wills. About 300 of them underwent DNA testing, the results of which remain in their personnel files for identification purposes. Simultaneously, soldiers from the Causeway Company began reconfiguring one of the causeway piers that had been towed by tugboat from Fort Eustis to Craney Island. Back at Fort Eustis, 24th Transportation Battalion soldiers began moving a token number of their vehicles and equipment to Lambert's Point in Norfolk, Virginia. There other 7th Group soldiers and U.S. Army Transportation School students uploaded the materials, via another causeway pier, onto a fast sealift ship. LCU-2000s (landing craft, utility) and mike boats then transported the vehicles and equipment from the FSS to Craney Island. Later in the exercise, during operations at a <b>secondary</b> <b>port</b> at the Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base at Virginia Beach, the smaller craft came alongside a second LSV to offload cargo.|$|E
