After her first husband was killed in the war, they married on 25 January 1941. The Macleods had a son and a daughter, Torquil and Diana, who were born in 1942 and 1944 respectively. They had a somewhat stormy marriage in which they retained a strong bond despite Macleod conducting a number of what his biographer describes as “romances” with other women (he <b>quotes</b> <b>love</b> letters written by Macleod but does not specifically say they went as far as sexual affairs). As was common for MPs’ wives of the era, Eve looked after constituency matters whilst her husband concentrated on his career at Westminster.|$|R

5000|$|In April 1981, Love's {{chief deputy}} Charles Mitchell Jr. {{reported}} to the school board and the public that after an investigation by a Detroit private investigator; electronic devices {{had been found in}} Love's office and car.

Mitchell said that a Chicago firm did search Love office and car, But they found nothing. Mitchell said he created the story for many reasons, most notably to discourage the possibility of future wiretaps and to test the effectiveness of the Chicago Police Department for Love's safety. Mitchell claimed it was all his idea and that Love knew nothing about the story being false. On April 23, 1981, Love held a news conference announcing Mitchell's resignation and publicly apologized to the school board and mayor Byrne: [...] "I had no knowledge of this discrepancy when it was {{reported to the}} board and public.

He was a quiet, private guy and he led his life that way—with quiet dignity. That dreadful day in January is a day that our platoon will never forget, and many of us are able to celebrate life because of Bill's sacrifice. He will never be forgotten by any of us who served with him." ...|$|R

But the following lines of the poem offer an alternative view, one which Williams re-affirmed throughout his career: [...] "A rose is a rose/ and the poem equals it/ if it be well made." ...|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{the movie}} is {{regarded}} by many as a masterpiece of the New Hollywood era. Roger Ebert considered {{it to be the}} finest film on the Vietnam war and included it on his list for the 2002 Sight & Sound poll for the greatest movie of all time. It is on the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies list at number 28, but it dropped two spots to number 30 on their 10th anniversary list.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Zap2it wrote, [...] "Sure, Blair's (Leighton Meester) {{been dreaming}} of her fairytale wedding {{since she was}} just a little girl. But it's also true that producers of Gossip Girl have been dreaming of this moment for a long time as well. And the Upper East Side drama didn't disappoint. In fact, it was easy the best episode this season." [...] Steve Marsi from TV Fanatic gave the episode a four stars rating out of five writing, [...] "In {{what has come to be}} sort of a make-or-break episode, Gossip Girl had a golden opportunity to redeem its recent mediocrity and prove itself worthy of all the passion and loyalty we've invested over the years. While there were some gaping plot holes and disappointments tonight - especially depending on your couple of choice - you can't find fault with the pure number of twists, especially during the last five minutes." [...] Marsi appreciated the references to Gossip Girls early days, [...] "The promised homages to the old days were there in spades, and incorporated in ways that actually fit the present-day story. Case in point: A memorable Gossip Girl <b>quote</b> ("I <b>love</b> you, always have, always will") which was spoken to a very different character long ago. Also, the cover of [...] "Young Folks" [...] at the onset was fun." [...] The Huffington Posts Laura Prudom also found the episode had honored Gossip Girls past, [...] "For the first time in recent memory, this week's milestone episode of Gossip Girl finally recaptured the confident plotting and razor sharp shocks of its first two seasons." [...] She also praised the fact Georgina is Gossip Girl which was totally unexpected. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "In classic Gossip Girl fashion, the 100th episode was full of witty one-liners, many of them from the mouth of Georgina Sparks and one in honor of The Princess Bride; paid homage to the pilot; and featured several head-turning moments." [...] Ology gave the episode a 9/10 grade.|$|R
5000|$|The commandment to love {{other people}} {{is given in}} the Torah, which states, [...] "Love your {{neighbor}} like yourself" [...] (Leviticus 19:18). The Torah's commandment to love God [...] "with all your heart, with all your soul and with all your might" [...] (Deuteronomy 6:5) is taken by the Mishnah (a central text of the Jewish oral law) to refer to good deeds, willingness to sacrifice one's life rather than commit certain serious transgressions, willingness to sacrifice all of one's possessions, and being grateful to the Lord despite adversity (tractate Berachoth 9:5). Rabbinic literature differs as to how this love can be developed, e.g., by contemplating divine deeds or witnessing the marvels of nature. As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: [...] "See life with the wife you love" [...] (Ecclesiastes 9:9). The biblical book Song of Solomon is considered a romantically phrased metaphor of love between God and his people, but in its plain reading, reads like a love song. The 20th-century Rabbi Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler is frequently <b>quoted</b> as defining <b>love</b> from the Jewish point of view as [...] "giving without expecting to take" [...] (from his Michtav me-Eliyahu, Vol. 1).|$|R
5000|$|Lily is {{left with}} the orphans after Miss Hannigan and Rooster leave, but Lily accidentally tells the secret.

She and the orphans come to Warbucks' mansion where Lily demands her part in the cut while the orphans <b>quote</b> [...] "WE <b>LOVE</b> YOU MISS HANNIGAN" [...] as Miss Hannigan tries to run by Lily. While fleeing from the orphans, Miss Hannigan and Rooster are intercepted upon the arrival of President Franklin D. Roosevelt along with his Secret Service. The President reads the papers that {{identifies}} Miss Hannigan, Rooster, and Lily while also mentioning the aliases of the latter two. Rooster and Lily are both arrested by the Secret Service as Rooster tells Lily that she loused up. Miss Hannigan tries to convince Annie to vouch for her to avoid being arrested, but Annie says she would and states that Miss Hannigan taught her to [...] "never tell a lie".

25|$|Throughout the house, {{there are}} {{numerous}} <b>love</b> <b>quotes</b> written by Oscar Wilde, William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In {{the dining room and}} kitchen, the furniture are in bright red and yellow colors, and logs stacked against each other fill up a wall.

5000|$|After {{the release}} of the Hated in the Nation {{compilation}} cassette by ROIR, as well as a series of letters written by Allin to such magazines as Maximum RockNRoll and Flipside,and advertising campaigns in many music magazines and fanzines like Option, Flipside, RIP, Ben is Dead and many others by Black & Blue Records, Allin's stature in the punk rock underground had grown considerably. However, Allin's uncompromising, and increasingly transgressive performances, and his tendency towards extremely lowbrow lyrics, made him an unlikely prospect not only for major labels, but also for many of the independent labels like SST, Touch and Go, and Alternative Tentacles. Allin had parted with his previous label, Black and Blue Records once he signed with Homestead Records with Yarmouth's blessings.The goal was to get GG on a major label and both GG and Yarmouth felt Homestead was a good first step in getting there versus the small RI based label. Yarmouth is <b>quoted</b> [...] "GG <b>loved</b> to trash any perceived or real authority including his record labels. I recall one show at The Populous Pudding in CT after {{the release of}} his second Homestead release where backstage GG pissed on my leg and yelled proudly that he now had pissed on both his labels. He said he pissed on Cosley's head. GG was that kind of guy. Back in the early days I {{spent a lot of money}} advertising GG in music publications. No label after Black & Blue had to sell an unknown artist." [...] Peter Yarmouth 4-25-2007 ...|$|R
40|$|Ahmed Hilmi {{was born}} (1865) and spent his {{childhood}} in the Ottoman city of Filibe (now Plovdiv in Central Bulgaria). Later {{his family moved to}} Istanbul where he lived most of his “conscious” life. Nevertheless Hilmi has perpetuated his relation to Bulgaria by putting the name of his birth town in front of his own name. In 1901 Ahmed Hilmi was exiled because of his political views by the Sultan Abdulhamid the Second to the town of Fizan (in Libya) where he started dealing with Sufism and entered the Arusi order. In different periods of his life he published the newspapers “Çaylak” (in Egypt), “Coşkun Kalender” (in Bursa) and “Hikmet” (in Istanbul) and about 40 books. He died unexpectedly in 1914 and was buried nearby Fatih Mosque in Istanbul. Ahmed Hilmi is famous for his deep knowledge of both Sufism and western philosophy. The most prominent works of the author are in the fields of religion, philosophy, logic and politics and {{it can be said that}} most of them -at least as titles- sound totally popular even for the contemporary reader. Some of Hilmi’s printed works are: The Islamic World and Europe in the Twentieth Century: A Political Guide for the Muslims (1911); Muslims Listen! (1910); Islam and the Religion of the Future; New Logic; Is It Possible to Deny God (1911, a book dealing with the whole history of philosophy, both eastern and western, trying to analyze them; Islamic Mysticism; The Science of Monotheism; The Materialist Delusions in the Presence of Science (1914); Three Philosophers; Sheikh Bedreddin; The Bektashis; History of Islam: (refutation of Dozy’s Islamic History); Finally (but not last) in this list is the collection of Sufi stories called “The Depths of Fantasy”. The stories in “The Depths of Fantasy” are not only conceptually connected but at the same time they follow a common composition which starts when the main character Raji after a series of long wanderings and spirituals tortures aroused by the problems of the existence and non-existence, finds himself in a cemetery where he comes upon the second main character Aynali Baba (“Mirror-Father”) : an old man who has decorated his hat with pieces of broken mirrors. During the first conversation Ayanli Baba prepares a coffee. This drink helps Raji get rid of everyday life’s burden and arranges his senses for a first contact with the metaphysical world, which takes part in the second story titled “The Hill of Naught”. When the coffee drinking finishes and the old man starts playing his flute (nay) and <b>quotes</b> some <b>love</b> poems, Raji falls asleep and dives into the depths of fantasy. From this point on, for a period of nine days the coffee and the sounds of the flute constantly accompany Raji’s next submergences into the world of fantasies: each described in a separate story. In all these stories the main character finds himself in a different place, is transformed into something new and meets a number of well-known or unfamiliar people: prophets, scholars, wise men etc. In “The Naught Hill” he lands in India where he meets Buddha; in “Feast for the Eyes” in the role of an Iranian gets together with Zoroaster and participates indirectly as a spectator and directly as a fighter in a 40 -day long battle between Ahriman’s light and Ormuzd’s darkness in which prevails the goddess of love Isida; In “Eternal Cycle” he goes through states in which for periods lasting millions of years he embodies millions of organisms. In the next story called “The Meeting of the Wise” Raji is already “His Majesty the Yellow Devil”; in “The Arena of Mightiness” he visits the planets Mars and Jupiter. Here the author uses completely scientific terminology from the field of astronomy as “double stars” and “solar eruptions”; in “Kaf and Anka” the main character is an Indian prince; in “Eternal Mystery” he is a Chinese sacrificing his soul’s immortality in order to learn the answer of the eternal mystery; in the story by the title “The Gathering of the Mighty” the main character attends a gathering at which are present: Abraham, Moses, Adam, Confucius, Plato, Aristotle, Zoroaster, Brahma, Jesus, Lokman, Khidr, Buddha and Mohammed who try answering the question that always has moved mankind: What is happiness? But after all these transformations Raji wakes up and returns to his own essence. Actually he is an excellent example of a substantial movement: his external forms are constantly changing but Raji’s essence remains the same. Two of Ahmed Hilmi’s most interesting stories are found in the second part of the book titled “The Lunatic Asylum in Manisa”. Here the author who has combined successfully a fascinating composition and a Sufi concentrate proves to be a real connoisseur of the Sufi knowledge. The two stories called “Mejnun with Leyla” and “Mejnuns without Leylas” are based on the following mystery: Does the Arabic letter “Alif” come from the full stop or vice versa (	an equivalent of the well-known problem of the egg and the hen). ...|$|R
