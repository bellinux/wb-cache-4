40|$|The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) {{is one of}} a new {{generation}} of detectors of gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational radiation was first predicted by Einstein in 1916, however gravitational waves have not yet been directly observed. One source of gravitation radiation is binary inspiral. Two compact bodies orbiting each other, such as a pair of black holes, lose energy to gravitational radiation. As the system loses energy the bodies spiral towards each other. This causes their orbital speed and the amount of gravitational radiation to increase, producing a characteristic ``chirp'' waveform in the LIGO <b>sensitive</b> <b>band.</b> In this thesis, matched filtering of LIGO science data is used to search for low mass binary systems in the halo of dark matter surrounding the Milky Way. Observations of gravitational microlensing events of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud suggest that some fraction of the dark matter in the halo may be in the form of Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). It has been proposed that low mass black holes formed in the early universe may be a component of the MACHO population; some fraction of these black hole MACHOs will be in binary systems and detectable by LIGO. The inspiral from a MACHO binary composed of two 0. 5 solar mass black holes enters the LIGO <b>sensitive</b> <b>band</b> around 40 Hz. The chirp signal increases in amplitude and frequency, sweeping through the <b>sensitive</b> <b>band</b> to 4400 Hz in 140 seconds.

To better {{understand}} soil alkalinization and salinization in this important agricultural region, it is vital to explore the distribution and variation of soil alkalinity and salinity in space and time. This study examined soil properties and identified the variables to extract soil alkalinity and salinity via physico-chemical, statistical, spectral, and image analysis. The physico-chemical and statistical results suggested that alkaline soils, coming from the main solute Na 2 CO 3 and NaHCO 3 in parent rocks, characterized the study area. The pH and electric conductivity (EC) were correlated with both narrow band and broad band reflectance. For soil pH, the <b>sensitive</b> <b>bands</b> were in short wavelength (VIS) and the band with the highest correlation was 475 nm (r = 0. 84). For soil EC, the <b>sensitive</b> <b>bands</b> were also in VIS and the band with the highest correlation was 354 nm (r = 0. 84). With the stepwise regression, {{it was found that the}} pH was sensitive to reflectance of OLI band 2 and band 6, while the EC was only <b>sensitive</b> to <b>band</b> 1. The R 2 Adj (0. 73 and 0. 72) and root mean square error (RMSE) (0. 98 and 1. 07 dS/m) indicated that, the two stepwise regression models could estimate soil alkalinity and salinity with a considerable accuracy. Spatial distributions of soil alkalinity and salinity were mapped from the OLI image with the RMSE of 1. 01 and 0. 64 dS/m, respectively. Soil alkalinity was related to salinity but most soils in the study area were non-saline soils. The area of alkaline soils was 44. 46 % of the basin.

Our outcome demonstrated that the potential use of VNIR spectroscopy for detecting the soil attributes {{can be used in}} an effective manner which may be useful in precision farming practices along with farming planning and management. According to the current study, spectral pre-treatment is essential to correlate the soil attributes in a better way. It may be concluded that the pre-treatment by SG-FDT method produced positive response on the robustness of PLSR models. Major soil nutrients were well predicted using hyper spectral VNIR spectroscopy. Our results revealed the importance of VNIR spectroscopy for the measurement of soil properties than the conventional laboratory approaches which are costly, time-consuming, and tedious. The PLSR-based model was developed for detecting the soil nutrients with better accuracy for all attributes with less RMSEP values as mentioned in Tables  3 and 4. The <b>sensitive</b> <b>bands</b> were detected for SOC at wavelengths 436, 444, 447, 549, and 616  nm; for N at wavelengths 480, 980, and 1702  nm; and for SOM at wavelengths 417, 441, 832, and 907  nm. The bands at 517, 657, 747, 1477, and 1492  nm showed good correlations with soil pH values, whereas bands at 572, 847, 992, 1202, 1537, 1622, and 1767  nm for EC values.

The detected soil attributes were analyzed by spectroscopy using the PLSR model which may be useful in precision farming and management. In the future scope, more soil samples will be considered for developing better predictive models.

The implemented network data analysis is based on a time coincidence search among AURIGA, EXPLORER and NAUTILUS; ALLEGRO data was reserved for follow-up studies. The network amplitude sensitivity to bursts improved by a factor ≈ 3 over the 1997 - 2000 IGEC observations; the wider <b>sensitive</b> <b>band</b> also allowed the analysis to be tuned over a larger class of waveforms. Given the higher single-detector duty factors, the analysis was based on threefold coincidence, to ensure the identification of any single candidate of gravitational waves with high statistical confidence. The false detection rate was as low as 1 per century. No candidates were found...|$|E

Determination of diseased leaves and growing spectrum of different pigment content. Analysis jujube leaf rust pigment content and spectral reflectance correlation study comparing jujube leaf rust pigment content and differential spectral correlation. Hyperspectral characteristic parameters to achieve the southern jujube jujube leaf rust pigments PC 1 /PC 2 and PC 1 +PC 2 content estimation. Using a combination of linear and polynomial fitting method to construct the canopy hyperspectral disease dates Brix content estimation model and test. The probabilistic neural network PNN and SVM classifier SVC applied to hyperspectral estimation model, comparative analysis of model accuracy. The results of the quantitative estimation of disease hyperspectral information dates pigment content in leaves of jujube growing use of high spectral monitoring and impact assessment of disease have high practical value. classification accuracy of 98 %, obtained very satisfactory recognition results...|$|R
40|$|Soy protein {{isolates}} {{were prepared}} from soybean by methods of ultrafiltration and sediment at isoelectric pH. The SDS-PAGE patterns of sognilk, defatted soybean and soy protein isolates smples were analyzed. 17 bands of soy proteins were fed {{in all of}} the SDS-PAGE patterns. In all of the propared smples, band l 7 with ar 104620 was formed as the only new one and some thermal <b>sensitive</b> <b>bands</b> such as band 13 with Mr 76060, band 12 with ar 70740 and band 5 with Mr 32820 disappeared. It was found ty heating and β -mercaptoethanol treatment that the change of sulfhydryl bond was attributed to this coanon SDS-PAGE pattern change. The SDS-PAGE patterns of soy protein also exited some changes when soybean was prepared as defatted soybean and protein isolates- sand 1 in defatted soybean, band 4, 7 in the protein isolates produced by sediment at isoelectric pH and band 1, 2 in the protein isolates produced by ultrafiltration were found disrmeared. The various characteristics chanqes were related to these changes processing. Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technolog...|$|R
40|$|Ab initio 6 - 31 G* SCF-MO {{calculations}} {{have been}} carried out for cis- and trans-S-ethyl thiocrotonate [cis- and trans- CH 3 —CHCH—C(O) SCH 2 CH 3]. Fully optimized geometries, relative stabilities, dipole moments and harmonic force fields for several conformers of these molecules have been determined and the results compared with those of similar molecules. Combined with FTIR spectroscopic data, the theoretical results demonstrate that trans-S-ethyl thiocrotonate exists in two different confromations about the Cα–C bond (the s-cis and s-trans forms, with CC–CO dihedral angles equal to 0 ° and 180 °, respectively), the s-cis conformation being more stable than the s-trans form by ca. 7 kJ mol– 1 for the isolated molecule situation, while the cis-s-ethyl thiocrotonate molecule adopts only the s-cis conformation about this bond. A comparison of the experimental and theoretical vibrational spectra also shows that the existence of the less stable s-trans isomer of an α,β-unsaturated thioester can be successfully monitored by the IR band at ca. 1165 cm– 1, ascribed to the Cα–C stretching mode of this form. Additional conformationally <b>sensitive</b> <b>bands</b> are also identified, but these are difficult to use in the IR spectrum because of overlap with other features...|$|R
