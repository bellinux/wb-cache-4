Mick Quinn tried to {{describe}} the concept: [...] "There's {{a few people who}} are just really out there. There's {{a lot of people around}} Oxford who are real spliffheads and that, who go and lie down in Port Meadow, but I'm not really sure about them. I'm not really sure that they're individuals: they're part of a much larger thing."

500|$|Nellie {{does not}} sing {{together}} with Emile, because Rodgers promised Martin {{that she would}} not have to compete vocally with Pinza, but the composer sought to unite them in the underlying music. [...] A tetrachord, heard before we see either lead, is played during the instrumental introduction to [...] "Dites-Moi", the show's first song. [...] Considered as pitch classes, that is, as pitches without characterization by octave or register, the motif is C-B-A-G. It will be heard repeatedly in Nellie's music, or in the music (such as [...] "Twin Soliloquies") that she shares with Emile, and even in the bridge of [...] "Some Enchanted Evening". [...] Lovensheimer argues that this symbolizes what Nellie is trying to say with her Act II line [...] "We're the same <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> fundamentallyâ€“ you and me".|$|E
500|$|... "Creative evolution", Shaw's {{version of}} the new science of eugenics, became an {{increasing}} theme in his political writing after 1900. He introduced his theories in The Revolutionist's Handbook (1903), an appendix to Man and Superman, and developed them further during the 1920s in Back to Methuselah. A 1946 Life magazine article observed that Shaw had [...] "always tended to look at people more as a biologist than as an artist". By 1933, {{in the preface to}} On the Rocks, he was writing that [...] "if we desire a certain type of civilization and culture we must exterminate the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> who do not fit into it"; critical opinion is divided on whether this was intended as irony. In an article in the American magazine Liberty in September 1938, Shaw included the statement: [...] "There are many {{people in the world who}} ought to be liquidated". Many commentators assumed that such comments were intended as a joke, although in the worst possible taste. Otherwise, Life magazine concluded, [...] "this silliness can be classed with his more innocent bad guesses".|$|E

500|$|The radical {{groups that}} flourished {{during this period}} held differing {{opinions}} of Magna Carta. The Levellers rejected history and law as presented by their contemporaries, holding instead to an [...] "anti-Normanism" [...] viewpoint. John Lilburne, for example, argued that Magna Carta contained {{only some of the}} freedoms that had supposedly existed under the Anglo-Saxons before being crushed by the Norman yoke. The Leveller Richard Overton described the charter as [...] "a beggarly thing containing many marks of intolerable bondage". Both saw Magna Carta as a useful declaration of liberties that could be used against governments they disagreed with. Gerrard Winstanley, the leader of the more extreme Diggers, stated [...] "the best lawes that England hath, [...] were got by our Forefathers importunate petitioning unto the kings that still were their Task-masters; and yet these best laws are yoaks and manicles, tying one <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> to be slaves to another; Clergy and Gentry have got their freedom, but the common people still are, and have been left servants to work for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Nirvana {{ultimately}} chose Albini {{to record}} its third album. [...] Albini {{had a reputation}} as a principled and opinionated individual in the American independent music scene. [...] While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told Request magazine in 1993, [...] "For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce two of my favorite records, which were Surfer Rosa [...] and Pod [...]" [...] Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying. [...] Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album. [...] Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to get a call from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project. [...] Although he considered the group to be [...] "R.E.M. with a fuzzbox" [...] and [...] "an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound", Albini told Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be [...] "the same <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> as all the small-fry bands I deal with", at the mercy of their record company. [...] Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil. [...] In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the PJ Harvey album Rid of Me to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.|$|E
500|$|In {{an outpouring}} of mid-century revisionist views, {{scholars}} approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay [...] "Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen" [...] that Austen's novels {{did not support the}} status quo but rather subverted it. [...] Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging [...] "her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> she disliked...". Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as [...] "expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order" [...] that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single woman is seen as a problem. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in [...] "Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing", published in Scrutiny in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in The Great Tradition (1948) that Austen {{was one of the great}} writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics. They agreed that she [...] "combined [...] qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both".|$|E

2500|$|Family First's preferencing {{agreement}} with the Coalition in the 2004 federal election led Barnaby Joyce, the National senate candidate for Queensland, to publicly slam the party {{the day before the}} election, calling them [...] "the lunatic Right", and stating that [...] "these are not the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> you do preference deals with". Joyce's comments came in response to a pamphlet published by one of the party's Victorian Senate candidates, Danny Nalliah who in his capacity as a church pastor had criticised other religions and homosexuality.|$|E

Vera Brodsky Lawrence of the New York Public Library published a two-volume set of Joplin works in June 1971, entitled The Collected Works of Scott Joplin, stimulating a wider interest in the performance of Joplin's music.|$|E

Nevertheless, his candidacy caused considerable controversy when National Party Senate candidate Barnaby Joyce launched a heavily publicised attack on Family First and his own party's preference deal with them the day before the election. Joyce highlighted a quote from one of Nalliah's brochures that asked parishioners to pray that God would pull down [...] "Satan's strongholds", which included brothels, gambling places, bottle shops, mosques and temples (including Freemason, Buddhist and Hindu temples). Joyce used Nalliah's derogatory statements about minority groups to describe Family First as [...] "not the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> you do preference deals with." ...|$|E

The Phoenix was well received, judged to be easy to handle in the air and on the ground and to land.
