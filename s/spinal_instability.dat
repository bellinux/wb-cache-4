CT/MR imaging confirmed a right-sided pre-/paravertebral soft tissue mass and destructive lytic lesions from T 2 to T 6. CT-guided needle biopsy confirmed granulomatous pulmonary Blastomycosis. Conservative management with antifungal therapy was initiated. Neurosurgical review confirmed no clinical or profound radiographic instability, and the patient was stabilized with TLSO bracing.

40|$|C 1 - Journal Articles RefereedBACKGROUND: Distant metastases from {{differentiated}} thyroid carcinoma {{occur in}} up to 20 % of cases and represent the most frequent cause of thyroid cancer-related death. Metastatic disease to the spine {{has the potential to}} cause severe morbidity, including pain, neurological deficit, and paraplegia. SUMMARY: We present a case series of eight consecutive patients with symptomatic spinal metastases due to thyroid carcinoma treated by our multidisciplinary team consisting of spinal surgeons, oncologists, and radiologists, with management of each case determined by our surgical algorithm. Four patients underwent surgical decompression and stabilization for <b>spinal</b> metastases causing <b>instability,</b> <b>spinal</b> cord compression, neurological deficit, or intractable pain. Three patients underwent vertebroplasty for focal mechanical pain due to osteolytic metastases in the absence of significant spinal cord compression or spinal instability; one of these patients required subsequent surgical decompression for spinal cord compression. One patient was nonoperatively treated. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy for the primary cancer and adjuvant radioiodine- 131 treatment. The only patient with poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, which was refractory to radioiodine- 131 died at 6 months after vertebroplasty procedures for symptomatic spinal metastases. One patient with medullary thyroid carcinoma died at 18 months after vertebroplasty. All remaining six patients who had well-differentiated papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma were alive at an average of 50 months (range: 17 - 96 months) after diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic spinal metastases and were ambulant, independent, and able to perform activities of daily living and had no significant pain or neurologic symptoms. CONCLUSION: The potential for long-term survival of several years following development of spinal metastases should be considered during the counseling and decision-making process for patients with thyroid cancer.

40|$|The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin extensibility, and tissue fragility. This communication briefly reports upon the neurological manifestations that arise including {{the weakness of}} the ligaments of the craniocervical junction and spine, early disc degeneration, and {{the weakness of the}} epineurium and perineurium surrounding peripheral nerves. Entrapment, deformation, and biophysical deformative stresses exerted upon the nervous system may alter gene expression, neuronal function and phenotypic expression. This report also discusses increased prevalence of migraine, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, Tarlov cysts, tethered cord syndrome, and dystonia, where associations with EDS have been anecdotally reported, but where epidemiological evidence is not yet available. Chiari Malformation Type I (CMI) has been reported to be a comorbid condition to EDS, and may be complicated by craniocervical instability or basilar invagination. Motor delay, headache, and quadriparesis have been attributed to ligamentous laxity and instability at the atlanto-occipital and atlantoaxial joints, which may complicate all forms of EDS. Discopathy and early degenerative spondylotic disease manifest by <b>spinal</b> segmental <b>instability</b> and kyphosis, rendering EDS patients prone to mechanical pain, and myelopathy. Musculoskeletal pain starts early, is chronic and debilitating, and the neuromuscular disease of EDS manifests symptomatically with weakness, myalgia, easy fatigability, limited walking, reduction of vibration sense, and mild impairment of mobility and daily activities. Consensus criteria and clinical practice guidelines, based upon stronger epidemiological and pathophysiological evidence, are needed to refine diagnosis and treatment of the various neurological and spinal manifestations of EDS.

40|$|Abstract Background Degenerative <b>spinal</b> {{stenosis}} and <b>instability</b> requiring multilevel spine surgery {{has been}} associated with large blood losses. Factors that affect perioperative blood loss include time of surgery, surgical procedure, patient height, combined anterior/posterior approaches, number of levels fused, blood salvage techniques, and the use of anti-fibrinolytic medications. This study was done to evaluate the efficacy of tranexamic acid in reducing blood loss in spine surgery. Methods This retrospective case control study includes 97 patients who had to undergo surgery because of degenerative lumbar <b>spinal</b> stenosis and <b>instability.</b> All operations included spinal decompression, interbody fusion and posterior instrumentation (4 - 5 segments). Forty-six patients received 1 g tranexamic acid intravenous, preoperative and six hours and twelve hours postoperative; 51 patients without tranexamic acid administration were evaluated as a control group. Based on the records, the intra- and postoperative blood losses were measured by evaluating the drainage and cell saver systems 6, 12 and 24 hours post operation. Additionally, hemoglobin concentration and platelet concentration were reviewed. Furthermore, the number of red cell transfusions given and complications associated with tranexamic acid were assessed. Results The postoperative hemoglobin concentration demonstrated a statistically significant difference with a p value of 0. 0130 showing superiority for tranexamic acid use (tranexamic acid group: 11. 08 g/dl, SD: 1. 68; control group: 10. 29 g/dl, SD: 1. 39). The intraoperative cell saver volume and drainage volume after 24 h demonstrated a significant difference as well, which indicates a less blood loss in the tranexamic acid group than the control group. The postoperative drainage volume at 12 hours showed no significant differences; nor did the platelet concentration Allogenic blood transfusion (two red cell units) was needed for eight patients in the tranexamic acid group and nine in the control group because of postoperative anemia. Complications associated with the administration of tranexamic acid, e. g. renal failure, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism did not occur. Conclusions This study suggests a less blood loss when administering tranexamic acid in posterior lumbar spine surgery as demonstrated by the higher postoperative hemoglobin concentration and the less blood loss. But given the relatively small volume of blood loss in the patients of this study it is underpowered to show a difference in transfusion rates. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Historically, laminectomies {{have been}} the primary way to treat lumbar spinal stenosis.  A laminectomy is a more {{invasive}} method with the aim to decrease {{the total amount of}} pain and numbness associated with lumbar spinal stenosis.  It is a surgery that eliminates the entire lamina to allow the nerves around this region to function properly. Laminectomies also often produce a longer recovery time as well as a greater risk for post-operative complications. There is typically more damage to the surrounding muscle tissue accompanied by a laminectomy.  Since a laminectomy involves the excision of the entire lamina, a laminectomy will usually cause more <b>spinal</b> <b>instability</b> than a laminotomy.  When going with the option of laminotomy, the procedure reduces the total amount of muscle severed. Because a laminotomy does not damage the spinous process and critical ligaments, there is not as much muscle weakness, pain, and lumbar instability seen with laminectomies.  Laminotomies are fairly new compared to laminectomies, and it involves using less invasive methods with precise instruments to minimize the risk of tissue damage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{laminotomy}} procedure {{has many}} benefits {{as to why}} it is a preferred spinal surgery since it is less invasive than other spinal procedures such as a laminectomy or a spinal fusion. Once a laminotomy procedure is done, patients have a great improvement in their pain and mobility. Laminotomies are usually safer than other surgeries that are open or invasive. This surgery usually is shorter than other spinal decompression procedures by having an average duration of 70-85 minutes, whereas other decompression surgeries can have a duration anywhere from 90 to 109 minutes. Laminotomies are usually more cost efficient than other surgical decompression surgeries. In 2007, it was seen that laminotomies were around $10,000, whereas other surgical procedures were around $24,000. Smaller skin incisions and scarring as well as less surgical trauma are also a benefit of laminotomy. [...] With this procedure, there is usually a faster recovery time that results in a shorter hospital stay if one is necessary at all. During the surgery {{there is also a}} benefit of minimizing the injury to muscles, ligaments, and bones in the spine since more invasive surgeries have a greater risk of damaging them. General anesthesia is usually required, but postoperative <b>spinal</b> <b>instability</b> is typically limited.|$|E
40|$|Ehlers–Danlos {{syndrome}} (EDS) —hypermobility type (HT) {{is considered}} to be the most common subtype of EDS and the least severe one; EDS-HT {{is considered to}} be identical to the joint hypermobility syndrome and manifests with musculoskeletal complaints, joint instability, and soft tissue overuse injury. Musculoskeletal complaints manifest with joint pain of non-inflammatory origin and/or <b>spinal</b> pain.

40|$|Spinal lumbar {{stenosis}} {{is a disease}} that occurs mainly between the 5 th and 7 th decade of life and can be congenital or acquired. The latter has many etiologies, but a degenerative cause is the most common. Stenosis is a narrowing of the spinal canal diameter caused by many factors such as bulging discs, hypertrophy of flavum ligament, facet capsule thickening and osteophyte formation. The classical symptom of the disease is sciatic pain, that improves with lumbar flexion and worsens with ambulation. Neurological examination is often normal and the most useful imaging test is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Conservative management consists in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, physical therapy and epidural - radicular infiltrations. Spinal infiltrations have a proven efficacy for pain management. A good result of this therapy predicts a favorable outcome after surgery. Surgical treatment consists in decompression with or without lumbar fusion. The addition of an arthrodesis is recommended for degenerative spondylolisthesis, correction of deformities, recurrent <b>spinal</b> stenosis with <b>instability,</b> sagittal or coronal imbalance and adjacent segment disease...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: An en bloc partial laminectomy and {{posterior}} lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) in {{spinal stenosis}} patients with severe foraminal narrowing has a shorter operation time, less neural manipulation and allows indirect decompression by restoring the interforaminal height {{compared to other}} procedures. This study investigated {{the efficacy of the}} procedure. Overview of Literature: PLIF {{is one of the most}} popular surgery for degenerative spine such as foraminal <b>spinal</b> stenosis, <b>instability</b> spondylolisthesis and discogenic pain. Various techniques for PLIF have their own advantages and disadvantages. But in some severe cases, we need an efficient method of PLIF for decompression and fusion. Methods: This study examined 61 patients, who had 85 levels treated with PLIF using an en bloc partial laminectomy and facetectomy, and could be followed up for more than 2 years. The mean age of the patients and mean follow up period was 66 years and 39 months, respectively. The clinical results were evaluated using the MacNab's criteria, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score, and Korea Version Oswestry Disability Index (KODI). The union of the intervertebral space was evaluated using Lenke’s criteria. The intervertebral angle and height of the posterior intervertebral disc were also measured. Results: Excellent and good results were obtained in 54 cases (89 %) according to MacNab's criteria. The VAS and KODI scores were 8. 1 and 34. 6, preoperatively, and 3. 4, and 14. 1, postoperatively. Bone union was A and B grades according to Lenke’s criteria in 57 cases. The mean segmental angle and mean height of the posterior disc were respectively, 7. 4 。and 6. 5 mm preoperatively, 9. 1 。and 10. 6 mm postoperatively, and 8. 0 。and 9. 7 mm in the last follow-up. There were 5 cases of postoperative infection, 4 cases of junctional problems and 1 case of screw malposition.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Systematic {{review and}} {{modified}} Delphi technique. OBJECTIVE: To use an evidence-based medicine process using {{the best available}} literature and expert opinion consensus to develop a comprehensive classification system to diagnose neoplastic <b>spinal</b> <b>instability.</b> SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: <b>Spinal</b> <b>instability</b> is poorly defined in the literature and presently {{there is a lack}} of guidelines available to aid in defining the degree of <b>spinal</b> <b>instability</b> in the setting of neoplastic spinal disease. The concept of <b>spinal</b> <b>instability</b> remains important in the clinical decision-making process for patients with spine tumors. METHODS: We have integrated the evidence provided by systematic reviews through a modified Delphi technique to generate a consensus of best evidence and expert opinion to develop a classification system to define neoplastic <b>spinal</b> <b>instability.</b> RESULTS: A comprehensive classification system based on patient symptoms and radiographic criteria of the spine was developed to aid in predicting spine stability of neoplastic lesions. The classification system includes global spinal location of the tumor, type and presence of pain, bone lesion quality, spinal alignment, extent of vertebral body collapse, and posterolateral spinal element involvement. Qualitative scores were assigned based on relative importance of particular factors gleaned from the literature and refined by expert consensus. CONCLUSION: The Spine Instability Neoplastic Score is a comprehensive classification system with content validity that can guide clinicians in identifying when patients with neoplastic disease of the spine may benefit from surgical consultation. It can also aid surgeons in assessing the key components of <b>spinal</b> <b>instability</b> due to neoplasia and may become a prognostic tool for surgical decision-making when put in context with other key elements such as neurologic symptoms, extent of disease, prognosis, patient health factors, oncologic subtype, and radiosensitivity of the tumor...|$|E

30|$|Comparing the two subsets of patients, both {{suffering}} from clinically relevant LSS, the first subset returns {{a statistically significant}} clinical improvement at follow-up.

40|$|Aim: The authors report {{experience}} with 14 cases where two screws or ′′double insurance′′ screws {{were used for}} transfacetal fixation of each joint for stabilization of the lumbar spinal segment. The anatomical subtleties of the technique of insertion of screws are elaborated. Materials and Methods: During the period March 2011 to June 2014, 14 patients having lumbar <b>spinal</b> segmental <b>instability</b> related to lumbar canal stenosis were treated by insertion of two screws into each articular assembly by transfacetal technique. After a wide surgical exposure, the articular cartilage was denuded and bone chips were impacted into the joint cavity. For screw insertion in an appropriate angulation, the spinous process was sectioned at its base. The screws (2. 8 mm in diameter and 18 mm in length) were inserted into {{the substance of the}} medial or inferior articular facet of the rostral vertebra via the lateral limit of the lamina approximately 6 - 8 mm away {{from the edge of the}} articular cavity. The screws were inserted 3 mm below the superior edge and 5 mm above the inferior edge of the medial (inferior) facets and directed laterally and traversed through the articular cavity into the lateral (superior) articular facet of the caudal vertebra toward and into the region of junction of base of transverse process and of the pedicle. During the period of follow-up all treated spinal levels showed firm bone fusion. There was no complication related to insertion of the screws. There was no incidence of screw misplacement, displacementor implant rejection. Conclusions: Screw insertion into the firm and largely cortical bones of facets of lumbar spine can provide robust fixation and firm stabilization of the spinal segment. The large size of the facets provides an opportunity to insert two screws at each spinal segment. The firm and cortical bone material and absence on any neural or vascular structure in the course of the screw traverse provides strength and safety to the process...|$|R

Forty-five consecutive patients with intradural extramedullary lesions, who underwent modified hemilaminectomy, were studied retrospectively. The intraspinal tumors were removed via the limited bone window with a 3. 3 -cm mean length (range: 2. 0 – 6. 5 cm) and a 1. 2 -cm mean width (range: 0. 6 – 1. 5 cm), in which the inner parts of the medial and lateral laminae were mostly undercut for wider view. Spinal lesions were cervical in 21 cases, thoracic in 12 cases, lumbar in 10 cases, and multiple in 2 cases. Forty-three cases were completely excised via hemilaminectomy alone. Two subjects with dumbbell neurinoma underwent two-stage tumor removal via anterolateral cervical approach following hemilaminectomy. With respect to neurological status, the percentage of good Frankel scale (D+E grade) was markedly improved from 22. 2 % on admission to 93. 3 % at follow-up. At the median 26 -month follow-up evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), none of the subjects showed <b>spinal</b> deformity or <b>instability.</b> By preserving musculoligamentous attachments and posterior bony elements as much as possible, the modified approach is minimally invasive and may be routinely used to remove intradural and extramedullary tumors, especially in patients with meningiomas and neurinomas...|$|R
30|$|Cervical laminoplasty {{was first}} {{described}} by Oyama et al. in the 1970 s {{with the intent}} of overcoming the limitations of a standard laminectomy procedure. Recurrence of compression on the <b>spinal</b> cord, post-laminectomy <b>instability</b> and kyphosis are well-known complications of laminectomy in the cervical spine [10 – 12]. Supplementation of laminectomy with a fusion can prevent development of post-laminectomy instability but at the cost of increased rates of adjacent segment degeneration and higher rates of complications related to implant malpositioning [13 – 15]. Moreover, treatment of CSM in younger patients represents a particular challenge in view of the importance of motion preservation in this particular subgroup of patients. Cervical laminoplasty is a technique designed to allow multiple level posterior decompression of the spinal canal while maintaining spinal alignment and stability through preservation of the posterior elements. Many different laminoplasty techniques have been described but they all share the same principle of achieving decompression of a stenotic spinal canal through the expansion of the posterior arch, the conservation of the posterior elements, and preservation of segmental motion. The techniques can be broadly divided into unilateral hinge, z-laminoplasty, and bilateral hinges (i.e., French-door laminoplasty or two lateral hinges with intact spinous processes). The fundamental aim of all these techniques is to achieve and maintain an expanded spinal canal while preserving motion and alignment of the cervical spine.|$|R
