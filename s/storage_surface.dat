Between the sector header and ECC areas, eight 512-byte sectors are combined, eliminating the need for redundant header areas between each individual chunk of 512-byte data. The Long Data Sector Committee selected the 4K block length for the first generation AF standard for several reasons, including its correspondence to the paging size used by processors and some operating systems as well as its correlation to the size of standard transactions in relational database systems.|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} MOU was to set out terms under which OPG, in {{consultation}} with the Municipality of Kincardine, would develop a plan for the long-term management of L&ILW at the WWMF. As part of the MOU-related activities, Golder Associates, on behalf of OPG and the Ministry of Kincardine, conducted an Independent Assessment Study of three long-term waste management options: enhanced processing and surface <b>storage,</b> <b>surface</b> concrete vaults, and deep rock vaults. The study, published in 2004, included technical feasibility and socio-economic impacts, as well as a review of international practices for waste management. The assessment found that all three long-term management options were technically feasible and could be safely constructed and operated at the WWMF, and that no clear preference for any of the three options had been identified in public attitude and tourism research. Ultimately, the Municipality of Kincardine identified a deep geologic repository as its preferred option for the long-term management of L&ILW, and endorsed the project on April 21, 2004.|$|E

30|$|Management {{of large}} volumes of {{associated}} water with CBM production is a potential concern due {{to the presence of}} elevated water salinity and sodicity. The produced water is managed in different ways in different areas of the USA and other countries. Existing production in the Powder River Basin utilizes a variety of options to manage CBM-produced water. Deep injection, aquifer <b>storage,</b> <b>surface</b> water discharge, land application (irrigation with amendments), livestock watering and impoundment are all being used to manage produced water. Land application of the CBM-associated high saline–sodic water is a common management method that has been practiced in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming and Montana. The agricultural use of the co-produced waters from CBM is another management option. However, the use of produced water for irrigation can result in deterioration in soil quality and changes in physical and chemical parameters of the soil (Veil and Clark 2011).|$|E

Interaction between active plasma species and the polymer surface, and the resulting surface changes were studied by contact angle measurement, surface energy determination, FTIR, and XPS. The most hydrophilic surface was obtained after only 3 - 4 s treatment. Treatment up to 10 s did not damage the polymer but longer treatments (30 and 60 s) caused partial degradation. The plasma broke C-C/C-H bonds and formed more C-O, O-C=O and C-O-C bonds. During <b>storage</b> <b>surface</b> oxygen decreased and a negligible amount of nitrogen was adsorbed.

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported here}} {{is part of}} a larger project that is coupling a suite of environmental models to simulate the hydrologic cycle within river basins (Bossert et al., 1999). These models include the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS), which provides meteorological variables and precipitation to the Simulator for Processes of Landscapes, Surface/Subsurface Hydrology (SPLASH). SPLASH partitions precipitation into evaporation, transpiration, soil water <b>storage,</b> <b>surface</b> runoff, and subsurface recharge. The runoff is collected within a simple river channel model and the Finite element Heat and Mass (FEHM) subsurface model is linked to the land surface and river flow model components to simulate saturated and unsaturated flow and changes in aquifer levels. The goal is to produce a fully interactive system of atmospheric, surface hydrology, river and groundwater models to allow water and energy feedbacks throughout the system. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the precipitation fields predicted by the RAMS model at different times during the 1992 [...] 1993 water year in the Rio Grande basin.

40|$|Wetlands are {{important}} hydrological elements of watersheds that influence water <b>storage,</b> <b>surface</b> water runoff, groundwater recharge/discharge processes, and evapotranspiration. Understanding {{the cumulative effect}} wetlands have on a watershed requires {{a good understanding of}} representative water-level fluctuations and storage characteristics associated with multiple wetlands across a region. We introduce a probabilistic approach based on frequency analysis of water levels in numerous geographically isolated wetlands across the mantled karst terrain of west-central Florida, in the Tampa Bay region. This approach estimates the probabilities, or percentage of time, that water levels in a wetland or upland groundwater wells are at or below a specific elevation. We applied this hydrologic characterization to 56 wetlands in west-central Florida, and documented that standing water was present in the wetlands 61 % of the time and that these wetlands were groundwater recharge zones at least 50 % of the time over the 7 year study. Additionally, we demonstrated that various wetland types, classified according to vegetation community composition and structure, exhibit similar means, extremes and ranges in water-level behavior. We believe {{that this is the first}} paper to robustly quantify inundation frequency and recharge status in seasonally flooded wetlands at a regional scale. The analytical tool introduced in this manuscript could be used to detect, through changes in water-level frequency distribution, wetland hydrological response to different climatological or anthropogenic stressors. This tool is timely as changes in frequency distribution shape may provide early warnings of ecosystem regime change...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In vitro {{experimental}} environments {{are used}} to study interactions between microorganisms, and to predict dynamics in natural ecosystems. This study highlights that experimental in vitro environments should be selected to match closely the natural environment of interest during in vitro studies to strengthen extrapolations about aflatoxin production by Aspergillus and competing organisms. Fungal competition and aflatoxin accumulation were studied in soil, cotton wool or tube (water-only) environments, for Aspergillus flavus competition with Penicillium purpurogenum, Fusarium oxysporum or Sarocladium zeae within maize grains. Inoculated grains were incubated in each environment at two temperature regimes (25 and 30 °C). Competition experiments showed interaction between the main effects of aflatoxin accumulation and the environment at 25 °C, but not so at 30 °C. However, competition experiments showed fungal populations were always interacting with their environments. Fungal survival differed after the 72 -h incubation in different experimental environments. Whereas all fungi incubated within the soil environment survived, in the cotton wool environment none of the competitors of A. flavus survived at 30 °C. With aflatoxin accumulation, F. oxysporum was the only fungus able to interdict aflatoxin production at both temperatures. This occurred only in the soil environment and fumonisins accumulated instead. Smallholder farmers in developing countries face serious mycotoxin contamination of their grains, and soil is a natural reservoir for the associated fungal propagules, and a drying and <b>storage</b> <b>surface</b> for grains on these farms. Studying fungal dynamics in the soil environment and other environments in vitro can provide insights into aflatoxin accumulation post-harvest...|$|E
