5|$|The Watten {{site was}} {{captured}} on 4 September 1944 by Canadian forces. The Germans had evacuated {{it a few}} days earlier and removed the pumps which kept the cavernous basement free from water; not long afterwards it began to flood. This made a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the bunker inaccessible to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Turkish brands like Beko and Vestel {{are among}} the largest {{producers}} of consumer electronics and home appliances in Europe, and invest a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> funds {{for research and development}} in new technologies related to these fields.|$|E
5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than to that of a modern warship.|$|E

5|$|A <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{rebuilding}} followed. In 1733, {{work began}} on the royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> water was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being {{found in the}} largely iron-silicon-nickel core. Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per billion of the crust whereas its concentration in the core {{is thought to be}} nearly 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the core may generate a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> the heat that drives plate tectonics and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Desha {{continued}} on to San Antonio, where {{he lost a}} <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money playing Monte Bank. He {{decided to return to}} San Felipe. Meeting two Americans and a Mexican cigar maker travelling that way, with their permission, he traveled with them. After his return to San Felipe, the citizens began to suspect Desha of murdering Early. A few days after Desha's arrival, Early's clothing was found in a nearby creek. Scattered nearby, a search party located skeletal remains believed to be Early's.|$|E
5|$|JB Kobask, a {{purebred}} Arabian stallion foaled in 1983, {{became the}} first live horse mascot for the Broncos in 1993 after a successful horse show career. He was a son of the reserve U.S. National Champion Arabian Stallion GG Jabask, and a grandson of the Polish-bred Arabian *Bask, a multiple U.S. National Champion after his importation to the United States. JB Kobask also had a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> Crabbet breeding in his pedigree.|$|E
5|$|On February 27, 1853, the twice-widower Crittenden {{married his}} third wife, Elizabeth Moss. Moss was twice-widowed, most {{recently}} to General William Henry Ashley. Moss was Crittenden's wife until his death. Crittenden served {{as attorney general}} until the expiration of Fillmore's term in 1853. Following his service as attorney general, he returned to private life. He made a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money establishing mining claims for his clients in the former Mexican territory.|$|E

5|$|Promotions in rank were {{decided by}} the emperor and could occur on special occasions, such as {{installation}} of a new emperor, inauguration of a new reign title, the wedding of a new empress, or {{the selection of a}} royal heir apparent. The central government sometimes sold ranks to collect more revenues for the state. The official Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) once wrote that anyone who presented a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> agricultural grain to the government would also be promoted in rank.|$|E
5|$|The shootdown {{happened}} {{at a very}} tense time in U.S.–Soviet relations during the Cold War. The U.S. adopted a strategy of releasing a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> hitherto highly classified intelligence information in order to exploit a major propaganda advantage over the Soviet Union. Six hours after the plane was downed, the South Korean government issued an announcement that the plane had merely been forced to land abruptly by the Soviets, and that all passengers and crew were safe.|$|E
5|$|Atangana {{won over}} other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and {{intervention}} on their behalf. He lavished attention on visitors {{from out of}} town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him to monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E

5|$|Despite the expedition's failure, Carrouges had {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} the campaign. Although he had lost five of his nine men-at-arms and a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money he had also been awarded a knighthood on the battlefield, substantially raising his social status {{and the amount of}} money he received from military service. Despite being in poor health on his return from Scotland, Carrouges had business in Paris and in January 1386 he traveled there to collect his wages for the previous year's campaign, leaving his wife with her mother-in-law at the village of Capomesnil.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the {{telescope}} observed the coordinates {{of the recently}} discovered pulsar, confirming its existence and investigating the dispersion measure. It was also {{used to make the}} first detection of polarization of the pulsar's radiation. This marked the start of a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> work investigating pulsars at Jodrell, which is still ongoing. In the 30 years following the discovery of pulsars, {{the telescope}} discovered over 100 new pulsars (and astronomers at Jodrell Bank discovered around 2/3 of the total number using the Lovell and other telescopes). 300 pulsars are regularly observed using either the Lovell, or a nearby 42-foot (13-m) dish.|$|E
5|$|In New Orleans, Desha {{assumed the}} name John Parker. Meeting an Ohio native named Thomas Early, {{he learned the}} man was {{carrying}} a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money and {{was on his way}} to Texas to purchase some horses and mules. Desha joined Early, traveling with him on a schooner dubbed the Rights of Man across the Gulf of Mexico into Galveston Bay. In April 1828, Desha and Early disembarked at Rightors Point (now Morgan's Point, Texas), and from there, they traveled to San Felipe de Austin, arriving in early May. After a brief stay, the two set out on horseback toward San Antonio. By the time Desha reached Gonzales, he was traveling alone.|$|E

5|$|Other major {{employers}} {{in the county}} include: BAE Systems, Sunseeker International, J.P. Morgan, Cobham plc and Bournemouth University. Dorset's three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> international trade and tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this {{will continue to have}} a positive effect on local businesses and tourism.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} renowned and highly ranked {{universities}} {{in the world are}} located near Boston. Three universities with a major presence in the city, Harvard, MIT, and Tufts, are located just outside of Boston in the cities of Cambridge and Somerville, known as the Brainpower Triangle. Harvard is the nation's oldest institute of higher education and is centered across the Charles River in Cambridge, though the majority of its land holdings and a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> its educational activities are in Boston. Its business, medical, dental, and public health schools are located in Boston's Allston and Longwood neighborhoods, and Harvard has plans for additional expansion into Allston.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} U.S. congressman, Brown's {{talent for}} {{business}} became evident in college, where he made a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money selling Encyclopædia Britannica sets. After briefly practicing law with his father, he purchased Kentucky Fried Chicken from founder Harland Sanders in 1964. Brown turned the company into a worldwide success, and sold {{his interest in the}} company for a huge profit in 1971. He then invested in several other restaurant ventures, but none matched the success of KFC. During the 1970s, he also owned, at various times, three professional basketball teams – the American Basketball Association's Kentucky Colonels, and the National Basketball Association's Boston Celtics and Buffalo Braves (currently the Los Angeles Clippers).|$|E
