25|$|A {{variation}} {{on this position}} is to secure the wrists to either the <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> or to a securing point between their ankles forming a hogtie, resulting in {{what is called a}} suspension bow. In this position, if the subject is a female and facing down, her breasts would be pointing almost straight down depending on the strictness of the position, and nipple clamps and weights can be added for painful stimulation. The clamps may alternatively be secured to a point on the floor, limiting the subject's ability to struggle or move at all without causing pain.|$|E
25|$|Once a load {{is lifted}} off the substrate, it will rotate until {{the centre of}} gravity is in the {{position}} of lowest potential energy. If it is suspended from a single point, the apparent centre of gravity (corrected for inherent buoyancy) will be directly below the lift point. If it is undesirable for the load to rotate by a large angle as it leaves the bottom, the lifting point must be chosen to allow for this effect, and a multi-part sling or <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> may be needed, and {{it may be necessary to}} secure slings so they do not slip.|$|E

25|$|Designed by {{the company}} as its Model 74, the plane was an {{incremental}} improvement over the F2B. The Navy-designated prototype XF3B-1 still had the tapered wings of the F2B for instance, but was built as a single-float seaplane using the FB-5 undercarriage. However, the growing use of aircraft carriers took away most {{of the need for}} floating fighters, and by the time other test results had been taken into account, the production F3B-1 (Model 77) had a larger upper wing that was slightly swept back and a redesigned tail with surfaces made from corrugated aluminum. It also eliminated the <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement of the undercarriage and revised the vertical tail shape.|$|E
25|$|Unlike when {{a person}} is {{suspended}} by their wrists, rope suspension around the ankles can be maintained for much longer as the ankle region naturally is able to take far more weight and stress than the wrists. This is especially so if boots are used as the ropes can run around the outside surface of the boot thus protecting the skin from damage. The person may be suspended with their legs together, or held apart either by using a <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> or by securing the ankles to two separate locations. With the legs held in this position, the subject may have an increased sense of vulnerability as their genital region would be easily accessible.|$|E
25|$|This {{position}} has the subject bound in a horizontal position, sometimes face up but usually face down. The body is lifted into this position either by attaching bondage {{equipment to the}} wrists and ankles, or {{to other areas of}} the body, or a mixture of both, with the subject's weight born by these areas. The ankles or wrists may be brought together or kept apart by a <b>spreader</b> <b>bar.</b> In case of the wrists and ankles ropes or suspension cuffs can be used. When the body itself is used to suspend the person, they may first be tied into a conventional bondage position such as a hogtie or ball tie, then by attaching ropes or chains to ropes under areas of the body able to take weight the person is lifted into the air.|$|E

25|$|The term bondage {{describes}} {{the practice of}} physical restraint. Bondage is usually, but not always, a sexual practice.

Studies among BDSM practitioners in the US have shown that about half of all men find the idea of bondage to be erotic; and many women do as well. Strictly speaking, bondage means binding the partner by tying their appendages together; for example, by the use of handcuffs or ropes, or by lashing their arms to an object. Bondage can also be achieved by spreading the appendages and fastening them with chains or ropes to a St. Andrew's cross or <b>spreader</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Mobility is {{severely}} restricted by the hip spica cast and walking without crutches or a walker is impossible because the hips cannot bend. There {{is a serious}} danger of falling if the patient in a hip spica cast tries to get upright to walk without assistance because they lack {{the ability to control}} their balance. Patients are normally confined to a bed or reclining wheelchair, or children's stroller. Children in spica casts can sometimes learn to get mobile by scooting around on skateboards, or pulling themselves across the floor. Some children even learn to walk by holding themselves up against furniture. A child in a spica cast must always be supervised and safety must always be considered when they are at a mobile phase of their healing to prevent reinjury or damage to the cast. Many spica casts have a <b>spreader</b> <b>bar</b> between the legs to help strengthen the cast and support the legs in the proper positions. It is important when moving the casted patient to not lift them by this <b>spreader</b> <b>bar,</b> as it may break and this could cause injury to the patient. To facilitate toileting or diaper changing and hygienic cleaning, an opening is created in the cast at the groin. The opening is normally referred to as the [...] "perineal opening". It is formed either during cast application or after cast application by cutting the hole with the cast saw. The opening must then be petalled or lined to keep this area of the cast clean and dry. Because the hips cannot bend, using a toilet is difficult, if not impossible. It is therefore necessary for the patient to either use a diaper, bedpan, or catheters to manage bodily waste eliminations. Bathing must be done by sponge baths. Hair may be shampooed by using plastic wash basins under the head. To shampoo wash the hair of a child, the child can be lifted and placed on a kitchen counter top and their head held over the kitchen sink.|$|E

40|$|A {{simulation}} {{model of a}} rotorcraft multi-lift system is developed and implemented in the MATLAB / Simulink environment. The modeling tool {{is designed to be}} modular and generic, capable of modeling various configurations of rotorcraft, <b>spreader</b> <b>bars,</b> and external loads. This paper focuses on simulation and control of a formation of four helicopters carrying a single external load. Rather than treating the aircraft and slung load as a single dynamic system, they are treated as separate rigid bodies each with its own independent equations of motion. All objects in the four-helicopter system are coupled exclusively through elastic cable forces that act on each of the bodies. Analytical checks of the model are performed for the trim and stability characteristics of each helicopter, and results show reasonable and expected behavior due to the physical coupling from the cables. A non-linear control scheme is developed that using an aerodynamic inverse approach. The control calculates desired control inputs based on an inversion of the quasi-steady aerodynamics and the desired trajectory of each helicopter. In order to accurately track the commanded trajectory, the control law makes direct use of the measured cable force acting on each helicopter. The controller’s performance is demonstrated in non-linear simulation of a four-helicopter multi-lift system and compared to a standard dynamic inversion controller. Simulation results show that the controller should make explicit use of measured cable forces and moments in order to ensure constant formation and safe separation of th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Aircraft {{recovery}} is possible using an inflatable wing canopy with steel cable or fiber suspension lines. These lines {{are attached to}} reels at the aircraft that not only provide stowage for the lines but braking during deployment to prevent high snatch forces. They can vary the inflated wings angle attack thereby controlling range and flared landing maneuver. The inflated pressurized wing can carry a larger load than flexible gliding parachutes. A combined aerodynamic-structural analysis is made {{which is based on}} the assumption that the sail is flexible and has freedom to make the shape which the aerodynamic pressure and the internal stresses dictate. Analytical results are obtained for Newtonian impact aerodynamic theory and are compared with results obtained for a rigid idealization of the paraglider wing. The calculations provide a basis for design of paragliders for hypersonic flight. freedom to take the shape which the aerodynamic pressures and the internal stresses dictate. The assumptions are also made that the booms are rigid and straight and that they have small enough cross sections so as not to affect the aerodynamics. The boom are maintained a fixed distance apart by <b>spreader</b> <b>bars,</b> and the dihedral of the leading-edge booms is fixed with respect to the keel boom. The aerodynamic theory used is Newtonian theory, which has sometimes been used to express the aerodynamic pressure-shape relationship for the hypersonic speed range. Numerical results are presented to show effects of variation in dihedral angle (raising or lowering of the leading-edge booms) ...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringThis report {{presents}} {{a study of}} the structural analysis for removal operation of the Frigg TCP 2 M 32 Module with a new lifting arrangement situated {{at the top of the}} M 32 Module. During the removal of the M 32 from the Frigg TCP 2 platform performed in 2005 a planned delay to the lifting operations was required, due to installation and welding of the M 32 module lifting points at the bottom frame of the module. The intention of this study is to investigate if the interruption could have been avoided. This is done by performing structural analysis and verification of the M 32 Module and the feasibility of installing padeyes at the top of the M 32 Module. Global and local analysis covers the ultimate limit state and is carried out in accordance with prevailing design rules and standards. The global analyses are performed by using the Sesam software package and local analysis are performed by a combination of finite element analysis, analytical stress analysis and code checks. The lifting operation is defined as a heavy lift operation. Data from the Saipem S 7000 semi-submergible crane vessel is used for defining load input for lifting and transportation of the M 32 module. In this study the lifting arrangement is defined as a single crane lift with 3 loose <b>spreader</b> <b>bars.</b> The first global analysis showed failure of columns connected to the lifting points. To maintain the structural integrity of the module during lifting, these columns were reinforced by adding reinforcement plates to the failing structural elements. After that the reinforcements for the lifting operation are made the transportation condition is the governing condition for the global analysis of the M 32 module, however it does not have a significant effect on the analysis result for the transportation condition, if the padeyes are top or bottom mounted. Analysis of the padeyes was performed as an analytical stress and showed that the padeye design has the sufficient strength to carry the lifting load. The joints in the module are analyzed and found to have the required strength to withstand all forces during lifting and transport of the module. Based on the analysis and considerations performed in this report, I consider it possible to perform the lift of the M 32 module with a lifting arrangement situated at the top of the module. I consider all collected data and sources used in this thesis accurate and reliable. If errors of any kind occur I can assure that this is not of my intention as my aim is to present the results as accurate and realistic as possible. If however any inaccuracies have occurred it is my hope that these are minor and do not effect the final conclusion of this thesis...|$|R
