Also, [...] "Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits" [...] is changed to [...] "Jump back, jiggle your hips and wiggle a bit".

Realizing what is about to happen, John attempts to warn others not to enter the school, to little effect. The two gunmen then enter the school, and after their plans to blow up parts of the school with propane bombs fail, begin shooting indiscriminately. Elias photographs them entering the library where they open fire, shooting several students, including Michelle and presumably Elias.|$|R
500|$|The two {{brothers}} had often argued, and {{earlier in the}} decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, [...] "I'll get you for this, {{you son of a}} bitch" [...] and threatening to kill him. This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes. [...] Asked to respond to his brother's death, Jack said, [...] "I didn't give a <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> Harry." [...] At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.|$|E
500|$|Jess Harvell in Pitchfork in 2005 {{wrote that}} [...] "Rakim's {{innovation}} was applying a patina of intellectual detachment to rap's most sacred cause: talking <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> how you're a better rapper than everyone else." [...] Christgau in the Village Voice in 1990 wrote of Rakim's style as [...] "calm, confident, clear. On their third album, as on their phase-shifting 1986 debut," [...] he continues, [...] "Eric B.'s samples truly are beats, designed {{to accentuate the}} natural music of an idealized black man's voice." [...] Looking back at the late eighties in Rolling Stone in 1997, Ed Moralez describes Rakim as [...] "the new-school MC of the moment, using a smooth baritone to become the jazz soloist of mystic Afrocentric rap." ...|$|E
500|$|Ray Charles was 28years old in 1958, {{with ten}} years of {{experience}} recording primarily rhythm and blues music for the Downbeat and Swingtime record labels, in a style {{similar to that of}} Nat King Cole and Charles Brown. Charles signed with Atlantic Records in 1954 where producers Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler encouraged him to broaden his repertoire. Wexler would later remember that Atlantic Records' success came not from the artists' experience, but the enthusiasm for the music: [...] "We didn't know <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> making records, but we were having fun". Ertegun and Wexler found that a hands-off approach was the best way of encouraging Charles. Wexler later said, [...] "I realized the best thing I could do with Ray was leave him alone".|$|E

5000|$|NME rated Growing Pains a 7/10, {{saying that}} [...] "DP-U don’t give the most {{fleeting}} of <b>shits</b> <b>about</b> anything even remotely modern. Having said that, seeing {{as most of}} the attention focused on them thus far has focused on their being either (kindly) grunge revivalists or (unkindly) Nirvana copyists, it’s worth making clear that ‘Growing Pains’ is significantly better than either description suggests. Sure, there’s more than a hint of the Cobain in the ragged guitars and slightly self-centred lyrical conceits, but rather than just aping Nirvana they instead share similar influences - particularly Pixies and Melvins - as well as update the mid-’90s college rock sound that Archers Of Loaf, Guided By Voices and Built To Spill made their own." ...|$|R
500|$|Described by her actress, Lauren Cohan, as [...] "a female Humphrey Bogart", Bela is [...] "a {{little bit}} manipulative" [...] and she [...] "always {{wants to be}} in control". According to series creator Eric Kripke, the writers {{conceptualized}} the character as [...] "someone [...] really never come across before" [...] because, though she moves throughout the supernatural world, Bela has no interest in the [...] "altruistic or obsessed or revenge-minded motives of hunting". Writer and producer Sera Gamble summarized the writing team's characterization of Bela as a greedy [...] "mercenary that [...] just [...] give a <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> the cause". Gamble believed that Bela [...] "finds it quite amusing" [...] that the Winchesters use their knowledge of the supernatural to help people. On this aspect, Gamble added, [...] "I always suspect when someone is that blasé that there's something underneath, and we're finally getting into that".|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E
500|$|The album debuted on the Billboard 200 {{at number}} 144. Geffen shipped {{about half of}} the initial US {{pressing}} to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song's video had received a world premiere on MTV's late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified Gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, [...] "Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was kind of neat. But I don't give a <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> some kind of achievement like that. It's cool—I guess." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{reports a}} 58% {{approval}} rating, based on 12 reviews. The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Go to Hell" [...] presents {{a microcosm of}} Coven's flaws with a crowded episode whose messy narrative crowds out an effective surprise for a leading character." [...] Matt Fowler from IGN gave the episode a rating of 7.9, adding that, [...] ""Go to Hell" [...] was a more focused episode, {{with a lot of}} driving action. It sounded off a few sour notes here and there, but in the end parts of it felt like a season finale." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode a D+, stating, [...] ""Go to Hell" [...] kills off Coven older generation in its entirety, turning things over to the next generation, and I could not give two <b>shits</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] He added, [...] "By far the worst thing any TV show can be is boring, and that goes doubly for a Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk show. But in [...] "Go to Hell", even the outrageous stuff feels rote." ...|$|R

500|$|The Marsh {{family is}} {{spending}} Stan's ninth birthday {{at a public}} aquarium in Denver. As the Marshes enjoy interacting with the trained bottlenose dolphins, Japanese armed with spears suddenly storm the dolphinarium and kill all the dolphins. The Japanese perform similar attacks at several other aquariums, and at an NFL game, where they kill members of the Miami Dolphins football team. Stan asks his friends Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny to help him take on the cause of saving the dolphins and whales from the Japanese. Kyle declines, feeling they can't change Japan's views on the issue. Cartman and Kenny are {{much more interested in}} playing the video game Rock Band, professing they [...] "don't give two <b>shits</b> <b>about</b> stupid-ass whales". Eventually, Butters (who is also too busy) informs Stan about the television show Whale Wars, stating that they can take volunteers to help them. Seeing this as his chance, Stan takes Butters' advice and joins host Paul Watson and his crew aboard the Sea Shepherd, but is underwhelmed by their method of throwing [...] "stinky butter" [...] at Japanese whalers in an effort to deter them. After the Japanese whalers kill Watson with a harpoon, Stan destroys their ship by igniting their fuel barrels with a flare gun. Stan becomes the new captain and leads a more successful campaign in impeding the Japanese whaling effort by employing more aggressive methods. The crew ends up getting interviewed by Larry King, who describes Paul Watson as an [...] "incompetent media whore" [...] and questions Stan on his intentions of increasing ratings with violence. Stan dismisses the charge and contends he is only interested in saving the whales, not ratings.|$|R
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the album, Madonna was {{dismissed}} by some critics. They called her voice sounding as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium", while the other detractors suggested that she was [...] "almost entirely helium, a gas-filled, lighter-than-air creation of MTV and other sinister media packagers." [...] Madonna said: [...] "From the very beginning of my career, people have been writing <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> me and saying, 'She's a one-hit wonder, she'll disappear after a year'." [...] She responded to the comment [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium" [...] by doing a photoshoot with Alberto Tolot, where she flirted with a giant Mickey Mouse toy, putting its hand inside her dress and looking at it with an admonishing glare. Author Debbi Voller noted that [...] "such provocative imagery at a young age of her career, could have hurt her too much. But it went on to shut those twerps who dared to take a swag at her voice again." [...] Twenty-five years later, in her acceptance speech of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction, Madonna thanked the critics who snubbed her in the early years, [...] "The ones that said I was talentless, that I was chubby, that I couldn't sing, that I was a one-hit wonder. They pushed me to be better, and I am grateful for their resistance." ...|$|E
500|$|Kills was {{introduced}} to singing and dancing {{at the age of}} 3, and until she was 12, she studied in the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. Kills initially pursued an acting career, appearing in some TV series including All About Me and The Archers; however, in her hometown of Leeds, she developed an interest in hip hop music. She subsequently entered various rap battles, for which she started writing lyrics, and in 2003, Kills won a BBC Radio 1-sponsored [...] "MC Battle". From there on, she began writing songs for artists and film soundtracks. Kills released her first single on 21 February 2005, titled [...] "Don't Play Nice", under the moniker Verbalicious and with label All Around the World; it peaked at number 11 on the UK Singles Chart. She was also recording for her debut studio album, then-scheduled for an Easter 2006 release. However, the label entered bankruptcy, causing her record deal to be dissolved and the album shelved. Kills continued to work in the music industry, mainly as a songwriter with the alias of Verbz. In 2007, she relocated to Los Angeles; the next year, she lent guest vocals to French artist M. Pokora's song [...] "They Talk <b>Shit</b> <b>About</b> Me", and changed her stage name to Natalia Cappuccini, under which she self-released an extended play (EP) titled Wommannequin.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} from The Slim Shady LP are written from the {{perspective}} of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish and over-the-top depictions of violence, which he refers to as [...] "made-up tales of trailer-park stuff". [...] The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: [...] "Why can't people see that records can be like movies? [...] The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen." [...] Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. [...] Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, [...] "I have a fairly salty relationship with women... But most of the time, when I'm saying <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'" [...] Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word [...] "nigga" [...] on the album, with the rapper noting, [...] "It's not in my vocabulary." [...] The Slim Shady LP begins with a [...] "Public Service Announcement" [...] introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. [...] Later in the album, a skit entitled [...] "Paul" [...] features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to [...] "tone down" [...] his lyrics.|$|E

5000|$|Eddie Vedder {{said about}} the song [...] "Daughter":"The child in that song {{obviously}} has a learning difficulty. And it's {{only in the last}} few years that they've actually been able to diagnose these learning disabilities that before were looked at as misbehavior, as just outright rebelliousness. But no one knew what it was. And these kids, because they seemed unable or reluctant to learn, they'd end up getting the shit beaten outta them. The song ends, you know, with this idea of the shades going down—so that the neighbors can't see what happens next. What hurts <b>about</b> <b>shit</b> like that is that it ends up defining people's lives. They have to live with that abuse for the rest of their lives. Good, creative people are just fucking destroyed." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to music and}} comedy on radio, the lads decided to expand their modes of expression now that they functioned as a movement — attempting {{to come up with}} a clothing style to associate with New Primitivism. The movement's unofficial look was thus born with a démodé style consisting of waist tight bell-bottom pants, plaid suit jackets, thin golden necklace worn above the shirt, and pointy shoes (the so-called špicoke) — similar to the 1970s leisure suit look — which the lads adopted from petty hoodlums and small-time smugglers seen around Baščaršija selling, though not wearing, clothing items such as Levi's 501 jeans that were either smuggled in from Italy or counterfeit locally in Yugoslavia. Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors especially embraced this throwback look, with young crowds soon showing up to their club gigs dressed this way. Meanwhile, Karajlić came up with the movement's unofficial creed: [...] "Tuđe hoćemo, svoje nemamo" [...] ("What's not ours, we want; because ours, we haven't got."), a parody on one of the often used political slogans of the communist period: [...] "Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo." [...] ("What's not ours, we don't want; ours, we won't give up on."). During summer 1983, after getting back from an out-of-town gig somewhere, we went to our favourite kafana Dedan at Baščaršija where our friend Đuro told us about a journalist from Start looking for us to do an interview. We were convinced Đuro's fucking with us, but he insisted, telling us the guy had already looked for us at TV Sarajevo (where of course no one ever heard of us), at Diskoton(where they were also clueless as to who we are), before finally resorting to asking about us from kafana to kafana and eventually ending up at Dedan, leaving a phone number with Đuro. This confirmed to us once more what we already picked up on during our out-of-town gigs — that people outside of the city are taking our braggadocios and bombastic proclamations in the youth print about being the 'kings of Sarajevo' quite literally and quite seriously. In reality we were complete unknowns. Media outlets in Sarajevo didn't give two <b>shits</b> <b>about</b> us, but we noticed that our embellished stories found a receptive audience in youth print media from other Yugoslav cities. They especially lapped up our tales of this 'great new movement in Sarajevo called New Primitivism'. Elvis J. Kurtović on the band's initial promotional strategy One of the very first activities on movement's behalf was writing an open letter to Sarajevo's own Goran Bregović, the best known and the most established rock musician in Yugoslavia, who was at the moment going through a well-documented creative and commercial crisis with his band Bijelo Dugme's latest studio effort getting poor reviews and selling underwhelmingly, not to mention constant reports of infighting and vocalist Željko Bebek's imminent departure. Dripping with jovial sarcasm and backhanded compliments, the new primitives' letter invited Bregović to join them, offering him a fresh start along with a creative reset.|$|R

Nas later described the title name as [...] "supreme ill. It's as ill as ill gets. That shit is a science of everything ill." [...] At {{the time of its}} recording, expectations in the hip hop scene were high for Illmatic. In a 1994 interview for The Source, which dubbed him [...] "the second coming", Nas spoke highly of the album, saying that [...] "this feels like a big project that's gonna affect the world [...] We in here on the down low [...] doing something for the world. That's how it feels, that's what it is.

[...] AZ recounted recording on the album, [...] "I got on Nas' album and did the 'Life's a Bitch' song, but even then I thought I was terrible on it, to be honest. But once people started hearing that and liking it, that's what built my confidence. I thought, 'OK, I can probably do this.' That record was everything. To be the only person featured on Illmatic when Nas {{is considered one of the}} top men in New York at that time, one of the freshest new artists, that was big."

About two weeks later, Nas was interviewed by Shaheem Reid of MTV News, where he criticised O'Reilly, calling him uncivilized and willing to go to extremes for publicity. Responding to O'Reilly, Nas, in an interview with MTV News, said: He doesn't understand the younger generation. He deals with the past. The people he represents are Republican, older, a generation {{that has nothing to do}} with the reality of what's happening now with my generation. ... He's not really on my radar. People like him are supposed to be taught and people like me are supposed to let niggas like him know. I don't take him serious. His <b>shit</b> is all <b>about</b> getting facts twisted or whatever.

5000|$|In 1984, the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) {{published}} a report titled Nunca Más (Never Again) with extensive research about instances of forced disappearance during the dictatorship. It {{started with a}} prologue which read: [...] "During the 1970s, Argentina was shaken by a terror that came both from the extreme right and from the extreme left." [...] For a new edition of the CONADEP report presented at the Buenos Aires Book Fair of 2006, the Human Rights Secretariat added a paragraph stating the following:"It is necessary to leave it clearly established ... that it is unacceptable to attempt to justify State terrorism {{as a sort of}} game of counteracting violences, as if it were possible to look for a justifying symmetry in the action of individuals faced with the Nation and the State's estrangement from their proper goals."Journalist Magdalena Ruiz Guiñazú, a former member of CONADEP, criticized the new prologue: [...] "It is a grave historical mistake to think that the report was an apology of the theory of the two demons." [...] Former President Alfonsín endorsed Ruiz Guiñazú's opinion and claimed that the addition of the prologue [...] "shows a dangerous tendency to re-invent history".
