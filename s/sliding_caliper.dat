5000|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} types of high performance brake systems on offer for the C4 S4. [...] All S4s' initially had 310 mm diameter by 25 mm thick, radially ventilated disc brakes up front, each with an ATE single-piston <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper</b> inside a 'UFO' styled bell-shaped disc. With the introduction of the V8 engine, a new front brake setup became standard; again the discs used radial ventilation, but these front discs were now sized at 314 mm by 30 mm - with a conventionally mounted Lucas-Girling caliper in an external position over the disc. US models had smaller 276 mm discs. The rear brakes, 269 mm by 20 mm and also radially ventilated - remained the same throughout C4 production; they used a Lucas-Girling single-piston <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper</b> with an integrated cable-actuated handbrake mechanism. A Bosch three-channel operation (four-channel sensing) Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with a mechanical load sensing valve for the rear brakes was standard throughout production.|$|E

50|$|The Lambretta TV125 Series 3 was {{the first}} modern two-wheeled {{production}} machine to be fitted with a disc brake.

In 1969 Honda released the world's first mass produced bike to have a disc brake. The CB750 had a hydraulically operated single piston <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper</b> with a solid front disc.|$|E
50|$|For 1969, ALL full sized Chrysler Corp {{vehicles}} {{returned to}} standard 15” wheels. This accommodated the growing share of cars equipped with front disc brakes, which were updated {{to a new}} simpler and less costly single piston <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper</b> design from the earlier 4-piston fixed caliper type. Once again, Chrysler sales literature listed power front disc brakes as standard equipment on Town and Country. But, once again, some left the factory with front drum brakes instead. Regardless of brake type, all T&Cs wore standard size 8.85x15 tires on 6.5”x15” heavy duty rims. Powertrain choices for Town and Country remained unchanged.|$|E

The front discs are sized at 345 mm in diameter by 30 mm thick, and are clamped by Continental Teves-ATE FNRG-60 single-piston <b>sliding</b> brake <b>calipers.</b> The rears are 300 mm by 22 mm, and again use single-piston <b>sliding</b> <b>calipers,</b> with an integrated cable-operated hand brake mechanism.

50|$|The {{braking system}} was also typical; the front brakes were disc brakes, using a solid iron disc and a single-piston <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper.</b> The rears were drum brakes (a {{technological}} backwards step from the 124, which used discs all round), utilising leading and trailing shoe design {{operated by a}} dual piston fixed slave cylinder. They were operated hydraulically, with a tandem master cylinder assisted by a vacuum servo using two separate circuits. A rear-mounted load sensing valve varied the bias of effort applied to the rear brakes, dependent on the load being carried (and also the pitch dynamics caused by braking effort and road levels). A centrally located floor mounted handbrake operated on the rear axle using bowden cables.|$|E
50|$|The {{front brake}} rotors of the RC45 were 310 mm in {{diameter}} and are actually the same rotors and hats as used on the NR750. A four piston two piece opposed piston caliper was used along with asbestos-free pads.

This caliper was used on many different Hondas including the RC45’s little brother, the NC35 RVF400. There is nothing special about the brakes other than they were adequate for the time; many have later installed Brembo brakes or if the budget doesn’t stretch that far, the excellent Nissin caliper used on the 954 Fireblade and SP-1 VTR1000 can be bolted straight up with a marked improvement in braking response and feel.|$|E

Usually a swelling is assessed by palpating the joint but a more objective, but still easy to use, method would be preferable. This study seeks to increase the knowledge in veterinary rehabilitation by validating four different measurement tools (three recognized and one novel) for the assessment of elbow joint swelling: palpation, tape measure (circumference and figure eight measurement), <b>slide</b> <b>caliper</b> (craniocaudal and mediolateral positioning) and tonometer. This was achieved by calculating the inter- and intra-rater reliability and correlating the results from the different measurements with each other. The methods with best inter- and intra-rater reliability as well as good correlation among themselves were shown to be <b>slide</b> <b>caliper</b> with craniocaudal positioning, circumference and figure eight.

40|$|Background: Recently, {{an expert}} group advised to measure carotid-femoral (cf) pulse wave {{velocity}} (PWV) {{on the right}} side of the body, and to use a <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper</b> when tape measure distance cannot be obtained in a straight line. The present study investigates the evidence for this advice by comparing the real travelled cf path lengths (RTPLs) at both body sides and comparing the straight distance (as can be obtained with a <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper)</b> with the tape measure distance. Methods: RTPLs were measured with MRI in 98 individuals (49 men, age 21 - 76 years). Path lengths from the aortic arch to the carotid (AA-CA) and femoral (AA-FA) sites were determined. RTPL was calculated as (AA-FA) - (AA-CA) and compared between both sides. RTPLs were compared with 80 % of the direct cf distance using a tape measure and the straight cf distance obtained from MRI images. Results: RTPL was slightly longer [11 mm (12), P < 0. 001] at the right side. The 80 %-rule overestimated RTPLs with 0. 5 % at the right and 2. 7 % at the left side. Straight MRI distance tended (P = 0. 09) to perform slightly better than tape measure distance. Conclusion: The travelled cf path is slightly longer at the right than at the left body side and the straight MRI distance tends to perform better than tape measure distance. The present study supports the advice of the expert consensus group to measure cf-PWV at the right body side using a <b>sliding</b> <b>caliper</b> when tape measure distance cannot be obtained in a straight line...|$|E

40|$|Thickness of {{the bark}} has serious {{influence}} on the round wood volume inside bark, if the diameter is measured over bark. The measured value of the bark thickness depends on measuring method. To analyse the possible bark thickness differences of spruce, given by different measuring methods and Peintinger´s bark thickness tables and to calculate the corresponding round wood volume differences, given by different bark thickness deduction compared with the Czech Standard is the principle goal of presented research. Three ways of bark thickness measuring were realized: by using bark gauge, increment hammer and <b>slide</b> <b>caliper.</b> Bark gauge gives the highest bark thickness values – 2, 2 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 3, 4 %. Measuring by this method is very carefully to the bark and it gives the real values of {{the thickness of the}} undamaged bark layer. It is close to the results of electronic diameter measuring. <b>Slide</b> <b>caliper</b> give the values 0, 9 mm higher compared with our standard, corresponding volume decrease is 1, 5 %. <b>Slide</b> <b>caliper</b> partly damages the surface layer of the bark. Increment hammer gives 0, 1 mm higher values of the bark thickness compared with our standard thanks to the destruction of the surface bark layer. Corresponding volume decrease can be approx. 0, 1 %. Peintinger’s bark thickness tables give 1, 3 mm higher spruce bark thickness, it means to 1, 9 % lower round wood volume. It means, Peintingers tables correspond better with the measured values than with the Czech Standard. We can recommend the using of Peintinger’s table for deduction of spruce bark thickness in electronic measuring of the round wood over bark and to use the bark gauge for test measuring.
