She threw three 'dynamite bombs' on the governor's coach; two did explode and <b>slightly</b> <b>injured</b> three <b>persons</b> in governor's entourage. Afterwards, she fled to Cracow in Austrian part of Poland, entered into fictional marriage with painter Adam Dobrodzicki and became citizen of Austria-Hungary. Austria refused to extradite her to Russia and instead arranged a trial in Wadowice, starting on 16 February 1908. Wanda Dobrodzicka had confessed but was acquitted.|$|R
40|$|In the {{national}} economic valuation of road accidents which the Swedish Road Administration uses, both {{the number of}} seriously and <b>slightly</b> <b>injured</b> <b>persons,</b> known to the police, is adjusted with the same nonresponse factor (expansion factor) of 2. 4. This applies regardless {{of the type of}} environment (rural or built-up area), road type and accident type/road user category. It therefore appears necessary to examine how reasonable this expansion factor is at present. In the project, a review has been made of how the reporting of road injuries to the police (police-STRADA) and to the hospitals (hospital-STRADA) differ with respect to degree of injury, accident type/road user category and type of environment. This was done with the help of accident data for 2003 - 2005 in some counties/ municipalities where, in principle, all accident & emergency hospitals were members of STRADA, an information system for data concerning accidents and injuries in the road transport sector. The study comprises a total of 55, 578 injury accidents (including "pedestrian-single"), reported by the police and/or an emergency hospital. If pedestrian-single accidents are excluded, there remain 46, 444 injury accidents. Of these, 11, 399 (24. 5 %) were reported only to the police and 24, 631 (53 %) only to a hospital, while 10, 414 (22. 4 %) were reported to both...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Traffic {{accidents}} {{are one of}} the leading epidemiological problems in developed countries as well as in developing ones. It is estimated that every day in the world 1308 person die in car accidents. Causes of traffic {{accidents are}} factors of road, vehicle and human factors, the latter one being the cause of more than 90 % car accidents, isolated or linked with other factors. Material and methods. Data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs - Department in Novi Sad were collected for the period 1992 - 2001 and analyzed. All road traffic accidents were divided into those with and without <b>injured</b> <b>persons.</b> All <b>injured</b> were divided in three categories: <b>slightly</b> <b>injured,</b> severely injured and killed. Categorisation was done by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (police). Results. Avarage number of road traffic accidents in AP Vojvodina is 13, 191, and 3502 with <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> per year. Avarage incidence is 174 accidents per 100, 000 population, and 301 injured per 100 000 population. Mortality rate is 30. 6 per 100 000 population. Number of killed in road traffic accidents per 10, 000 vehicles is 6. 91. Discussion. During the 1992 - 2001 period, morbidity and mortality rates of traffic accidents in AP Vojvodina were high. Participating of bicycle drivers, car passengers and pedestrians is higher than in developed countries. <b>Injured</b> <b>persons</b> are mostly 20 - 29 y. o., but rates of killed persons are the same in all age groups older than 19. Men are more in danger than women. Majority of accidents happen during the early autumn months, on Fridays and Saturdays, in early evening hours. Most <b>persons</b> have been <b>injured</b> or killed in city accidents,along Subotica-Belgrade highway. Conclusion. AP Vojvodina had the highest mortality rate of road traffic injuries per ten thousand vehicles in Europe - 6. 91. Effective preventive meausres are needed to decrease rates of road traffic accidents...|$|R

40|$|Background: Operative {{treatment}} of acromioclavicular (AC) joint dislocations Allman-Tossy III type is controversial. There {{are more than}} 30 types of operative treatments described. At the Department of Traumatology of Celje General and Teaching Hospital (CGTH) we operate the AC joint dislocation by the AC joint opened reduction and fixation using two Kirschner wires and additional figure of eight wire loop over the AC joint. The purpose of the analysis is to evaluate the results of acromioclavicular joint complete dislocation Allman-Tossy III type operative treatment. Patients and methods: In the 2 -year period from July 1 st 1997, to June 31 st, 1999, at the Department of Traumatology of CGTH we operatively treated 59 <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> with the AC joint dislocation. There were 55 men (93 %) and 4 women (7 %). The average age was 40 years (from 20 to 72 years). 56 (95 %) <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> had the AC joint injury of Allman-Tossy III type. In first three weeks (early reconstruction) we operated 45 <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> (76. 3 %). The applied material was removed after 8 weeks. 47 (79. 7 %) <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> were re-examined {{at least one year}} after the injury (27 months in average; 14 â 39 months). The results were evaluated according to University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) scale for the shoulder function evaluation. The impact of factors on a good treatment result was presented by the odds ratio and uni-variant analysis calculation. Results: Out of 47 <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> re-examined according to the UCLA scale at least one year after the injury there were 17 <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> (36. 2 %) rated with an excellent result (UCLA 34 â 35), 22 good (46. 8 %) (UCLA 28 â 33), 5 satisfactory (10. 6 %) (UCLA 21 â 27) and 3 bad (6. 4 %) (UCLA 0 â 20). In total we achieved 83 % of excellent and good results. The <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> age did not significantly affect the treatment result. Complications occurred in 14 (29. 8 %) injured patients. If no complications were occurred the odds ratio for good result was 6. 7. Â  39 % of the <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> were on the sick leave for more than 4 months. In the <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> with accident insurance we noticed a longer sick leave status (odds ratio 1. 25). The injury did not affect the <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> employment. The majority of the employed (92. 4 %) carried out the same work after treatment as before the injury. Conclusion: By the operative {{treatment of}} the AC joint dislocation a good or excellent result is achieved in the majority of the <b>injured</b> <b>persons</b> (83 % in total). </p...|$|R
