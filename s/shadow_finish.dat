Though he originally planned on including Szeth's flashbacks in the third book, he decided upon prewriting that Dalinar's flashback sequence was a better fit; he also abandoned the title Stones Unhallowed, {{which he had been}} considering for Szeth's book, due in part to its similarity to the projected title of the third book of Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller Chronicle series, The Doors of Stone.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The paper {{describes}} a Chinese shadow play animation {{system based on}} Kinect. Users, without any professional training, can personally manipulate the <b>shadow</b> characters to <b>finish</b> a <b>shadow</b> play performance by their body actions and get a shadow play video through giving the record command to our system if they want. In our system, Kinect is responsible for capturing human movement and voice commands data. Gesture recognition module is used to control the change of the shadow play scenes. After packaging the data from Kinect and the recognition result from gesture recognition module, VRPN transmits them to the server-side. At last, the server-side uses the information to control the motion of shadow characters and video recording. This system not only achieves human-computer interaction, but also realizes the interaction between people. It brings an entertaining experience to users and easy to operate for all ages. Even more important is that the application background of Chinese shadow play embodies {{the protection of the}} art of shadow play animation. Keywords—Gesture recognition, Kinect, shadow play animation...|$|R
40|$|As {{computers}} {{become increasingly}} integrated into our daily lives, ways of interacting with them must also become more natural. For example, large video walls are already common in public spaces, but while many {{are driven by}} digital video streams, all are passive and accommodate no natural mode of interaction. In order to make them responsive (like video kiosks) bare hand motions must be tracked atop large interactive surfaces. To this end, an inexpensive portable laser rangefinder prototype was developed by our group in 1998. This thesis tracks {{the development of a}} smaller, lighter, and more accessible scanning head better suited to practical application. In addition, two sets of baseband electronics were built. The first was based on previous designs, and altered to interface with the new scanning head. The second device was based around a much more compact single motherboard and used a new single-chip microcomputer with increased A/D resolution. With this system, hands are tracked by ranging from the planar-scanned laser. As a result, this technique suffers from occlusion with multiple hands (e. g. when two or more hands are aligned with the laser, the first hand is <b>shadowed).</b> This thesis <b>finishes</b> with a potential solution to this problem, showing a two-handed application to demonstrate a multi-handed workaround approach...|$|R
50|$|Mag {{is given}} a pendant by Faey, which had been left with her as a baby on Faey's doorstep. Using the small piece of {{charcoal}} that she finds inside, Mag begins to draw random shapes. The drawings are able to destroy various parts of Domina's body. Domina, enraged by what she considers Faey's betrayal, captures Ducon and Lydea along with Mag, bringing them to the secret room where she keeps her regenerative bed, the reason that she has lived so long. Faey leaves the underworld, and the stirrings of the incredibly powerful sorceress are the trigger for the manifestation of the Shadow City. While Ducon fights Domina, Lydea escapes with Kyel by running through a rift into the Shadow City shown to her by the same mysterious man seen earlier by Ducon. Ducon kills Domina, and then meets the man who looks like him - His father. From Ombria's reflection, years ago {{he fell in love}} with Royce's sister, and tarried with her long enough to get her with child. The <b>shadow</b> transition eventually <b>finishes,</b> and Ombria has changed. No one has memories of the previous Ombria but for Faey and Mag. Ducon is now Prince and Lydea his love, Kyel is his heir and Mag is Kyel's tutor. All is happy.|$|R
5000|$|... 1970 however was {{to start}} {{the demise of the}} Nordschleife for {{international}} motor racing. After the death of Piers Courage at the Dutch Grand Prix a few months previously, the Grand Prix Drivers' Association had a meeting at a hotel in London. Despite considerable pressure from outside parties they voted not to race at the notorious German circuit unless significant changes were made to the track safety conditions of the Nürburgring. Speeds of Formula One cars had increased dramatically as had the technology- the cars were lapping the 'Ring more than 2 minutes faster than they had in 1951, and it had become clear that the Nürburgring, which was essentially a rough, unprotected road that went through forests and valleys situated in an expansive mountain range, was too dangerous and outdated for Grand Prix racing. The changes demanded by the drivers were refused by the circuit owners and organizers and could not possibly be made in time for the 1970 event, forcing a hasty switch to the fast Hockenheimring, which had already been upgraded with safety features. The race itself proved to be an exciting one, as it was won by Austrian Jochen Rindt, resisting a charging Ickx in a Ferrari.1971 saw the race return to a modified Nürburgring. It was made smoother, straighter and was fitted with Armco barriers and run-off areas wherever possible. But with the layout being virtually the same as before, the circuit retained much of the character that led Stewart to call it [...] "The Green Hell." [...] It was less dangerous than it had been before, but the 'Ring was still by far the most technically challenging circuit on the F1 calendar. It was still dangerously rough and narrow in many areas, and even though some of the worst jumps and windy straights (particularly at Brunnchen and the Antonius Bridge) had been smoothed over or made straight, there were still some big jumps on the track, particularly at Flugplatz and Pflanzgarten. Also, there were still some parts of the track that did not have Armco, but more of this was added through the years. The first event on the rebuilt Nordschleife saw Stewart win from his teammate François Cevert. The 1972 event saw Jacky Ickx dominate in his Ferrari and Stewart crashed on the last lap after tangling with Swiss Clay Regazzoni. The 1973 race was dominated by Tyrrell teammates Stewart and Cevert; and it was to be the 27th and last victory of Stewart's illustrious career. 1974 saw New Zealander Howden Ganley crash heavily at Hatzenbach, seriously injuring the Kiwi. Ganley had already crashed heavily at the Nürburgring the year before and he decided to end his F1 career after his 1974 accident. The race saw Regazzoni win after Austrian Niki Lauda (who had crashed and had broken his wrist at the previous year's German Grand Prix) and South African Jody Scheckter tangled on the first lap; Lauda was out but Scheckter went on to finish second. Briton and multiple motorcycle world champion Mike Hailwood crashed heavily in a McLaren at Pflanzgarten and broke his leg, his auto racing career was effectively ended by this crash. 1975 saw Lauda become the only driver ever to lap the old Nürburgring in under seven minutes; the Austrian lapped the monstrous circuit in his Ferrari in 6 minutes, 58.6 seconds at an average speed of 122 mph (196 km/h), which was good enough for pole position. But like so many years gone by, the weekend saw yet another serious accident. Briton Ian Ashley crashed his Williams FW during practice at Pflanzgarten and he was seriously injured; he did not race in Formula One again for at least two years. Argentine Carlos Reutemann took victory after keeping the lead for five remaining laps while Lauda had a puncture after leading for the first nine laps. Briton Tom Pryce ran as high as second after starting 17th in an under-funded <b>Shadow,</b> but he <b>finished</b> fourth after very hot fuel began to leak into his cockpit. Frenchman Jacques Laffite and Lauda passed Pryce. Laffite finished second which was a milestone for Briton Frank Williams's struggling team; it was the English Williams's first real taste of success in Formula One. Pryce received a medal for his efforts. The 1975 Grand Prix was the fastest race ever run on the old Nürburgring; Lauda's teammate Clay Regazzoni posted the fastest lap at 7:06.4- which was to be the lap record of the old circuit.|$|R
