25|$|A CW {{complex is}} a type of topological space {{introduced}} by J. H. C. Whitehead {{to meet the needs of}} homotopy theory. This class of spaces is broader and has <b>some</b> <b>better</b> categorical properties than simplicial complexes, but still retains a combinatorial nature that allows for computation (often with a much smaller complex).|$|E
25|$|Better quality {{general purpose}} {{oscilloscopes}} include a calibration signal {{for setting up}} the compensation of test probes; this is (often) a 1kHz square-wave signal of a definite peak-to-peak voltage available at a test terminal on the front panel. <b>Some</b> <b>better</b> oscilloscopes also have a squared-off loop for checking and adjusting current probes.|$|E

25|$|Smaller much thinner plywoods {{and lower}} quality plywoods (see Average-quality plywood photo below and right) may only have their plies (layers) {{arranged}} {{at right angles}} to each other, though <b>some</b> <b>better</b> quality plywood products will by design have five plies in steps of 45 degrees (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees), giving strength in multiple axes.|$|E
25|$|Found on <b>some</b> <b>better</b> analog oscilloscopes, this varies {{the time}} (holdoff) {{during which the}} sweep circuit ignores triggers. It {{provides}} a stable display of some repetitive events in which some triggers would create confusing displays. It is usually set to minimum, because a longer time decreases the number of sweeps per second, resulting in a dimmer trace. See Holdoff {{for a more detailed}} description.|$|E
25|$|With {{triggered}} sweeps, {{the scope}} will blank the beam {{and start to}} reset the sweep circuit each time the beam reaches the extreme {{right side of the}} screen. For a period of time, called holdoff, (extendable by a front-panel control on <b>some</b> <b>better</b> oscilloscopes), the sweep circuit resets completely and ignores triggers. Once holdoff expires, the next trigger starts a sweep. The trigger event is usually the input waveform reaching some user-specified threshold voltage (trigger level) in the specified direction (going positive or going negative—trigger polarity).|$|E

500|$|The {{rectangular}} five bay barn is [...] {{long and}} [...] wide, {{although it was}} previously larger. The middle bay is slightly longer than the others because of the central porches. The barn is built of local Blue Lias stone with <b>some</b> <b>better</b> quality oolitic ashlar used for the quoins on the corners and the porches which provided cover for gfoods being loaded and unloaded at the doors. It is supported by two-stage buttresses reaching to {{three quarters of the}} height of the walls. Each of the side walls has ventilation slits, or breathers, with those in the end walls being {{in the shape of a}} cross pommee. The barn originally had an attached dovecote on the western end, and still has niches for birds inside the barn and on the east gable wall. The dovecote was adapted into a calf shed.|$|E
500|$|Professor David Nutt, former {{chair of}} the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in the UK has said, [...] "people are better off taking ecstasy or amphetamines than those [...] we know nothing about" [...] and [...] "Who knows what's in [...] when you buy it? We don't have a testing system. It could be very dangerous, we just don't know. These {{chemicals}} have never been put into animals, let alone humans." [...] Les King, {{a former member of}} the ACMD, has stated mephedrone appears to be less potent than amphetamine and ecstasy, but that any benefit associated with this could be negated by users taking larger amounts. He also told the BBC, [...] "all we can say is [...] is probably as harmful as ecstasy and amphetamines and wait until we have <b>some</b> <b>better</b> scientific evidence to support that." ...|$|E
500|$|The early novels {{published}} by Hamilton were of generally poor quality. Michael Ashley, a historian of sf, described the first issue, Lee Stanton's Mushroom Men of Mars as [...] "of abysmal quality", and the third, Roy Sheldon's Gold Men of Aureus as [...] "atrocious". However, Campbell contributed <b>some</b> <b>better</b> work, beginning with Phantom Moon, {{under the house}} name Roy Sheldon, which appeared in issue 6, dated 15 March 1951; his first novel under his own name was World in a Test Tube, which appeared in issue 8, dated 15 April 1951. He continued to write for the magazine after he became editor—his work {{has been described as}} [...] "enjoyable", though [...] "not especially sophisticated". Tubb was also a regular contributor, often under house names, which according to Landsborough were used by Hamilton to prevent authors gaining name recognition under a pseudonym and then taking that name to another publisher.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} {{story by}} Michael Halperin contained a different subplot involving {{a problem with}} the dilithium in the warp drive of the Enterprise. The diplomatic conference was added by D.C. Fontana when it was developed into a teleplay. Fontana had previously worked on , including the episode [...] "Journey to Babel". [...] "Lonely Among Us" [...] was subsequently compared to [...] "Journey to Babel", which Fontana denied, saying, [...] "I wrote 'Journey to Babel' and I wrote this too, and I feel there is a difference. There's a definite delineation and separation here, both in intent and content." [...] Director Cliff Bole did not recall much of the episode later, but did not think much of the script, saying [...] "The subject matter affects the end product. There's <b>some</b> <b>better</b> written shows, obviously." [...] It was the first episode of The Next Generation to be directed by Bole, who had previously worked on shows such as V and The Six Million Dollar Man.|$|E

2500|$|In 1873, Wilson and Griffin {{subdivided}} {{their land}} (with Griffin getting almost 2/3 of the property, but Wilson retaining <b>some</b> <b>better</b> land (east of current Fair Oaks Avenue), near his Lake Vineyard property). Griffin then sold 2,500 acres (10km²) of his property to the [...] "Indiana Colony," [...] represented by Daniel M. Berry. In 1876, after the Colony had sold {{most of its}} allotted land and established {{what would become the}} City of Pasadena, Wilson began subdividing and developing his adjacent landholdings which would become {{the eastern side of the}} new settlement.|$|E
2500|$|The best {{characterized}} birefringent {{materials are}} crystals. Due to their specific crystal structures their refractive indices are well defined. Depending on the symmetry of a crystal structure (as determined {{by one of}} the 32 possible crystallographic point groups), crystals in that group may be forced to be isotropic (not birefringent), to have uniaxial symmetry, or neither in which case it is a biaxial crystal. The crystal structures permitting uniaxial and biaxial birefringence are noted in the two tables, below, listing the two or three principal refractive indices (at wavelength [...] 590nm) of <b>some</b> <b>better</b> known crystals.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars, {{including}} Perdue, [...] {{have considered}} other meanings for [...] "le-ithiel" [...] and [...] "ukhal". Observing that [...] "it {{is highly unlikely}} that the two Hebrew terms refer to personal names" [...] (note that the names Agur and Jakeh are not seen anywhere else in the Bible or any other Israelite document), Perdue points out that <b>some</b> <b>better</b> translations for le-ithiel would be [...] "I am weary, O God"; or: [...] "I am not God". [...] "Ve-ukhal" [...] would complement it: [...] "How can I prevail/I am exhausted?". The highly non-standard Hebrew and the lack of parallel language elsewhere makes it difficult to settle on a particular shade of meaning.|$|E

2500|$|GameZone {{scored the}} game 7.5 out of 10, praising {{the story and}} the detail of the game's milieu; [...] "More {{impressive}} than the actual story {{is the way that}} it's told. Dark Falls creator Jonathan Boakes was able to convey a lot of information using very simple storytelling techniques that fit perfectly within the gloomy world of the game." [...] The game's sound design was also singled out for praise. Although they were critical of the obscurity of some of the puzzles, they concluded [...] "it can be clunky, slow and frustrating, but offers up <b>some</b> <b>better</b> storytelling than many games with a hundred times the development budget. Sure, its clichéd at times. But it's also genuinely creepy and compelling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Scalia concurred in {{the opinion}} of the Court, except for its {{discussion}} of the legislative history [...] the form the law took when it was a bill pending before Congress, and the statements various members of Congress made while it was pending. Justice Scalia believed that the text of the statute passed by Congress {{was the only thing that}} was important. [...] "The examination [...] does not uncover anything useful (i.e., anything that tempts us to alter the meaning we deduce from the text anyway), but that is the usual consequence of these inquiries (and a good thing, too)." [...] Ultimately, though, Justice Scalia found the effort futile. [...] "I can discern no reason for devoting 10 pages of today's opinion to legislative history, except to show that we have given this case close and careful consideration. We must find <b>some</b> <b>better</b> way of demonstrating our conscientiousness." ...|$|E
2500|$|A simple, {{inexpensive}} amplifier {{may have}} only two tone controls, a passive bass and treble control. In <b>some</b> <b>better</b> quality amps, one or more midrange controls are provided. On the most expensive amps, there may be shelving equalizers for bass and treble, a number of mid-range controls (e.g., low mid, mid and high mid), and a graphic equalizer or parametric equalizer. [...] The amplifier's master volume control restricts the amount of signal permitted through to the driver stage and the power amplifier. [...] When using a power attenuator with a tube amplifier, the master volume no longer acts as the master volume control. Instead, the power attenuator's attenuation control controls the power delivered to the speaker, and the amplifier's master volume control determines the amount of power-tube distortion. Power-supply based power reduction is controlled by a knob on the tube power amp, variously labeled [...] "wattage", [...] "power", [...] "scale", [...] "power scale", or [...] "power dampening".|$|E
