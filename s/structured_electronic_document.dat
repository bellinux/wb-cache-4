40|$|PixED (from Pixel to <b>Electronic</b> <b>Document)</b> {{is aimed}} at {{converting}} <b>document</b> images into <b>structured</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> which can be read by a machine for information retrieval. The approach {{is based on the}} combination of perception and symbol reading which are the two processes involved when humans detect the organisation of a document. "Pre-attentive reading" denotes the physical segmentation related to perceptual organisation. "Selective attention " means that symbol reading is limited to specific sequences of symbols or to pre-attentively selected locations. An OCR provides the primary structured description of the document. PixED improves the quality of this description, completes the physical segmentation and adds a logical description. A distributed software architecture and an incremental strategy are defined to enable the integration of perception and symbol reading. The approach is tested on a set of documents composed of several pages which are gathered from proceedings of scientific conferences. 1...|$|R

40|$|Introduction One of {{the most}} {{important}} tasks in every office is document management which includes the subtasks of creating, archiving, retrieving, dispatching, updating and processing documents. In the last decades and in many different ways, there have been attempts to automate these tasks with positive results. Technological advances allow these tasks to be fully automated through the use of computers and specialized software. Document management is considered as one of the principal applications of computers. Documents comprise 80 % of information that is today available in electronic form, in contrast to classic <b>structured</b> databases [1]. <b>Electronic</b> <b>documents</b> are no more a simple analogue of paper documents; they are more dynamic entities in multiple forms and media. They can include information related to their origin and executable code that undertakes their management, something which is not possible in any piece of paper. Documents become the focus of...|$|R

We study how high level database update languages can be used to update files, and show that such updates can be executed efficiently.

Furthermore, we show that unparsing combined with a previously developed query optimization technique provides an efficient update mechanism. 1 Introduction Database systems are concerned with structured data. Unfortunately, data is still often available in an unstructured manner (e. g., in files) even when it does have a strong internal <b>structure</b> (e. g., <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> or programs).

40|$|Most of the <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> {{available}} from todays {{huge number of}} electronic information sources have on implicit structure. In order to manipulate, exchange, and archive these documents, {{it is important to}} extract their logical structure and to make it explicitly available. Many researches have noted the importance of document logical structure recognition, yet we still lack an easy method for recognizing the implicit <b>structure</b> of <b>electronic</b> <b>documents.</b> The two most widely used methods are: recognizing structure by hand, or through structure recognition programs. Due to the large number of documents, the manual approach is tedious and error-prone although in principle it is very simple. Writing a complete recognition pro-gram is much more effective, but it requires significant intellectual effort. To combine the ad-vantages of both methods, this thesis presents an approach to automate the learning of recognition grammars from manually structured examples. The approach uses two techniques from the field of machine learning: Version space - to abstract from the concrete contents of the structured examples in order to recognize examples with different content, and grammatical inference - to generalize the syntactic structure of the structured examples in order to recognize examples with slightly deviating structure. These two techniques are embedded into an incremental structure learning system - MarkItUp! - which allows for a convenient refinement of a recognition grammar towards new examples with unanticipated structure. This dissertation presents the design, analysis, and implementation of MarkItUp!. The characteristics of MarkItUp! are as follows. (1) it supports a simple way for the user to obtain a suitable recognition grammar; (2) it uses incremental learning so that the recognition gram-mar can be efficiently modified using additional structured examples. Experimental results on combining the version-space method with a grammatical inference approach in the learning cycle are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Information and {{knowledge}} retrieval {{has been recognized}} as a key issue in engineering design. A great deal of design-related information used and generated within engineering companies is formally recorded in documents. These documents become more useful if they are structured in a consistent way {{so that they can}} be retrieved and their contents accessed more effectively. Achieving useful <b>structure</b> in <b>electronic</b> <b>documents</b> relies on embedding some sort of mark-up or coding that is computer-understandable. Manual mark-up is time-consuming and costly. This paper proposes a knowledge engineering approach to automatic document mark-up employing XML (the eXtensible Mark-up Language) to 'tag' explicitly the structural information. The focus here is on long and complex engineering documents. A three-level model is explored to achieve automatic semantic mark-up using a set of document decomposition schemes. The model includes a strategic level which identifies document typographical features based on such things as styles, inference or templates; a tactical level to define the rules to realize semantic mark-up according to the document features; and an operational level to perform the computational implementation of the mark-up rules. By making document structure explicit, information retrieval can be made more focused by returning not just whole documents but the document components that are most relevant or of most interest to the engineering designer, and information relevant to the designer's need both with respect to document structure and content, not content alone. In addition, interpretation of useful structure by the human user can be hardwired into documents, which allows us to move closer to true semantic level retrieval...|$|R

However {{the diversity of the}} Web information as well as the relared formats makes it vety difficult for users to efficiently search and obtain the information they require, The reason for the difficulty is because most of the information uploaded to the Web is unstructured or less structured. Many metadata models are proposed to response to this problem. These metadata models attempt to provide a certain kind of general description for the Web infimnation to improve its structuredness.
