5|$|Chief of Staff of the Russian 1st Army, Aleksey Yermolov, {{related in}} his memoirs that the Russian left was {{shifting}} position when the French Army arrived <b>sooner</b> than expected; thus the Battle of Shevardino became a delaying effort to shield the redeployment of the Russian left. The construction of the redoubt and its purpose is still disputed by historians to this day.|$|E
5|$|Even though Richard's {{statistics}} {{showed he}} bounced between Houston and the minors {{during his first}} four years with the Astros due to his wildness, he often told reporters that racism {{played a role in}} keeping him from becoming a regular with the big club <b>sooner.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to {{the later}} Chronicle of Polish Dukes by Gallus, the battle {{occurred}} by accident: When Bolesław decided {{to throw a}} feast to boost his army's morale, Yaroslav's archers and scouts decided to create trouble for the Polish servants who were gutting the animals and preparing them near the river. However, they only annoyed them enough that the servants themselves crossed the relatively shallow river and chased away Yaroslav's surprised troops, who had been guarding the river. Bolesław learned of the skirmish <b>sooner</b> than Yaroslav, and managed to move most of his army across the river, defeating the surprised Yaroslav.|$|E
5|$|Although double-hull {{design is}} {{superior}} in low energy casualties and prevents spillage in small casualties, in high energy casualties where both hulls are breached, oil can spill through the double-hull {{and into the}} sea and spills from a double-hull tanker can be significantly higher than designs like the mid-deck tanker, the Coulombi egg tanker and even a pre-MARPOL tanker, as the last one has a lower oil column and reaches hydrostatic balance <b>sooner.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{low number}} of subfossil finds, Hadropithecus {{is thought to have}} been rare, and it died out <b>sooner</b> than its sister taxon, Archaeolemur. Both {{disappeared}} shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, but being a large, specialized, terrestrial grazer, Hadropithecus would have faced more pressure from domestic livestock, introduced pigs, and spreading human populations than its more generalized cousin. The last known record was radiocarbon dated to around 444–772 CE.|$|E

5|$|Determined {{and with}} renewed hope, Twilight leads her best friends back to Ponyville, which Discord has altered in a chaotic manner: The day-night cycle is {{haphazard}} and buildings float off the ground. Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about the Elements of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains the Elements. She forces her best friends to wear the Elements, though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the <b>sooner</b> they defeat Discord, the <b>sooner</b> they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but the Elements fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop the elements and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E
5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief <b>sooner</b> than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Rachel {{reveal their}} {{marriage}} plans to New Directions, {{most of whom}} are less than enthused.

The ruse backfires, and the engaged pair announce that they will be getting married even <b>sooner</b> than planned.|$|E

5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which he treated with disdain. Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that <b>sooner</b> or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E
5|$|Glubb {{nevertheless}} {{knew that}} the Israeli army would <b>sooner</b> or later be stronger than his {{and that he had}} to prevent the strengthening of the Harel and Etzioni brigades to secure East Jerusalem. He redeployed his strength on 23 May to reinforce the blockade. The Iraqi army, at that time seconded by tanks, relieved the Legion units in northern Samaria and these were redeployed towards the Jerusalem sector. The 2nd Regiment of the Legion moved to Latrun. A full Jordanian brigade was placed in the area.|$|E
5|$|In HIT, the {{platelet}} {{count in the}} blood falls below the normal range, a condition called thrombocytopenia. However, it is generally not low enough to lead to {{an increased risk of}} bleeding. Most people with HIT will therefore not experience any symptoms. Typically the {{platelet count}} will fall 5–14 days after heparin is first given; if someone has received heparin in the previous three months, the fall in platelet count may occur <b>sooner,</b> sometimes within a day.|$|E

25|$|The 2010 season {{turned out}} to be much more {{successful}} than the 2009 campaign. The <b>Sooners</b> ended the season with a record of 12-2 and became the Tostito's Fiesta Bowl champions by defeating Connecticut by a score of 48-20 in Glendale, Arizona. This was the first BCS bowl game victory for Bob Stoops and the <b>Sooners</b> since the 2003 Rose Bowl. Marquee victories for the <b>Sooners</b> in 2010 were against Florida State, Texas, Oklahoma State and Nebraska. The Bedlam match-up between the <b>Sooners</b> and Cowboys proved to be the decisive game in who would represent the Big 12 South in the conference championship game. The <b>Sooners</b> defeated the Cowboys in a high scoring affair 47-41. The <b>Sooners</b> {{went on to win the}} Big 12 Championship game 23-20, the final match between conference rival Nebraska. After the 2010 season, offensive coordinator Kevin Wilson left OU to become head coach at Indiana, becoming the fifth <b>Sooners</b> offensive coordinator under Bob Stoops to become a head coach and the sixth coordinator overall.|$|R
