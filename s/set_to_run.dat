5|$|Archie Comics, {{publisher}} of the main Sonic the Hedgehog comics, started a Sonic X series in 2005. It was originally <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> for only four issues, but was extended to 40 issues due to high demand. The last issue was released on January 1, 2009, and led into the first arc of the Sonic Universe series. The comics were written by Ian Flynn, who also authors the main comic series. Some issues were published in Jetix Magazine in the United Kingdom and Italy.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{requested the}} death penalty for all the convicts. Sentencing took place on 31 August: Kodani was given a 28-year prison term, and received two sentences; the first for 10 years under Indian Penal Code Section 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and the second for 18 years under Section 302 (murder) and others. Her sentences are <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> consecutively, making a total of 28 years. Bajrangi received life imprisonment.

5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if the gun is pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. The gun is attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E

25|$|Both {{premature}} explosion types could {{result from the}} magnetic influence exploder. If a torpedo was still turning to get on course or had not stabilized its depth when the warhead armed, the exploder could see a magnetic field change and detonate. As the warhead approached the target, it could sense a change due to the ship's effect on the earth's magnetic field. That's a desired effect if the torpedo is <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> under the ship, but not a desirable effect when the torpedo is set to hit {{the side of the}} ship.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} of Bumiputra-held economic equity has been frequently disputed, {{with a number}} of allegations from some quarters that the government intentionally underestimated the share of Bumiputra equity to justify the NEP and its related policies. Although many affirmative action measures of the NEP were continued under the National Development Policy which ran from 1990 to 2000, and later by the National Vision Policy <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from 2000 to 2010 – leading many Malaysians to refer to the NEP in the present tense – the official Bumiputra equity share remained less than the original 30% target.|$|E

25|$|The {{city was}} known for its rail history. Into the 1960s the Norfolk and Western and Southern Railway ran three trains a day toward New York City; the trains went to {{different}} destinations {{to the west and}} south: Memphis, Nashville, New Orleans. Roanoke has not had passenger rail service since 1979. In August 2013, it was announced that Amtrak service as part of their Northeast Regional would be extended from Lynchburg to Roanoke by 2017. Construction of a platform for this new service began in Fall 2016, with trains <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> from Roanoke in Fall 2017. In the meantime, a bus service, the Smart Way Connector, aligns with the Amtrak schedule to connect riders to the Kemper Street Station in Lynchburg. Roanoke would be a stop in the proposed Transdominion Express passenger rail system currently under study by the Commonwealth of Virginia.|$|E

500|$|According to Cartoon Network {{executive}} Linda Simensky, {{the first}} season did [...] "remarkably well" [...] in ratings ever since its premiere, {{becoming one of the}} top-rated series on the network and prompting Cartoon Network to quickly order a second season for a November 1999 premiere, making it one of four seasons which Ed, Edd n Eddy was <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run.</b> Antonucci stated that change in the characters from the first to the second season is [...] "very" [...] noticeable, due to the amount of development they've went through. Antonucci directed the season, and co-wrote the episodes with Jono Howard and Mike Kubat, although Robert Leighton was credited as a co-writer for [...] "To Sir with Ed".|$|E

500|$|The United States Congress legislated {{a highway}} {{proposal}} in 1991 known as I-73. Originally <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> along I-75 to Detroit, the definition was amended in 1995 {{to include a}} branch that would run along US223 and US127 to Grayling, then on a continuation along I-75 to Sault Ste. Marie. MDOT examined three options to build the freeway, but abandoned further study after June 12, 2001, diverting remaining funds to improvement of safety along the corridor. The department stated there was a [...] "lack of need" [...] for sections of the proposed freeway, and the project's website was taken offline in 2002. According to 2011 press reports, a group advocating {{on behalf of the}} freeway is working to revive the I-73 proposal in Michigan, but state and local governments continue to express disinterest in resurrecting the freeway.|$|E
500|$|Kim Collins, who has {{competed in}} every Games that Saint Kitts and Nevis has participated in, was <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> the 100 meter dash. Collins {{was not allowed}} to compete by his Olympic {{committee}} after they found out he stayed with his wife, outside of the Olympic village. Collins required to get permission to stay outside the village for multiple nights in a row, and the committee stated he violated team discipline rules. On the issue of not being allowed to compete, Collins said [...] "I feel that I should stay in a hotel with my wife, with or without their permission, that’s the honest to God truth whether they like it or not." [...] He planned to never race for the country again, stating, [...] "This is how it ends, it ends on a really sad note. I should have been allowed to run. I don’t see what is the big deal, I am a grown man, I’m just about to become a grandfather." [...] Collins would later compete in the 2016 Olympics under the same flag.|$|E
500|$|While {{previous}} Republican nominee {{candidates and}} fellow Long Island Congressmen Rick Lazio and Pete King had both indicated {{an interest in}} replacing Giuliani, upon Giuliani's withdrawal the state party quickly rallied around Lazio, who had more campaign funds and who {{was viewed as a}} potentially strong candidate. [...] In particular, Governor Pataki — who never cared much for Giuliani to begin with — was strongly in favor of Lazio, and praised him as [...] "fresh, unencumbered challenger" [...] to Clinton. [...] This also caused a shuffle in New York's unique third-party ballot-line alignments: the Liberal Party of New York, which was previously <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> Giuliani (whom they had supported in all three of his mayoral races), now switched to Clinton, while the Conservative Party of New York, which had previously been loath to endorse the socially liberal Giuliani (and was set to nominate former Westchester Congressman Joe DioGuardi) lined up behind Lazio. [...] Lazio accepted the unanimous approval of delegates to the Republican Party state convention at a hotel ballroom in Buffalo on May 30.|$|E

500|$|The first raids {{began to}} be {{launched}} at 7.32 am on 16 January. The day's operations were focused on Hong Kong, which was struck by 138 aircraft during the morning and a further 158 in the afternoon. The raiders sunk five large tankers and an IJN oiler, and damaged several other ships. In addition, Kai Tak Airport was badly damaged, and all the aircraft {{on the ground there}} at the time destroyed. Widespread damage was also inflicted on the Kowloon and Taikoo docks. However, the village of Hung Hom, which was located near the Kowloon docks, was heavily bombed and hundreds of civilians were killed or wounded. Stanley Internment Camp was also hit by a bomb which killed 14 of the Allied civilians imprisoned there. The Japanese garrison at Hong Kong strongly resisted the raid, using particularly effective anti-aircraft tactics which the Americans had not previously encountered; a US Navy report described the gunfire the aircraft faced as having been [...] "intense to unbelievable". The TBF Avenger torpedo bombers dispatched against Hong Kong suffered particularly heavy losses as their low-level attack runs were vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. As the Avengers' torpedoes were <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>run</b> too deep these attacks achieved little.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} set to {{continue}} 10 {{years after the first}} Mother. [...] The player-character, Flint, was a cowboy in the vein of Clint Eastwood with two boys, Lucca and Klaus (later becoming Lucas and Claus), and a dog, Boney. The game was to include over 10 playable characters and span 10 years in its story based around the Pig army, which attempts to use [...] "primitive machinery ... to enslave mankind". At the 1999 Space World, IGN sampled environments including a hovercraft in a desert canyon, a snake dungeon, a cutscene with a bullet train, a town with non-player characters, and a mine cart scene, through themes including fantasy, the medieval, and science fiction. Physical contact with an enemy in the overworld triggered a turn-based battle scene shown in the first-person (similar to EarthBound). The battles had psychedelic backgrounds and a circular menu that included a command to [...] "get up" [...] if the player was knocked down in a real-time sequence. Attacks could be timed with the in-game music for stronger effects. The developers also planned multiple routes for advancing through the game and unforeseen complications from minor actions, such as a monster finding food dropped in the forest. The game {{was set to}} include features such as synching the game's time with the real time, but those features would not have worked without the 64DD.
