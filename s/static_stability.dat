5|$|With unarticulated wheels, {{climbing}} obstacles {{will cause}} {{the body of a}} vehicle to tilt. If the vehicle's center of mass moves outside of the wheelbase or axle track, the vehicle will become statically unstable, and will tend to tip over. At speed, a vehicle can become dynamically unstable, meaning that it can be tipped over by an obstacle smaller than its <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> limit, or by excessive acceleration or tight turning. Without articulation, this can be an impossible position from which to recover.|$|E
25|$|Other {{differences}} include intake ramps for {{the engines}} and two extra wing hard points for payload (for {{a total of}} 11), retaining previous hardpoints on the bottom centerline, wingtips, and two conformal fuselage positions. Among the most significant aerodynamic changes are the enlarged leading edge extensions (LEX) which provide improved vortex lifting characteristics in high angle of attack maneuvers, and reduce the <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> margin to enhance pitching characteristics. This results in pitch rates in excess of 40 degrees per second, and high resistance to departure from controlled flight.|$|E
25|$|While {{snow and}} ice act to {{insulate}} the surface from large energy losses in winter, they also act to retard warming {{in the spring and}} summer because of the large amount of energy required to melt ice (the latent heat of fusion, 3.34 x 105 J/kg at 0°C). However, the strong <b>static</b> <b>stability</b> of the atmosphere over areas of extensive snow or ice tends to confine the immediate cooling effect to a relatively shallow layer, so that associated atmospheric anomalies are usually short-lived and local to regional in scale. In some areas of the world such as Eurasia, however, the cooling associated with a heavy snowpack and moist spring soils is known to play a role in modulating the summer monsoon circulation. Gutzler and Preston (1997) recently presented evidence for a similar snow-summer circulation feedback over the southwestern United States.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs to {{guarantee}} flight safety when system failures occur, modern fly-by-wire flight control systems for commercial aircraft incorporate reconfiguration control modes. While relaxed <b>static</b> <b>stabilities</b> (RSS) are utilized on most new designed fly-by-wire airliners, the flying qualities design {{become a major}} concern when reconfiguration flight control laws are developed. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze the reduction of flying qualities when reconfiguration laws are activated. Longitudinal and lateral-directional control laws, along with their alternative and direct modes, were developed for a commercial aircraft with relaxed longitudinal and directional <b>static</b> <b>stabilities.</b> Flying qualities assessment with reconfiguration laws were carried out based on the handling qualities rating method (HQRM), which has certification levels connected to military specifications such as MIL-STD- 1797 A. The analysis indicated that short period mode and Dutch roll mode are most affected in the downgrade of flight control law. It is suggested that qualities of these modes should be guaranteed as priority when reconfiguration laws are designed...|$|R

2500|$|In guided {{missiles}} {{where the}} fins {{can be moved}} to trim the vehicles in different angles of attack, the center of pressure {{is the center of}} pressure of the flow field at that angle of attack for the undeflected fin position. [...] This is the center of pressure of any small change in the angle of attack (as defined above). [...] Once again for positive <b>static</b> <b>stability,</b> this definition of center of pressure requires that the center of pressure be further from the nose than the center of gravity. [...] This ensures that any increased forces resulting from increased angle of attack results in increased restoring moment to drive the missile back to the trimmed position.

30|$|Static voltage instability, {{which usually}} {{has to be}} faced by {{transmission}} network operators, is now a nuisance also for the operators of ADNs due to the connections of DGs [14]. Significant research {{on the influence of}} DGs on <b>static</b> voltage <b>stability</b> of distribution network, the <b>static</b> voltage <b>stability</b> index and the methods to improve the <b>static</b> voltage <b>stability</b> of ADNs are being conducted as shown in [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The <b>static</b> voltage <b>stability</b> based on the load flow equation theory of distribution system is proposed in [15, 16], and the further improvement of voltage stability index (VSI) is discussed in [17]. A new VSI is developed in [18] for identifying the most sensitive bus to the voltage collapse in distribution network by using the catastrophe theory; In [19], a method that using the load apparent power to characterize the VSI has been discussed; whereas [20, 21] analyze the impact of distributed generations access on voltage stability index in distribution network; Furthermore, the optimal voltage stability-based distributed generation placement method have been proposed in [22, 23] to improve the voltage stability of the whole system.|$|R
