5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain pedal, a <b>swell</b> <b>pedal</b> for organ, a footswitch to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control pedal to modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of screw-in legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled drawbars for the Nord Stage, for users who prefer to use real drawbars instead of the buttons provided as standard.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} method of {{controlling}} the louvers is the balanced <b>swell</b> <b>pedal.</b> This device is usually placed above {{the centre of the}} pedalboard and is configured to rotate away from the organist from a near-vertical position (in which the shades are closed) to a near-horizontal position (in which the shades are open). An organ may also have a similar-looking crescendo pedal, found alongside any expression pedals. Pressing the crescendo pedal forward cumulatively activates the stops of the organ, starting with the softest and ending with the loudest; pressing it backwards reverses this process.|$|E
2500|$|Playing both {{acoustic}} {{and electric}} guitars (although more usually the latter), Bailey {{was able to}} extend the possibilities of the instrument in radical ways, obtaining a far wider array of sounds than are usually heard. He explored the full vocabulary of the instrument, producing timbres and tones ranging from the most delicate tinklings to fierce noise attacks. (The sounds he produced have been compared to those made by John Cage's prepared piano.) Typically, he played a conventional instrument, in standard tuning, but his use of amplification was often crucial. In the 1970s, for instance, his standard set-up involved two independently controlled amplifiers to give a stereo effect onstage, and he often would use the <b>swell</b> <b>pedal</b> to counteract the [...] "normal" [...] attack and decay of notes. He also made highly original use of feedback, a technique demonstrated on the album String Theory (Paratactile, 2000). Throughout both his commercial and improvising careers his principal [...] "working guitar" [...] was a 1963 Gibson ES 175 model, serial number 120592.|$|E

50|$|Some {{years after}} the rebuild {{it was thought that}} the Willis changes, though well-intentioned, detracted too much from the {{original}} concept, so it was decided to restore the instrument to the Lewis specifications. The Durham-based firm of Harrison and Harrison was engaged and the work was carried out in two stages. In 1986, the electrics were renewed and although the Willis console was retained, it was given a solid state action with eight memory levels for the combination pistons and four for the Crescendo pedal. Also, the Willis <b>swell</b> <b>pedals</b> were replaced by balanced pedals.|$|R
50|$|The C2's {{pipe organ}} emulation, unlike the {{electric}} organs, is generated using samples instead of physical modeling. It includes 21 stops, and provides an emulation of the <b>swell</b> <b>pedal</b> (which behaves differently from a Hammond organ) and tremulant. The sound engine was improved, providing additional click levels and emulations of other models of Leslie Speaker.|$|E
50|$|In popular music, the {{pedaling}} style may be {{more varied}} and idiosyncratic, in part because jazz or pop organists may be self-taught. As well, the pedaling styles may differ due {{to the design of}} electromechanical organs and spinet organs, many of which have shorter pedalboards that are designed to be played primarily with the left foot, so that the right foot can control a volume (<b>swell)</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{the piece}} {{will work on}} a {{standard}} pipe organ, it sounds much better on a reed organ (either a European harmonium or an American pump organ), as {{the rise and fall}} of the air pressure from the player's working the treadles meshes with the music. The constant pressure of a pipe organ makes it sound rather dull, although a skilled player may approximate the effect by a judicious use of the <b>swell</b> <b>pedal.</b>|$|E
50|$|The organ {{comprises}} four manuals and pedals. It {{is designed}} particularly to play from {{its position on}} the Quire screen to both East and West sides of the Cathedral. The Swell is situated in {{the centre of the}} case at console level and is controlled by two <b>swell</b> <b>pedals,</b> one for each side of the case. Directly above the Swell is the Great organ which is split into East and West divisions; it comprises two separate principal choruses. The fourth manual is a West Positive, mirroring the function of the Choir organ for the West side of the Cathedral.|$|R

5000|$|The present organ at St Mary's {{church is}} located in the south chancel and was built in 1880 by Martin & Coate of Oxford. The organ has 16 stops, with pipes of spotted metal (an alloy of lead and tin):The organ has four {{couplers}} [...] - [...] <b>swell</b> to <b>pedal,</b> <b>swell</b> to great, swell octave to great, and great to pedal. The wind system uses a Discus electric blower. The pedal keyboard is laid out in a concave-parallel design.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the centenary the organ was in a poor state, {{especially}} the old tracker action and in 1965 the firm of J. W. Walker (London) rebuilt the instrument at the huge cost of £4409. The work included new tracker action to the manuals (except lowest octave on the Swell which was electro-pneumatic), electro-pneumatic action to the pedals, new console, balanced <b>Swell</b> <b>pedal,</b> extended Pedal stops, new Open Diapason on the Swell and new Thumb and Toe pistons.|$|E

50|$|Ladegast {{was born}} in Hochhermsdorf (now Hermsdorf), Saxony, to a {{carpenter}} and cabinet-maker. He worked first for his brother Christlieb, an organ builder at Geringswalde, and built his first two organs {{at the age of}} twenty. He then traveled as a journeyman to various workshops, including those of Johann Gottlob Mende in Leipzig, Urban Kreutzbach in Borna, Adolf Zuberbier in Dessau, Martin Wetzel in Strasbourg, and Aristide Cavaillé-Coll in Paris. His work with Cavaillé-Coll was especially influential on his own designs; the two developed a friendship, and Ladegast introduced many technical innovations learned from Cavaillé-Coll's workshop to Germany, such as <b>swell</b> <b>pedals</b> and Barker levers.|$|R
2500|$|The Abbey has a fine organ, {{built in}} 1911 by William Hill and Son. It was {{designed}} to be on the scale of a cathedral organ, but lack of funds meant the original scheme was never completed. Some stops were subsequently added but, today it is still incomplete. The quality of the Hill organ and the richness of its Edwardian tone still shine through after 100 years of service, and the organ is a wonderful and fitting complement to the beauty of this ancient Abbey church. The console is also in original condition and is unusual for the right side positioning of the <b>swell</b> <b>pedals,</b> and for the sight of stop stubs (7) for the [...] "missing" [...] ranks.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} {{treasure of}} this organ however is its action. For the <b>Swell,</b> Choir and <b>Pedals</b> traditional Tracker action is used, however, the Great uses a Barker lever pnumatics system.|$|R
50|$|Apart from routine maintenance, the {{instrument}} remained untouched until 1952, when Henry Willis & Sons undertook a major rebuild, {{during which the}} wind pressures were increased. The balanced <b>Swell</b> <b>pedal</b> and the hitch-down Solo pedal were replaced by Willis's Infinite Speed and Gradation pedals. The Choir organ - which had been housed {{in front of the}} Swell - was relocated to the north side and a new console was installed adjacent to it (the original console was on the south side). The Choir organ's Flauto Traverso was replaced by a Nazard, and a Tierce was provided on a new slider. A number of new couplers were also provided and the Violon unit (32'-16'-8') was extended by 12 pipes to create a Viola 4'.|$|E
5000|$|Thalben-Ball was {{throughout}} his life an unashamed virtuoso, whether as pianist, as organist, or as choirmaster. His style of performance (like that of his younger contemporary Virgil Fox in the USA) was rooted in the 19th century, and made full use of every facility of the modern organ. Even when he was playing baroque repertoire, there would be many registration changes, ample <b>swell</b> <b>pedal</b> and dramatic contrasts in volume. He could sight-read, transpose and improvise in any style and at any length to the highest standard without perceptible effort. [...] Long after many organists had taken up the habit of hiring a deputy for choir-training purposes, he retained full control of his choir, without any assistant organist or voice coach.|$|E
50|$|The {{balanced}} <b>swell</b> <b>pedal</b> (as pictured above) {{was developed}} {{in the late nineteenth century}} so that the opening of the box could be fixed at any degree (not just the two or three options of the ratchet swell). This pedal is fitted above the center of the pedalboard. It usually rotates towards and away from the organist through a distance of about 90° from an almost vertical position ("shut") to a near horizontal position ("open"). Because the pedal is balanced, the organist does not need to hold it in position, and it will balance at any point in its travel. In addition, this location for most expression pedals, above the center of the pedalboard, is much more convenient for use by both feet if necessary (although it is usually operated with the right foot).|$|E
50|$|The {{opportunity}} {{was taken}} to replace the old choir organ with an entirely new organ which includes great, <b>swell</b> and <b>pedal</b> divisions playable from a completely revised, detached all-electric four-manual console. These divisions can be combined with the main organ in the north transept gallery. The new section not only provides accompaniment for the church choir but {{can be used as}} a separate instrument for services held in the chancel.|$|R
50|$|The Compton organ is a three manual {{instrument}} with {{a unique}} 150 stop tab layout which was designed for the Plaza and her sister cinema by Norman Cocker the resident organist from Manchester Cathedral and Arthur Ward {{one of the original}} Directors of the Stockport Plaza. It has in addition 42 toe and thumb pistons. There are 11 ranks of pipes situated in 2 chambers, one over the other {{to the right of the}} stage. These are concealed behind the decorative grill in the wall. There is no electric amplification, as the sound is produced acoustically straight from the organ pipes. The console is on a lift so that it can rise out of the floor, adding to the theatrical effect.As there is no amplification the organist controls the volume using <b>swell</b> <b>pedals</b> that operate shutters in the grill. It was played before shows, and during silent movies, variety acts and musical interludes between films. The organ can supply a large range of effects from sleigh bells to aircraft and sea sounds.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} a large three manual pipe organ which dates from 1841 by the organ builder William Hill. It has {{undergone}} several restorations by Hill, Norman and Beard, and Nicholson and now has two separate sections. The Great and <b>Swell</b> 1 and <b>Pedal</b> 1 divisions are high {{on the wall above}} the arch into the tower crossing and face West. The Choir and <b>Swell</b> 2 and <b>Pedal</b> 2 divisions are at ground level between the St Peter Chapel and the south aisle. A specification of the organ {{can be found on the}} National Pipe Organ Register. The organ case was designed by George Frederick Bodley and Thomas Garner.|$|R
5000|$|The organ's main console is {{the biggest}} in the world. It has 1,235 stop tabs {{controlling}} 587 flue stops, 265 reed stops, 35 melodic percussions, 46 non-melodic percussions, 164 couplers, 18 tremolos, 120 <b>swell</b> <b>pedal</b> selectors for the 6 swell pedals controlling 15 swell boxes, and a stop crescendo pedal. The console is also {{the only one in}} the world with 7 manuals. The lowest two (Choir and Great) have a range of seven octaves, and the next lowest (Swell) has a range of six octaves, while the rest have a normal five octave range. [...] The bottom five keys on the Swell manual (GGG to BBB,) are in place mainly for cosmetic reasons, as there are no pipes, in most ranks, for those notes. The manuals from top to bottom are: ...|$|E
50|$|Beginning in {{the nineteenth}} century, it became common for one or more {{divisions}} of pipes in a pipe organ to be enclosed in a wooden box, at least one side of which would consist of palettes that open and close {{in a manner similar}} to a Venetian blind. A mechanical (later electrical) mechanism connected the box to a pedal that the organist would use to open and close the shutters, adjusting the perceived loudness of the sound. When the box is shut (or closed), less sound is released into the venue. In American and British organs, the enclosed division is usually named the Swell, and the box surrounding the pipes is usually referred to as the swell box. Thus, the expression pedal is sometimes known as the <b>swell</b> <b>pedal</b> or swell shoe. Larger organs may have two or more expression pedals, allowing the volume of different divisions to be individually controlled.|$|E

50|$|During the 1980s, the Schantz Organ Company of Orrville, Ohio was {{contracted}} {{to build a}} new instrument of 27 ranks and 1,649 pipes. Fifteen ranks of pipes were completely new (essentially the Great and Choir divisions), while some pipes and materials were carried over from the 1964 instrument. The organ is split in chambers {{on either side of the}} chancel, with the Great and Choir on the left, and the <b>Swell</b> and <b>Pedal</b> on the right.|$|R
50|$|The Chapel is {{equipped}} with a sound system, a new Yamaha grand piano and 2 pipe organs. The Ridley Pipe Organ is a Casavant Freres Opus 1099. It had a second manual keyboard added later in its life. The pipes for this added organ are located {{at the back of the}} Chapel, while the original four sets (great, choir, <b>swell</b> and <b>pedal)</b> are at the front. The Lower School chapel service includes at least one musical performance each Friday.|$|R
2500|$|The {{first pipe}} organ, {{installed}} {{shortly after the}} cathedral was built, came from France and had one manual and a pedal clavier. [...] The second organ, installed in 1885, was built in England as the gift of parishioner Godfrey Rhodes, featuring great, <b>swell</b> and <b>pedal</b> organs. [...] The large statue of Saint Cecilia, patroness of sacred music, {{was placed on the}} casing in front of the organ in 1906. [...] Because of wear, the Vicariate decided to move the 1885 instrument next door to the Columbus Welfare Building for use during choir rehearsal. [...] A new instrument, the third and present one, consisting of great, <b>swell,</b> choir, and <b>pedal</b> organs was installed in the choir loft by organbuilder Alfred G. Tickner of the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Company of Boston. [...] This instrument was solemnly blessed on September 9, 1934, by Msgr. Stephen Alencastre, followed by a dedicatory recital by organist Don George, broadcast over radio station KGU in Honolulu.|$|R
