5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done <b>several</b> <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>week</b> in chronic kidney disease, is often required {{on a daily basis}} in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the rate of N mineralization from cowpea plant parts harvested at onset of flowering (5 weeks) and mid pod-fill (7 weeks) under near optimum conditions. Cowpeas were grown in a greenhouse and supplied with 15 NH,"NO, to isotopically label tissue. Cowpea leaves, stems, a n d roots were incorporated into a sandy soil (Psammentic Paleustalf) and net N mineralized was measured <b>several</b> <b>times</b> during <b>a</b> 10 <b>week</b> incubation. The amount of N accumulated in 7 -week old cowpeas was more than double that in 5 -week old cowpeas. The portion of N mineralized after 10 weeks was 24 % for 5 -week old cowpeas and 27 % for 7 -week old cowpeas. The rate of N mineralization from leaves and stems increased with plant age, but decreased for roots. The amount of N mineralized from 7 -week old cowpeas was more than double (235 %) that from 5 -week old cowpeas due to greater N accumulation and a more rapid rate of N mineralization of the more mature cowpeas. The greatest amount of N was released from leaves, which amounted to 74 and 65 % of total N mineralization from 5 - and 7 -week old cowpeas, respectively. The percentage of N mineralized by 10 weeks was linearly related to the tissue N concentration of the plant parts and to their C / N ratio. These relationships allow a quick estimation of the amount of N that would mineralize from cowpea residues incorporated into soil based on their N concentration or C / N ratio. ...|$|R
