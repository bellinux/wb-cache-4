5|$|In 1957 Briskin was {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} related to the control of MGM. As part of a battle between Joseph R. Vogel and Joseph Tomlinson, Briskin was brought in {{as a member of}} the Board of Directors of MGM, along with MGM's former production head, Louis B. Mayer, and also as a producer for the studio. However, the special board meeting which was held to appoint the two executives was held to be illegal by the Delaware Chancery Court, and the Mayer and Briskin appointments were overturned. The conflict continued on throughout the year, until MGM held a stockholders' meeting in October. During the meeting, the shareholders agreed to expand the board by adding ten new directors. Tomlinson's group was clearly routed, gaining only a <b>single</b> <b>seat</b> of the ten; that <b>single</b> <b>seat</b> was Briskin.|$|E
5|$|F-16C/D: The F-16C (<b>single</b> <b>seat)</b> and F-16D (two seat) {{variants}} entered {{production in}} 1984. The first C/D version was the Block 25 with improved cockpit avionics and radar which added all-weather capability with beyond-visual-range (BVR) AIM-7 and AIM-120 air-air missiles. Block 30/32, 40/42, and 50/52 were later C/D versions. The F-16C/D had a unit cost of US$18.8million (1998). Operational cost per flight hour {{has been estimated}} at $7,000 to $22,470 or $24,000, depending on calculation method.|$|E

5|$|The DLM won {{its first}} {{parliamentary}} seat in Lebanon's 2005 elections representing the Tripoli district. On 2 June 2005, amid election rounds, Samir Kassir, {{a founder of}} the movement, was assassinated in a car bombing. Less than one month later, George Hawi, a former secretary general of the Lebanese Communist Party and an ally of the DLM, was killed in a similar car bombing in Beirut. In the 2009 elections, the party again won a <b>single</b> <b>seat,</b> instead representing the West Bekaa district. It {{is a member of the}} March 14 Alliance parliamentary coalition.|$|E
5|$|Fisher wanted {{additional}} Commonwealth {{power in}} certain areas, {{such as the}} nationalisation of monopolies. A constitutional referendum was initiated in 1911 which aimed to increase the federal government's legislative powers over trade and commerce and over monopolies. Both questions were defeated, with around 61 per cent voting 'No'. The Fisher government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes. All six questions were defeated, with around 51 per cent voting 'No'. At the 1913 election, the Commonwealth Liberal Party, led by Joseph Cook, defeated the Labor Party by a <b>single</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
5|$|It contested the 2008 provincial {{election}} {{under the}} Wildrose Alliance banner, {{and was able}} to capture seven {{percent of the popular vote}} but failed to hold its <b>single</b> <b>seat</b> in the Legislative Assembly. Support for the party rose sharply in 2009 as voters grew increasingly frustrated with the Progressive Conservative (PC) government, resulting in a surprise win by outgoing leader Paul Hinman in an October by-election. In the fall of 2009 Danielle Smith was elected as leader and by December the Wildrose was leading provincial opinion polls ahead of both the governing PCs and the opposition Liberals. Wildrose's caucus grew to four members in 2010, after two former PC members of the Legislative Assembly defected in January and an independent MLA joined the party in June of that year.|$|E

These were supplemented by 35 two seat trainers, the Jaguar T2 (previously Jaguar B). The Jaguar S and B had a more comprehensive nav/attack system(consisting of a Ferranti/Marconi NAVWASS (NAVigation and Weapon Aiming Sub System) and a Plessey 10 Way Weapon Control System) than the A and E models used by the French Air Force. RAF Jaguars were used for rapid deployment and regional reinforcement, and others flew in the tactical nuclear strike role, carrying the WE.177 bomb.|$|E
5|$|The {{result was}} the 1981 {{dismissal}} of Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister and the resignation of Louisy. Louisy was succeeded not by Odlum, but by Winston Cenac, who himself resigned eight months later on 16 January 1982. Cenac was succeeded by Michael Pilgrim in an attempt by moderates in the Labour Party to avoid the possibility of Odlum leading the country. By this point Odlum had left the party, forming the Progressive Labour Party (PLP). Pilgrim's government also collapsed, necessitating an early general election in 1982 in which the Labour Party was left with only 3 of the 17 seats, returning the United Workers Party to government and seeing Odlum dismissed from Parliament. His Progressive Labour Party won only a <b>single</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Reid took office, Alberta was {{experiencing}} the Great Depression. Reid took measures to ease Albertans' suffering, but believed that inducing a full economic recovery {{was beyond the}} capacity of the provincial government. In this climate, Alberta voters were attracted to the economic theories of evangelical preacher William Aberhart, who advocated a version of social credit. Despite Reid's claims that Aberhart's proposals were economically and constitutionally unfeasible, Social Credit routed the UFA in the 1935 election; Reid's party did not retain a <b>single</b> <b>seat.</b> Reid lived forty-five years after his defeat, but these years were spent in obscurity; he never returned to political life.|$|E

5|$|In July 1997, violent clashes {{occurred}} between factional forces separately allied to FUNCINPEC and the CPP, leading to Ranariddh's ouster {{from his position}} as First Prime Minister. Ranariddh subsequently returned from exile in March 1998, and led the party to the 1998 general elections, which was won by CPP with FUNCINPEC as the first runner-up. Subsequently, FUNCINPEC joined CPP again, this time as a junior partner in a coalition government. Ranariddh was appointed as the President of the National Assembly, a post which he held until 2006 when he was ousted from FUNCINPEC by the party's former secretary-general Nhek Bun Chhay. At the same time, FUNCINPEC continued to see its share of voters and seats in the national assembly drop over the general elections of 2003, 2008 and 2013, with the party failing to win a <b>single</b> <b>seat</b> in the National Assembly at the 2013 general elections. In January 2015, Ranariddh returned to FUNCINPEC, and was re-appointed as the party's president.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of FN electoral success, the {{immigration}} debate, growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism, and the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, the 1989 affaire du foulard {{was the first major}} test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following the event, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began employing anti-immigration rhetoric. In {{the first round of the}} 1993 legislative elections the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a <b>single</b> <b>seat</b> due to the nature of the electoral system (if the election had used proportional representation, it would have won 64 seats). In the 1995 presidential election, Le Pen rose slightly to 15% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Increased support also materialised {{when the}} Bygdefolkets Krisehjelp, the Norwegian Farmers' Aid Association, sought {{financial}} aid from Nasjonal Samling, {{who in turn}} gained political influence and a useful existing network of well-trained party officers. Quisling's party never managed a grand anti-socialist coalition, however, {{in part because of}} competition from the Conservative Party for right-wing votes. Though Quisling remained unable to demonstrate any skill as an orator, his reputation for scandal nonetheless ensured that the electorate were aware of Nasjonal Samling's existence. As a result, the party showed only moderate success in the October elections, with 27,850 votes—approximately two per cent of the national vote, and about three and a half per cent of the vote in constituencies where it fielded candidates. This made it the fifth largest party in Norway, out-polling the Communists but not the Conservative, Labour, Liberal or Agrarian parties, and failing to secure a <b>single</b> <b>seat</b> in Parliament.|$|E

5|$|The FN {{was hurt}} in the snap 1988 {{legislative}} elections by the return two-ballot majority voting, by the limited campaign period, and by the departure of many notables. In the election the party retained its 9.8% support from the previous legislative election, but {{was reduced to a}} <b>single</b> <b>seat</b> in the National Assembly. Following some anti-Semitic comments made by Le Pen and the FN newspaper National Hebdo in the late 1980s, some valuable FN politicians left the party. Other quarrels soon also left the party without its remaining member of the National Assembly. In November 1988, general secretary Jean-Pierre Stirbois, who, together with his wife Marie-France, had been instrumental in the FN's early electoral successes, died in a car accident, leaving Bruno Mégret as the unrivalled de facto FN deputy leader. The FN only got 5% in the 1988 cantonal elections, while the RPR announced it would reject any alliance with the FN, now including at local level. In the 1989 European elections, the FN held on to its ten seats as it won 11.7% of the vote.|$|E
