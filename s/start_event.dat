500|$|The nordic {{combined}} events used both venues listed for cross country skiing and ski jumping. The test event for Nordic combined {{occurred during the}} weekend of 15–17 February 2008. Because {{of the lack of}} snow and warm weather prior to the test event, the schedule for the test event was adjusted to the sprint event on 15 February, the Gundersen event on 16 February, and the sprint qualification event on 17 February. The sprint event on 15 February was cancelled to changing winds. Meanwhile, the Gundersen event on 16 February was changed to a mass <b>start</b> <b>event</b> won by Norway's Petter Tande. Two unsuccessful attempts at the ski jumping part of the sprint qualification event to high winds on the 17th resulted in the event's cancellation.

5000|$|Interpolators {{are often}} used with a stable system clock. The <b>start</b> <b>event</b> is asynchronous, but the stop event is a {{following}} clock. [...] For convenience, imagine that the fast ramp rises exactly 1 volt during a 100 ns clock period. Assume the <b>start</b> <b>event</b> occurs at 67.3 ns after a clock pulse; the fast ramp integrator is triggered and starts rising. The asynchronous <b>start</b> <b>event</b> is also routed through a synchronizer that takes at least two clock pulses. By the next clock pulse, the ramp has risen to [...]327 V. By the second clock pulse, the ramp has risen to 1.327 V and the synchronizer reports the <b>start</b> <b>event</b> has been seen. The fast ramp is stopped and the slow ramp starts. The synchronizer output {{can be used to}} capture system time from a counter. After 1327 clocks, the slow ramp returns to its starting point, and interpolator knows that the event occurred 132.7 ns before the synchronizer reported.|$|E
