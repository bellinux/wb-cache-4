50|$|Recently, the pragma-dialectical {{theory of}} argumentation has {{incorporated}} insights from rhetoric into {{the analysis of}} argumentative discussion (Van Eemeren & Houtlosser, 2002; 2006). Parties involved in {{a difference of opinion}} “maneuver strategically” to <b>simultaneously</b> <b>realize</b> their dialectical and their rhetorical aims. In other words, the parties in an argumentative discussion attempt to be persuasive (have their standpoint accepted) while observing the critical standards for argumentative discourse. In each of the critical discussion stages there is a rhetorical goal that corresponds with the dialectical goal and interlocutors can make use of three analytical aspects to balance effectiveness and reasonableness: making an opportune selection from the topical potential available at the stage concerned, approaching the audience effectively, and carefully exploiting presentational means. These three aspects correspond with some focal points of rhetorical study - topics, audience adaptation and presentational devices - so that insights acquired in rhetoric are brought to bear in explaining how rhetorical and dialectical considerations play a part in the various ways of strategic maneuvering.|$|E
