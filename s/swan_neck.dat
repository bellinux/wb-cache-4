Then {{he closed the}} flask, and no organisms grew in it. In another experiment, when he opened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks, causing organisms to grow in some of them. The number of flasks in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms. Pasteur also used <b>swan</b> <b>neck</b> flasks containing a fermentable liquid. Air was allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. Nothing grew in the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. This showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.|$|E

[...] The Polish were {{rebuilding}} their Arabian breeding program following World War II, and wanted a stallion that would restore the Ibrahim sire line to their national studs. Ibrahim was a desert-bred stallion brought to Poland in 1907 by Count Joseph Potocki. [...] The horse was killed in 1917 during the Bolshevik Revolution, {{and by the end}} of World War II, the sire line had been lost to Poland. It was preserved via Ibrahim's son Skowronek, who had been exported to England in 1912, and Skowronek was the great-grandsire of Nabor. [...] In Poland, Nabor was first put to stud at the Albigowa State Stud, then in 1957 moved to the Michalow State Stud. [...] While in Poland, he was noted for his docile temperament, intelligence, soundness, and Saklawi-style Arabian beauty: [...] "dry, fine head with expressive eye, <b>swan</b> <b>neck</b> and milk-white hair unusual for his age ... he resembled the Arabian horses painted by Juliusz Kossak, the best painter of oriental horses." [...] In 1962, the Poles were also able to import his sire Negatiw.|$|E

The fingers may suffer from almost any deformity depending on which joints are most involved.

[...] "Z-thumb" [...] or [...] "Z-deformity" [...] consists of hyperextension of the interphalangeal joint, fixed flexion and subluxation of the metacarpophalangeal joint and gives a [...] "Z" [...] appearance to the thumb.

50|$|Swan With Two Necks: In the United Kingdom, swans have {{traditionally}} been {{the property of the}} reigning Monarch. However, in the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I granted the right to ownership of some swans to the Worshipful Company of Vintners. In {{order to be able to}} tell which Swan belonged to whom, it was decided that Vintners' swans should have their beaks marked with two notches, or nicks. In those days, 'neck' was another form of 'nick' and so the Vintners spotted that a <b>Swan</b> With Two <b>Necks</b> could afford them a rather clever pun, and a striking pub sign.|$|R
