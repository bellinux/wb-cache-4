25|$|In 1933, Dalí {{was photographed}} {{by his wife}} Gala Dalí {{with one of her}} {{slippers}} balanced on his head. In 1937 he sketched designs for a shoe hat for Schiaparelli, which she featured in her Fall-Winter 1937-38 collection. The hat, shaped like a woman's high heeled shoe, had the heel standing <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> the toe tilted over the wearer's forehead. This hat was worn by Gala Dalí, Schiaparelli herself, and by the Franco-American editor of the French Harper's Bazaar, heiress Daisy Fellowes, who was one of Schiaparelli's best clients.|$|E

25|$|Past the {{junction}} with NY238, which forks {{off to the}} southeast towards Attica, the highway begins going <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down into the creek valleys here at the northern fringe of the Allegheny Plateau. Passing lanes are sometimes available on the downhill sections, particularly in the next community to the east, Alexander, where another route to Attica, NY98 crosses via an overpass. This allows traffic to continue at a high speed through the surrounding dairy and sod farms up {{the other side and}} into Bethany, the next town, whose four four-way intersections offer no traffic control devices to slow down drivers.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of the century, paleontologists would be {{occupied}} with several controversies regarding ceratopsian paleobiology. One concerned the stance of the ceratopsid forelimbs. When Marsh first reconstructed the ceratopsid forelimb, he portrayed it in an erect posture. However, when later researchers like Sternberg and Osborn tried to mount the skeletons, they found that the forelimb bones apparently sprawled despite the hindlimbs standing <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down. Later researchers like Robert T. Bakker and Gregory S. Paul attempted to revive the erect reconstruction, but continuing research in the 1990s by researchers like John Ostrom, Peter Dodson, and James Farlow found an intermediate value to be better supported.|$|E
25|$|Gillnets {{existed in}} ancient times as archaeological {{evidence}} from the Middle East demonstrates. In North America, Native American fishermen used cedar canoes and natural fibre nets, e.g., made with nettles or the inner bark of cedar. They would attach stones {{to the bottom of}} the nets as weights, and pieces of wood to the top, to use as floats. This allowed the net to suspend <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down in the water. Each net would be suspended either from shore or between two boats. Native fishers in the Pacific Northwest, Canada, and Alaska still commonly use gillnets in their fisheries for salmon and steelhead.|$|E

25|$|Mirren says {{transforming}} {{herself into}} the Queen came almost naturally after the wig and glasses, since she shares a default facial expression—a slightly downturned mouth – with the monarch. She regularly reviewed film and video footage of Elizabeth and kept photographs in her trailer during production. She also undertook extensive voice coaching, faithfully reproducing the Queen's delivery of her televised speech to the world. Morgan has said that her performance was so convincing that, {{by the end of}} production, crew members who had been accustomed to slouching or relaxing when they addressed her were standing <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> respectfully folding their hands behind their backs. Mirren arranged to spend time off-camera with the supporting cast playing other members of the Royal Family, including James Cromwell, Alex Jennings and Sylvia Syms so they would be as comfortable with each other as a real family.|$|E
500|$|Many of the trail's present {{highlights}} {{were not}} part of the trail in 1937: Roan Mountain, North Carolina and Tennessee; the Mount Rogers high country, including Grayson Highlands, Virginia; the Pochuck Creek swamp, New Jersey; Nuclear Lake, New York; Thundering Falls, Vermont; and Saddleback Mountain, Maine. [...] Except for places where the Civilian Conservation Corps was brought in (mostly in Shenandoah National Park, the Great Smoky Mountains, and Maine), the original trail often climbed <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down mountains, creating rough hiking conditions and a treadway prone to severe erosion. The ATC's trail crews and volunteer trail-maintaining clubs have relocated or rehabilitated miles of trail since that time.|$|E
500|$|According to Anthony, Paul was [...] "a {{picture of}} {{professional}} efficiency", whereas John, {{one of the}} top Under-19 New South Wales cricketers, was the showman of the group. John's performances on-stage built The Cockroaches' reputation for being a party-band, even though alcohol and drug use was not part of their personal lifestyles. Paul, who returned to St Andrews as a teacher, noted about the band's early days, [...] "We had a good following around the unis, pubs and colleges. We had a reputation as a good live act". Anthony credited Paul and John for the band's reputation. [...] He described Paul as [...] "very serious, <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down and a really solid rock singer" [...] who was known for his jumps and acrobatics on stage, and John as carefree, charismatic, a talented pop music writer, and a natural leader of both the band and their audience. [...] Paul reported that the 1980s was an vibrant time for local music in Sydney, and that the group gained additional exposure by performing on TV shows like Simon Townsend and Hey, Hey it's Saturday. [...] Their success forced Paul to give up teaching to devote his energies on touring full-time.|$|E

500|$|The {{group was}} unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit visa because customs {{believed}} that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts. As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, [...] "The craziness was this: {{they were not the}} regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing what we do with them—that makes a world of difference". During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he [...] "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> out like a guided Patriot missile, right towards the disco ball high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and... came falling down... on top of some English kid's head....

Without the old {{restrictive}} corsets, flappers wore simple bust bodices to restrain their chest when dancing. They also wore new, softer and suppler corsets that reached to their hips, smoothing the whole frame, giving women a <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down appearance, {{as opposed to the}} old corsets which slenderized the waist and accented the hips and bust.|$|E

Some links in the network were as long as [...] Gradients of 10%–12% are known in ordinary terrain, 15%–20% in mountainous country. The Roman emphasis on constructing straight roads often resulted in steep slopes relatively impractical for most commercial traffic; over the years the Romans themselves realized this and built longer, but more manageable, alternatives to existing roads. Roman roads generally went <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down hills, rather than in a serpentine pattern.|$|E

2500|$|On January 12, 1920, {{a front-page}} story in The New York Times, [...] "Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon", {{reported}} a Smithsonian press release about a [...] "multiple-charge, high-efficiency rocket." [...] The chief application envisaged was [...] "the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the Earth's atmosphere", the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery, since [...] "the new rocket apparatus would go <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> come straight down." [...] But it also mentioned a proposal [...] "to [...] to the dark {{part of the new}} moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant flash powder which, in being ignited on impact, would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope. This would be the only way of proving that the rocket had really left the attraction of the earth, as the apparatus would never come back, once it had escaped that attraction." ...|$|E
