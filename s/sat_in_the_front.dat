Reagan hosted two 2008 Republican presidential debates at the Reagan Presidential Library, {{the first in}} May 2007 and the second in January 2008. While she {{did not participate in}} the discussions, she <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row and listened as the men vying to become the nation's 44th president claimed to be a rightful successor to her husband. Though some speculation arose as to whether Reagan might support New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in a presidential bid, nothing came of it. On March 25, she formally endorsed Senator John McCain, then the presumptive Republican party nominee for president, but McCain would go on to lose the election to Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|Everywhere Hitler went, he was {{accompanied}} by men of the FBK. They worked in three shifts, providing close protection of Hitler. Before a trip or important public event, the RSD checked the route, the buildings along it, and the places which Hitler was to visit. The local Gestapo office provided intelligence reports, along with information as to any assassination rumours, to the RSD. Orpo police officers were called in as necessary to help with security. As far as possible, the streets or approaches to a building were lined with uniformed SS men, with every third man facing the crowd. At the same time, plainclothes SS men or Kripo police officers mingled with the crowd of spectators. Hitler's motorcade was preceded by a pilot car. Hitler's car, usually an open Mercedes-Benz, followed 50metres behind. Hitler always stood or <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> seat, beside the driver, with a FBK member and an adjutant behind him. Following his car were two cars {{to the left and}} right, one {{with the rest of the}} FBK and the other with a detachment of RSD men. Then came the car of other Nazi chieftains and/or SS leaders; after a further 100-metre gap came the car or cars with any additional guests.|$|E
25|$|The lower wings were {{mounted on}} the top of a flat bottomed, single-stepped hull with flat sides which tapered in profile toward the rear. The wings were further braced to the hull by a pair of struts {{reaching}} back from the nose to the centre wing leading edge. The nose also had raised decking protecting of the pilot, who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the open cockpit with a passenger seat behind him.|$|E

25|$|The green room, {{where the}} artists rested after their performances, was altered from {{previous}} contests.

25|$|In 1919, Laue {{was called}} to the University of Berlin as ordinarius {{professor}} of theoretical physics, a position he held until 1943, when he was declared emeritus, with his consent and one year before the mandatory retirement age. At the university in 1919, other notables were Walther Nernst, Fritz Haber, and James Franck. Laue, {{as one of the}} organizers of the weekly Berlin Physics Colloquium, typically <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row with Nernst and Einstein, who would come over from the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik in Berlin-Dahlem, where he was the director. Among Laue’s notable students at the university were Leó Szilárd, Fritz London, Max Kohler, and Erna Weber. In 1921, he published the second volume of his book on relativity.|$|E
25|$|The 2 CV 4 × 4 2CV Sahara {{appeared}} in December 1960. This had an additional engine-transmission {{unit in the}} rear, mounted {{the other way around}} and driving the rear wheels. For the second engine there was a separate push-button starter and choke. With a gear stick between the front seats, both transmissions were operated simultaneously. For the two engines, there were separate petrol tanks under the front seats. The filler neck <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> doors. Both engines (and hence axles) could be operated independently. The spare wheel was mounted on the bonnet. The car had ample off-road capability, but at twice the price of the standard 2CV. 694 were produced until 1968 and one more in 1971. Many were used by the Swiss Post as a delivery vehicle. Today they are highly collectable.|$|E
500|$|Weinberg was {{subsequently}} appointed director in 1955. He often <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row at ORNL division information meetings {{and he would}} ask the first, often very penetrating, question after each scientific talk. For young scientists giving their first presentation, the experience could be frightening, {{but it was also}} exciting and stimulating. When asked how he found the time to attend every meeting, Weinberg replied jokingly, [...] "We didn't have a DOE in those days." ...|$|E
60|$|He <b>sat</b> again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> bench of <b>the</b> chapel.

5000|$|On May 11, 1951, Bradford {{saw that}} the bus driver had punched her ticket for the wrong price, {{apparently}} [...] "a costly and frequently recurring error if it was indeed an error". Bradford asked to be charged the correct price, and after being told twice {{to return to the}} back of the bus, she <b>sat</b> down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b>|$|R
500|$|Clark <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{in many of}} his classes, a {{position}} held by the highest performer in class. Clark participated heavily in debate, was consistently within the top 5% of his class as a whole (earning him a [...] "Distinguished Cadet" [...] patch on his uniform) and graduated as valedictorian of West Point. The valedictorian is first to choose which career field of the Army to serve in, and Clark selected armor. He met Gertrude Kingston, whom he later married, at a USO dance for midshipmen and West Point cadets.|$|E
500|$|Marchant first {{teamed up}} with Ian Browne {{at the start of}} 1956, just ten months {{before the start of the}} Melbourne Olympics. The older Browne {{selected}} Marchant because of the pure speed that Marchant had exhibited in the past year. They were a contrasting pair. Marchant was a short man of [...] and , while Browne stood at [...] and , unusually tall for a cyclist. For a final test run before the pair formally committed to racing together, the pair simply had a few tandem sprints around the track. Browne <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> seat, while Marchant sat in the rear seat. The pair went on to win the 2000m tandem event at the Australian Championships in 1956, but going into the Melbourne Olympics, nobody, themselves included, regarded them as realistic medal chances. However, their mentor, former champion Billy Guyatt convinced them that they had the potential to make progress at international level.|$|E
2500|$|Olga de Meyer {{attended}} the King's coronation in Westminster Abbey in 1902 when her presence {{was described as}} [...] "conspicuous". According to an article entitled [...] "Coronation of King Edward VII: Splendid Scene in Westminster Abbey", The New York Times, 10 August 1902, Olga <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row of the King's box along with several of his intimate friends, including Mary Cornwallis-West, Minnie Paget and the king's mistress Alice Keppel.|$|E

60|$|On {{the fifth}} day of her visit, Mr. Mott <b>sat</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> parlour. <b>The</b> window was closed, the door was closed, and Mr. Mott, sitting in an easy chair with his feet up, was aroused from a sound nap by the door opening to admit a young man, who, deserted by Mrs. Pett, stood bowing awkwardly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> doorway.|$|R
50|$|In 2007 he {{was again}} elected a Senator, with Juan Manuel Urtubey being elected {{governor}} of Salta.

2500|$|Traditionally, Thomas <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> row {{and asked}} the first {{question}} during White House press conferences. However, according to Thomas in a 2006 Daily Show interview, this ended because she no longer represented a wire service. During the Bush administration, Thomas {{was moved to the}} back row during press conferences; She was called upon at briefings on a daily basis but no longer ended Presidential news conferences saying, [...] "Thank you, Mr. President." [...] When asked why she was seated in the back row, she said, [...] "they didn't like me...I ask too mean questions." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{railroad}} {{became famous}} for its gravity cars, four-wheel coasters that {{took advantage of the}} steep, relentless grade, were first introduced in 1902. Gravity cars had an operator known as a gravityman who <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> right seat (on most cars) and operated two brake levers that pressed heavy duty brake shoes against the car's wheels. Gravitymen had strict orders to obey a 12 mile-per-hour speed limit as they glided down Mt. Tamalpais to either Muir Woods or into Mill Valley. [...] "Gravities" [...] ran at scheduled times, like all trains on the line, essential to safe operation on a single track railroad. Gravity cars were towed back to the summit by the steam engines, where they were stored in the yard for the next run.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{different}} wings {{known to have}} been fitted to the Parasol both had constant chord and very square tips. [...] They were of fabric covered wood construction. [...] The quite slender fuselage was a mixture of steel tubes and spruce, square sided aft of the cockpits and rounded forwards. [...] The supercharged 226hp (167kW) Armstrong Siddeley Lynx radial engine was smoothly cowled but with its cylinder heads exposed. [...] The observer <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> cockpit, allowing him direct access to the dynamometer. [...] This had a control wheel and dial for the force readings, plus a lever with which he could free, read or lock the instrument. [...] The pilot's cockpit, behind and with a view unobstructed by the wing had two unusual controls associated with the measurements. [...] He could engage a pair of dynamometer cams which limited its movement and that of the wings to the 6mm necessary for a force measurement in case of a dynamometer failure. [...] He also controlled an hydraulic brake which was used to stop the engine during measurements and avoid prop wash interference. [...] After a period of gliding flight, the engine could be restarted with a gas starter.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{mounted a}} pair of Allison V-1710-125 liquid-cooled V-12 engines behind the crew's cabin, each driving one of the twin propellers. Air intakes were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wing leading edge. The landing gear was tricycle and a full, four surface cruciform tail was fitted, whose ventral fin/rudder unit prevented the coaxial propellers from striking the ground. The pilot and co-pilot sat under twin bubble canopies, and <b>the</b> bombardier <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extreme <b>front</b> behind a plexiglass nose.|$|R
60|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{midst of}} this general hubbub, Dr Lumbey <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first-floor <b>front,</b> as before related, nursing the deposed baby, and talking to Mr Kenwigs. He was a stout bluff-looking gentleman, with no shirt-collar to speak of, and a beard that had been growing since {{yesterday}} morning; for Dr Lumbey was popular, and the neighbourhood was prolific; {{and there had been}} no less than three other knockers muffled, one after the other within the last forty-eight hours.|$|R
2500|$|On Thursday, April 30, 1998, around 3:00p.m., Jones {{parked his}} dark gray Toyota pickup truck on the {{transition}} loop from the Harbor Freeway to the Century Freeway in Los Angeles (...) [...] Jones <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> {{of his truck}} with his pet dog Gladdis, a seven-year-old Labrador-whippet mixed-breed. Jones began pointing a loaded shotgun at passing cars on the freeway, causing motorists to report him to the police. Jones himself then called 9-1-1, revealing he was emotionally distraught about HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations) and the circumstances surrounding his HIV. Jones {{said he was in}} pain due to mistreatment by the HMO in whose care he had been placed. As was confirmed later, aside from being HIV-positive, Jones also suffered from cancer. During the call, he fired off several rounds from his shotgun, with one of them going through the roof of his truck. Authorities then closed the two freeways, preventing anyone from approaching him. Jones remained in his truck the entire time, as police helicopters monitored his movements. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Special Weapons Team began to assemble and got into position around him. Jones then reached into a backpack he owned and took out clothing and a videotape. He then began throwing the items over the freeway wall. Afterwards, {{he got out of the}} truck and walked across the empty freeway.|$|E
2500|$|In 1869, Dr. Dio Lewis {{gave the}} lecture in Dover {{that he gave}} three years later in Hillsboro, Ohio, where it {{inspired}} the woman's temperance crusade {{and led to the}} organization of the W. C. T. U. In Dover, a committee of women was appointed, meetings held and saloons visited. Burlingame was a member of this committee, presided at the great mass meetings held, and was offered the leadership of the movement, which she declined. “In June, 1873,” said Burlingame, “Mrs. M. M. H. Hills came to my house and told me I had been elected president of the Free Baptist W.M.S., just organized at the New Hampshire Yearly Meeting. I at once decided that if president in name, I would be in fact. It had been the custom for women's societies in the denomination to ask a minister to preside, read reports and conduct all public business. I arranged at the first meeting after my election for the women to do their own work. I well remember the first time I presided at the Anniversaries in 1873 at Farmington, N. H." [...] The prominent men, Dr. O. B. Cheney, Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, who had formerly conducted the exercises for the women, <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> pew, ready to grasp the helm should anything go wrong. Ascending the steps to the platform, Burlingame was too abashed to stand behind the pulpit, so she stood beside it. Other officers sustained their parts well. At the close of the exercises Rev. Knowlton came and congratulated her and said, [...] "The brethren will have to look out for their laurels after this.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones then unfurled a large, square banner {{with white}} hand-lettering that read: [...] "HMO's {{are in it}} for the money!! Live free, love safe or die." [...] Jones had made the banner {{specifically}} for the occasion and displayed it for the news helicopters to see. As it was pretty windy on the interstate at the time, Jones weighted the banner down with a container to stop it blowing away. Jones continued to make obscene gestures and returned to his truck several times to pet his dog. This was all broadcast on live television by news helicopters recording the event live. As it was a Thursday afternoon, it was witnessed by many children, whose after-school cartoons had been interrupted in order to broadcast the incident. As authorities prepared to negotiate with him, Jones suddenly returned to his truck and <b>sat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> seat. Intending to take his own life, Jones ignited a Molotov cocktail inside his truck. The vehicle suddenly burst into flames and was set ablaze. Jones got out of the vehicle however and ran across the freeway as he was engulfed in flames and smoke, with his hair, pants and socks all on fire. Jones tried to pat out the flames, managing to peel off his pants, socks and underwear. He continued to wander about, naked from the waist, looking dazed and disoriented. He then walked {{to the edge of the}} freeway gesturing angrily. It appeared as if he was about to jump off the freeway, however, he changed his mind and backed away from the edge, before returning to his ablaze truck. Moments later, at around 3:50p.m., he retrieved his shotgun from the back of the truck and then walked back across the freeway. He placed the shotgun beneath his chin, pulled the trigger and committed suicide. He then fell to the ground with the cameras still rolling and playing the event live to viewers watching at home. Jones died at the age of forty, roughly two weeks after his birthday.|$|E

50|$|Also, a {{new type}} of contestants was introduced, the {{suffering}} contestants.

At the end of the auction, the suffering contestants would earn exactly the same prize the contestants earned, and they had {{to see some of the}} best prizes go unclaimed without being able to do anything about it.

25|$|During {{the colonial}} period, a European-style Christianity {{was at first}} {{promoted}} by the authorities. Native Congolese generally attended different churches or services from whites.
