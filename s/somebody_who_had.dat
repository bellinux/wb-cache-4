5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E

The name stuck and they went by Godsmack from then on. We were aware of the Alice in Chains song but didn't really think much about it." [...] In 1996, Tony Rombola and Joe D'Arco joined Godsmack as the guitarist and drummer, after Richards left upon learning he had a six-year-old child and Stewart left due to personal differences. In the same year, the band entered the studio for the first time, recording its first CD titled All Wound Up. The CD was recorded in just three days for $2,600.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2008, Kunis portrayed Mona Sax, an assassin, {{alongside}} Mark Wahlberg in {{the action}} film Max Payne, based on the video game of the same name. Kunis underwent training in guns, boxing, and martial arts for her role. Max Payne was relatively successful at the box office, grossing $85 million worldwide but was panned by critics, with several reviewers calling Kunis miscast. Travis Estvold of Boise Weekly wrote that she was [...] "horribly miscast {{as some sort of}} undersized, warble-voiced crime boss". Director John Moore defended his choice of Kunis saying, [...] "Mila just bowled us over..... She wasn't an obvious choice, but she just wears Mona so well. We needed someone who would not be just a fop or foil to Max; we needed <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> to be that character and convey her own agenda. I think Mila just knocked it out of the park." [...] She was nominated for another Teen Choice Award for her role in the film.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the script}} for Strange Days was {{completed}} in 1993, the lead characters were not secured in the cast list until May 1994. Originally, actor Andy Garcia was a potential candidate to star in the film, and Bono of the Irish rock band U2 was rumored to star as Faith's love interest Philo Gant. Ultimately, Academy Award nominees Ralph Fiennes, Angela Bassett, and Juliette Lewis were chosen as the leads. Fiennes' role in the Schindler's List impressed Bigelow enough to want to cast him as Nero, stating that the role [...] "required <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{a tremendous amount of}} intelligence, complexity, depth, a series of qualities that I really felt only Ralph could supply." [...] Cameron, however, felt that a [...] "glibber and slicker" [...] actor would be better for the role, but admitted that Fiennes made Lenny [...] "a sexier character—a guy you can care about very much." [...] In contrast, Bassett was already suggested by Cameron since the beginning. The fact that Lewis was able to sing was appreciated as the producers wanted to avoid lip-synching.|$|E
500|$|After days {{of media}} speculation, it was {{confirmed}} on September 6, 2007 that Spears {{would open the}} 2007 MTV Video Music Awards at the Pearl Theatre in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on September 9, 2007. It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organisers at the last minute. The performance began with Spears lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble". [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The performance was universally panned by critics. Jeff Leeds of The New York Times said that [...] "no one was prepared for Sunday night's fiasco, in which a listless Ms. Spears teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words in a wan attempt to lip-synch her new single". Vinay Menon of the Toronto Star commented Spears [...] "looked hopelessly dazed. She was wearing the expression of <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been deposited at the Palms Casino Resort by a tornado, one that promptly twisted away, taking her clothing and sense of purpose. [...] lumbering, in slow motion, as if somebody had poured cement into her streetwalker boots". David Willis of BBC stated her performance would [...] "go down in the history books as being one of the worst to grace the MTV Awards".|$|E

The day after the performance, American blogger Chris Crocker posted a video in YouTube titled [...] "Leave Britney alone!", in which he cried and defended Spears's performance, explaining {{that he did not want}} her to spiral out of control like Anna Nicole Smith, who had died in February 2007. Within the first 24 hours of its posting, the video accumulated over 2 million views. [...] "Leave Britney alone!" [...] turned Crocker into an internet celebrity, and was featured on television shows such as The View and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. It was also parodied by dozens of other YouTube users, most famously by actor Seth Green. An editor for YouTube said [...] "the melodramatic two-minute clip made Crocker an instant YouTube star" [...] and named it one of the top videos of 2007. Wired named it the top video of 2007.|$|E

2500|$|Wesley matures {{significantly}} {{over the}} course of both Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel; in his early appearances he was largely cowardly and incompetent. Alexis Denisof claims that his initial goal in playing the character was to be as annoying as possible for the other characters. He explains, I thought that an irritating version of Giles would be annoying for [...] and also for Buffy. Wesley's purpose was to come there and point the finger and get things shipshape. He's a by-the-book school teacher.

To Wesley that was a completely new and bizarre place. During this time, Denisof came up with a background story for Wesley regarding his father to explain [...] "why he was so repressed." [...] The writers used this story in the show, alluding to it in early Angel episodes such as [...] "I've Got You Under My Skin", and [...] "Belonging". While discussing Wesley's character development {{over the course}} of Angel, Denisof explains: [...] "I decided that Wesley was internally confronting his father and that released him a little bit and made him less repressed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unlike the andartes {{who were}} {{resisting}} Axis rule in Greece and were preferred a democratic decision-making progress with matters being settled by popular vote, the maquis bands {{tended to be}} dominated by a single charismatic leader, who was usually an older man who was not a réfractaire, a chef who was commonly a community leader; or somebody who before the war had been a junior political or military leader under the Third Republic; or <b>somebody</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been targeted by the Reich for political and/or racial reasons. Regardless if they had served in the military or not, the maquis chefs soon started calling themselves capitaines or colonels. The aspect of life in the maquis best remembered by veterans was the youthful idealism of those days, with most of the maquisards remembering how innocent they were, seeing their escape into the countryside as a grand romantic adventure which as Ousby observed [...] "they were nervously confronting new dangers they barely understood; they were proudly learning new techniques of survival and battle. These essential features stand out in accounts by maquisards even after innocence had quickly given way to experience, which made them regard danger and disciple as commonplace". The innocence of the maquisards was reflected in the choice of noms de guerre they took, which were usually whimsical and boyish names, unlike the noms de guerre used by the résistants in the older groups, which were always serious names. The maquis had {{little in the way of}} uniforms with the men wearing civilian clothing with a beret being the only common symbol of the maquis as a beret is sufficiently common in France not to stick out, but at the same time was uncommon enough to allow the beret to be the symbol of a maquisard. To support themselves, the maquis took to theft with bank robbery and stealing from the Chantiers de Jeunesse (the Vichy youth movement) being especially favored means of obtaining money and supplies. Albert Spencer, a Canadian airman shot down over France while on a mission to drop leaflets over France who ended up joining the maquis soon discovered the distinctive slang of the maquisards, learning that the leaflets he had been dropping over France were torche-culs (ass-wipes) in maquis slang. As the maquis started to grow, the Milice was deployed to the countryside to hunt them down and the first milicien was killed in April 1943. As neither the maquis or the milice had many guns, the casualties were fairly low at first and by October 1943 the Milice had suffered only ten dead as result of its clashes with the maquis. The SOE soon made contact with the maquis bands, but however the SOE were unable to convince Whitehall until early 1944 that supplying the Resistance should be a priority.|$|E
