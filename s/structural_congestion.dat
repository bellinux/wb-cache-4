40|$|We {{propose a}} network {{topology}} design approach that targets {{the reduction of}} <b>structural</b> <b>congestion</b> in a directed acyclic network. What we mean by <b>structural</b> <b>congestion</b> is that a node has much higher in-degree than out-degree in a directed network. We approach the issue using a network design game model. In this model we consider multiple sources and one destination. Each node is willing to connect to other nodes but it should pay the price of whole paths it uses to send traffic to the destination. The model yields a weight for each link. We show that if these weights are used to compute shortest paths, then a network topology is obtained with {{a low level of}} <b>structural</b> <b>congestion.</b> The proposed method has two phases. In Phase I, we solve a linear optimization problem in order to find the optimum link weights. In Phase II, each node optimizes its own individual objective function, which is based on the weights computed in Phase I. We show that there exists a Nash Equilibrium which is also the global optimum. In order to measure the penalty incurred by the selfish behavior of nodes, we use the concept called price of anarchy. Our results show that the price of anarchy is zero...|$|E
40|$|In Belgium, {{the advent}} of <b>structural</b> <b>congestion</b> appears to be {{accompanied}} with a turn in urban flight dynamics. Based on urban-economics theories, {{it is tempting to}} link both phenomena, since urban dwellers suffer less from congestion. However, when studying migration figures, a quite different explanation for the renewed population growth in the urban areas pops up. Both aspects are regularly addressed in the media, but the relationship between both is usually not recognized. This article makes a brief assessment of the interaction between the outlined phenomena, by adding an urban livability perspective...|$|E
40|$|Congestion {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} factors leading to patient dissatisfaction and doctor-patient conflicts in the medical market of China. In this study, we explore the causes and ef-fects of <b>structural</b> <b>congestion</b> in the Chinese medical market from an incentive structure perspec-tive. Our analysis reveals that prior medical system reforms with price regulation in China have induced hospitals to establish incentives for capital-intensive investments, while ignoring human capital, and have driven medical staff and patients to higher-level hospitals, reinforcing an incen-tive structure in which congestion in higher-level hospitals and idle resources in lower-level hos-pitals coexist. The existing incentive structure has led to cost increases and degradation of human capital and specific factor effects. Recent reforms to reduce congestion in the Chinese medical mar-ket were not effective. Most of them had no impact on and did not involve the existing distorted in-centive structure. Future reforms should consider rebalancing expectations for medical quality, free flow of human capital and price regulation reforms to rebuild a new incentive structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{of infrastructure}} systems by embedded sensors, computation, and communication networks has enabled significant advances in their management. Exam-ples include monitoring of <b>structural</b> health, traffic <b>congestion,</b> environmental hazards, and energy usage.

40|$|Capillary {{rarefaction}} {{occurs in}} many tissues {{in patients with}} essential hypertension and may contribute to an increased vascular resistance and impaired muscle metabolism. Rarefaction {{may be caused by}} a structural (anatomic) absence of capillaries, functional nonperfusion, or both. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the extent of structural versus functional capillary rarefaction in the skin of subjects with essential hypertension. We examined skin capillary density with video microscopy before and during maximization of the number or perfused capillaries by venous <b>congestion</b> (<b>structural</b> capillary number) and before and during postocclusive reactive hyperemia (capillary recruitment, which may have a structural and/or functional basis). The study group was composed or 26 patients with never-treated essential hypertension and 26 normotensive control subjects. In both groups, intermittently perfused capillaries in the resting state were an important functional reserve for recruitment during postocclusive hyperemia. Recruitment of perfused capillaries during postocclusive reactive hyperemia was decreased in the hypertensive subjects compared with normotensive control subjects (47. 9 +/- 6. 8 versus 55. 3 +/- 8. 2 capillaries/mm(2), respectively; P 6. 6 versus 57. 2 +/- 8. 6 capillaries/mm(2), respectively; P 7. 5 % versus 97. 2 +/- 2. 7 %, respectively; P 4. 6 capillaries/mm(2)) truly reflects the structural difference between the normotensive and hypertensive subjects, then, at most, 62 % (4. 6 / 7. 4 X 100 %) of the difference in capillary numbers during postocclusive hyperemia (approximate to 7. 4 capillaries/mm(2)) can be explained by structural defects, and at least 38 % can be explained by functional defects. In conclusion, in patients with essential hypertension, recruitment of perfused capillaries is impaired, which can be explained by both functional and structural rarefaction...|$|R
40|$|We {{initiate}} {{the study of}} congestion games with variable demands where the (variable) demand has to be assigned to exactly one subset of resources. The players' incentives to use higher demands are stimulated by non-decreasing and concave utility functions. The payoff for a player {{is defined as the}} difference between the utility of the demand and the associated cost on the used resources. Although this class of non-cooperative games captures many elements of real-world applications, it has not been studied in this generality, to our knowledge, in the past. We study the fundamental problem of the existence of pure Nash equilibria (PNE for short) in congestion games with variable demands. We call a set of cost functions C consistent if every congestion game with variable demands and cost functions in C possesses a PNE. We say that C is FIP consistent if every such game possesses the alpha-Finite Improvement Property for every alpha> 0. Our main results are structural characterizations of consistency and FIP consistency for twice continuously differentiable cost functions. Specifically, we show 1. C is consistent if and only if C contains either only affine functions or only homogeneously exponential functions (c(x) = a exp(p x)). 2. C is FIP consistent if and only if C contains only affine functions. Our results provide a complete characterization of consistency of cost functions revealing <b>structural</b> differences to <b>congestion</b> games with fixed demands (weighted congestion games), where in the latter even inhomogeneously exponential functions are FIP consistent. Finally, we study consistency and FIP consistency of cost functions in a slightly different class of games, where every player experiences the same cost on a resource (uniform cost model). We give a characterization of consistency and FIP consistency showing that only homogeneously exponential functions are consistent...|$|R
40|$|Preeclampsia (PE) is the commonest {{hypertensive}} disorder seen in pregnancy {{and is a}} significant cause for maternal mortality and morbidity world wide. Its impact on perinatal morbidity and mortality is difficult to measure. It is a well known fact that women who develop PE are at {{an increased risk of}} essential hypertension and other cardiovascular mortality like stroke and heart attacks. Recent literature has suggested that women who develop PE have increased markers of cardiovascular disease at the time of booking their pregnancy. We have previously demonstrated that reduction in capillary density after venous <b>congestion</b> (<b>Structural</b> capillary rarefaction) is an early marker for essential hypertension. We hypothesized that structural capillary rarefaction could be an early marker for PE. We aim to measure capillary density in primigravid Caucasian women with no other complications (low risk group) and in women with previous PE and Essential hypertension (high risk group). We measured fasting blood sugar, fasting insulin, fasting lipid profile at booking, VEGFR 2 (angiogenic), sFlt- 1 (antiangiogenic) and Endoglin (anti-angiogenic) factors along with their routine blood tests (11 - 16 weeks, 27 - 32 weeks, 34 - 38 weeks). Our objective was to find if capillary rarefaction existed before the onset of PE and if acted as a mediator of this syndrome, if so could it be used to predict PE either as a stand alone marker or in combination with other known predictive factors measured in this study. We recruited 326 subjects {{to participate in the study}} to measure capillary density at 11 - 16 weeks, 20 - 24 weeks, 28 - 31 weeks, 34 - 38 weeks and 5 - 15 weeks postnatally. After 150 women were followed up for all 5 visit and a normogram of capillary density changes in pregnancy was established, we selectively followed up women who had a uterine artery pulsatality index of < 2. 5 at 21 weeks scan as they were low risk of developing PE. 15 women were lost for follow up and 5 women were excluded because of violation of the protocol. 1 pregnancy was terminated for a foetal anomaly. A total of 305 women were analyzed. At the initial analysis it was found that capillary rarefaction occurred at 20 weeks in women who later developed preeclampsia. We measured VEGFR 2 an endothelial progenitor cell marker involved in neoangiogenesis of capillaries. We also measured anti-angiogenic factors sFlt- 1 and Endoglin in a cohort of women in the normotensive group at random and all the samples in the PE group. We found that capillary density at baseline and after venous congestion decreases as pregnancy progresses in normal pregnancy. In women who develop Preeclampsia the magnitude of decrease in capillary density at baseline and after venous congestion is exaggerated and is earlier compared to women who remained normotensive. The changes in anti-angiogenic factors are also exaggerated when compared to normal pregnancy. The VEGFR 2 levels are lower at 34 - 38 weeks visit in women who had term preeclampsia when compared to normotensive women. Structural rarefaction of skin capillaries at 20 - 24 weeks gestation and 27 - 32 weeks gestation were reliable predictors of preeclampsia. Combining capillary rarefaction with uterine artery doppler pulsatility index can further increase the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction. We also confirmed that previous history of preeclampsia or chronic hypertension and high UAD pulsatility index were independent predictors of preeclampsia.

40|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{of infrastructure}} systems by embedded sensors, computation, and communication networks has enabled significant advances in their management. Examples include monitoring of <b>structural</b> health, traffic <b>congestion,</b> environmental hazards, and energy usage. The use of homogeneous (especially, commercially available off-the-shelf) information technology (IT) solutions makes infrastructure systems subject to correlated hardware malfunctions and software bugs. Over the past decade, many concerns {{have been raised}} about the vulnerabilities of infrastructure systems to both random failures and security attacks. Cyber-security of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems is especially important, because these systems are employed for sensing and control of large physical infrastructures. So far, the existing research in robust and fault-tolerant control {{does not account for}} cyber attacks on networked control system (NCS) components. Also, the existing research in computer security neither considers the attacks targeting NCS components nor accounts for their interactions with the physical system. The goal of this thesis is to bridge this gap by focusing on (1) security threat assessment, (2) model-based attack diagnosis, and (3) resilient control design. First, cyber-security assessment for SCADA systems is performed based on well-defined attacker and defender objectives. The mathematical model of SCADA systems considered in this work has two control levels: regulatory control using distributed proportional-integral (PI) controllers, and supervisory fault diagnosis based on approximate dynamical system models. The performance of a PI control based regulatory scheme and a model-based supervisory diagnostic scheme is studied under a class of deception attacks. In order to test the system resilience, a class of stealthy attacks which can evade detection by SCADA systems is presented. Second, design of attack diagnosis schemes that incorporate the knowledge of physical dynamics of the system is presented. For SCADA systems used to manage water canal networks, an observer-based attack diagnostic scheme, in which each observer estimates the state of a reduced-order flow model, is presented. The observer parameters are computed using a convex optimization method, and the performance of this scheme is tested on a number of attack scenarios. An application of the theoretical results is illustrated by a field operational test performed on the SCADA system of the Gignac water canal system, located in Montpellier, France. A successful experimental cyber-attack on the sensors and actuators of this canal network revealed new vulnerabilities of the current SCADA system implementation. Another illustration includes security analysis of two benchmark scenarios: the Tennessee Eastman process control system (TE-PCS) and a power system state estimator (PSSE). In both these cases, model-based statistical detection schemes are used to study stealthy deception attacks. For the case of TE-PCS, design of practically implementable attack-detection and response mechanisms to maintain operational safety is presented. For the case of PSSE, it is assumed that the attacker only has a partial knowledge of the actual system model. For a set of attacker objectives, the trade-off between the attacker knowledge and possible impact of a successful attack on the performance of false data detection schemes is studied. Third, the stability of linear hyperbolic systems of PDEs when the boundary control actions and the system parameters switch discontinuously between a finite set of modes is studied. Switched PDE models can describe a class of fault and attack scenarios resulting from intermittent withdrawals through offtake nodes and compromise of sensor-control data. Motivated by such scenarios, a new condition for stability of linear hyperbolic systems of PDEs under arbitrary switching of boundary control actions and system parameters is derived. A class of switching attack strategies is presented, which violate the stability condition and result in unstable flow dynamics. Fourth, the problem of controlling stochastic linear systems for networked control settings is considered when the sensor-control data is prone to packet loss and jamming. For a class of packet drop models, feedback control policies which minimize a given objective function subject to safety constraints are synthesized. For marginally stable systems, under mild hypotheses on the noise introduced by the control channel and large enough control authority, the synthesis of a control policy that render the state of the closed-loop system mean-square bounded is presented. Finally, a class of games involving discrete interdependent risks is considered when each player is a NCS, and their security is interdependent due to the exposure to network induced risks. The problem of security decisions of individual players is formulated as a two-stage non-cooperative game defined as follows: in the first stage, the players decide whether to invest in security or not; and in the second stage, they apply control inputs to minimize the average operational costs. The characterization of the equilibria of the game is presented, which includes the determination of the individually optimal security levels. The presence of interdependent security causes a negative externality, and the individual players tend to under invest in security relative to the social optimum. From these results, for a wide parameter range, public policy incentivising higher security investments is desirable...|$|R
