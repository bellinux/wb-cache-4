50|$|Nothing in a Japanese {{garden is}} natural or left to chance; each plant is chosen {{according}} to aesthetic principles, either to hide undesirable sights, {{to serve as}} a backdrop to certain garden features, or to create a picturesque scene, like a landscape painting or postcard. Trees are carefully chosen and arranged for their autumn colors. Moss is often used to suggest that the garden is ancient. Flowers are also carefully chosen by their <b>season</b> <b>of</b> <b>flowering.</b> Formal flowerbeds are rare in older gardens, but more common in modern gardens. Some plants are chosen for their religious symbolism, such as the lotus, sacred in Buddhist teachings, or the pine, which represents longevity.|$|E

40|$|A phenological {{study with}} the aim to {{elucidate}} flower and fruit development stages in species of Uncaria gambir was conducted in field trial of agricultural faculty of Andalas University-West Sumatra. Observation during flower and fruit organ development was done in eleven inflorescences. Quantitative and descriptive data were collected during one <b>season</b> <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> time. Phenology of flower and fruit development could be classified in five stages, namely F 0 (flower initiation), F 1 (small bud scale), F 2 (large bud scale), F 3 (anthesis, flower opening) and F 4 (fruit development). All these events had average completing time in 112 days, and could be detailed as follows: flower initiation stage (F 0) took place in 20 days, small scale bud stage (F 1) occurred in 27 days, and large scale bud and anthesis stage (F 0 and F 3) each took place in 5 days, meanwhile fruit development stage (F 4 =S 0) would complete in 53 days. This result should be useful information especially for creating breeding programme in Uncaria gambir species...|$|E
40|$|Emissions of {{volatiles}} from leaves exhibit {{temperature dependence}} on maximums, but the optimum temperatures {{for the release}} of floral volatiles and the mechanism(s) of optimising these emissions have not been determined. We hypothesised that flowers have an optimum temperature for the emission of volatiles and, because the period of flowering varies highly among species, that this optimum is adapted to the temperatures prevailing during flowering. To test these hypotheses, we characterised the temperature responses of floral terpene emissions of diverse widespread Mediterranean plant species flowering in different seasons by using dynamic headspace sampling and analysis with GC-MS. The floral emissions of terpenes across species exhibited maximums at the temperatures corresponding to the <b>season</b> <b>of</b> <b>flowering,</b> with the lowest optimal temperatures observed in winter-flowering and the highest in summer-flowering species. These trends were valid for emissions of both total terpenes and the various terpene compounds. The results show that the optimum temperature of floral volatile emissions scales with temperature at flowering, and suggest that this scaling is the outcome of physiological adaptations of the biosynthetic or emission mechanisms of flowers...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to prove the {{occurrence}} of the arrhenotokous parthenogenesis in Osmia excavata All ken and Osmia cornifrons (Radoszkowski) by means of the biological experiments. The principles of experiments arc (1) to liberate the virgin females which are controlled under low temperature conditions to the field later than their normal flying season, or (2) to liberate the virgin females of the newly introduced species to a habitat where the species does not occur. The first method was devised for Osmia excavata and the second to Osmia cornifrons. It is clear that Osmia cornifrons has never been found in Kyushu. Accordingly, the liberation of the virgin females of this species in Kyushu may afford a valid key to prove the occurrence of parthenogenesis. A preliminary experiment by the first method for Osmia excavata was succeeded in 1954 (see Table 1), but the following summary is the result of experiments conducted in 1955. On February 8, 1955, the overwintering adult females of Osmia excavata were put into the thermostat regulated at 4 ～ 5 ℃. They were 60 in number, devided 3 groups containing 20 bees each. The first group of the red marked bees was liberated on May 9, at 10 : 00 (fine, 20 ℃), transfering immediately from the thermostat (5 ℃) to the field. Then, 7 out of 20 flew away soon, and 13 bees early next morning. After all, 14 females were established until May 13 afternoon. The results of their nesting activities were shown in Table 2. The second liberation of the white marked bees was practised a w eek later, on May 16, at 16 : 00 (fine, 26 ℃). In this case, 17 out of 20 flew away early next morning, 1 at noon, and the rest on May 18 morning. Among these, only 5 bees were established. The results were shown in Table 3. The third liberation of the yellow marked bees was conducted a fortnight later from the first one, on May 23, at noon(fine, 25 ℃), transfering immediately from the thermostat (5 ～ 7 ℃), too. In this case, 10 out of 20 flew away on that day, and the rest next morning. Although 8 out of 20 established, none of them completed a nest or a larval cell with only one exception. For example, one bee began nesting on May 25 morning, but her first egg was deposited on May 31 evening. Thus, it took about a week to construct a single larval cell! It seemed probable that these unhappy results were caused principally by the lack of pollen and nectar at that time. The second method for Osmia cornifrons was conducted as follows: A short series of nests of Osmia cornifrons was collected at Ka r u izawa, Honshu, in the summer of 1954. From these, 23 females were obtained. On February 8, these (overwintering) females were put into the thermostat regulated at 4 ～ 5 ℃. The liberation was conducted on April 5. In this case, 19 out of 23 flew away within a week and 4 found to be dead. Among these, only 4 were established. The results were shown in Table 4. It is concluded through Tables 2 to 4 that th e males of Osmia excavata and Osmia cornifrons are produced from the unfertilized eggs. It is of great interest to note that the following facts were clarified by the liberations of virgin females of Osmia excavata during the off season. 1. The structure of the nests were confused. Namely, (a) the lengths of larval cells were proved to be irregular, making a remarkable contrast to the normal nest, in which the larval cells became shorter towards the entrance, and (b) an empty cell was built between the larval cells. 2. Owing to the shortage of the suitable pollen and nectar, (a) the nesting abilities of female bees were decreased and (b) most of bees were forced to divide their labours. For example, the female bees of Osmia excavata are used to collect pollen and nectar simultaneously from the flowers of Brassica. While, in the off <b>season</b> <b>of</b> <b>flowering</b> period of Brassica, it was frequently observed that she sucked honey from the nectar of the flowers of white clover, and then flew away for searching pollen. Several kinds of pollens (undetermined) were detected in these cells. 3. The parasitism of the larvae of a species of Meloid beetles was newly observed. 4. Many larvae were killed by the decease caused by an unknown bacterium. 5. Many unhatched eggs were recorded beyond expectation. 1. シロオビツツハナバチの越年中の雌蜂を 5 ℃前後の低温処理によつてその活動期をほぼ 1 ヵ月おくらせ, 野外で雄が死滅した頃を見計つてこの雌蜂(処女蜂) を放飼して営巣産卵させた. 2. その結果シロオビツツハナバチの雄産性処女生殖を確認した. 3. 但し 1954 年度の実験では 1 つの巣に 3 匹の雌蜂が存在したが, この雌蜂が不授精卵から生じたものか或は実験の失敗によるのかは明かでない. 4. この実験の弱点を補うために, 本州産のコツノツツハナバチの処女蜂を放つて営巣産卵させ, その結果本種においても雄産性処女生殖の存在を知つた. 5. 活動期をおくらせたシロオビツツハナバチの処女蜂によつて営巣された巣の虫室長は不規則となり, 正常の場合にみられる虫室長の逓減が不明瞭となつた. また虫室間に空室が設けられた巣も現われた. 6, 更に活動期がずれたことによつて(a) 花粉・蜜源植物が缺乏した結果蜂の営巣能力が衰え, しかも花粉と蜜は別個の花から採集するようになり, (b) 天敵として新たにツチハンミョウが登揚し, 細菌性の病気によつて死亡する幼虫が増加し, (c) 卵が孵化せずに終つたものが多数認められた...|$|E

This objection to solemnize marriage in the merry month of May, however fit a season for courtship, is also borrowed from the Roman pagans, which, had these fanatics been aware of it, would have been an additional reason for their anathema against the practice.
