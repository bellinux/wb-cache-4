5|$|At {{this time}} the Luftwaffe was sending {{increased}} numbers of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters over England, at night and at low-level. They were able to hit the coastal areas and their speed and agility meant they were a difficult prospect to intercept. The German pilots were disadvantaged in some respects. There {{was a lack of}} nigh-flying experience in these units, the Fw 190s did not carry radar and had a short range. Aside from a small mirror, the pilot could not always <b>see</b> <b>behind</b> him well enough at night. On 16 May 1943 the Fw 190s lost four and probably a fifth to 85 Squadron. On 13 June 1943 Cunningham intercepted an Fw 190 not far from his airfield at West Malling. The GCI controller telephoned the crew-room to notify them the commanding officer was closing on an enemy aircraft heading to London. They heard both aircraft and the brief burst of fire followed by the explosion. To his amazement, Cunningham later learned the pilot—Leutnant Ullrich from 3./Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (Fast Bomber Wing 10—SKG 10)—was thrown through the canopy as the Fw 190A-5, Werknummer, 840047 code CO+LT, fell earthwards. He deployed his parachute and was picked up by a searchlight crew with a broken arm.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} scandal {{occurred}} on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured {{the services of}} a woman, Rose Keller, a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He told her she could make money by working for him—she understood her work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs, face-down, so that she could not <b>see</b> <b>behind</b> her. Then he whipped her. Keller testified that he made various incisions on her body into which he poured hot wax, although investigators found no broken skin on Keller, and Sade explained that he had applied ointment to her after the whipping. Keller finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. At this time, la Présidente, Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a lettre de cachet (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the King, excluding Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The lettre de cachet would later prove disastrous for the marquis.|$|E
25|$|Cumberland {{brought forward}} the 13th and 62nd {{to extend his}} first and second lines. At the same time, two squadrons of Kingston's Horse were brought forward to cover the right flank. These were then joined by two troops of Cobham's 10th Dragoons. While this was taking place, Hawley began making {{his way through the}} Culwhiniac Parks {{intending}} to outflank the Jacobite right wing. Anticipating this, the two battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's regiment had lined the wall. However, since the government dragoons stayed out of range, and the Jacobites were partly in dead ground they moved back and formed up on a re-entrant at Culchunaig, facing south and covering the army's rear. Once Hawley had led the dragoons through the Parks he deployed them in two lines beneath the Jacobite guarded re-entrant. By this time the Jacobites were guarding the re-entrant from above with four battalions of Lord Lewis Gordon's and Lord Ogilvy's regiments, and the combined squadron of Fitzjames's Horse and Elcho's Lifeguards. Unable to <b>see</b> <b>behind</b> the Jacobites above him, Hawley had his men stand and face the enemy.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} few years of life one can {{calculate}} the age of sheep from their front teeth, as a pair of milk teeth is replaced by larger adult teeth each year, the full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age. The front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age, making it harder for them to feed and hindering the health and productivity of the animal. For this reason, domestic sheep on normal pasture begin to slowly decline from four years on, and the life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, though some sheep may live as long as 20 years. Sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled. Sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, with excellent peripheral vision; with visual fields of about 270° to 320°, sheep can <b>see</b> <b>behind</b> themselves without turning their heads. Many breeds have only short hair on the face, and some have facial wool (if any) confined to the poll and or the area of the mandibular angle; the wide angles of peripheral vision apply to these breeds. A few breeds tend to have considerable wool on the face; for some individuals of these breeds, peripheral vision may be greatly reduced by [...] "wool blindness", unless recently shorn about the face. Sheep have poor depth perception; shadows and dips in the ground may cause sheep to baulk. In general, sheep have a tendency to move out of the dark and into well-lit areas, and prefer to move uphill when disturbed. Sheep also have an excellent sense of smell, and, like all species of their genus, have scent glands just in front of the eyes, and interdigitally on the feet. The purpose of these glands is uncertain, but those on the face may be used in breeding behaviors. The foot glands might also be related to reproduction, but alternative reasons, such as secretion of a waste product or a scent marker to help lost sheep find their flock, have also been proposed.|$|E

2500|$|The Lamborghini Concept S is a 2005 {{concept car}} Based on the Lamborghini Gallardo, {{with an open}} {{roadster}} body designed by Luc Donckerwolke. It was first shown at the 2005 Geneva Motor Show. It {{was intended to be}} a modern interpretation of the single-seat roadsters of the past. Utilizing a 'saute-vent' (French for 'change wind') instead of a traditional windscreen, and dividing the interior into two distinct compartments by continuing the bodywork between the seats, which also serves as an air inlet feeding the mid-mounted 5 L V10 engine, gives the car a distinctly futuristic look. This is also to increase aerodynamic flow. The rear-view mirror is even electronically retractable to allow the driver to <b>see</b> <b>behind,</b> when necessary, or hide it when not in use. Though considered more of a styling exercise than a working production vehicle, the final working show car only had to be modified slightly from the original computer-aided designs. Lamborghini had rumored to be building 100 for customers, but decided to keep it as a styling exercise. Only 2 models were ever made: the high-window prototype sits in the Lamborghini museum with no engine, while the running low-window prototype featured at Pebble Beach was up for auction on 10 December 2015 at RM Sotheby's Manhattan event [...] "Driven by Disruption". It was expected to go for $2.4 to 3 million, but failed to sell.|$|E

2500|$|Professor James Kugel of Bar-Ilan University read [...] to {{tell that}} Jacob legally adopted Joseph's sons Ephraim and Manasseh as his own, making them coequal heirs with Jacob's other sons. Thus, while Joseph {{formerly}} was entitled to one-twelfth of Jacob's estate, after [...] Jacob replaced Joseph's single share with the two shares of Ephraim and Manasseh, giving Joseph in effect a double portion. Kugel reported that modern scholars <b>see</b> <b>behind</b> this incident a midcourse correction in Israel's list of tribes. At an early stage, it had become fixed that there were 12 tribes, but then reality changed. Levi had been a tribe like any other with its own tribal land, but then Levi became essentially landless, a scattered people of priests and religious functionaries, {{with only a few}} cities of their own. Simeon disappeared. To compensate for {{at least one of these}} absences, the territory elsewhere attributed to Joseph was counted as two territories, each with its own ancestor figure, Ephraim and Manasseh. The Israelites told that Joseph had two sons by those names, each a tribal founder. That way, a tribal list could omit the Levites, as in [...] or the Simeonites, as in [...] and, by replacing “Joseph” with “Ephraim and Manasseh,” still include the names of 12 tribes. Kugel reported that Jacob then blessed his two new sons, making another midcourse correction in ...|$|E
