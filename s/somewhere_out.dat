500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Fight Club" [...] {{was largely}} negative. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a [...] "D–"; {{he called it}} [...] "dire stuff" [...] and wrote that [...] "there’s something rancid about forced quirk; it’s rotten and smug". Handlen both criticized Griffin's inability to portray two separate characters, as well as Carter's failure at writing a comedic script. He also felt that the [...] "relentless self-awareness isn’t amusing anymore". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a scathing review. He wrote [...] "If it is indeed true that <b>somewhere</b> <b>out</b> in this vast world we all have an identical twin, I have but one wish for mine. I sincerely hope he was spared the hour of torture that 'Fight Club' imposed upon me." [...] Christina Brzustoski from 11th Hour Magazine opined that [...] "Just when you thought The X-Files couldn't get a more grating guest star than Victoria Jackson, Chris Carter manages to top himself yet again with not one, but two, {{for the love of}} God, two Kathy Griffins in the Carter-penned episode 'Fight Club.' It's a safe bet this disjointed, lame episode will probably not be easily confused with the far superior David Fincher movie of the same name. But then the current state of The X-Files makes Elmo in Grouchland look like an Oscar contender." ...|$|E

"All {{kinds of}} {{scrambled}} thoughts" [...] {{went through his}} mind after the accident, including [...] "whether the girl might still be alive <b>somewhere</b> <b>out</b> of that immediate area..., whether some awful curse actually did hang over all the Kennedys... whether there was some justifiable reason for [...] to doubt {{what had happened and}} to delay [...] report"... whether somehow the awful weight of this incredible incident might in some way pass from [...] shoulders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elvis's {{second set}} in the show {{consisted}} of [...] "Ready Teddy" [...] and a short on-air comment to Sullivan, [...] "Ah, Mr. Sullivan. We know that <b>somewhere</b> <b>out</b> there you are looking in, and, ah, all the boys and myself, and everybody out here, {{are looking forward to}} seeing you back on television." [...] Next, Elvis declared, [...] "Friends, as a great philosopher once said, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog ...,' [...] " [...] as he launched into a short (1:07) version of the song.|$|E

JOHNNY--He's got a {{daughter}} <b>somewheres</b> <b>out</b> West, I think {{he told me}} once. [He puts the letter on the cash register.] Come to think of it, I ain't seen old Chris in a dog's age.

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Sharon High School in May 1936, Graham {{attended}} Bob Jones College, then located in Cleveland, Tennessee. After one semester, {{he found it}} too legalistic in both coursework and rules. At {{this time he was}} influenced and inspired by Pastor Charley Young from Eastport Bible Church. He was almost expelled, but Bob Jones Sr. warned him not to throw his life away: [...] "At best, all you could amount to would be a poor country Baptist preacher <b>somewhere</b> <b>out</b> in the sticks.... You have a voice that pulls. God can use that voice of yours. He can use it mightily." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{their return}} to Australia, the members began rehearsing in February 1975, still using the name of Mississippi. In Wheatley's autobiography, Paper Paradise (1999), he {{described}} how they obtained their name: [...] "It was now {{time to get out}} of the rehearsal room and play to a live audience – somewhere without any fanfare, <b>somewhere</b> <b>out</b> of the way. I booked the Golfview Hotel in Geelong for the Saturday night of 1 March 1975. While travelling to the venue down the Geelong Road from Melbourne, we passed the turn-off for Little River. From the back of the truck, Glenn Shorrock shouted, 'What about the Little River Band'? And so, that night the Golfview Hotel witnessed the first performance of the Little River Band, albeit advertised on the marquee as Mississippi." [...] On 20 March 1975 they played their first official gig under their new name at Martini's Hotel in Carlton. They played a return gig at the Golfview Hotel five days later.|$|E
