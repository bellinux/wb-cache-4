On May 9, 1989, she fell during a climb in Buoux, France; after forgetting {{to tie a}} <b>safety</b> <b>rope,</b> she fell 85ft (25m) into a tree, and was knocked unconscious, dislocated her left elbow and broke a bone in her foot. She had been training hard for the World Cup and had to stop competing {{for a few months}} to recover; she was devastated to miss the first World Cup in the sport. However, only six weeks after her fall, she was back climbing.|$|E

As they climb, Roderick and Wicke cut the <b>safety</b> <b>rope,</b> intentionally killing some of the knights. At the top, they discover the giants' realm and decide to split into two groups: one with Jack, Elmont, and Crawe, and the other including Roderick and Wicke, but not before Roderick forcibly takes the remaining beans from Jack (although Jack manages to save one for himself).|$|E

2500|$|Climbing on short, low routes {{without the}} use of the <b>safety</b> <b>rope</b> that is typical of most other styles. [...] Protection, if used at all, {{typically}} consists of a cushioned bouldering pad below the route and a spotter, a person who watches from below and directs the fall of the climber away from hazardous areas. Bouldering may be an arena for intense and relatively safe competition, resulting in exceptionally high difficulty standards.|$|E
2500|$|Other daredevils {{have made}} {{crossing}} the gorge their goal, {{starting with the}} successful passage by Jean François [...] "Blondin" [...] Gravelet, who crossed Niagara Gorge in 1859. Between 1859 and 1896 a wire-walking craze emerged, resulting in frequent feats over the river below the falls. One inexperienced walker slid down his <b>safety</b> <b>rope.</b> Only one man fell to his death, at night and under mysterious circumstances, at the anchoring place for his wire.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were some}} police {{officers}} present to maintain order, as the Parisian Prefecture of Police had given Reichelt permission to proceed. After Reichelt's death, M. Louis Lépine who, as the Prefect of Police (...) , was ultimately {{responsible for the}} permission being granted, issued a statement {{making it clear that}} while the police routinely gave permission for experiments to be performed from the Eiffel Tower, it was understood in these cases that dummies would be used. They had given permission in Reichelt's case only on the basis that he would be conducting dummy drops, and that under no circumstances would they have allowed him to proceed if they had known he would be making the jump himself. M. Lépine assured La Croix that he had never signed an order that allowed a live jump. From his arrival at the tower, however, Reichelt {{made it clear that he}} intended to jump himself. According to a later interview with one of the friends who accompanied him up the tower, this was a surprise to everybody, as Reichelt had concealed his intention until the last moment. His friends tried to persuade him to use dummies in the experiment, assuring him that he would have other opportunities to make the jump himself. When this failed to make an impression on him, they pointed to the strength of the wind and said he should call off the test on safety grounds, or at least delay until the wind dropped. They were unable to shake his resolve; seemingly undeterred by the failure of his previous tests, he told journalists from Le Petit Journal that he was totally convinced that his apparatus would work, and work well. When questioned as to whether he planned to take any additional precautions, such as using a <b>safety</b> <b>rope,</b> he replied that he would not, since he intended to trust his life entirely to his parachute: ...|$|E

5000|$|Bouldering may be {{described}} as climbing short, severe routes on boulders or small outcrops. While <b>safety</b> <b>ropes</b> from above are occasionally used, most boulderers feel that the most ethical form of protection is a bouldering mat or pad {{similar to those used}} by gymnasts. In addition, other climbers standing on the ground may [...] "spot" [...] the boulderer, to help safely guide his or her fall. Since the climber moves without aid of equipment it is a form of free climbing but the distinction is generally unimportant.|$|R
2500|$|The film's climax on Veridian III {{was filmed}} over eight days on an {{elevated}} plateau in the [...] "Valley of Fire", north of Las Vegas, Nevada.

The 110-degree heat was difficult for all involved, especially Shatner, as his character wore an all-wool uniform. Safety harnesses and wires were used to keep performers safe from tumbling off a precipice, and were then removed digitally.|$|R

Divers require confined-space training and working at heights certification. In the USA commercial diving operations require at least one trained tender, a diver, and a supervisor. Surface-supplied air with two-way radio communications to the diver and a <b>safety</b> <b>rope</b> are preferred. The Occupational Safety & Health Administration regulation 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart T allows scuba with a rope for basic communications. The diver should be wearing a harness, strapped to a <b>safety</b> <b>rope,</b> so that {{in case of an}} emergency the dive tender can pull the diver up. Diving contractors always need to check the safety legislation appropriate to their local jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|The FDNY issued {{personal}} <b>safety</b> <b>ropes</b> to firefighters until 2000, when it discontinued {{the practice}} {{saying that they}} were too bulky and were not being used. The department's official report on the fire, issued in September 2005, stated that ropes would have been helpful, and they were issued again starting a month later; since 2006 FDNY firefighters have been equipped with a hook, a rope, and a sliding mechanism. The report also blamed the firefighters for poor communication and for remaining too long on the fourth floor given the conditions, and those operating the pump for poor understanding of the equipment.|$|R

50|$|José Mendoza is {{the captain}} of the Zancudo group of the San Pedro neighborhood, and has spent about forty years {{recruiting}} dancers and training them. This includes teaching how to make the stilts made from ocote wood. These stilts measure two meters long and have a “foot” fastened by wire and rope. Recruited dancers are boys from 12 to 14 years of age and are trained for two months after they make a pledge to Saint Peter. At first, the boys balance themselves with <b>safety</b> <b>ropes</b> on their stilts. Only males are permitted to dance, with some wearing women’s masks. Performances can extend for hours, during which small gifts are distributed among the spectators from baskets. The dancers are accompanied by musical groups, “chinas Oaxaqueñas” and “monos de calenda.” These dancers perform the strenuous performance on the feast day of Saint Peter {{as well as at the}} Guelaguetza of Oaxaca and other dance festivals in Mexico.|$|R
