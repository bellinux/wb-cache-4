500|$|... "Illegal" [...] is a ballad with lyrics {{revolving}} around mourning {{for the loss}} of a lover, as seen in the lines, [...] "It should be illegal to deceive a woman's heart". It contains elements of pop and country music. Spence D. of the website IGN felt that Shakira adopted an [...] "almost modern day country-styled pop aesthetic". Throughout the song, her vocals are subdued, complete with [...] "rolling delivering, breathy accentuations, and... trill". AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that the lyrics [...] "You <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> love me until you died/And as far as I know you're still alive" [...] were similar to Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know" [...] (1995).|$|E
500|$|... "The End of All Things" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Fury, while being directed by [...] veteran, Jeff Hunt. It was Hunt's third series credit (his other two being [...] "The Man from the Other Side" [...] and [...] "The Box"). Leading up to the episode's broadcast, executive producer Jeff Pinkner remarked {{in a conference call}} with journalists that it was a [...] "game-changer" [...] because [...] "our characters learn a lot more and the audience is going to learn a lot more about the über-plot of the season’s bad guy, David Robert Jones." [...] Referring to the Observer September, Pinker added that the episode would also peel [...] "back some layers about what his agenda has been and use that as an opportunity to revisit the things on the show we’ve seen before." [...] Fellow executive producer J.H. Wyman elaborated [...] "We always <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> find out about the Observers this season {{and we were going to}} investigate them a lot more. We’re excited about it all. That’s a highlight– the Observers are a highlight. For us to constantly break what you know and reset and have people go, 'Wow, I didn’t see that coming!' That’s why we get up in the morning is to take people along for the ride. We’re excited about what’s coming up, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E

2500|$|The United States then {{fought a}} four-round veto duel with France, forcing it {{to back down}} and accept the {{selection}} of US-educated Kofi Annan {{to be the next}} Secretary-General. President Clinton was very impressed and told Clarke and Sheehan, [...] "Get me a crow, I should eat a crow, because I <b>said</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never pull it off." [...] In his memoirs, Clarke said that [...] "the entire operation had strengthened Albright's hand in the competition to be Secretary of State in the second Clinton administration." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, that's the rub! If <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'what,' <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be more grammatical. Norton swears {{that it was}} not human, and, indeed, {{from the}} {{scratches}} on his throat, I should be inclined to agree with him." ...|$|R
