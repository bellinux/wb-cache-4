40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{trial to}} determine the effect of repeated freezing and thawing on beef <b>striploins,</b> showed that the effect of thawing on frozen non-aged beef significantly improved tenderness, flavour and acceptability, indicating that thawing had a similar effect to aging. In the subsequent study, 207 beef <b>striploins</b> were collected from the Southern Crossbreeding Project (SXB: 70 heifers grainfed for 80 days, 70 steers grainfed for 180 days), Davies Gene Mapping Project (DGM: 30 steers grainfed for 180 days) and also 37 Hanwoo <b>striploins</b> imported into Australia from Korea. SXB animals consisted of Hereford cross calves sired by Belgian Blue, Limousin, South Devon, Hereford, Angus, Wagyu and Jersey bulls. DGM animals consisted of purebred Limousins and Jerseys and Limousin by Jersey crosses. Sensory analysis of beef <b>striploins</b> involved semi-trained taste panel assessments, using nine-point category scales for initial and sustained juiciness, beef flavour, beef fat flavour, oily flavour, buttery flavour, chicken-skin flavour, corn flavour, grassy flavour and overall acceptability. Flavour acceptability was positively enhanced by increased levels of intramuscular fat (IMF%). Significant differences in breed were apparent for juiciness, beef flavour, buttery flavour and flavour acceptability, after adjusting data to a constant level of intramuscular fat, suggesting that some variation in flavour may be genetic. The Korean Hanwoo displayed a numerically higher intensity of chicken score and lower intensity of beef flavour. Australian cattle breeds differed in fatty acid composition between each other and also to that of the Korean Hanwoo. The latter had 57 % mono-unsaturated fatty acids, which was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) than the Australian breeds (47 %). Since IMF% was confounded with breed, breed differences were not significant when adjusted for IMF%. Jersey animals most closely resembled the Hanwoo in fatty acid profile, whilst animals containing Limousin differed markedly from the Hanwoo. A chemical sensor was able to establish significant differences between Korean Hanwoo and Australian animals and predominantly mirrored differences in fatty acid composition and to some extent flavour. Development of prediction equations from individual fatty acids was disappointing (R 2 < 15 %). However, when fatty acid data, IMF% and chemical sensor data were combined to form prediction equations, moderate R 2 values were obtained of (24 % to 43 %). Thesis (M. Ag. Sc.)

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effect of two breeds (Belgian Blue vs. Limousin) and {{previous}} vacuum storage time on color and lipid stability of meat packaged in high-oxygen atmosphere. Vacuum packaged <b>striploins</b> from Belgian Blue and Limousin cows were stored at − 1 °C and + 4 °C for up to 60 days and analyzed. Part of these samples were repackaged under modified atmosphere – 70 % O 2 / 30 % CO 2 – at different times, stored 2 days at + 4 °C and 5 d at + 8 °C, and then analyzed. The following parameters were evaluated: color (CIE L*a*b*), metmyoglobin %, lipid oxidation (TBARS) and fat content. Color measurement and metmyoglobin % determination showed greater pigment stability in Belgian Blue samples than in Limousin. Belgian Blue also presented higher lipid stability (TBARS). A positive correlation between pigment oxidation and lipid oxidation was highlighted. The greater amount of fat in meat of Limousin could partially explain its higher sensitivity to oxidation. Nevertheless, other factors may be involved in oxidative stability such as metmyoglobin reducing activity and antioxidant capacity. An understanding of the oxidative processes and their interaction would provide a basis for explaining quality deterioration in meat and for developing strategies to maintain sensory qualities.

O'QuinnThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the effect of enhancement on consumer and trained beef palatability scores of three quality grades when cooked to three degrees of doneness (DOD) and to determine the accuracy and repeatability of the Pressed Juice Percentage (PJP). <b>Striploins</b> of USDA Prime, Low Choice, and Low Select quality grades were used in this study. To maximize variation in juiciness, steaks were either enhanced (formulated for 108 % pump with a solution of water, salt, and alkaline phosphates) or non-enhanced, and cooked to three degree of doneness (Rare: 60 °C, Medium: 71 °C, or Very Well-Done: 82 °C). All samples were evaluated for Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), Slice Shear Force (SSF), PJP, and palatability traits by consumer and trained panelists. Consumer panelists rated all enhanced treatments similar (P > 0. 05) to each other and greater (P 0. 05) and greater (P 0. 05) and greater (P 90 % categories, respectively. Therefore, enhancement has a substantial, positive effect on beef palatability. Enhancing higher quality beef does not provide an additional palatability benefit; hence the greatest economic advantage is in enhancing lower quality beef products.

40|$|Abstract. A study {{involving}} {{two groups}} of feedlot cattle (n = 84 and 112) was undertaken to compare the effect of two preslaughter lairage (L) durations (3 h v. 18 h) on carcass and meat quality properties. The cattle were grainfed for 150 days before slaughter and had a mean carcass weight of 347. 0 ± 25. 4 kg. Cattle from the same feedlot pen were randomly allocated to the two treatments {{on the day before}} slaughter. One group was transported to the abattoir the day before slaughter and held overnight (L– 18 h) whereas the other group remained at the feedlot and was transported the following morning and remained in the lairage for 3 h before slaughter (L– 3 h). After slaughter, meat quality was evaluated on a subset of 15 carcasses/lairage treatment from the two slaughter groups. Objective meat quality measures were made on unaged and 14 -day-aged <b>striploins</b> (longissimus lumborum) from these carcasses. Cattle from the reduced lairage treatment had heavier bled bodyweights at slaughter (P 0. 05) on carcass weight, muscle glycogen concentration, pH 3 h, ultimate pH, shear force or Minolta lightness values. Significant interactions (P< 0. 05) between lairage duration and aging were observed for cooking loss percentage and Minolta a ∗ and b ∗ values but these were relatively small in magnitude. There were no differences in the incidence of ingesta contamination or rumen rupture between the lairage treatments. It was concluded that shortening holding times in lairage from 18 to 3 h for cattle that have travelled < 6 h would not affect carcass or beef quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} was to study the effect of duration and temperature of previous vacuum-packed (VP) storage on the microbiological quality of Belgian Blue (BB) beef packed in high-oxygen atmosphere. VP <b>striploins</b> from bulls (B) and cows (C) were stored at − 1 °C and + 4 °C for up to 80 days. These meats were subsequently repackaged under modified atmosphere (MA) – 70 % O 2 / 30 % CO 2 – at different times, and stored 2 d at + 4 °C and 5 d at + 8 °C. The average initial counts in VP meats were 3. 6 log CFU/cm² (B) and 2. 7 log CFU/cm² (C) for total viable count (TVC) at + 22 °C; < 2. 0 log CFU/cm² (B and C) for lactic ac id bacteria (LAB) at + 22 °C; 1. 1 log CFU/cm² (B) and 1. 3 log CFU/cm² (C) for Enterobacteriaceae at + 30 °C and < 1. 0 log CFU/cm² (B and C) for Pseudomonas spp. and Brochothrix thermosphacta. During the first 40 days of VP storage, temperature had a striking influence on microbial growth. The maximum count differences between storage temperatures were obtained at the 20 th day of storage: 2. 7 log CFU/cm² (B) and 2. 9 log CFU/cm² (C) for TVC, 4. 0 log CFU/cm² (B and C) for LAB and 3. 6 log CFU/cm² (B and C) for Enterobacteriaceae. The difference in TVC between temperatures at the 20 th day tended to disappear once the meats were repacked under MA and stored during seven days. Conversely, the difference in LAB and Enterobacteriaceae counts tended to be maintained after MA repackaging, showing that duration and temperature of VP storage had influence on microbiological quality of BB meat subsequently stored in high-oxygen atmosphere. Moreover, chilling at temperatures {{very close to the}} freezing point of meat during VP storage, which has already showed innumerous advantages for physicochemical quality of meat, was capital to maintain the microbiological quality of BB fresh meat during subsequent MA-packed storage.

40|$|Supplying {{beef with}} {{consistent}} eating quality to consumers {{is vital to}} the beef industry. We investigated the relationship between eating quality and biochemical measurements, intramuscular fat (IMF), moisture content and heme iron. Six cuts (<b>striploin,</b> outside, rump, tenderloin, oyster blade and the topside) from 18 French cattle were grilled, medium or rare. In total 540 untrained French consumers rated the steaks for tenderness, flavour, juiciness and overall liking, according to MSA protocols. These scores were combined on a weighted basis (0. 3, 0. 3, 0. 1, 0. 3 respectively) to make a score called MQ 4. The sensory scores were analysed using a mixed linear model with cut, age and country included as fixed effects, and animal ID as a random term. The biochemical measurements were then incorporated one at a time as covariates into the model, as well as their interactions with all fixed effects to assess their association with the sensory scores. IMF (range 0. 23 - 9 % wet matter) had a positive, linear, relationship with flavour and overall liking (magnitude of effect 6. 08 and 5. 94 across the IMF range). Moisture content (range 70 - 77 % wet matter) had a negative, linear, relationship with flavour and overall liking (magnitude of effect 6. 35 and 6. 15 across the moisture content range).

Contrasts between the mean responses of 1 / 2 MN bull group versus 1 / 2 MN and 3 / 4 MN groups and within 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 MN heifers groups, were made in the different feedlot periods. The means of cold carcass weights (CCW) and yields were, respectively, 321. 31 kg and 58. 94 % for 1 / 2 MN bulls, that were superior of the 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 MN heifers; with values of 263. 64 kg and 56. 82 %; and 289. 56 kg and 57. 94 %, respectively. The economic results (%LW) of the carcass and cut yields, were higher for the 1 / 2 MN bulls than for the 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 MN heifers.

Two favorable CAST alleles increased tenderness ratings of AT-striploin, TS-striploin, rump, and oyster blade steaks by, respectively, 6. 1, 4. 2, 4. 2, and 3. 1 units, and overall liking by 4. 7, 2. 8, 2. 9, 3. 7 (all P < 0. 04). Two favorable CAPN 1 - 4751 alleles increased tenderness of AT-striploin, TS-striploin, and rump steaks by 6. 5, 4. 3, and 3. 9 units, and overall liking by 5. 6, 3. 1, and 4. 1 units. Two favorable CAPN 3 alleles improved rump steaks by 3. 7, 3. 3, 3. 7, and 3. 5 units, for tenderness, juiciness, liking the flavor, and overall liking. There were no significant CAPN 1 - 316 effects. The effect of HGP was greatestfor the AT-striploin (reducing tenderness and overall liking by 8. 2 units, P < 0. 001), then TS-striploin (- 5. 6 for tenderness, - 5. 0 for overall liking, P < 0. 001), and then rump (- 4. 4 for tenderness, - 3. 3 for overall liking, P < 0. 007). Processing conditions differed considerably between NSW and WA. Rump steaks from NSW scored about 10 units greater than those from WA, but Angus and Brahman steaks from the same location with the same marker alleles had similar scores. In contrast, NSW Angus <b>striploin</b> steaks scored about 15 units greater for tenderness and overall liking (P < 0. 001) than cattlewith the same marker alleles at the other 3 location × breed combinations, which had generally similar scores. Therefore, calpain-system gene markers have beneficial effects on eating quality, consistent with our previous findings for objective meat quality...|$|E
40|$|Em inúmeras pesquisas, tem sido verificada a inferioridade da carcaça e da carne de vacas, principalmente de vacas de descarte que são levadas ao abate muito velhas e/ou com acabamento inadequado. Com este trabalho, teve-se como objetivos estabelecer entre as vacas abatidas no município de Lavras-MG a condição {{corporal}} mais freqüente durante o período de março a julho e avaliar a relação existente entre condição corporal e rendimento de carcaça e de alguns cortes do traseiro. O levantamento foi conduzido no matadouro municipal de Lavras-MG e dividido em duas fases assim compreendidas: Fase 1 (1 º a 31 de março de 2001), na qual se determinou que 53, 41 % do total de animais abatidos no período foram fêmeas e que os escores de condições corporais (ECC) mais freqüentes entre elas foram 3, 4 e 5. Na fase 2 (15 abril a 15 de julho de 2001), foram utilizadas 140 fêmeas, 42 vacas da CC 3, 59 fêmeas da CC 4 e 39 da CC 5. Em cada escore, as vacas foram classificadas em três grupos genéticos: azebuadas, holandesadas e mestiças. No matadouro, antes do abate, as vacas foram pesadas, classificadas quanto à condição corporal e grupo genético e fotografadas para posterior classificação por outros avaliadores. Os parâmetros avaliados foram: rendimento de carcaça quente (RCQ), peso da gordura renal e pélvica, área de olho de lombo (AOL), espessura de gordura de cobertura (EGC) e pesos dos cortes (contrafilé, alcatra completa e filé mignon). O escore de condição corporal (ECC) teve influência sobre o RCQ, a EGC, o peso da gordura renal e pélvica e o peso da alcatra completa nos três grupos genéticos. Para a AOL e o peso do filé mignon, só foi observado efeito do ECC sobre as vacas azebuadas; o peso de contrafilé não foi afetado pelo ECC. As vacas azebuadas apresentaram maior RCQ e EGC; porém, a maior AOL foi observada entre as vacas holandesadas. A gordura renal e pélvica e o peso dos cortes (alcatra, contrafilé e filé mignon) não variaram entre os grupos genéticos. Pelos resultados obtidos, pode-se concluir que as vacas abatidas no período apresentaram baixa condição corporal e que essa influencia as características de rendimento na carcaça. A {{number of}} research works {{have shown the}} inferiority of the carcass and of the meat of cows mainly of cull cows which are led to slaughter very old and/ or with an unsuitable finishing. This work was aimed to establish among the cows slaughtered {{in the town of}} Lavras - Mg the most frequent body condition during the period of March to July and to evaluate the relationship existing between body condition and carcass yield and the yield of some cuts of the rear. The survey was conducted in the slaughterhouse of the town of Lavras - MG and divided into two phases, thus comprehended : phase 1 (1 st to 31 st of March 2001) determined that 53. 41 % of the total of animals slaughtered in the period were females and that the body condition scores (BCS) more frequent among them were 3, 4 and 5. In phase 2 (15 th April to 15 th July 2001) were utilized 140 females viz. 42 cows of BCS 3, 59 females of BCS 4 and 39 of BCS 5. In each sore the cows were ranked into three genetic groups: zebu- crossed, Holstein- crossed and crossbred. In the slaughterhouse before slaughter the cows were weighted classified as to body condition and genetic group and photographed for further classification by other referees. The evaluated parameters were: HCY, kidney and pelvic fat weight LEA, PFT and weight of the cuts (<b>striploin,</b> whole rump and tenderloin). The body condition score (BCS) influenced the HCW, PFT kidney and pelvic weight and the weight of the whole rump in the three genetic groups. For the LEA and weight of the tenderloin only the effect of the BCS on the zebu-crossed cows was found, <b>striploin</b> weight was not affected by the BCS. The zebu-crossed cows presented a greater HCY and PFT but the largest LEA was observed among the Holstein cows. The kidney and pelvic fat and the weights of the cuts (<b>striploin,</b> rump and tenderloin) did not range among the genetic groups. From the results obtained, one can conclude that the cows slaughtered in the period presented poor body condition and that this influenced the carcass yield characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The European beef grading {{systems of}} EUROP and Carcase Fatness {{are used to}} {{determine}} carcase value throughout Europe. We investigated the relationship between EUROP class and eating quality. Six cuts (the <b>Striploin,</b> Outside, Rump, Tenderloin, Oyster blade and the Topside) from 18 French cattle were grilled, medium or rare. In total, 540 untrained French consumers rated the steaks for Tenderness, Flavour, Juiciness and Overall Liking, according to MSA protocols, and these scores were combined on a weighted basis (0. 3, 0. 3, 0. 1, 0. 3 respectively) to make a fifth term called Meat Quality score (MQ 4). During processing the cattle were graded using the European ‘EUROP’ and ‘Carcase Fatness’ systems. The sensory scores were analysed using a mixed linear model with cut, age and EUROP score included as fixed effects, and animal ID as a random term. Due to the low numbers of animals, Carcase Fatness scores were selected from the limited range of 3 -, 3 = and 3 + and hence do not significantly influence eating quality. In all cases, the sensory scores differed between the EUROP classes. However, these differences followed no clear linear trend across EIJROP classes within any of the cuts tested. Thus, while the EUROP system may adequately describe carcase muscling characteristics, it does not predict eating quality. The industry should consider using a system more related to eating quality to determine the monetary value of carcases, rewarding those producers supplying the meat most preferred by consumers...|$|E
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{evaluated the}} meat yield of prepared beef cuts, bone and trimmings of steer and culled cow carcasses. Culled 72 -month-old Braford cows, 496 kg live weight and 36 -month-old steers, 494 kg live weight were used, {{all from the}} same herd and finished on ryegrass pasture. A randomized complete design, with two treatments and 15 replications, was used. Hot carcass weight was lower for cows (248 kg) than for steers (263 kg). Steer carcasses presented better conformation, lower chilling loss, shorter (128. 6 vs. 137. 7 cm), with longer and thicker limbs compared to cows and similar fat finishing. Steer carcasses showed, compared to cow carcasses, always in the same order, similar side cut yield (13. 5 vs. 13. 4 %), higher forequarter yield (38. 4 vs. 37. 2 %), and lower hindquarter yield (48. 1 vs. 48. 9 %), resulting lower yields of the sub-primal cuts full rump and sirloin, lower rump UK trim, rump tail and <b>striploin.</b> Steer and cow carcasses were similar in total yield of prepared meat cuts (77. 8 vs. 77. 6 %), discarded bone (17. 4 vs. 17. 9 %), discarded trimmings (4. 54 vs. 4. 09 %), and losses inherent to the deboning process (0. 34 vs. 0. 34 %). The results showed that cow carcasses are longer, have shorter and thinner limbs, have higher hindquarter and lower of forequarter yields, but the total yield of prepared meat cuts were similar between cow and steer carcasses...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} the use of the spectrophotometer Minolta CM- 600 d for measuring the colour and the proportions of different myoglobin redox forms (oxymyoglobin, deoxymyoglobin, and metmyoglobin) on the surface of meat. One vacuum-packaged (VP) <b>striploin</b> was supplied by a Belgian food wholesaler. It was cut in 3 cm thick steaks, repacked under vacuum and stored at − 0. 5 °C until analyses. The measurement of colour in the C. I. E. L*a*b* space and the determination of oxymyoglobin, deoxymyoglobin, and metmyoglobin were performed on VP and modified atmosphere-packed (70 % O 2 / 30 % CO 2 for 24 h) samples (n = 10). Results obtained were compared to two reference methods (colour measurement using a chromameter Minolta CR- 400 and spectrophotometric determination of different myoglobin redox forms in aqueous meat extracts) by F-test for precision and t-test for accuracy. Statistic significance level was established at 5 %. The two colour measurement methods presented the same precision, when considering VP samples only, and different accuracies, probably because of the different detectors and observation angles used by both devices. The two methods for determining the different myoglobin forms presented also the same precision but different accuracies, probably due to the fact that oxygenation is favoured during some steps of the reference method (e. g. extraction, filtration). In conclusion, the results for colour measurement obtained by both devices cannot be compared. It is necessary to compare both methods for determining oxymyoglobin, deoxymyoglobin, and metmyoglobin in complete anaerobic conditions in order to eliminate the oxygenation bias. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the influence of age of animal, hot carcass weight, pH, conformation and fat class on basic beef quality attributes (tenderness, sarcomere length, basic chemical composition, marbling and colour) in a group of purebred animals. The object of the study was beef of Limousin bulls (25 to 27 months, hot carcass weight - 432 ± 31 kg, “U” conformation class, “ 2 ”–“ 3 ” fat class). Analysed cuts were Infraspinatus muscle from the blade and Longissimus dorsi muscle from the cube roll and the <b>striploin.</b> Tenderness was analysed with universal testing machine, colour - chromometer analysis, sarcomere length - microscopic method, basic chemical composition - near-infrared spectroscopy and marbling - computer image analysis. No differences in tenderness and sarcomere length were observed within the age groups of Limousin bulls (age of 25, 26, 27 months) (p> 0. 05). Moisture (p = 0. 0123) and fat (p = 0. 0250) content were significantly different for meat of animals slaughtered at the age of 25 and 27 months. No influence of pH value on tenderness was observed, but at the same time, influence on sarcomere length (p = 0. 039) and b* component of colour (0. 045) was found. For “U” conformation class, in subclasses, as well as for fat classes “ 2 ”–“ 3 ”, there were no differences in tenderness, sarcomere length and colour components. Higher fat content was observed in the higher fat class, rather than in lower, however this feature was not associated with marbling...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the bacterial diversity and its evolution during storage of fresh beef, depending on its origin, packaging and storage temperature. Two batches of three vacuum packed striploins from United Kingdom and Belgium were obtained from a food wholesaler located in the Walloon Region. Fifteen days after slaughter, the striploins were sliced and individually kept under vacuum for 30 days: i) at − 1 °C; ii) at + 4 °C and iii) at − 1 °C for 15 days and then at + 4 °C for 15 days. The bacterial diversity was evaluated by metagenomic approach 15, 30 and 45 days after slaughter. Furthermore, each 15 days part of the vacuum packed <b>striploin</b> slices were repacked under modified atmosphere (70 % O 2 / 30 % CO 2), stored at + 4 °C for 2 days and at + 8 °C for 5 days, and then analyzed. Metagenomic analysis revealed a selection of the initial flora depending on atmosphere and temperature conditions. The development of Lactobacillus algidus was favored in samples preserved under vacuum at − 1 °C, while a predominance of Lactococcus piscium was observed for samples stored at + 4 °C. Moreover, storage under modified atmosphere favored the development of Leuconostoc gasicomitatum. These microorganisms have already been isolated from beef, but no study has evaluated their role in food conservation. The next step of this study will be to isolate and characterize strains of Lactobacillus algidus from meat and to assess their bioprotective potential. Peer reviewe...|$|E
