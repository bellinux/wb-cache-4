Plant reproduction suffers under salt stress in chickpea, but it remains unclear which process is most affected and what traits discriminate tolerant from <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines.</b> Three pot experiments were carried out to compare the effects of salt application (17 g NaCl kg− 1 Alfisol) at sowing (SS) and at the start of flowering (SF) on growth, canopy transpiration, plant architecture, and flower, pod and seed development (timing, numbers, mass, abortion). Six pairs of tolerant/sensitive lines with similar flowering times within each pair, but different among the pairs, were used. Shoot biomass was similar in tolerant and <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines</b> in the SS and SF treatments, whereas the seed yield decreased more under SS and SF treatments in the <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines.</b> The flower, pod and seed numbers within all pairs was higher in the tolerant than in the <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines</b> in the non-saline controls, but the differences in numbers of seeds and pods further increased in both the SS and SF treatments. By contrast, neither the duration of flowering or podding, nor the percentage of flower or pod abortion, discriminated tolerant from <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines.</b> In non-saline controls the numbers of primary branches was 100 % higher across the <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines,</b> whereas the number of tertiary branches was 8 -fold higher across tolerant lines.

The rice plants were subjected to high temperature stress (39 – 43 °C) for 1 – 15 d from main stem flowering. Based on the heat stress index, they were divided into thermal resistant lines, semi-thermal resistant <b>lines,</b> semi-thermal <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines</b> and thermal <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines.</b> Therefore, the maintainer lines K 22 B, Bobai B and V 20 B belonged to thermal resistant lines, whereas II- 32 B, Zhongzhe B and Zhong 9 B belonged to thermal <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines.</b> For rice restorer lines, Minghui 63 had the highest thermal resistance, followed by R 207, P 32, P 929, and the lowest thermal resistant lines P 62 - 2 - 2, R 8006 and P 51. The correlation analysis indicated that the heat stress index was significantly correlated with seed-setting rate and abortive grain rate under heat stress, but not under natural conditions.

40|$|Abstract- Recent {{development}} has witnessed blackout incidents {{in many parts}} of the world. This can be due to voltage instability phenomena resulted from the stressed situation of the system where large amounts of real and reactive power are transported over long transmission lines. Besides, electric power systems are also exposed to various contingencies which contribute to over-loading of network branches, unsatisfactory voltages, leading to voltage collapse problems. Appropriate precaution can be made if the areas prone to voltage instability are clustered making a continuous monitoring is possible. This paper presents the weak area clustering technique based on <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines</b> and critical line outages in power system network. A new algorithm to automatically perform the line outage contingency analysis and ranking was developed. This technique results in critical line outages in the system. Subsequently, voltage stability analysis which confines the repetitive load flow and voltage stability indices computation revealed the <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines</b> in the system. Outcomes from both techniques will eventually cluster the weak area in the system, representing the resultant cluster deduced from each one. Implementation on the IEEE RTS revealed the effectiveness of the proposed technique, making it feasible to be implemented in a practical system which in turn helping in proper monitoring process to the specified cluster.

Two inbred lines differing in their leveI of tolerance to AI were used: Cateto 237 (tolerant) and L 36 (sensitive). The apical 20 mm of the primary root was divided into 2 -mm-Iong segments that were analyzed for total protein content and peroxidase activity. These results demonstrate that the total protein content along the root apex was not affected by AI in the tolerant inbred line, but decreased in the <b>sensitive</b> <b>line.</b> In the apical 2 mm of {{the root of the}} <b>sensitive</b> <b>line,</b> the expression of low molecular weight proteins (43 kDa or smaller) was decreased. Expression of low molecular proteins increased in the tolerant inbred line, even though total protein content did not increase. This suggests that some of these proteins could play a role in metal tolerance, perhaps as binding peptides. While the peroxidase activity of the tolerant inbred line did not change with exposure to AI, peroxidase activity in the apical 6 mm of the root of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>line</b> decreased. The tolerant inbred line constitutively expressed more anionic peroxidase isoforms. These results demonstrate that maintenance of protein expression may be {{an important component of the}} plant's resistance to AI stress, and that resistance to AI stress is associated with the higher expression of anionic peroxidase isoforms. 200...|$|R

Experiments were undertaken under different vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and water regimes (water stress (WS) and well watered (WW)) to test genotypic differences and trait relationships in the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) at which transpiration declines, canopy conductance (proxied by transpiration rate (TR, g H 2 O cm– 2 h– 1)), canopy temperature depression (CTD, °C), transpiration efficiency (TE, g kg– 1) and growth parameters, using 15 contrasting cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) genotypes. Under WW conditions at the vegetative and early podding stages, plant mass and leaf area were larger under low VPD, and was generally lower in tolerant than in sensitive genotypes. Several tolerant lines had lower TR under WW conditions and restricted TR more than <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines</b> under high VPD. Under WS conditions, transpiration declined at a lower FTSW in tolerant than in <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines.</b> Tolerant lines also maintained higher TR and CTD under severe stress. TE was higher in tolerant genotypes under WS conditions. Significant relationships were found between TR, and TE, CTD and FTSW under different water regimes. In summary, traits that condition how genotypes manage limited water resources discriminated between tolerant and <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines.</b> Arguably, a lower canopy conductance limits plant growth and plant water use, and allows tolerant lines to behave like unstressed plants until the soil is drier and to maintain a higher TR under severe stress, as lower TR at high VPD leads to higher TE...|$|R

40|$|This review {{deals with}} the complex sex {{determining}} system of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, governed by the interactions between a genetic determination {{and the influence of}} temperature, shown in both domestic and wild populations. Naturally sex reversed individuals are strongly suggested in two wild populations. This can be due to the masculinising temperatures which some fry encounter during their sex differentiation period when they colonise shallow waters, and/or to the influence of minor genetic factors. Differences regarding a) thermal responsiveness of sex ratios between and within Nile tilapia populations, b) maternal and paternal effects on temperature dependent sex ratios and c) nearly identical results in offspring of repeated matings, demonstrate that thermosensitivity is under genetic control. Selection experiments to increase the thermosensitivity revealed high responses in the high and low <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines.</b> The high-line showed ~ 90 % males after 2 generations of selection whereas the weakly <b>sensitive</b> <b>line</b> had 54 % males.

PD 0332991 is an orally active, highly selective inhibitor of the cyclin D kinases (CDK) 4 and CDK 6 with ability to block retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation in the low nanomolar range. To identify predictors of response, we determined the in vitro sensitivity to PD 0332991 across a panel of molecularly characterized human breast cancer cell lines. Methods Forty-seven human breast cancer and immortalized cell lines representing the known molecular subgroups of breast cancer were treated with PD 0332991 to determine IC 50 values. These data were analyzed against baseline gene expression data to identify genes associated with PD 0332991 response. Results Cell lines representing luminal estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) subtype (including those that are HER 2 amplified) were most sensitive to growth inhibition by PD 0332991 while nonluminal/basal subtypes were most resistant. Analysis of variance identified 450 differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells. pRb and cyclin D 1 were elevated and CDKN 2 A (p 16) was decreased in the most <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines.</b> Cell cycle analysis showed G 0 /G 1 arrest in <b>sensitive</b> cell <b>lines</b> and Western blot analysis demonstrated that Rb phosphorylation is blocked in <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines</b> but not resistant lines. PD 0332991 was synergistic with tamoxifen and trastuzumab in ER+ and HER 2 -amplified cell lines, respectively. PD 0332991 enhanced sensitivity to tamoxifen in cell lines with conditioned resistance to ER blockade. Conclusions These studies suggest a role for CDK 4 / 6 inhibition in some breast cancers and identify criteria for patient selection in clinical studies of PD 0332991...|$|R

Both lines showed an increase in ∆ 1 -pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate synthase 1 (P 5 CS 1 ) gene expression after induction of salt stress with enhanced expression in the root tissue of the tolerant line, while maximum expression was noted in the shoot tissues of the <b>sensitive</b> <b>line.</b> We observed a much reduced proline dehydrogenase (PDH) expression in both the root and shoot tissues of both canola lines, with more marked reduction of PDH expression in the shoot tissues than that in the root ones.

The preliminary screening experiment with 150 nl l− 1 concentrations of SO 2 and NO 2 in combination for 10 d, yielded well-defined <b>sensitive</b> and tolerant <b>lines</b> in both the stocks. However, the percentage frequency distribution of plants in different injury classes varied and stock S 2 showed a better segregation of different lines. In a subsequent experiment, treatment {{with a mixture of}} each gas at 100 nl l−lconcentration for 22 d caused a variable degree of growth reduction. As a result of air pollution treatment, most of the growth parameters were significantly (P < 0. 001) reduced in the <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines</b> of both the stocks, whereas the tolerant lines showed a marked resistance to the growth inhibitory effect of the pollutants.

To sustain root function in the hypoxic environment, a key adaptation for waterlogging tolerant plants is the formation of adventitious roots (ARs). We found that cucumber waterlogging tolerant line Zaoer-N seedlings adapt to waterlogging stress by developing {{a larger number of}} ARs in hypocotyls, while almost no AR is generated in <b>sensitive</b> <b>line</b> Pepino. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying AR emergence, the iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics approach was employed to map the proteomes of hypocotyls cells of the Zaoer-N and Pepino under control and waterlogging conditions. A total of 5, 508 proteins were identified and 146 were differentially regulated proteins (DRPs), of which 47 and 56 DRPs were specific to tolerant and <b>sensitive</b> <b>line,</b> respectively. In the waterlogged Zaoer-N hypocotyls, DRPs related to alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH), 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylicacid oxidases, peroxidases, 60 S ribosomal proteins, GSDL esterases/lipases, histone deacetylases and histone H 5 and were strongly overrepresented to manage the energy crisis, promote ethylene release, minimize oxidative damage, mobilize storage lipids, and stimulate cell division, differentiation and growth. The evaluations of ethylene production, ADH activity, pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) activity and ethanol production were in good agreement with the proteomic results. qRT-PCR analysis of the corresponding 146 genes further confirmed the accuracy of the observed protein abundance.

40|$|The {{diterpene}} ester PEP 005 {{is a novel}} anticancer {{agent that}} activates protein kinase C (PKC) and induces cell death in melanoma at high doses. We now describe the in vitro cytostatic effects of PEP 005 and the diterpene ester phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, observed in 20 % of human melanoma cell lines. Primary cultures of normal human neonatal fibroblasts were resistant to growth arrest, indicating a potential for tumor selectivity. <b>Sensitive</b> cell <b>lines</b> were induced to senesce and exhibited a G 1 and G 2 -M arrest. There was sustained expression of p 21 WAF 1 /CIP 1, irreversible dephosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, and transcriptional silencing of E 2 F-responsive genes in <b>sensitive</b> cell <b>lines.</b> Activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) /extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) 1 / 2 by PKC was required for diterpene ester–induced senescence. Expression profiling revealed that the MAP kinase inhibitor HREV 107 was expressed at a higher transcript level in resistant compared with <b>sensitive</b> cell <b>lines.</b> We propose that activation of PKC overstimulates the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in molecular changes leading to the senescent phenotype.

40|$|Abstract Background Cytokines of the {{transforming}} {{growth factor}} β (TGF-β) superfamily exert effects on proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation in various cell types. Cancer cells frequently acquire {{resistance to the}} anti-proliferative signals of TGF-β, which can be due to mutations in proteins of the signalling cascade. We compared the TGF-β-related signalling properties in B-cell lymphoma cell <b>lines</b> that were <b>sensitive</b> or resistant to TGF-β-induced anti-proliferative effects. Results TGF-β <b>sensitive</b> cell <b>lines</b> expressed higher cell surface levels of the activin receptor-like kinase 5 (Alk- 5), a TGF-β receptor type 1. The expression levels of the other TGF-β and bone morphogenetic protein receptors were comparable in the different cell lines. TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad 2 was similar in TGF-β sensitive and resistant cell lines. In contrast, activation of Smad 1 / 5 was restricted to cells that were sensitive to growth inhibition by TGF-β. Moreover, with activin A we detected limited anti-proliferative effects, strong phosphorylation of Smad 2, but no Smad 1 / 5 phosphorylation. Up-regulation of the TGF-β target genes Id 1 and Pai- 1 was identified in the TGF-β <b>sensitive</b> cell <b>lines.</b> Constitutive phosphorylation of MAPK p 38 was restricted to the TGF-β <b>sensitive</b> cell <b>lines.</b> Inhibition of p 38 MAPK led to reduced sensitivity to TGF-β. Conclusions We suggest that phosphorylation of Smad 1 / 5 {{is important for the}} anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β in B-cell lymphoma. Alk- 5 was highly expressed in the <b>sensitive</b> cell <b>lines,</b> and might be important for signalling through Smad 1 / 5. Our results indicate a role for p 38 MAPK in the regulation of TGF-β-induced anti-proliferative effects. </p...|$|R
40|$|Beside {{a direct}} toxicity, cadmium impact on plants {{involves}} both a secondary-induced water stress and an oxidative stress. Proliferating cell lines of Atriplex halimus {{were selected for}} their sensitivity or resistance to polyethylene glycol (PEG 10, 000, 20 %) and then exposed to 100 muM CdCl(2) in the simultaneous {{presence or absence of}} PEG 20 % or 150 mM NaCl. The PEG resistant cell line exhibited a higher growth in the presence of Cd than the <b>sensitive</b> <b>line,</b> although Cd acccumulation was higher in the former than in the latter. Exogenous PEG induced an increase in Cd concentration in the sensitive but not in the resistant cell line while NaCl induced a decrease in Cd accumulation in both cell lines. In the presence of Cd alone, the water content (WC) was higher and the osmotic potential was lower in PEG-sensitive than in PEG resistant line. The presence of PEG in the Cd-containing medium increased the WC and decreased the osmotic potential in PEG-resistant line comparatively to Cd stress alone, while an inverse trend was observed for the <b>sensitive</b> <b>line.</b> The PEG-resistant cell line displayed a higher ability to cope with oxidative stress in relation to an increase of endogenous antioxidants (glutathione and ascorbic acid), a high constitutive superoxide dismutase (EC 1. 15. 1. 1) activity and an efficient Cd-induced increase in glutathione reductase (GR) (EC 1. 6. 4. 1) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) (EC 1. 11. 1. 11). Cadmium tolerance in PEG-resistant line is thus not related to any strategy of Cd exclusion or osmotic adjustment but to tolerance mechanisms allowing the tissue to restrict the deleterious impact of accumulated Cd...|$|R
40|$|Acid soils {{severely}} reduce maize (Zea mays L.) yield in the tropics. Breeding for {{tolerance to}} soil acidity provides a permanent, environmentally friendly, and inexpensive {{solution to the}} problem. This study was carried out to determine {{the relative importance of}} additive, dominant, and epistatic effects on maize grain-yields in different tropical genotypes. Divergent selection in three populations (SA 4, SA 5, and SA 7) provided inbred <b>lines</b> tolerant or <b>sensitive</b> to acid soils. The tolerant and <b>sensitive</b> <b>lines</b> from each population were used to obtain the F 1, F 2, F 3, back-crosses, second back-crosses, and selfed back-cross generations. In addition, the tolerant lines from SA 4 and SA 5 were crossed with a <b>sensitive</b> <b>line</b> from the Tuxpeño Sequía population, from which the same generations were also derived. All generations from each of the five sets of crosses were evaluated in three acid-soil environments and one non-acid-soil environment. A generation-mean analysis was performed on each set for yield. The sequential sum of squares associated with additive, dominance, and digenic epistatic effects were used to estimate the relative importance of each genetic effect. Epistasis was not important in any set in the non-acid-soil environment, with dominance accounting for 80. 76 % of the total variation among generation means across sets. In acid-soil environments, epistasis was more important. The relative importance of digenic epistasis was greater in those evaluations with large experimental errors. The tolerant line from population SA 5 was prone to severe root lodging, suggesting a very poor root system. Apparently, the tolerance to soil acidity in this line is not associated with a large root system. Peer-reviewe...|$|R
