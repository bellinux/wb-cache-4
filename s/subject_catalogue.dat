5000|$|The Great Library of Alexandria, {{created by}} Ptolemy I {{after the death}} of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, was created to house the {{entirety}} of Greek literature. It was notable for its famous librarians: Demetrius, Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Callimachus. These scholars contributed significantly to the collection and cataloging of the wide variety of scrolls in the library's collection. Most notably, Callimachus created what is considered to be the first <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> of the library holdings, called the pinakes. The pinakes contained 120 scrolls arranged into ten subject classes; each class was then subdivided, listing authors alphabetically by titles. The librarians at Alexandria were considered the [...] "custodians of learning".|$|E
50|$|Analysis of the <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> {{shows that}} as of 1820 44% of the titles in the library were {{concerned}} with history, and 16% were literature of various kinds. An extensive range of subjects was represented by smaller numbers of works. Recent literature was not particularly well represented, with, for instance, no works by Jane Austen being listed. It seems that library policy was only to collect novels once {{it was clear that}} the author in question had gained an enduring and positive reputation. 260 editions of the Bible were included, and works from other European countries were well represented. For instance, 57% of the history titles had been published outside Britain. There was a good selection of library catalogues from other collections, and runs of the official publications of parliament. For an eighteenth-century library there was an unusually good selection of periodicals, although newspapers were not collected.|$|E

5000|$|Leeser Rosenthal's son George (1828-1909) was {{a banker}} in Amsterdam when he {{inherited}} his father's library. George Rosenthal housed the library {{in his home}} on Amsterdam's Herengracht and commissioned the Dutch-Jewish bibliographer Meijer Roest (1821-1889) to compile a catalogue of the collection. The catalogue, entitled [...] Catalog der Hebraica und Judaica aus der L.Rosenthal'schen Bibliothek was published in two volumes in 1875 with Leeser Rosenthal's own catalogue, Yodea Sefer as an appendix. Leeser Rosenthal's children wanted the library to remain undivided {{and serve as a}} public resource in memory of their learned father. To this end, they offered the collection to Chancellor Bismarck to be housed in the Kaiserliche und Königliche Bibliothek in Berlin, but he declined the offer. Offers to other European and American libraries also came to nothing. In 1880, the library of the city and university of Amsterdam moved to the former archery ranges on Singel canal, where there was space for the library to expand. Following this, Rosenthal's heirs decided to present their father's library to the city of Amsterdam. It was accepted 'with warmest thanks for a princely gift' and Meijer Roest was appointed curator the year after. Since the Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana became part of the University of Amsterdam's library, the collection has been continually expanded in keeping with its assumed role as a modern, functional library covering all fields of Jewish study. Roest was succeeded as curator by Jeremias M. Hillesum (1863-1943), who made significant additions to the library. He, in turn, was followed by Louis Hirschel (1895-1944), who in 1940 completed a <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> for the library.|$|E
40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{effectiveness}} of library subject catalogues as tools of research. We know that they are indispensable from a theoretical point of view, and from general observation of their use and the results of a few studies we can conclude that they are generally compatible with the library use habits of readers. Some of the general conclusions which have been drawn from studies of the <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> are: that there is no significant difference between the amount of author catalogue use and <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> use; that the non- specialist ordinarily will make more use of the <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> than the specialist; and that most of the use of the <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> is for materials in English and of fairly recent date. If the second of these generalizations is true, namely that <b>subject</b> <b>catalogue</b> use is primarily by non- specialists, a discussion of the classified catalogue as a research tool may be a somewhat sterile exercise. On the other hand, we can remind ourselves that the importance of research isn't determined by popular vote, so even a minority use should justify its consideration. In any case, classification and classified catalogues have a high degree of relevancy. This was my reason for agreeing to discuss the subject of the role of the classified catalogue in research. In evaluating what I have to say about classification, one general caveat must be observed. My remarks on classification will relate exclusively to its use in the classified catalogue. While some points might have relevance to the classification of books for shelving, others might have differing relevance or no relevance whatever. No effort will be made here to indicate when there is or is not a common ground in problems of shelf classification and the classified catalogue. A second caveat is that the limitations of my experience withpublished or submitted for publicatio...|$|E

In this sense, this research is a part of a broader project which analyses ISKO as an academic space that promotes a dialogical dimension among those theoretical questions. In this sense, it aims to analyze the presence of <b>subject</b> <b>cataloguing</b> in the discussions of knowledge organization as well as how the authors of such subject dialogue each other. Considering the questions, the full collection of ISKO and ISKO-Spain conference proceedings were analyzed in order to verify how present were <b>subject</b> <b>cataloguing</b> matters in those collections. It was possible to identify a group of 36 articles (27 from International ISKO and 9 from ISKO – Spain) whose references were bibliometrically analyzed in terms of documentary forms, average life, language and citation analysis. The results showed that the major ISKO and ISKO-Spain literature on <b>subject</b> <b>cataloguing</b> is based on journal articles, mostly published in English, presenting a relatively young average life (14 years for ISKO and 10 for ISKO-Spain).

A esse corpus procedeu-se uma análise bibliométrica relativa às fontes documentais utilizadas (forma, língua e vida média) e aos autores citados (redes de citação por meio do software PAJEK).
