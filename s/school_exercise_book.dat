He collected his stories, poetry, cartoons and caricatures in a Quarry Bank High <b>School</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>book</b> that he called the Daily Howl. The drawings were often of crippled people, and the writings satirical, and throughout the book was an abundance of wordplay. According to classmate Bill Turner, Lennon created the Daily Howl to amuse his best friend and later Quarrymen bandmate Pete Shotton, to whom he would show his work before he let anyone else see it. Turner said that Lennon [...] "had an obsession for Wigan Pier. It kept cropping up", and in Lennon's story A Carrot in a Potato Mine, [...] "the mine {{was at the end of}} Wigan Pier." [...] Turner described how one of Lennon's cartoons depicted a bus stop sign annotated with the question, [...] "Why?". Above was a flying pancake, and below, [...] "a blind man wearing glasses leading along a blind dog—also wearing glasses".|$|E

Originally written in a <b>school</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>book,</b> it was hidden, as its discovery could have endangered Chukovskaya. With the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, and his subsequent denunciation by Nikita Khrushchev, Chukovskaya reexamined the work, edited out a no-longer-relevant introduction, and sought publication in 1962. The book was nearly published in 1963, but was pulled before it could be released due to a changing political climate. It finally saw release in France in 1965 in Russian but with a changed title ("The Deserted House") and different character names. It was then published in the United States, in Russian, with the correct title, in Novy Zhurnal. [...] However, the book was not published in Chukovskaya's native country, and she forbade publication of any other work until after the release in Russia of Sofia Petrovna. The book was not published in the Soviet Union until 1988 amidst Glasnost.|$|E

50|$|AA Raiba {{had hung}} three large {{unfinished}} works from his Kashmir Series of the 1950s {{on the walls}} of his studio. These unfinished panoramas of Kashmir's wintry landscapes, towns and temples, include a large primed canvas of coarse coatings on jute whose embedded designs and relief, reveal a plethora of stages to fathom from the artist's process and technique. Strong and weathered, the paintings have come out of his studio after sixty years. They will dramatically take up the space of the present exhibition, calling attention to the materials he used: jute or old sarees, treated with invented mixtures, that primed, sized, gave texture, and unfading colour to his paintings. A box of school notebooks form a part his studio. Raiba had pasted into <b>school</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>books</b> hundreds of his drawings, jottings and cuttings, folds of papers which open up to larger grids of space, from which he drew his world of references.

Also from his studio, are printmaking copper-plates, which he had once cut up into calligraphic stencils, to make a three-dimensional sculptural work.

40|$|Children’s writing» in Russia {{and in the}} Soviet Union {{are without}} a doubt sources as new as they are precious, beyond any disquisitions {{on the nature of}} the sources, on adult {{influence}} on the child and on the spontaneity of the child in the learning process. For this reason the present essay analyses the different typologies of «children’s writing», produced at school, in the sections of the Pioneer Organisation, in the orphanages and in the family itself, starting from the general context of mass alphabetisation. For the first time in the history of the Soviet Union, this reveals that children were able to not only read but also to write, and could use writing to learn complex knowledge, to communicate with adults, and to recount dramatic experiences of the Second World War. This essay aims to grasp the way in which these sources can shed new light on our knowledge of the history of childhood and Soviet education in general. It is divided into three parts: the first analyses <b>school</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>books</b> (dealing with the history of literature), valuable for the analysis of the evolution of teaching methodology and the content of Soviet school reform. The second part deals with letters sent by adolescents to the governmental Authorities, which are useful for reconstructing the process of development of the first Pioneer Organisations for communist adolescents in the interwar period. The third studies diaries and war stories which bear witness to the injustices of Stalinism and the dramatic experiences of the Nazi occupation. The enormous quantity of «children’s writing» preserved in the Archives are evidence of the almost sacred value attributed to writing as palpable evidence of the great heroic deeds of the Soviet people in the edification of communism and in their defeat of Nazism...|$|R
