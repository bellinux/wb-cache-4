40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} user navigation equipment of <b>satellite</b> <b>radionavigation</b> systems (GLONASS/GPS) for measuring the inclination of the aerial axis of rotation. The authors have demonstrated that the required accuracy of the angular inclination is achieved only in a relative phase mode, which is not always feasible. The application of filtering for measured parameters of navigation equipment has namely been used for planimetric coordinates. Filtering is performed using the second order Kalman filter. It has significant effect; thus, even at a speed of 1 rpm, there is no disruption in the autonomous coded mode; for the relative phase mode, the required accuracy is achieved at 3 rpm...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWith the {{increase}} of global satellite navigation systems (GNSS) in {{a limited number of}} frequency bands, the current spectrum dedicated to satellite navigation encounters congestion. A possible path to keep modernizing the different GNSS is to find new frequency bands where a <b>satellite</b> <b>radionavigation</b> service (RNSS) could be provided. This article takes a regulatory approach to identify potential candidate bands, which are then reviewed in detail to assess their usability for a new RNSS deployment. The results of this analysis are: (1) there exist spaces in the spectrum where a RNSS allocation exists or could be added. For example, the option consisting in adding another RNSS allocation into aeronautical radio-navigation service (ARNS) bands. However, such allocation change is not planned and would require important commitment from administrations and long negotiations with the civil aviation community; (2) the use of telecommunication signals of opportunity coming from an hybrid satellite-terrestrial network of emitters. Among these solutions, some would permit to combine navigation and telecommunication services, offering a huge opportunity for mass market application...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Galileo, the European Satellite Navigation System, is {{currently}} under development. Even before first satellites {{of the constellation}} are launched, Galileo signals will be provided through ground based Navigation Signal Generators for the investigation of signal performance and characteristics. These low power devices, called Pseudolites (Pseudo-Satellites), will transmit signals equivalent to those which are transmitted by the in-orbit satellites. However, from the regulatory point of view they are not providing <b>Radionavigation</b> <b>Satellite</b> Service (RNSS) as defined in International Tele communication Union (ITU) Radio Regulations but "something else". This has to be investigated, because {{it is expected that}} Pseudolites (PLs) will, beyond their roles to evaluate signal performances in the early phase of the program...|$|R
40|$|The European {{initiative}} for {{the provision of}} <b>Radionavigation</b> <b>Satellite</b> Services (RNSS) â€“ GALILEO - will comprise all segments for an independent and fully operational infrastructure under civil control. Some of the signal transmissions will share carrier frequencies and some of the available spectrum with the USGPS system. Signals on common centre frequencies have been designed for functional inter- operability, making GPS and GALILEO two systems of the next generation infrastructure for Global Navigation Satellite Services. The GALILEO system architecture comprises a space segment, the associated ground segment for performance monitoring and satellite control and, last but not least, the User segment. This paper provides a general overview of the GALILEO architecture. The individual segments of the GALILEO architecture and their internal interaction are described. Finally, external interfaces to other systems for the provisioning of time as well as the boundaries of the GALILEO system are explained...|$|R
50|$|Link 16 is a TDMA-based secure, jam-resistant, {{high-speed}} {{digital data}} link which operates {{in the radio}} frequency band 960-1,215 MHz, allocated {{in line with the}} ITU Radio Regulations to the aeronautical radionavigation service and to the <b>radionavigation</b> <b>satellite</b> service. This frequency range limits the exchange of information to users within line-of-sight of one another, although with satellite capabilities and adhoc protocols, it is nowadays possible to pass Link 16 data over long-haul protocols such as TCP/IP using MIL-STD 3011 (JREAP) or STANAG 5602 (SIMPLE). It uses the transmission characteristics and protocols, conventions, and fixed-length or variable length message formats defined by MIL-STD 6016, STANAG 5516 (formerly the JTIDS technical interface design plan). Information is typically passed at one of three data rates: 31.6, 57.6, or 115.2 kilobits per second, although the radios and waveform FHSS itself can support throughput values well over 1 Mbit/s.|$|R
40|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{artificial}} satellites, the concept of navigating in space {{and the desire to}} understand and validate the laws of planetary and satellite motion dates back centuries. At the initiation of orbital flight in 1957, space navigation was dominated by inertial and groundbased tracking methods, underpinned by the laws of planetary motion. It was early in the 1980 s that GPS was first explored as a system useful for refining the position, velocity, and timing (PVT) of other spacecraft equipped with GPS receivers. As a result, an entirely new GPS utility was developed beyond its original purpose of providing PVT services for land, maritime, and air applications. Spacecraft both above and below the GPS constellation now receive the GPS signals, including the signals that spill over the limb of the Earth. The use of <b>radionavigation</b> <b>satellite</b> services for space navigation in High Earth Orbits is in fact a capability unique to GPS. Support to GPS space applications is being studied and planned as an important improvement to GPS. This paper discusses the formalization of PVT services in space as part of an overall GPS improvement effort. It describes the GPS Space Service Volume (SSV) and compares it to the Terrestrial Service Volume (TSV). It also discusses SSV coverage with the current GPS constellation, coverage characteristics as a function of altitude, expected power levels, and coverage figures of merit...|$|R
40|$|<b>Radionavigation</b> <b>Satellite</b> Service (RNSS) {{systems such}} as the U. S. Global Positioning System (GPS) and the Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) are {{primarily}} being used today in the space-to-Earth direction (i. e., from GPS satellite to Earth user) for {{a broad range of}} applications such as geological surveying; aircraft, automobile, and maritime navigation; hiking and mountain climbing; and precision farming and mining. However, these navigation systems are being used increasingly in space. Beginning with the launch of the TOPEX/Poseidon remote-sensing mission in 1992, over 90 GPS receivers have flown onboard spacecraft for such applications as real-time spacecraft navigation, three-axis attitude control, precise time synchronization, precision orbit determination, and atmospheric profiling. In addition to use onboard many science spacecraft, GPS has been used or is planned to be used onboard the shuttles, the International Space Station, the International Space Station Emergency Crew Return Vehicle, and many commercial satellite {{systems such as}} Orbcomm, Globalstar, and Teledesic. From a frequency spectrum standpoint, however, one important difference between the space and terrestrial uses of GPS is that it is being used in space with no interference protection. This is because there is no frequency allocation for the space-to-space use of GPS (i. e., from GPS satellite to user spacecraft) in the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) regulatory table of frequency allocations. If another space-based or groundbased radio system interferes with a spaceborne GPS user, the spaceborne user presently has no recourse other than to accept the interference. Consequently, for {{the past year and a}} half, the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field and other Government agencies have been working within ITU toward obtaining a GPS space-to-space allocation at the next World Radio Conference in the year 2000 (WRC 2000). Numerous interference studies have been conducted in support of a primary space-tospace allocation in the 1215 - to 1260 -MHz and 1559 - to 1610 -MHz RNSS bands. Most of these studies and analyses were performed by Glenn and submitted as U. S. input documents to the international Working Party 8 D meetings in Geneva, Switzerland. In the structure of the ITU, Working Party 8 D is responsible for frequency spectrum issues in the RNSS and the mobile satellite service (MSS). The full texts of the studies are available from the ITU web site under Working Party 8 D contributions. Note that because spaceborne RNSS receivers operate in a receive-only mode with navigation signals already being broadcast toward the Earth, the addition of a space-tospace allocation will not result in interference with other systems. A space-based RNSS receiver, however, could experience interference from systems of other services, including intraservice interference from other RNSS systems. The interference scenarios examined in the studies can be inferred from the following frequency allocation charts. In these charts, services labeled in all capital letters (e. g., "ARNS") have primary status, whereas those labeled with sentence-style capitalization (e. g., "Amateur radio") have secondary status (i. e., a service with secondary status cannot claim interference protection from or cause harmful interference to a service with primary status). Charts showing the ITU frequency allocations in the 960 to 1350 MHZ range and the 1525 - 1660 MHZ range are discussed and presented...|$|R
