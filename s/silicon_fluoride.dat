2500|$|Silicon and {{silicon carbide}} readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, {{reactive}} and volatile silicon tetrahalides. Silicon tetrafluoride {{may also be}} made by fluorinating the other silicon halides, and is produced by the attack of hydrofluoric acid on glass. Heating two different tetrahalides together also produce a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr3 through SiFClBr2 to SiFCl2Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements {{is illustrated by the}} change from an infinite ionic structure in aluminium fluoride to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom. Silicon tetrachloride is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon esters. The silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks.

30|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for the recovery of silica such as acid or alkali leaching, followed by separation and purification using different techniques. US Patent No. 4539187 (1985) describes a method where CFA is reacted with fluorosilicic acid and hydrogen fluoride at a high temperature to form fluorides of Fe, Al and Si. The fluoride mixture is distilled, separating the aqueous and gaseous <b>silicon</b> <b>fluoride</b> from the mixtures, hydrolyzing the silicon fluorides vapor, and recovering silicon dioxide in high purity form. Recently, US Patent No. 0287827 A 1 (2010) released a method where a mixture of coal and CFA is reacted with hydrogen fluoride in water to produce a liquid stream containing <b>silicon</b> <b>fluoride</b> and metal fluorides, and a solid stream containing unreacted coal and S compounds. Sulfur compounds are reacted with metallic nitrates dissolved in the water, which separated the aqueous solution of nitrate, S and metallic ions from the solid coal, and the solid coal is then washed with water. Subsequently, <b>silicon</b> <b>fluoride</b> and metal fluorides are contacted with metallic nitrates in an aqueous mixture to form solid silicon dioxide, and solid silicon dioxide is separated from the aqueous mixture. This process has recovered high purity silica from CFA. However, acid leaching is not always appropriate because it needs better acid resistant and air-tight processing equipment and it causes environmental pollution. This problem can be solved by using alkaline leaching methods. US Patent Nos. 0119426 A 1 (2010) and 7871583 B 2 (2011) released an alkaline leaching method for the recovery of silica from CFA, where Si is leached using NaOH in the form of Na 2 SiO 3 solution.

The extent of surface fluorination {{and the type of}} fluorinated species depend on the solvent and treatment procedure. The silicas that were studied show evidence of the formation of two types of surface-fluorinated silicon species: suface-bonded tetrahedral species with a general formula of On-Si(OH) 4 - n - mFm and, to a lesser extent, octahedral species [FnSi(OH) 6 - n] 2 -, which were formed already at low temperature. The thermal decomposition of [FnSi(OH) 6 - n] 2 - leads to the removal of corresponding <b>silicon</b> <b>fluorides</b> and hydroxyfluorides, and surface-bonded O 3 Si-F and O-SiF 3 can be additionally formed.

To complete the circuit, the solid remaining after pyrohydrolysis is treated with the nitric acid stream to produce Al(NO 3) (3) for recycling. The technique satisfies the objective of not requiring on-going purchase of chemicals. The application of this work is primarily as part of a process for producing ultra-clean coal.

Photoluminescence (PL) of the pillar structures which have been downsized exhibits visible and infrared emissions, which are attributable to microscopic pillars and to the confinement of excited carriers in the Si core, respectively.

The results suggest that WF 6 rapidly forms a thin corrosion film on Si(100) above 300 K which exerts a pronounced passivating effect as the layer begins to thicken.

The results of the tests indicate that gelatin strike does not coagulate the silica at the low concentration of silica ({tilde 30 } ppm) expected in the SS&C dissolver solutions because the silicon is complexed with fluoride ions (e. g., SiF{sub 6 }{sup - 2 }).

40|$|The {{determination}} of the energy levels and the probabilities of transition between them, by the formal analysis of observed electronic, vibrational, and rotational band structures, forms the direct goal of all investigations of molecular spectra, but the significance of such data lies {{in the possibility of}} relating them theoretically to more concrete properties of molecules and the radiation field. From the well developed electronic spectra of diatomic molecules, it has been possible, with the aid of the non-relativistic quantum mechanics, to obtain accurate moments of inertia, molecular potential functions, electronic structures, and detailed information concerning the coupling of spin and orbital angular monenta with the angular momentum of nuclear rotation. The silicon fluori 1 e molecule has been investigated in this laboratory, and is found to emit bands whose vibrational and rotational structures can be analyzed in this detailed fashion. Like <b>silicon</b> <b>fluoride,</b> however, the great majority of diatomic molecules are formed only under the unusual conditions of electrical discharge, or in high temperature furnaces, so that although their spectra are of great theoretical interest, the chemist is eager to proceed to a study of polyatomic molecules, in the hope that their more practically interesting structures might also be determined with the accuracy and assurance which characterize the spectroscopic determinations of the constants of diatomic molecules. Some {{progress has been made in}} the {{determination of}} molecule potential functions from the vibrational term values deduced from Raman and infrared spectra, but in no case can the calculations be carried out with great generality, since the number of known term values is always small compared with the total number of potential constants in even so restricted a potential function as the simple quadratic type. For the determination of nuclear configurations and bond distances, however, a knowledge of the rotational terms is required. The spectra of about twelve of the simpler polyatomic molecules have been subjected to rotational analyses, and a number of bond distances are known with considerable accuracy, yet the number of molecules whose rotational fine structure has been resolved even with the most powerful instruments is small. Consequently, it was felt desirable to investigate the spectra of a number of other promising polyatomic molecules, with the purpose of carrying out complete rotational analyses of all resolvable bands, and ascertaining the value of the unresolved band envelopes in determining the structures of such molecules, in the cases in which resolution is no longer possible. Although many of the compounds investigated absorbed too feebly to be photographed under high dispersion with the present infrared sensitizations, the location and relative intensities of their bands, determined by low dispersion measurements, will be reported in the hope that these compounds may be reinvestigated in the future with improved techniques. ...|$|E

For the temporarily resolved macroscopic model, a relation between the integral equation used for calculation of the so called synchronization states and the Helmholtz differential equation is presented. The nanopore morphology during current oscillations is measured by high resolution scanning electron microscopy and calculated using the microscopic model {{in the form of}} a spatio temporarily resolved two dimensional cellular automate. Two types of silicon oxide with different nanopore densities are visible which are shown to be the physical origin of the synchronization of the oscillation...|$|R
