5|$|On March 12, all South Vietnamese <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{survived the}} North Vietnamese assault {{gathered}} {{at the headquarters of}} the 23rd Infantry Division and Hoa Binh airfield. Unfortunately, those soldiers were without their leaders, because both Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang were captured by the North Vietnamese {{in the early hours of}} the day. From Saigon, President Nguyen Van Thieu ordered Phu to hold all South Vietnamese positions at the eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, where they could stage a counter-attack. Phu drew up a plan to retake Ban Me Thuot that would involve the last two remaining regiments (44th and 45th Infantry Regiments) of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and the <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{gathered at the}} 23rd Infantry Division headquarters and Hoa Binh airfield. Thieu approved the plan at dawn, and authorised Phu to make full use of three Republic of Vietnam Air Force units (6th Air Force Division belonging to the ARVN 2nd Brigade, 1st Air Force Division at Da Nang Air Base, and the 4th Air Force Division at Cần Thơ).|$|E

It was finished by 1547, when Mills was paid £1,000 for his work and to discharge the <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been guarding the site during the project.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{artillery}} introduced in England eventually {{spread to the}} rest of the British Isles. Although up to a thousand Irish <b>soldiers</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> served in Europe returned during the war, bringing with them experience of siege warfare from the Thirty Years' War in Europe, it was the arrival of Oliver Cromwell's train of siege guns in 1649 that transformed the conflict, and the fate of local castles. None of the Irish castles could withstand these Parliamentary weapons and most quickly surrendered. In 1650 Cromwell invaded Scotland and again his heavily artillery proved decisive.|$|E
