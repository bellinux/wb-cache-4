It is designed as much as practical based on neutron absorber solution injection into the existing core while the changes and interferences with the existing core structure are kept to a minimum. Core neutronic calculations were performed using MCNPX 2. 6. 0 and MTR_PC package for the current operational core equipped with the second <b>shutdown</b> <b>system,</b> and one experiment was conducted in the Tehran Research Reactor to test the neutronic calculations.

5000|$|The Pickering A {{system did}} not {{originally}} {{have a second}} independent <b>shutdown</b> <b>system.</b> The Bruce containment concept differs: the reactor's reactivity mechanism deck serves {{as a part of}} the containment boundary, is closer to the reactor, and more prone to damage in the event of an accident ("accidental physical disassembly").

The trust of the public on the government is influenced by the factors of moral and competence. That is, if the policy chosen by the government is effective, the public come to trust their government more. Focusing on the factors of the government competence, this study examined to know how the effectiveness and efficiency of governmental policies have impact on the public trust on the government.

50|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} need the safety systems to avoid mission {{critical}} failures. The worst possible consequence {{that can result}} is leakage of radioactive materials (U-235 or Pu-239). One of the systems to avoid mission critical failures for nuclear power plant is <b>shutdown</b> <b>system.</b> It has two different forms: rod controls and safety injection control. When problem occurs in the nuclear power plant, the rod control <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> drops the rods automatically and stops the chain reaction. The safety injection control injects liquid immediately when the system faces the problem in nuclear reactor and stops the chain reaction. Both systems are usually automatically operated, but also can be manually activated.|$|R

50|$|The AWHR is an {{innovation}} in renewable energy safety {{as it will}} limit the use of fissile uranium-235 to breeding fissile uranium-233 from fertile thorium-232. The extraction of nuclear energy from the 90th element Thorium {{is said to have}} more energy than the world's oil, coal, and uranium combined. The AHWR has safety features that distinguish it from conventional lightwater nuclear reactors. Some of these features consist of: strong safety systems, reduction of heat from core through a built in cooling system, multiple <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems,</b> and a fail-safe procedure that consist of a poison that shuts down the system {{in the case of a}} technical failure (FBR). The potential threat scientists try to avoid in reactors is the buildup of heat because nuclear energy escalates when it reacts with, high temperatures, high pressures, and chemical reactions. The AHWR has features that helps reduce the probability of this occurrence through the: negative reactivity coefficients, low power density, low excess reactivity in the core, and proper selection of material, attributes built in.|$|E
50|$|In {{controlled}} {{testing in}} 1986, with the EBR-II reactor running {{at full power}} and the emergency <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> disabled, the reactor's supply of electricity was intentionally turned off, causing the coolant pumps to stop. This is a worse scenario than {{what happened in the}} Fukushima Nuclear Disaster. (At Fukushima, which began operation in 1971, the emergency shutdown system turned off the reactor as soon as it detected the earthquake. However the tsunami destroyed the electric generators powering the coolant pumps, which needed to continue running after the reactor shutdown. Subsequently, the core overheated and meltdown occurred.) EBR-II, in contrast, handled the event without creating a dangerous situation. EBR-II had a negative thermal coefficient of reactivity that shut down the reactor when the temperature increased due to loss of the coolant pumps; the time required to heat the large pool of sodium surrounding the reactor provided a sufficient time buffer for the passive decay heat removal system to prevent the EBR-II reactor from melting down. The safe shutdown of the EBR-II relied only on the laws of physics and did not require operator or control system intervention.|$|E
50|$|The pool-type reactor {{design of}} the EBR-II {{provides}} passive safety: the reactor core, its fuel handling equipment, and many other systems of the reactor are submerged under molten sodium. By providing a fluid which readily conducts heat from the fuel to the coolant, and which operates at relatively low temperatures, the EBR-II takes maximum advantage of expansion of the coolant, fuel, and structure during off-normal events which increase temperatures. The expansion of the fuel and structure in an off-normal situation causes the system to shut down even without human operator intervention. In April 1986, two special tests were performed on the EBR-II, in which the main primary cooling pumps were shut off with the reactor at full power (62.5 megawatts, thermal). By not allowing the normal <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> to interfere, the reactor power dropped to near zero within about 300 seconds. No damage to the fuel or the reactor resulted. The same day, this demonstration was followed by another important test. With the reactor again at full power, flow in the secondary cooling system was stopped. This test caused the temperature to increase, since there was nowhere for the reactor heat to go. As the primary (reactor) cooling system became hotter, the fuel, sodium coolant, and structure expanded, and the reactor shut down. This test showed that it will shut down using inherent features such as thermal expansion, even if the ability to remove heat from the primary cooling system is lost.|$|E

30|$|This example {{illustrates}} a state-based schedule for an industrial <b>shutdown</b> <b>system</b> using TMR. We assume multiple controllers periodically receive the sensor samples. In each communication cycle, the controllers receive the temperature readings from either two sensors (best and average-case) or three sensors (worst-case) {{and make the}} decision by voting on the results. If {{two of the three}} temperature sensors report a temperature beyond a set threshold, the <b>system</b> will <b>shutdown</b> the <b>system,</b> because the voting will already be decisive. Otherwise, the controllers will receive the third sensor value and will include it in the voting process.|$|R

50|$|Liquid neutron {{absorbers}} {{are also}} used in rapid <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> for light water reactors. Following a SCRAM, if the reactor (or section(s) thereof) are not below the shutdown margin (that is, they could return to a critical state due to insertion of positive reactivity from cooling, poison decay, or other uncontrolled conditions), the operators can inject solutions containing neutron poisons directly into the reactor coolant. Neutron poisons are water-based solutions that contain chemicals that absorb neutrons, such as common household borax, sodium polyborate, boric acid, or gadolinium nitrate, causing a decrease in neutron multiplication, and thus shutting down the reactor without use of the control rods. In the PWR, these neutron absorbing solutions are stored in pressurized tanks (called accumulators) that {{are attached to the}} primary coolant system via valves; a varying level of neutron absorbent is kept within the primary coolant at all times, and is increased using the accumulators {{in the event of a}} failure of all of the control rods to insert, which will promptly bring the reactor below the shutdown margin. In the BWR, soluble neutron absorbers are found within the Standby Liquid Control System (SLCS), which uses redundant battery-operated injection pumps, or, in the latest models, high pressure nitrogen gas to inject the neutron absorber solution into the reactor vessel against any pressure within. Because they may delay the restart of a reactor, these systems are only used to shut down the reactor if control rod insertion fails. This concern is especially significant in a BWR, where injection of liquid boron would cause precipitation of solid boron compounds on fuel cladding, which would prevent the reactor from restarting until the boron deposits were removed.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{is the final}} submission for the Engineering Internship unit (ENG 450), undertaken at WorleyParsons Resources and Energy for a duration of 19 weeks. The main objective of the final year engineering internship is to provide exposure to the applied world of engineering design or research {{through a period of}} workplace employment in a relevant area of engineering. As such, it aims to address and develop several technical and process competencies as defined by Engineers Australia. As a pre-cursor to the work undertaken as part of the Engineering Internship, the nature of the processes on the concerned facilities (Bayu-Undan) are explored. The scope of the specific Bayu-Undan II project assigned is subsequently defined in pursuit of increased hydrocarbon liquids and LNG production. The work undertaken, as detailed in this report, encompasses the activities assigned to the Instrumentation and Control discipline in the preliminary 'planning' phase of the project (formally referred to as pre-Front End Engineering Design). These tasks/activities served as the primary deliverables required for this phase of the project. An Instrument feasibility study is provided to essentially outline the scope of work required from an instrumentation perspective, in order to facilitate the defined 'flow-line' tie-ins to occur. As such, it provides the basis for specification and configuration of the associated instrumentation. As a means of establishing a basis for the required modifications, the hardware components, layout, architecture and configuration of the control and <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> on the existing facilities is subsequently explored. The modification and/or configuration of the control and <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems,</b> in order to accommodate the defined 'flow-line' tie-ins, are subsequently provided as the control and <b>shutdown</b> <b>systems</b> vendor scope of work.
