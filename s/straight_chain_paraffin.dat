30|$|The present work {{deals with}} {{isomerization}} of <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> <b>paraffin,</b> n-hexane with an {{aim to make}} up loss in gasoline quantity as well as octane. This is due to its reduced benzene content warranted by its carcinogenic nature. Performance of impregnation of alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba) on Pt/desilicated (and dealuminated) zeolites Beta was studied and found that isomer selectivity as high as 99 % with stable catalytic performance is achievable. Furthermore, replacing part of hydrogen (15 %) with carbon dioxide in hydrogen as carrier gas improves hexane conversion. Hexane conversion increased as Mg–<[*]Ba–<[*]Ca–<[*]Sr–Pt/deSi Beta. Observed performance parameters have been explained {{on the basis of}} reported variation in acidity due to both alkaline earth metals and CO 2.|$|E

The samples range in age between 2000 and 9000 years (C- 14 -age of organic C). They contain 100 - 300 ppm of extractable fatcompounds and 20 - 70 ppm of hydrocarbons. There is no connection between the original distribution of the homologous series of n-fatty acids and n-paraffins.

The thesis {{covers the}} {{fundamentals}} of refining and fuel technology, engine technology as regards parameters which influence knock {{and the results of}} engine tests. Definitions of octane number and the interpretation of the system developed to establish these numbers using the CFR engine are given. The literature survey covers the fundamental refining processes which are used to upgrade gasoline components in order to raise their octane quality or to achieve a more suitable distillation range. Some of the reactions which take place are described and operating conditions for the reactions to occur are given. The chemistry of fuels which affects their octane quality is given and discussed.

40|$|Samples of zeolite Y {{in which}} part of the Na+ ions were {{exchanged}} by metal ions such as Ni 2 +, Cu 2 +, or others were reduced by H 2 to 550 Deg. The resulting samples were investigated by magnetic and ESR methods. The {{results indicate that the}} metal atoms produced by the redn. diffuse out of the pores and form relatively large sized crystals at the outer surface of the zeolite particles. If, previous to the redn., 2 types of metal ions are present, for instance Ni 2 + and Cu 2 +, redn. may, under favorable circumstances, lead to the formation of crystals of alloys. Alloy formation had a profound influence on the type of conversion of hexane. Ni-on-zeolite catalysts show a hydrogenolytic reaction producing CH 4 and <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> <b>paraffins</b> of lower mol. wt. Ni-Cu zeolite catalysts are less active, but show considerable isomerization to singly branched isoparaffins. Small amts. of 2, 2 -dimethylbutane were also found in the products. The pattern of the reaction thus becomes more similar to that demonstrated by Pt-on-zeolite catalysts. A similar influence on the reaction pattern was demonstrated by the admixt. of Ag although to a lesser degree...|$|R
30|$|Importance of {{isomerization}} of the <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> <b>paraffins</b> (chiefly C 6 –C 8 for gasoline) and C 11 –C 16 for diesel) needs not be overemphasized {{in light}} of environmental/health issues and requirements of fuels’ desired physical properties. Products of the isomerization reaction, branched paraffins (iso-alkanes), enhance octane number of gasoline and improve the cold flow properties of diesel. In addition, this research area has so amply been explored by numerous researchers that it has almost reached the stage of platitude. Briefly, this reaction is carried out in presence of hydrogen, {{though there is no}} net consumption of hydrogen. As well-established reaction mechanism described for usually studied and commercially employed bifunctional catalysts comprises of the following steps. n-Alkane dehydrogenates to corresponding olefin which diffuses to acid sites in the neighborhood. At acid sites, olefin converts structurally and upon reaching the metal site it saturates to branched paraffin, though a little variation in this conventional mechanism has also been proposed [1]. The metal function needed on the acidic catalyst has been widely reported to be imparted by Pt. Furthermore, on the basis of increased molecular size upon conversion, large pore zeolites attracted the attention of the researchers. Among the probable candidates, keeping hydrothermal stability of the catalyst in mind, zeolites Beta has remained the catalyst of choice. Readers are referred to relatively recent works [1, 2] for introduction to paraffin isomerization and review articles by Valavarasu and Sairam [3], and Akhmedov et al. [4] for details and comprehensive intricacies of various commercial processes. Now, when the molecular size of product increases {{as a result of the}} reaction, it is worth expecting that (a) smaller crystal size, preferably in nanometer size affording smaller diffusion length and enhanced external surface area and (b) generation of mesoporosity in zeolites crystals would be beneficial for the reaction. Again, the readers are referred to a recent review article to apprise themselves on the potential of hierarchical porosity for host of hydrocarbon reactions, including isomerization [5]. Furthermore, combined application of mesoporosity and nanocrystalline large pore zeolites Beta for isomerization reaction has also been exemplified [2].|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe single events microkinetic {{modeling}} {{approach is}} extended to include saturated and unsaturated cyclic molecules, {{in addition to}} <b>straight</b> <b>chained</b> <b>paraffins.</b> The model is successfully applied to hydrocracking (HCK) of a hydrotreated Vacuum Gas Oil (VGO) residue in a pilot plant, under industrial operating conditions, on a commercial bi-functional catalyst. The molecular composition of the VGO feed is obtained by reconstruction based {{on a combination of}} analytical data (SIMDIS, GCxGC, mass spectroscopy). The necessary extensions to the single events methodology, which has previously only been applied to much simpler reacting systems (i. e. HCK of paraffins) are detailed in this work. Feeds typically used in the petrochemical industry typically contain a far more complex mixture of hydrocarbons, including cyclic species (i. e. naphtenes & aromatics). A more complex reaction network is therefore required in order to apply a single events model to such feeds. Hydrogenation, as well as endo-and exo-cyclic reactions {{have been added to the}} well-known acyclic β-scission and PCP-isomerization reactions. A model for aromatic ring hydrogenation was included in order to be able to simulate the reduction in aromatic rings, which is an important feature of HCK units. The model was then applied to 8 mass balances with a wide range of residue conversion (20 – 90 %). The single events model is shown to be capable of correctly simulate the macroscopic effluent characteristics, such as residue conversion, yield structure, and weight distribution of paraffinic, naphthenic, and aromatic compounds in the standard cuts. This validates the overall model. The single events model provides far more detail about the fundamental chemistry of the system. This is shown in a detailed analysis of the reaction kinetics. The evolution of molecule size (i. e. carbon number), number of saturated/unsaturated rings, or the ratio of branched and un-branched species can be followed along the reactor. This demonstrates the explanatory power of this type of model. Calculations are performed on the IFPEN high performance computing cluster, with parallelization via MPI (message passing interface). This was very useful in order to reduce time consuming problems especially for the parameter fitting step. ...|$|R

40|$|The author {{presents}} {{some results}} {{of an attempt to}} apply the graph theory for the kinetic description of <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> reactions. Using some classical examples already solved by help of the quasi-steady-state approximation, a critical discussion on the capabilities of the graph-treatment is brought up. The kinetic analysis of <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> reactions by help of plane diagrams originates in the work of Christiansen [1]. On the other hand, beginning with the work of King and Altman [2] the graph theory was successfully applied in order to describe kinetically closed catalytic sequences [3 ÷ 6]. Taking into account that the <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> reactions are also based on closed sequences, the idea of describing them by help of graph theory appears as natural. This is the reason why Temkin suggested a method to derive rate equations for catalytic and <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> with linear mechanism reactions by help of graphs [7]. In such a theoretical frame the graphical schemes of Christiansen were transposed in graphs [8]. Detailed kinetic treatments of concrete <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> reactions are rather difficult.

Not {{more than one-third of}} the 14 C incorporated into the surface lipids was found in the C 29 paraffin and derivatives, whereas more than two-thirds of the 14 C from <b>straight</b> <b>chain</b> precursors are usually found in these compounds. The small amount of 14 C incorporated into the paraffin fraction was found in the n-C 29 paraffin rather than branched paraffins showing that the 14 C in the paraffin must have come from degradation products. Radio gas-liquid chromatography of the saturated fatty acids showed that, in addition to the n-C 16 acid which was formed from both branched precursors, isoleucine-U- 14 C gave rise to branched C 15, C 17, and C 19 fatty acids, and isobutyrate- 1 - 14 C gave rise to branched C 16 and C 18 acids. Thus the reason for the failure of broccoli leaf to incorporate branched precursors into branched paraffins is not the unavailability of branched fatty acids, but the absolute specificity of the system that synthesizes paraffins, probably the elongation-decar-boxylation enzyme complex. Consistent with this view, no labeled branched fatty acids longer than C 19 could be found in the broccoli leaf.
