2500|$|Due to {{changing}} needs or personal preferences, {{a person may}} {{go back to work}} after retiring. In this case, it is possible to get Social Security retirement or <b>survivors</b> <b>benefits</b> and work at the same time. A worker who is of full retirement age or older may (with spouse) keep all benefits, after taxes, regardless of earnings. But, if this worker or the worker's spouse are younger than full retirement age and receiving benefits and earn [...] "too much", the benefits will be reduced. If working under full retirement age for the entire year and receiving benefits, Social Security deducts $1 from the worker's benefit payments for every $2 earned above the annual limit of $15,120 (2013). Deductions cease when the benefits have been reduced to zero and the worker will get one more year of income and age credit, slightly increasing future benefits at retirement. For example, if you were receiving benefits of $1,230/month (the average benefit paid) or $14,760 a year and have an income of $29,520/year above the $15,120 limit ($44,640/year) you would lose all ($14,760) of your benefits. If you made $1,000 more than $15,200/year you would [...] "only lose" [...] $500 in benefits. You would get no benefits for the months you work until the $1 deduction for $2 income [...] "squeeze" [...] is satisfied. Your first social security check will be delayed for several months—the first check may only be a fraction of the [...] "full" [...] amount. The benefit deductions change in the year you reach full retirement age and are still working—Social Security only deducts $1 in benefits for every $3 you earn above $40,080 in 2013 for that year and has no deduction thereafter. The income limits change (presumably for inflation) year by year.|$|E

40|$|This work investigates how the {{provision}} {{of a variety of}} public policies affects individual life-cycle decisions. In Chapter 2, I examine the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by considering a dynamic interaction between extending health insurance coverage and the demand for federal disability insurance. I argue that as the ACA provides insurance coverage to the uninsured, it improves this group's health and reduces their demand for federal disability insurance. In order to provide a quantitative assessment of this dynamic link, I extend the Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari incomplete markets model by endogenizing health accumulation and disability decisions. Findings suggest that the ACA reduces the fraction of working-age people receiving disability benefits from 5. 7 to 4. 9 percent. Chapter 3 analyzes the effects of social security <b>survivors</b> <b>benefits</b> and argues that survival benefits provide insurance against the heterogeneity of mortality rates. Specifically, {{the provision}} of <b>survivors</b> <b>benefits</b> mitigates the inequality induced by within cohort mortality differences and the associated price variations in the private life insurance market. Further, <b>survivors</b> <b>benefits</b> also help insure the uncertainties of income shocks and life events. The risk spreading provided by <b>survivors</b> <b>benefits,</b> however, is funded via taxes that distort individual decisions. Counterfactual results from a dynamic model suggest that removing <b>survivors</b> <b>benefits</b> for dependent children and aged spouses generates an ex-ante utility change equivalent to a 0. 3 percent decline and 0. 8 percent increase of permanent consumption, respectively. In Chapter 4, considering that people choose both years of education and their area of specialization, I estimate the impacts of technological progress and immigration on educational choices of native-born Americans. Results derived from a general equilibrium model suggest that these two changes lead to opposite effects on educational choices. In particular, the influx of immigrants reduces natives' incentives to complete college degrees and major in natural sciences and engineering fields...|$|E

40|$|We {{revisit the}} issue of the {{usefulness}} of Social Security when there are frictions that prevent the existence of a fluid market for annuities. We model households as families and not as individual agents which provides a rationale for the existence of life insurance. Moreover, our structure also allows us to incorporate altruism towards dependents, providing for a unified picture of the various risks associated to the timing of death. The simultaneous existence of widespread life insurance and very limited annuities holdings is part of our quest. We want to know whether the lack of annuities {{is a product of the}} existence of social security or whether it is due to more fundamental problems (the moral hazard of house ownership, the adverse selection that it is way harder to detect in the case of long lived than in those that are likely to die soon). In our research we will explore various possible configurations of privately provided annuities (from inexistence to fully and cheaply provided to expensive and limited to financial and non housing levels), and how their existence is affected by Social Security, both in its basic form and in its <b>Survivors</b> <b>Benefits</b> program.

40|$|Excerpt] The Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act (LHWCA) is {{a federal}} workers’ {{compensation}} program that covers certain private-sector maritime workers. Firms that employ these workers are required to purchase workers’ compensation or self-insure and are responsible for providing medical and disability benefits to covered workers who are injured or become ill {{on the job and}} <b>survivors</b> <b>benefits</b> to the families of covered workers who die on the job. More than $ 980 million in LHWCA benefits are paid each year. The LHWCA is administered by the Department of Labor (DOL) and all benefit costs are paid by employers and their insurance carriers. Congress has extended the provisions of the LHWCA to cover workers outside of the maritime industry, such as overseas government contractors and civilian employees of military post exchanges. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Congress added to the list of workers exempted from the LHWCA persons who repair recreational vessels of any size. The LHWCA pays for all medical care associated with a covered injury or illness. Disability benefits are based on a worker’s pre-injury wage, and, unlike comparable state workers’ compensation benefits, are adjusted annually to reflect national wage growth...|$|E
40|$|How {{and through}} which {{repertoires}} of practices do migrant domestic workers access global social protection? And how do their gender, race, class, and generational positioning {{along with their}} transnational family relations affect this access? This dissertation deals with these questions and focuses {{on the case of}} Peruvian and Colombian Migrant Domestic Workers in the city of Brussels. Such migrants share a paradoxical positioning as they contribute productively and reproductively to the development of their receiving and sending societies but experience a lack of formal and informal social protection on both sides. This analysis first maps through a multi-sited ethnography the repertoire of practices they use to strategize their access to Social Protection in the areas of: 1 - old-age and <b>survivors</b> <b>benefits,</b> 2 - incapacity, 3 - health & family, 4 - active labor market programs, 5 - unemployment, 6 -housing, and education, 7 - community and family support. Secondly, it theorizes these practices as Global Social Protection Arrangements that are simultaneously made out of transnational interpersonal relationships and formal support systems. Thirdly, building from the work of Anthias (2016) a Translocations lens is used to analyze how these actor’s gender, race, class, religious and generational positioning within the global reproduction of labor as well as within their transnational family networks simultaneously affect the functionality of such arrangements. Concluding, it’s argued that more privileged migrant domestic workers will use arrangements composed mostly of formal resources, while less privileged ones will see formal avenues less open to them and therefore have to rely on an informal arrangement. Far, from the rights based normative approach to social protection, this thesis provides a glance at how transnational access to social protection is strategize across borders. Furthermore, it’s relevant in a context of increasing human mobility where inequalities in access to social protection emerge as a public transnational social question (Faist, 2016) that is suitable both for academics and policy makers...|$|E
