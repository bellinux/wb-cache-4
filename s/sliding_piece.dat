30|$|The {{reduction}} in total viable cells recovered from established S. epidermidis biofilms treated with NO/THCPSi NPs {{was compared to}} the control biofilms {{of the same species}} not treated with the NPs. Glass microscope slides were cut into pieces with surface areas of 24  mm 2. The glass pieces were cleaned with 70 % ethanol and dried. S. epidermidis was cultured at 37 °C in TSB overnight and diluted to 106  CFU/mL. The 106  CFU/mL microbial suspension was then added to each tube containing the glass <b>slide</b> <b>pieces.</b> The vials containing bacteria, broth, and glass <b>slide</b> <b>pieces</b> were placed in a 37 °C incubator for biofilm formation. After 24  h, the glass <b>slide</b> <b>pieces</b> were removed from the nutrient broth, rinsed twice in sterile PBS, and individually transferred into new Eppendorf tubes containing a fresh suspension 1  mL of 0.1  mg/mL NO/THCPSi NPs and THCPSi NPs (control) in PBS and returned to the 37 °C incubator. After 24  h, the tubes containing glass <b>slide</b> <b>pieces</b> were sonicated in a 125 -W ultrasonic cleaner for 5  min to remove the biofilm-forming cells from the slide. The resulting bacterial suspension was subjected to serial tenfold dilutions, and 100  μL of appropriate dilutions was plated onto agar plates, which were then incubated at 37 °C overnight. The total number of colonies that grew on each plate was counted, and the number of viable biofilm bacteria removed from each slide was determined.|$|R

50|$|Part of {{the reason}} for adding the new pieces was to {{equalize}} the number of jumping <b>pieces</b> with <b>sliding</b> <b>pieces.</b> The wizard was created specially to be a color-bound piece, an analog to the bishop. Because of the symmetry and four additional corners, Omega Chess creates new tactical possibilities, including the possibility of checkmate with two knights.|$|R
50|$|The Coggeshall rule {{consisted}} of two rulers, each a foot (30 cm) long, which were put together in various ways. The most common and convenient arrangement was {{to have one of}} the rulers slide within a groove made along the middle of the other, like an ordinary linear slide rule, as shown in the figure below. Another form had one ruler sliding alongside the other, and a third form had a common two-foot folding ruler with a groove along one side in which a thin <b>sliding</b> <b>piece</b> was inserted that carried Coggeshall's lines.|$|E
50|$|At each {{dividing}} line on piece DE, which one {{passes through the}} opening B in the box. {{there is a little}} pin. When one wishes to hear a note, one pulls on the piece, to move the pin for that note. Then, applying that pin with precision against the opening in the box, one plucks the string with one's finger at N, and the string produces the desired sound. This effect is produced by the different positions in which one puts the <b>sliding</b> <b>piece</b> (DE) and the right-angle piece over the string (HG) The different distances from H create the different sounds.|$|E
50|$|A cam is a {{rotating}} or <b>sliding</b> <b>piece</b> in a mechanical linkage used especially in transforming rotary motion into linear motion or vice versa. It {{is often a}} part of {{a rotating}} wheel (e.g. an eccentric wheel) or shaft (e.g. a cylinder with an irregular shape) that strikes a lever at one or more points on its circular path. The cam can be a simple tooth, as is used to deliver pulses of power to a steam hammer, for example, or an eccentric disc or other shape that produces a smooth reciprocating (back and forth) motion in the follower, which is a lever making contact with the cam.|$|E
50|$|Seen from a more-typical oblique position, however, {{each side}} of a square piece is {{somewhat}} akin to a low arch that joins neighboring corners. The low part of that arch engages mostly-hidden internal <b>sliding</b> <b>pieces</b> that (among other functions) support the edge cubies. The high surface of the arch includes convex curved circular flanges that engage grooves inside the cubies, to hold the structure together.|$|R
50|$|The song {{opens with}} a <b>slide</b> <b>piece</b> and quickly moves into a solo {{acoustic}} guitar capo on the 3rd fret strumming the chords of A, D and E before bass, drums and piano join in, respectively. Wyman's autoharp can be heard somewhat faintly during the first verse with noticeable 'ping' sounds coming from it around the 0:40-0:50 mark but it is mostly inaudible throughout the track after the 0:55 ('she said my breasts') minute mark.|$|R
5000|$|Edge cubies {{in their}} normal {{position}} are retained by the flanges of neighboring square pieces. Corner cubies are retained by {{a trio of}} short circular flanges {{at the ends of}} the interior <b>sliding</b> <b>pieces.</b> When a face is rotated, those short flanges temporarily retain edge cubies, particularly when the face is rotated about 1/8 of a turn (roughly 45 degrees). As well, the corner cubies are temporarily retained by the curved flanges on the neighboring square pieces.During a rotation, flanges [...] "change roles" [...] as cubies travel along their circular paths.|$|R
50|$|In theater, a brace is a <b>sliding</b> <b>piece</b> of wood {{or metal}} with a 'butterfly' winged nut {{to make it}} longer or shorter to fit the flat used to {{stabilize}} a flat set piece such as a flat. The nut is used, {{so that it can}} be changed more quickly than a screw to the floor during a quick change. Usually, a brace is painted black to make it less noticeable to the audience. Braces are often used to form a triangle between two perpendicular items (like a vertical flat and a stage. They can also make a flat piece stronger by forming an X-shape between all four corners. Another way to brace a rectangular flat is to use special braces, called toggles which run at regular intervals, parallel to the short end of the flat, effectively breaking it into many smaller, stronger rectangles.|$|E
40|$|The {{missing link}} {{and the top}} spin are two puzzles closely related to Loyd's 15 -puzzle.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approach for obtaining {{direct access to}} the attacked squares of <b>sliding</b> <b>pieces</b> without resorting to rotated bitboards. The technique involves creating four hash tables using the built in hash arrays from an interpreted, high level language. The rank, file, and diagonal occupancy are first isolated by masking the desired portion of the board. The attacked squares are then directly retrieved from the hash tables. Maintaining incrementally updated rotated bitboards becomes unnecessary as does all the updating, mapping and shifting required to access the attacked squares. Finally, rotated bitboard move generation speed is compared with that of the direct hash table lookup method. Comment: 7 pages, 1 figure, 4 listings; replaced test positions, fixed typo...|$|R
50|$|The {{butterfly}} keyboard {{is split}} into two roughly triangular <b>pieces</b> that <b>slide</b> as the laptop's lid is opened or closed. As the lid is opened both <b>pieces</b> <b>slide</b> out to the sides, followed by one <b>piece</b> <b>sliding</b> downward. The two halves mesh to form a keyboard 29.2 cm (11.5 in) wide which overhangs {{the sides of the}} laptop body. Conversely, as the lid is closed one <b>piece</b> <b>slides</b> back, then both slide inward until the keyboard can be covered by the lid. The movement of the keyboard is driven by a cam on the lid's hinge, so the motions of the keyboard parts are always synchronized with the movement of the lid.|$|R
50|$|The {{minimum number}} of moves for the {{original}} puzzle is 81, which is verified by computer to be the absolute minimum for the default starting layout, if you consider <b>sliding</b> a <b>piece</b> two positions {{in the same direction}} to be a single move.|$|R

40|$|We present two new perfect hashing {{schemes that}} can be used for {{efficient}} bitboard move generation for <b>sliding</b> <b>pieces</b> in chess-like board games without the need to use rotated bitboards. Moreover, we show that simple variations of these schemes give minimal perfect hashing schemes. The new method is applicable provided N, the number of k-bit spaced positions that may be set to 1, is not more than k + 1. In chess, for a Rook’s movement along a file N = k = 8; for a Bishop’s movement N ≤ 8, and k = 9 for a north-east diagonal and k = 7 for a north-west diagonal. The results of computational experiments comparing the efficiency of move generation with the standard method show that using the hashing scheme gives an average improvement of approximately 40 %. The schemes we suggest are simple, efficient, and easy to understand and implement...|$|R
