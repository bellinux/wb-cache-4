50|$|A {{link budget}} is {{accounting}} {{of all of}} the gains and losses from the transmitter, through the medium (free <b>space,</b> <b>cable,</b> waveguide, fiber, etc.) to the receiver in a telecommunication system. It accounts for the attenuation of the transmitted signal due to propagation, as well as the antenna gains, feedline and miscellaneous losses. Randomly varying channel gains such as fading are taken into account by adding some margin depending on the anticipated severity of its effects. The amount of margin required can be reduced by the use of mitigating techniques such as antenna diversity or frequency hopping.|$|R

50|$|A <b>space</b> {{elevator}} <b>cable</b> {{would need}} to carry its own weight {{as well as the}} additional weight of climbers. The required strength of the cable would vary along its length. This is because at various points it would have to carry the weight of the cable below, or provide a downward force to retain the cable and counterweight above. Maximum tension on a <b>space</b> elevator <b>cable</b> would be at geosynchronous altitude so the cable would have to be thickest there and taper carefully as it approaches Earth. Any potential cable design may be characterized by the taper factor - the ratio between the cable's radius at geosynchronous altitude and at the Earth's surface.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{the main}} {{technical}} {{problem has been}} considered {{the ability of the}} cable to hold up, with tension, the weight of itself below any given point. The greatest tension on a <b>space</b> elevator <b>cable</b> is at the point of geostationary orbit, 35786 km above the Earth's equator. This means that the cable material, combined with its design, must be strong enough to hold up its own weight from the surface up to 35786 km. A cable which is thicker in cross section at that height than at the surface could better hold up its own weight over a longer length. How the cross section area tapers from the maximum at 35786 km to the minimum at the surface is therefore an important design factor for a <b>space</b> elevator <b>cable.</b>|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper proposes that for widely <b>spaced</b> <b>cable</b> reeving configurations in container‐handling cranes there is an interesting, and unexpectedly useful, phenomenon defined henceforth as geometrical extension which gives rise to unevenly distributed cable stretch and, hence, uneven tensions across the system. Geometrical extension is entirely caused by the reluctance of the trolley, spreader and cable system to conform, as a whole, to certain overall shapes. Such shapes are developed because of the various translational and rotational motions which can be experienced at the trolley (that is at the attachment point of the cables running down to the spreader). Other cables stretch effects, such as those due to static and dynamic (inertia) loads, are additional to the geometrical extension (which can, in some circumstances, manifest as a compression instead...|$|R

40|$|Future {{supercomputers}} {{with millions}} of processors would pose significant challenges in their interconnection networks due to difficulty in design constraints such as <b>space,</b> <b>cable</b> length, cost, power consumption, etc. In-stead of huge switches or bisection bandwidth restricted topologies such as a torus, we propose a network which utilizes both fully-connected lower-bandwidth electronic packet switching (EPS) network and low-power optical cir-cuit switching (OCS) network. Optical circuits, connected sparingly to only a limited set of nodes to conserve power and cost, are used in a supplemental fashion as “shortcut” routes only when a node communicates substantially across EPS switches, while short latency communication is han-dled by EPS only. Our MPI inter-node communication al-gorithm accommodates for such a network by appropriate scheduling of nodes according to application communica-tion patterns, in particular utilizing relatively high EPS lo-cal switch bandwidth to forward messages to nodes with optical connections for shortcutting {{in order to maximize}} overall throughput. Simulation studies confirm that our pro-posal effectively avoids contentions in the network in high-bandwidth applications with nominal additions of optical circuitry to existing machines. 1...|$|R
