This test series included nine aircraft drop tests that were conducted at the Joint Parachute Test Facility, El Centro, California, between September 1971 and May 1972. The test technique and analytical planning method utilized to best simulate loading conditions in a low density environment are presented and some test results are shown to assess their adequacy. Performance effects relating to <b>suspension</b> <b>line</b> <b>lengths</b> of 1. 7 D sub o with different canopy loadings are noted.

40|$|During {{the first}} Supersonic Flight Dynamics Test (SFDT- 1) for NASA's Low Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) Program, the Parachute Decelerator System (PDS) was {{successfully}} tested. The main parachute in the PDS was a 30. 5 -meter supersonic Disksail parachute. The term Disksail {{is derived from}} the canopy's constructional geometry, as it combined the aspects of a ringsail and a flat circular round (disk) canopy. The crown area of the canopy contained the disk feature, as a large flat circular disk that extended from the canopy's vent down to the upper gap. From this upper gap to the skirt-band the canopy was constructed with characteristics of sails seen in a ringsail. There was a second lower gap present in this sail region. The canopy maintained a nearly 10 x forebody diameter trailing distance with 1. 7 Do <b>suspension</b> <b>line</b> <b>lengths.</b> During the test, the parachute was deployed at the targeted Mach and dynamic pressure. Although the supersonic Disksail parachute experienced an anomaly during the inflation process, the system was tested successfully in the environment it was designed to operate within. The nature of the failure seen originated in the disk portion of the canopy. High-speed and high-resolution imagery of the anomaly was captured and has been used to aid in the forensics of the failure cause. In addition to the imagery, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) recorded test vehicle dynamics and loadcells captured the bridle termination forces. In reviewing the imagery and load data a number of hypothesizes have been generated in an attempt to explain the cause of the anomaly...|$|R

40|$|Several {{experimental}} investigations {{to obtain}} the drag performance of 10 % scale-model disk-gap-band-type parachute assemblies trailing in the Viking forebody wake were conducted over the range of Mach 0. 2 to 2. 6. The wind-tunnel tests varied both the canopy trailing distance and ratio of <b>suspension</b> <b>line</b> <b>length</b> to canopy diameter. The data obtained permitted optimization of both parameters. Parachute drag performance in the forebody wake is markedly degraded transonically beginning at Mach 0. 6, reaching a minimum value at Mach 1. 0, then approaches the subsonic value for the selected configuration as Mach number is increased to 1. 4. Further increase in Mach number causes the drag coefficient to again decline. A 20 % increase in parachute-alone transonic drag coefficient was obtained by increasing suspension-line length ratio from 1. 16 to 1. 73...|$|E

Data which was obtained during Kp - 50 was used. We calculated the onset time map of low- and mid-latitude {{and found that the}} onset times vary with the magnetic field <b>line</b> <b>length</b> and intensity of F 10. 7. The onset time becomes constant, which is 10 minutes ahead of sunrise at 100 km, when the magnetic field <b>line</b> <b>length</b> is shorter than 5000 km.

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} about {{radio frequency}} design of coplanar-waveguide (CPW) based p-matched shunt switch for broad-band (18 - 40 GHz) application. The effects {{of variation in}} membrane width (50 â€“ 80 Âµm) of the switch and high-impedance transmission <b>line</b> <b>length</b> (200 â€“ 600 Âµm) between the switch structures on scattering parameters are studied. The variation in beam width has very little effect on return loss and insertion loss of the switch in the up-state.

40|$|A ringsail parachute, {{which had}} a nominal {{diameter}} of 40 feet (12. 2 meters) and reference area of 1256 square feet (117 m(exp 2)) and was modified to provide a total geometric porosity of 15 percent of the reference area, was flight tested {{as part of the}} rocket launch portion of the NASA Planetary Entry Parachute Program. The payload for the flight test was an instrumented capsule from which the test parachute was ejected by a deployment mortar when the system was at a Mach number of 1. 64 and a dynamic pressure of 9. 1 pounds per square foot (43. 6 newtons per m(exp 2)). The parachute deployed to <b>suspension</b> <b>line</b> stretch in 0. 45 second with a resulting snatch force of 1620 pounds (7200 newtons). Canopy inflation began 0. 07 second later and the parachute projected area increased slowly to a maximum of 20 percent of that expected for full inflation. During this test, the <b>suspension</b> <b>lines</b> twisted, primarily because the partially inflated canopy could not restrict the twisting to the attachment bridle and risers. This twisting of the <b>suspension</b> <b>lines</b> hampered canopy inflation at a time when velocity and dynamic-pressure conditions were more favorable...|$|R
