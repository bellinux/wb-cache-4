50|$|The <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>{{damselfly}}</b> (Ceriagrion tenellum) {{is a small}} damselfly {{flying in}} heathland bogs and streams. It is in the family Coenagrionidae.|$|E
50|$|Nesting birds include mallard. Common frog, {{palmate newt}} and smooth newt breed in the pools. Dragonflies {{recorded}} include four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor, common darter and the <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|E
50|$|Notable {{breeding}} bird species {{that have been}} recorded on the site include the European nightjar, Eurasian hobby and Dartford warbler. Rare dragonflies include the <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>damselfly,</b> the southern damselfly and the downy emerald. Other insects recorded include the bog bush cricket. Annual wildlife surveys are carried with {{groups such as the}} Devon Amphibian and Reptile Group (DRAG), the Devon Bat Group, Butterfly Conservation, the Devon Wildlife Trust and the Devon Biodiversity Records Centre helping coordinate the work.|$|E
50|$|Females {{occur in}} three colour forms, but all have yellow bands around the {{abdominal}} segments. The form typica has more black on its abdominal segments than the form 'fulvipes', particularly segment 6. Immatures have lighter eyes and have yellow stripes on the thorax, not red.They {{can easily be}} confused with <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>damselflies,</b> but the latter has orange legs, while the large <b>red</b> <b>damselfly</b> has black legs. In Greece and Albania a closely related species occurs, the Greek red damsel (Pyrrhosoma elisabethae). They look very much the same, the females only having a slightly different pronotum with deep folds in the hind margin. The males differ in their lower appendages, which are longer than the upper ones, while the black hook on the lower appendages is half as long as in the large <b>red</b> <b>damselfly.</b> The appendages of the large <b>red</b> <b>damselfly</b> {{can be seen in}} the gallery below.|$|R

50|$|The {{river and}} ponds of the Tuckingmill Valley Park provide {{valuable}} habitat within an urban area, for two nationally scarce insects; scarce blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura pumilio) and <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Ceriagrion tenellum). The larvae of the golden-ringed dragonfly (Ceriagrion tenellum) {{have been found}} and the adults can be seen through the summer and autumn. Other dragonflies include the common darter (Sympetrum striolatum) and the once rare migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) which usually fly in August and September.|$|E
50|$|The forest {{supports}} a rich invertebrate fauna, with many heathland specialities. Half of Britain's 46 breeding species of damselflies and dragonflies (the Odonata) have been recorded, the scarcer among them being the black darter, brilliant emerald and <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>damselfly.</b> It {{is also an}} important home for the golden-ringed dragonfly, which flies from mid-June to early September. Of the forest's 34 species of butterfly, the most spectacular, the purple emperor, can be hard to see. Another speciality, the silver-studded blue, is by contrast plentiful, with the main food plants of its caterpillars being gorses and heathers.|$|E
50|$|The Lutter and its {{tributary}} streams, the Schmalwasser and Ahrbeck, and the Lachte, which {{flow through}} {{the eastern part of}} the Südheide Nature Park, form an extensive river system covering an area of about 2450 ha which has been designated as a nature reserve. The region is of particular importance for nature conservation on the Südheide as it is in an almost natural state. As well as the brooks with their fish and otters, there are also adjacent water meadows and carrs, bogs, marshes and river source areas, in which birds such as the black stork, sea eagle and crane are found as well as rare river dragonflies, like the <b>small</b> <b>red</b> <b>damselfly</b> which is threatened with extinction and the severely endangered keeled skimmer. Over 160 endangered animal and plant species live by and in these heath streams. Especially significant are the last remaining colonies of the Northwest European freshwater pearl mussel, which makes very high demands on the quality of its habitat.The Bundesamt für Naturschutz, the state of Lower Saxony and the districts of Celle and Gifhorn have supported this nature conservation project since 1989.|$|E
50|$|The large <b>red</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Pyrrhosoma nymphula) is a mainly European damselfly, {{with some}} populations in Northern Africa and Western Asia.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} common <b>damselflies,</b> the large <b>red</b> <b>{{damselfly}}</b> is often the first damselfly to emerge, usually in April or May.|$|R
50|$|Ceriagrion tenellum is only 25 - 35 mm long. It {{is a lot}} {{shorter than}} the large <b>red</b> <b>damselfly,</b> with which it is {{sometimes}} confused. In both sexes the thorax is bronze-black on top.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Small</b> <b>Red</b> <b>Damselfly</b> (Ceriagrion tenellum) (De Villiers) (Odonata: Coenagrionidae: Ceriagrion) is classed as {{vulnerable}} (Shirt, British Red Data Book, Nature Conservancy Council, Peterborough, UK, 1987) throughout the UK, and {{is included in}} certain Local Biodiversity Action Plans (LBAPs) in the south. A large proportion of any Biodiversity Action Plan {{is concerned with the}} requirement of conservation and management programmes. In order to guide them, information about the habitat preferences of the species concerned is vital. Detailed habitat information was collected to include a variety of physical parameters particularly vegetation, both in-channel and bankside. The species was found to be primarily associated with in-channel emergent broad-leaved plants, bankside grasses and rushes, and shallow, narrow channels with dark organic substrate. The consequences of these findings are discussed in relation to the conservation and management of C. tenellum...|$|E
50|$|Pyrrhosoma elisabethae, the Greek <b>red</b> <b>{{damselfly}},</b> is {{a species}} of damselfly in the family Coenagrionidae. The damselfly finds its habitat in rivers. It is found in Albania and Greece. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|X. zealandica larvae are {{widespread}} across New Zealand, {{occurring in}} rocky and weedy streams and ponds. The larvae of the <b>red</b> <b>damselfly</b> are identified by their pointed tail gills and long hairs by the tip.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of marsh violets makes the bog an ideal supportive habitat for the uncommon small pearl-bordered fritillary. Dragonflies are in abundance {{similar to the}} adjacent Woorgreens Lake and Marsh reserve. Records include broad-bodied chaser and the large <b>red</b> <b>damselfly.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald <b>damselfly,</b> large <b>red</b> <b>damselfly,</b> red-eyed <b>damselfly,</b> <b>small</b> red-eyed damselfly, azure damselfly, common blue damselfly, blue-tailed damselfly, migrant hawker, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor dragonfly, four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, black-tailed skimmer, keeled skimmer, common darter, ruddy darter, common hawker, Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{species of}} dragonflies and damselflies {{have been recorded}} at Black Lake: white-faced darter (Leucorrhinia dubia last recorded 1997), brown hawker (Aeshna grandis), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), black darter (Sympetrum danae), large <b>red</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Pyrrhosoma nymphula) and common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum).|$|R
50|$|The Woorgreens {{reserve is}} {{considered}} to be the Forest of Dean's best dragonfly site, and over seventeen species have been recorded. Some of the species are scarce and breeding colonies in this area are important. They are supported by the network of other ponds and ditches in the area, such as Kensley pond. Breeding populations recorded include blue-tailed <b>damselfly,</b> large <b>red</b> <b>damselfly,</b> azure damselfly, southern hawker, ruddy sympetrum, broad-bodied chaser and the emperor dragonfly.|$|R
50|$|The River Wid {{forms the}} {{northern}} {{boundary of the}} park, and it is bisected by the Great Eastern Main Line. Most of the site is semi-natural grassland which has a diverse range of species. There are also areas of oak and hornbeam woodland, ponds and wetlands. There are birds such as moorhens and long-tailed tits, insects including large <b>red</b> <b>damselflies</b> and orange tip butterflies, and flowers such as the lesser stitchwort and ox-eye daisy.|$|R
50|$|Xanthocnemis zealandica, {{commonly}} known as red damsefly or <b>red</b> coat <b>damselfly</b> {{is the most common}} native New Zealand damselfly. Adult damselflies are often seen flying around vegetation close to streams.|$|R
50|$|Many {{species of}} aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been recorded}} from the site especially damselflies and dragonflies including the scarce hairy dragonfly which has bred on the site and the <b>red</b> eyed <b>damselfly</b> is found in abundance.|$|R
50|$|Sphagnum capillifolium, the <b>red</b> bogmoss or <b>small</b> <b>red</b> peat moss, is {{a species}} of peat moss native to Canada, the {{northern}} United States, Greenland and Europe. <b>Small</b> <b>red</b> peat can be distinguished by its sweeping, outward-curving branches that resemble tresses.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the larger}} damselflies, this species is most common in July and August. It is often found by ponds and lakes, and is very rarely seen along flowing water. Emerald Damselflies like to perch among reeds, their colour {{providing}} good camouflage. They are not as strong fliers {{when compared to other}} common damselflies such as the common blue or large <b>red</b> <b>damselflies,</b> but {{they are more likely to}} be seen on misty, rainy days then those species. When disturbed they usually do not fly very far away, landing on another perch a few yards away. Their habit of perching with their wings half open is characteristic of the family Lestidae and gives rise to their other common name of spreadwings. A population can consist of several hundred insects.|$|R
