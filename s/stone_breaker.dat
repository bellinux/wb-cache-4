One of the best-known examples in Europe is Courbet's The <b>Stone</b> <b>Breakers,</b> which was destroyed in Dresden in 1945 during the Allied bombings. The original of Emanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware, a work with an iconic status in the US, was destroyed in a British bombing of Bremen.

The total depth {{at the time was}} 1078 ft. The capital brace was 40 feet high and was quite distinctive with a long raised walkway to the east. The head frame was an open timber structure. In 1897 The North Queensland Register listed the equipment on the surface to include a 430-ton hopper, a <b>stone</b> <b>breaker,</b> a 28 hp engine, two air compressors, two robey boilers, six rock drills and an underground air machine.|$|E

However, this early system proved to have many problems, and the mines inspector {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "very little is yet really known about electricity". At first, the dynamos were incapable of powering the full 30 stamps and the water turbine was still needed to run the battery at full capacity. The dynamos were upgraded the following year, replacing the cast-iron armatures with laminated iron ones, and by 1888 the electric plant was capable of powering the 30 stamps as well as an air compressor and a <b>stone</b> <b>breaker.</b>|$|E
50|$|Although {{their work}} seems {{drastically}} different at first glance, Courbet's influence on Cubism {{can be found}} in Picasso's underlying goals. Just as Courbet attempted to present a realistic vision of his world, in Bottle, Glass, Fork Picasso attempts to create an accurate representation of the table in the café. Picasso's method of realism is not an accurate optical imitation of the natural world, but a more inclusive type of realism. He included many perspectives of an object and relied on the associations made {{in the mind of the}} viewer because of their own sensory experiences with the objects. An example of this is The <b>Stone</b> <b>Breakers</b> (1850).|$|R
50|$|Repin {{grew up in}} Chuguev, in the Kharkov Governorate (now Ukraine) and {{was aware}} of the poverty and {{hardship}} of most rural life at that time. He spent two years traveling during which time he observed both the dachas of the rich and the toil of the common peasant. As such it can be considered a genre painting, but treated on the heroic scale of history painting, as was often the case in 19th-century works, especially after A Burial At Ornans by Gustave Courbet (1850). Barge Haulers drew direct comparisons from critics with Millet's works and Courbet's The <b>Stone</b> <b>Breakers</b> (also 1850), which showed laborers at the side of a road.|$|R
50|$|The mill was {{completed}} in 1889 and equipped by Sandycroft and Company, of Chester U.K., with three engines aggregating 54 h.p., Cornish boilers, piston jiggers, <b>stone</b> <b>breakers,</b> two pairs of rollers, two raff wheels and elevators, classifier, three sluices, six 4.9m Borleas round buddles, picking tables, three Frue vanners and a separator. Richard King remained {{as director of the}} company and Edward King as mine manager. When operations resumed in 1890, the mill ran only briefly yielding 274 tons of concentrate valued at £6,411. Soon after it closed permanently and King's mine was let to tributors but it too closed at the end of 1891 when the company abandoned its leases.|$|R
50|$|Richard King, {{realizing that}} he needed capital to further develop his mine, {{launched}} the Ravenswood Silver Mining Company Limited with £60,000 capital in June 1882. The treatment works were erected by 1883 and consisted of a Hope's <b>stone</b> <b>breaker,</b> a set of 75 cm rolls, a Hancock jig, 35 cm raff wheel, pulleys and trommels; and the workforce doubled to 46 men. In 1883, 371 tons of high grade ore valued at £11,872 were exported. In 1884, the despatch by railway of 853 tons of concentrate valued at £19,566 reflected the increased productivity. In 1885, despite temporary suspension of operations due to drought, 866 tons of concentrate valued at £21,568 were dispatched. In 1886, 743 tons valued at £19,036 were exported and in 1887, the output was 899 tons valued at £20,632.|$|E
50|$|To {{treat the}} whole body of ore from a mine, dry {{crushing}} is strongly recommended. To accomplish this in the most efficient manner, a <b>stone</b> <b>breaker</b> which will reduce to about ¼ inch cubes is necessary. For subsequent crushing Kroms rolls have, {{up to the present}} time, proved most satisfactory. They will crush with considerable evenness to a thirty mesh, which is generally sufficient. The crushings are then roasted in the ordinary way in a reverberatory furnace and the whole of the roastings are passed through the machine we have just described. By this it is claimed that over 90 per cent. of the gold can be extracted at very much the same cost as the processes now in general use in gold producing countries, which on the average barely return 50 per cent. If so, the gentlemen who have brought forward these improvements deserve all the success their process promises.|$|E
5000|$|The Welsh Crown Spelter company still {{retained}} {{a few men}} on its books, to safeguard its assets, and a catalogue of these assets was prepared. In June 1907 an auction advertisement (see bottom picture) subsequently appeared in the Mining Journal, selling many of the mechanical assets of the Welsh Crown Spelter Co., and divided into 'Electrical Mining Plant', mostly from Pandora mine and 'Dressing Plant', from Klondyke mill. Pertinent to the Klondyke operation, this sale included the like of 100 tons of 18 lb flat-bottom rail, a petrol locomotive of 22.5" [...] gauge, 25 side-tip wagons, and 800' of Henderson cableway. The dressing plant on offer included a <b>stone</b> <b>breaker</b> and several jiggers, pulleys and belts, the contents of smiths' and carpenters' shops, telephone installations, drawing instruments, office and household furniture, and a pony and trap. It {{is clear from the}} full list of auction items that the mill was very dependent on electricity for its operation. This may also have contributed to the decline, for pumping equipment in particular was prone to failure.|$|E
5000|$|The term dates on {{a broader}} scale to the Realist {{movement}} in French art during the mid-19th century.

5|$|The art {{historian}} Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson posits that {{the painting is}} informed by the progressive style of French realists such as Rosa Bonheur and Gustave Courbet.

Filipovitch-Robinson believes that Predić rejected the precision and linearism of both Academic and Biedermeier art, and, as Courbet would have done, used heavily textured brushstrokes to define the roughness of the muddy road. She also draws parallels between the painting and Courbet's Peasants of Flagey, which was shown at the Paris Salon of 1850–51 alongside The <b>Stone</b> <b>Breakers</b> and A Burial At Ornans.|$|R

5000|$|Aspinall would {{entertain}} prospective shareholders from London, {{paying for}} their first-class train fare and accommodation, {{and take them}} to see the mine and the mill. On approaching the mine, he would give a friendly hoot on his car horn, which was, in fact, a signal for his [...] "workers" [...] to act their roles. The entrance tunnel to the mine had previously been cleaned, and some 20 tons of lead concentrates (shipped from Devon) were glued to the walls, giving a sparkling appearance. Aspinall had also purchased locally galena concentrates for which he would pay 50% above the ordinary market price. This was he said, for use in a new secret process, but was in fact used to provide some evidence of mined ore. Men guarded the entrance to the tunnel, and others ran around, giving an impression of great activity. In Klondyke mill itself, much of the equipment (a <b>stone</b> <b>breaker</b> and a few jigs) was of virtually no use at all, but Aspinall installed a shaking table, then erected a launder from the stonebreaker {{to the head of the}} table. Together with a couple of other pieces of equipment, it all looked the part and made a convincing noise.|$|E

This research will specifically study and analyze income received, identify and examine the issues that arise in performing <b>stone</b> <b>breaker</b> as an occupation: deficiencies, expectations, and negative impacts. Ten urban villages/villages in Moramo North District was taken as research population. Area samples taken were five (5) urban/rural where workers are concentrated in Lalowaru Village, Puasana Village, Mata Mawatu Village, Sanggula Village, and Lamokula Village. Samples community were 5 percent of all household. Therefore total samples taken were 93 people scattered in villages. Research informants are Head of North Morano district, Stone Processing owner, and stone carrier driver. Data collection was conducted by observation, interview using a list of questions, as well as documentation of objective conditions. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis techniques, which describe the objective conditions of the field in accordance with the purpose of research. Research result shows workers are housewives who help their husbands and families to supplement the household income to support family life. In general, socio-economic conditions of women suplit <b>stone</b> <b>breaker</b> is relatively low, their education level is generally elementary or none.
