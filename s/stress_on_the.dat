5|$|Most Nahuatl dialects have <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{penultimate}} syllable of a word. In Mexicanero from Durango, many unstressed syllables {{have disappeared}} from words, and {{the placement of}} syllable stress has become phonemic.|$|E
5|$|The first verse of {{the text}} {{is used for the}} opening and final {{sections}} of the aria; the second verse for the middle section. Both verses have an identical rhyming scheme. The form of the verses is based on the style perfected by Metastasio, including the placement of poetic stress. Each line has seven sung syllables; the first two lines of each verse close with the <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> penultimate syllable (versi piani), the final line of each with <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last syllable (verso tronco).|$|E
5|$|A third {{theme of}} the work is the <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{importance}} and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of Æthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of Ælfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.|$|E

40|$|Distribution of {{stresses}} about rectangular openings excavated in {{bedded rock}} was investigated {{by means of}} photoelastic experiments using 37 kinds of models made of gelatine jelly. By those model experiments, influence of ratio of the breadth to {{the height of the}} opening, thickness and elastic modulus of immediate roof and high roof, thickness of packs in the goaf, and fissures contained in the immediate roof or <b>the</b> high roof <b>on</b> <b>the</b> distribution of <b>stresses</b> around the opening was studied. Influence of the thickness of immediate roof, height of caved rocks in the goaf or rigidity of face props in long wall working face were investigated as well. As the results of those experiments, following conclusions were obtained : 1. The tensile stresses of the roof in the bedded rock are larger than these stresses which arise in the non-bedded rock, and <b>the</b> tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof are larger than <b>the</b> tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. 2. When the immediate roof is thick, <b>the</b> tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof and <b>the</b> compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side walls are considerably smaller than those stresses which arise when the immediate roof is thin. 3. When the high roof is thick, <b>the</b> tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof are still more small, and <b>the</b> compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side walls are a little larger than these stresses which arise when the high roof is thin. 4. When the modulus of elasticity of the immediate roof is large, <b>the</b> tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof are larger and <b>the</b> compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side walls are smaller than these stresses which arise when the modulus of elastisity of the immediate roof is large. 5. <b>The</b> compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face decrease as the thickness of the packs in the goaf increases. However, the magnitudes of tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof undergo only little change. 6. When the immediate roof is fissured, tensile <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof are almost equal to zero. 7. When the high roof is fissured, the tensile stresses are larger as compared with the case in which the high roof is not fissured. 8. <b>The</b> compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> long wall face decrease as the height of caved rocks in the goaf increases. 9. <b>The</b> compressive <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face decrease as the rigidity of face props increases...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{addressed}} to use knowledge about the orthodontic system with numerical simulation of the nite elements method. For the rst time we simulated <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orthodontic system and, in this manner, calculated <b>the</b> orthodontic force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tooth. A 3 D orthodontic model or orthodontic system was designed resembling moderate crowding in the dental arch with all supporting structures. CATIA V 5 computer software was used {{to set up a}} model for the orthodontic system and ABAQUS was used for simulation of <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orthodontic system. Our attention was focused <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tooth lateral incisor and its periodontal ligament. The results of the numerical simulation showed complex <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tooth lateral incisor and its periodontal ligament. In this paper is presented a calculation of the orthodontic force acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tooth lateral incisor due to the orthodontic wire. This orthodontic force was calculated from <b>the</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bracket. The calculated orthodontic force was in the area which is considered as the optimal orthodontic force for movement of the tooth...|$|R
5|$|Other {{investigations}} (such {{as blood}} tests and viral culture) are discouraged, {{as they may}} cause unnecessary agitation and thus worsen the <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> compromised airway. While viral cultures, obtained via nasopharyngeal aspiration, {{can be used to}} confirm the exact cause, these are usually restricted to research settings. Bacterial infection should be considered if a person does not improve with standard treatment, at which point further investigations may be indicated.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
5|$|Speakers at {{the inquiry}} have also testified that a {{significant}} volume of city traffic regularly cut across the roof deck as a bypass of the traffic lights {{at the corner of}} Hillside Drive and Ontario Avenue, resulting in more <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> structure than it had been designed to handle. The NORR report speculated that a heavy vehicle might have contributed to a previously undetected partial failure of the support structure a few months prior to the final collapse.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} current problems in Indonesian aviation are poor development {{and maintenance of}} air transportation infrastructure, especially in remote areas. Other significant problems include overcapacity; the massive surge of air travelers in recent years, prompted by the growth of low-cost carrier passengers, has put intense <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> aging airport infrastructure in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% which increases crew comfort and minimises the buildup of <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airframe. The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5000|$|Trisyllabic and polysyllabic {{words are}} <b>stressed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third-to-last syllable.|$|R
50|$|Polysyllabic {{words that}} end in vowels are <b>stressed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{next-to-last}} syllable; most words ending in consonants are <b>stressed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final syllable. There are exceptions. When a word deviates from these rules, the stressed vowel should be indicated by an acute accent mark. The accent marks are often omitted in casual writing.|$|R

5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally, {{groups may}} split {{up when they}} become so large that {{competition}} for resources is problematic, but even then, members of matrilines tend to stick together. Dominant females procure more food, matings, and supporters. Among olive baboons in Tanzania, high-ranking females give birth at shorter intervals to infants with a higher survival rate, and their daughters tend to mature faster than low-ranking females. However, these high-ranking females also {{appear to have a}} higher probability of miscarriages and some high-ranking matrilines have inexplicably low fertility. One theory suggests this occurs due to <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> high-ranking females, although this theory is controversial.|$|E
5|$|One {{of their}} {{innovative}} features {{was a relatively}} new kind of bow called the bulbous bow or Taylor bow, named after its inventor, Rear Admiral David W. Taylor, who served as Chief Constructor for the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair in World War I. The result {{of a series of}} towing tests begun in 1910, this bow reduced water resistance by an average of six percent at high speeds, supported the forecastle and reduced bending <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hull. A disadvantage was the formation of a heavy layer of water which would creep up along the forward side of the hull at higher speeds, although this could be reduced to some degree by careful design of this area.|$|E

50|$|It {{does not}} appear that stress is phonemic, {{but this is not}} certain.

This is complicated by long vowels, and not all verbal conjugations follow this pattern.|$|R
5|$|The Hungarian mythographer Karl Kerényi, one of {{the founders}} of the modern study of Greek mythology, wrote about Orion in Gods of the Greeks (1951). Kerényi portrays Orion as a giant of Titanic vigor and criminality, born outside his mother as were Tityos or Dionysus. Kerényi places great <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> variant in which Merope is the wife of Oenopion. He sees this as the remnant of a lost form of the myth in which Merope was Orion's mother (converted by later generations to his {{stepmother}} and then to the present forms). Orion's blinding is therefore parallel to that of Aegypius and Oedipus.|$|E
5|$|The algae {{benefit from}} {{a safe place to}} live and consume the polyp's carbon dioxide and {{nitrogenous}} waste. Due to the strain the algae can put on the polyp, <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> coral often drives them to eject the algae. Mass ejections are known as coral bleaching, because the algae contribute to coral's brown coloration; other colors, however, are due to host coral pigments, such as green fluorescent proteins (GFPs). Ejection increases the polyp's chance of surviving short-term stress—they can regain algae, possibly of a different species at a later time. If the stressful conditions persist, the polyp eventually dies.|$|E
5|$|The {{major factors}} {{influencing}} diving safety are the environment, the diving {{equipment and the}} performance of the diver and the dive team. The underwater environment is alien, both physically and psychologically stressful, and usually not amenable to control, though divers can be selective in the conditions in which they are willing to dive. The other factors must be controlled to mitigate the overall <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> diver and allow the dive to be completed in acceptable safety. The equipment is critical to diver safety for life support, but is generally reliable, controllable and predictable in its performance.|$|E

5|$|The medical {{problems}} of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).|$|E
5|$|The sister {{trains in}} service with NSB were prone to {{technical}} failures, {{since they have}} to operate on hundred-year-old infrastructure on cross-mountain services. The Class 71 has more lenient operating conditions thanks to better infrastructure, and therefore has not been prone to as much malfunction. The only incident to ground all the Class 71 trains occurred on 17 June 2000, after a Class 73-train operated by NSB derailed at Nelaug Station owing to <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> axles. The Oslo Airport Express Trains were back in service the next day, while the 73-series had to wait another month before returning to service. On 24 January 2004, a Class 71 unit {{had to be taken}} out of service due to smoke from a stressed bearing, causing the replacement of the bearings on all units within days.|$|E
5|$|There are no extant written {{records of}} the make-up of the broader {{categories}} of soldiers and sailors, but since the Mary Rose carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows {{there had to be}} a considerable proportion of longbow archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number of men with a condition known as os acromiale, affecting their shoulder blades. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable <b>stress</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the pull on the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.|$|E
