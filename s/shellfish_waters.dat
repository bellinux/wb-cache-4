40|$|In North Carolina, {{more than}} 100, 000 acres of <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> {{have been closed}} to shellfishing, many since the Clean Water Act {{was put in place}} in 1972. These waters are {{considered}} impaired because of levels of fecal coliform bacteria in excess of a set water quality standard. By law, the state must develop a TMDL, or total maximum daily load, for each impaired water body. 	In North Carolina, only one TMDL for fecal coliform in <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> has been developed in the State, and it has not been implemented. North Carolina does not offer any guidelines for implementing these TMDLs. The purpose of this project was to use case study TMDLs for nonpoint sources of fecal coliform in <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> to see how they have been implemented and what North Carolina could learn from this. Land use was analyzed for coastal North Carolina counties, and the counties were categorized based on those land uses as forest, agriculture, or developed. Two case study TMDLs were selected for each category. After reading each case study, the TMDL contact for the state was interviewed about implementation of the case study and general guidelines for implementation in the state. Though some of these case studies were approved as early as 2004, none have been implemented. In addition, each state had different methods for dealing with TMDL implementation. Other means of improving water quality before TMDL development were also investigated. These included different types of best management practices, action by stakeholders, and watershed management plans. Any of these could be used to prevent water quality impairment or to improve degraded water quality. Actions can be taken on state and local levels to improve water quality in closed <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> in North Carolina. Locally, sources of fecal coliform should be identified so appropriate best management practices can be selected and implemented.

40|$|Bivalve {{shellfish}} such as {{oysters and}} mussels can concentrate human pathogens when grown in areas impacted by municipal wastewater. Under EU regulation this risk to consumers {{is controlled by}} determining the sanitary quality of bivalve shellfish production areas based on the concentration of Escherichia coli present in shellfish flesh. The authors present a modelling approach to simulate an uptake of E. coli from seawater and subsequent depuration by Mytilus edulis. The model that dynamically predicts E. coli concentration in the mussel tissue is embedded within a 3 -D numerical modelling system comprising hydrodynamic, biogeochemical, shellfish ecophysiological and the newly proposed microbial modules. The microbial module has two state variables, namely, the concentrations of E. coli in water and in the mussel tissue. Novel formulations to calculate the filtration rates by mussels and the resulting uptake of bacteria are proposed; these rates are updated at every computational time step. Concentrations of E. coli in seawater are also updated accordingly {{taking into account the}} amounts ingested by mussels. The model has been applied to Bantry Bay in the south-west of Ireland. The results indicate that the model is capable of reproducing the official classification of <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> in the bay based on monthly sampling at several stations. The predicted filtration rates and ratios of E. coli in water and mussels also compare well with the literature. The model thus forms a tool that may be used to assist in the classification of <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters</b> at much greater spatial and temporal detail than that offered by a field monitoring programme. Moreover, it can also aid in designing an efficient monitoring programme. The model can also be utilised to determine the contribution of individual point sources of pollution on the microbial loading in mussels and, when incorporated into an operational framework, it can provide a short-term forecasting of microbial contamination in a shellfishery. Also, the model can be easily extended to include other shellfish and pathogen species. EU Interreg IVB Atlantic Area Programm...|$|E

The future rainfall is downscaled, using climatic variables from HadCM 3, CSIRO and CGCM 2 GCMs, with the use of a hybrid generalized linear–artificial neural network model.

These results were obtained, under the high emissions scenario, as projected by the HadCM 3 as maximum. Nevertheless, the catchment drainage system is projected to cope with the future conditions in 2080 by all three GCMs. The results also indicate that under scenario B 1, a significant drop was projected by CSIRO, which in the worst case could reach up to 50 % in spill volume, 39 % in spill duration and 25 % in spill frequency.

In 2003, a total of 30 samples were analysed for trace metals. All mercury concentrations measured were below or close to the limit of quantification, 0. 03 mg/kg wet weight, which is well within the European maximum level of 0. 50 mg/kg wet weight for mercury in bivalve molluscs. Levels of lead were typically low, with a mean of 0. 26 mg/kg wet weight and maxima of 1. 04 mg/kg wet weight, also below the respective European maximum level of 1. 50 mg/kg wet weight. In addition, levels of cadmium were all below the European maximum level of 1 mg/kg wet weight, though the level of cadmium determined at Castlegregory in Tralee Bay was 0. 97 mg/kg, close to the European limit. Castlegregory has not been included in the sampling programme since 1994, but will be included in future monitoring. There are no internationally agreed standards or guidelines available for the remaining trace metals in shellfish.

Approaches to quantify these impacts are carried out with numerically modelling through catchment model Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and hydrodynamic model DIVAST with the focus in the coastal catchment of river Frome and Piddle connected to a natural harbour in Dorset, southern England. Firstly, the SWAT model is employed to assess the catchment flow regime and set up the baseline condition of river flow in both hourly and daily time step. The hourly simulation using Green & Ampt infiltration has excellent model performance with Nash Sutcliff Efficiency (NSE) an...|$|E
40|$|The cool, clean {{waters of}} Puget Sound provide {{some of the}} finest {{shellfish}} habitat in the world, contributing to Washington’s position as the nation’s leading producer of farmed bivalve shellfish. The region has established a strong record for restoring polluted <b>shellfish</b> <b>waters,</b> upgrading 8, 000 more commercial shellfish acres than were downgraded over the past ten years. While these efforts are essential and must continue, they also reveal important lessons and warning signs for future efforts. Pollution problems are surfacing in more areas, are increasingly complex and costly to resolve, and are exacerbated by landscape changes caused by population growth and development. These trends require more far-sighted strategies that shift emphasis away from symptoms and short-term fixes to lasting protection of water quality and watershed functions. New research underscores the need for better land use planning, watershed management and public education that promotes suitable land uses and infrastructure; preserves natural land cover and hydrologic systems; minimizes connectivity between pollution sources and receiving waters; strengthens practices to prevent pollution; establishes indicators and methods to measure landscape changes and cumulative impacts; and helps citizens and elected officials make better decisions to safeguard shellfish growing areas...|$|E
40|$|The Marine Institute, Ireland, runs a {{suite of}} {{operational}} regional and coastal ocean models. Recent developments include several tailored products {{that focus on the}} key needs of the Irish aquaculture sector. In this article, an overview of the products and services derived from the models are presented. The authors give an overview of a shellfish model developed in-house and that was designed to predict the growth, the physiological interactions with the ecosystem, and the level of coliform contamination of the blue mussel. As such, this model is applicable in studies on the carrying capacity of embayments, assessment of the impacts of pollution on aquaculture grounds, and the determination of <b>shellfish</b> <b>water</b> classes. Further services include the assimilation of the model-predicted shelf water movement into a new harmful algal bloom alert system used to inform end users of potential toxic shellfish events and high biomass blooms that include fish-killing species. Models are also used to identify potential sites for offshore aquaculture, to inform studies of potential cross-contamination in farms from the dispersal of planktonic sea lice larvae and other pathogens that can infect finfish, and to provide modelled products that underpin the assessment and advisory services on the sustainable exploitation of the resources of marine fisheries. This paper demonstrates that ocean models can provide an invaluable contribution to the sustainable blue growth of aquaculture and fisheries...|$|R
30|$|Ongoing global warming, anthropisation {{of coastal}} environments, {{international}} seafood trade, consumption of undercooked seafood and increase in individuals at risk will undoubtedly increase NOVC infections, especially in summer, as already {{demonstrated in the}} Baltic Sea (Huehn et al. 2014; Schirmeister et al. 2014), and will render NOVC infection an under-diagnosed, life-threatening, emerging infectious disease, involving economic issues (seafood importation) (Robert-Pillot et al. 2014). NOVC strains have been confirmed as potential contaminants of widely consumed food types in France, and are also present in <b>shellfish</b> and <b>water</b> samples collected from French coastal and estuarine areas (Hervio-Heath et al. 2002).|$|R
