At the Victorian Championships, she showed her potential by setting a state record of 17.4 seconds (s) for the 25-yard freestyle in the under-8 division. The following year, she covered 25 yards in 15.7 seconds, three seconds faster than Davies had {{done at the}} <b>same</b> <b>age.</b> She progressed steadily, sweeping the state age titles from nine to 13, setting records that were often faster than those by boys of the <b>same</b> <b>age.</b>|$|E

5000|$|There are {{suggestions}} that hormone levels can affect a person's perception of cuteness. Konrad Lorenz suggests that [...] "caretaking behaviour and affective orientation" [...] towards infants as an innate mechanism, {{and this is}} triggered by cute characteristics such as [...] "chubby cheeks" [...] and large eyes. The Sprengelmeyer et al. (2009) study expands on this claim by manipulating baby pictures to test groups {{on their ability to}} detect differences in cuteness. The studies show that premenopausal women detected cuteness better than <b>same</b> <b>aged</b> postmenopausal women. Furthermore, to support this claim, women taking birth control pills that raise levels of reproductive hormones detect cuteness better than <b>same</b> <b>aged</b> women not taking the pill.|$|R

5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the <b>same</b> <b>age,</b> probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
