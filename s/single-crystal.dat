5|$|In {{material}} sciences, many complicated inorganic and organometallic {{systems have}} been analyzed using <b>single-crystal</b> methods, such as fullerenes, metalloporphyrins, and other complicated compounds. <b>Single-crystal</b> diffraction is also used in the pharmaceutical industry, due to recent problems with polymorphs. The major factors affecting the quality of <b>single-crystal</b> structures are the crystal's size and regularity; recrystallization is a commonly used technique to improve these factors in small-molecule crystals. The Cambridge Structural Database contains over 800,000 structures as of September 2016; over 99% of these structures were determined by X-ray diffraction.|$|E
5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than <b>single-crystal</b> diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular faceting shapes of diamonds {{are more prone to}} breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed specifically to reduce the likelihood of breakage or splintering.|$|E
5|$|Other {{forms of}} elastic X-ray {{scattering}} include powder diffraction, Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and {{several types of}} X-ray fiber diffraction, which was used by Rosalind Franklin in determining the double-helix structure of DNA. In general, <b>single-crystal</b> X-ray diffraction offers more structural information than these other techniques; however, it requires a sufficiently large and regular crystal, which is not always available.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} growth of large <b>single-crystals</b> of Cu 2 MnAl, a {{ferromagnetic}} Heusler compound suitable for polarizing neutron monochromators, by means of optical floating zone under ultra-high vacuum compatible conditions. Unlike Bridgman or Czochralsky grown Cu 2 MnAl, our floating zone grown <b>single-crystals</b> show highly reproducible magnetic properties and an excellent crystal quality with a narrow and homogeneous mosaic spread as examined by neutron diffraction. An investigation of the polarizing properties in neutron scattering suggests a high polarization efficiency, limited by the relatively small sample dimensions studied. Our study identifies optical floating zone under ultra-high vacuum compatible conditions as a highly reproducible method to grow high-quality <b>single-crystals</b> of Cu 2 MnAl.

40|$|A micro-spectrophotometer is {{described}} allowing {{the measurement of}} absorption and emission spectra of very small oriented <b>single-crystals</b> in polarized light. The faint emission intensity requires a well linked up micro-optical system. The low signal-current makes it necessary to count photons and to cool simultaneously the photomultiplier. For cooling of the <b>single-crystals</b> a helium evaporation cryostat {{is described}}, suitable to measure the microscopic objects in polarized light and to adjust the crystals even at low temperatures.

Hull also used the powder method to determine the structures of various metals, such as iron and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of <b>single-crystal</b> X-ray crystallography has three basic steps. The first—and often most difficult—step is {{to obtain an}} adequate crystal of the material under study.

5|$|In the 1950s, {{research}} {{started in}} the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800°C. This low-pressure process is known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, {{but it was not}} reported until 1962. Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, <b>single-crystal</b> diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led to massive research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|During the {{processing}} of bauxite to alumina in the Bayer process, gallium accumulates in the sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it can be extracted {{by a variety of}} methods. The most recent is the use of ion-exchange resin. Achievable extraction efficiencies critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite. At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15 % of the contained gallium is extractable. The remainder reports to the red mud and aluminium hydroxide streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal. For semiconductor use, it is further purified with zone melting or <b>single-crystal</b> extraction from a melt (Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less valence electron than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in <b>single-crystal</b> CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
40|$|Seventy-five {{synthetic}} powder trioctahedral mica samples (between Mg, Co, Ni, and Fe end members, {{with different}} degrees of oxidation, vacancy and Al/Si contents, and including an OH/F substitution series) were studied by room-temperature powder X-ray diffraction. The iron-bearing samples were studied by 57 Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy. Subsets of the samples were also characterized by scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive spectroscopy, optical microscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, and gas chromatography. Lattice parameters (refined under the 1 M stacking polytype, space group C 2 /m) were determined for all powder samples and iron site populations ([4]Fe 3 +, [6]Fe 2 +, and [6]Fe 2 +) were obtained from Mossbauer spectroscopy. The relation (c/a) cosbeta* = 113 was found to hold exactly (within experimental error) for all synthetic powders whereas it does not hold in general for synthetic and natural 1 M <b>single-crystals.</b> The above relation is predicted to hold for geometric home-octahedral sheets (having equal M 1 and M 2 site bond lengths) and not to hold for geometric meso-octahedral sheets (having unequal M 1 and M 2 site bond lengths). The counter-rotation of the M 2 site of 1 M <b>single-crystals</b> exactly (within experimental error) follows the geometric meso-octahedral sheet model, which, assuming a uniform octahedral sheet height and site-specific M 1 and M 2 bond lengths, predicts site-specific flattening angles and a counter-rotation angle for the M 2 site which is uniquely determined by the bond length difference between the M 1 and M 2 sites. A geometric meso-octahedral 2 : 1 layer silicate was shown to require corrugated tetrahedral sheets composed of bond-distorted tetrahedra. Key geometric meso-octahedral distortions in 1 M <b>single-crystals</b> were identified and elucidated: (i) intra-layer top-bottom displacements within a TOT layer; and (ii) a tetrahedral bending angle between the apical bond and the pyramidal base formed by the three basal bonds. Plots of lattice parameter b versus average-octahedral-bond-length allowed the following distinction to be made: Unoxidized divalent synthetic solid solution series tend to evolve along constant flattening-angle lines whereas trivalent octahedral cation and vacancy bearing natural <b>single-crystals</b> and synthetic powders follow trends with varying flattening angles. We found that the bond length of a given interlayer cationic species monotonously increases as the tetrahedral rotation angle alpha decreases in trioctahedral- 1 M <b>single-crystals.</b> An upper limit of tetrahedral rotation of alpha = 9. 5 ° was demonstrated to occur in trioctahedral- 1 M K-rich micas having an sheet, for both synthetic powders and natural <b>single-crystals.</b> Other attempts at applying geometric crystal chemical models and at identifying structure-chemical relationships from structural refinement data {{will benefit from the}} perspective of our more complete and systematic approach based on pursuing simple geometrical models using 'regular' coordination polyhedrons and characteristic cation-specific bond lengths up to the limit beyond which such models are shown to necessarily breakdown because of unavoidable 'non-regular' polyhedral distortions.

5|$|The nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{have improved}} creep strength {{with the addition}} of rhenium. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium. Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the F-15 and F-16, whereas the newer <b>single-crystal</b> third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. Rhenium is also used in the superalloys, such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial gas turbine engines like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause superalloys to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP (topologically close packed) phases. In 4th- and 5th-generation superalloys, ruthenium is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new superalloys are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is <b>single-crystal</b> X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, <b>single-crystal</b> ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, and polished into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
