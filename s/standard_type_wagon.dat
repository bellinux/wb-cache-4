2500|$|The church {{architecture}} of Cornwall and Devon typically {{differs from that}} of the rest of southern England: most medieval churches in the larger parishes were rebuilt in the later medieval period with one or two aisles and a western tower, the aisles being the same width as the nave and the piers of the arcades being of one of a few <b>standard</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Wagon</b> roofs often survive in these churches. The typical tower is of three stages, often with buttresses set back from the angles. Only a few Cornish church towers are beautiful or striking, the majority are plain and dull. Part of the reason is the shortage of good building stone in the county. The arcades of those churches with aisles generally have piers of one of three different types: Type A [...] "consists of four attached shafts in the main axes and four hollows in the diagonals"; Type B which seems to have been in use earlier has [...] "square piers with four attached demi-shafts"; or octagonal piers. Type A is very common in both Devon and Cornwall.|$|R

In 1933, they launched their [...] "S" [...] <b>type</b> <b>wagons.</b> A fast, well thought out and reliable design, it was a valiant attempt to maintain the steam wagon market.

50|$|As the H <b>type</b> <b>wagons</b> were withdrawn, more goods was {{transported by}} the {{alternative}} method of open wagons fitted with tarpaulins.

It was decided to recycle old steel underframes, using components from and a similar design to the then-new bogie boxvans, {{to create a new}} fleet of four-wheeled, all-steel boxvans.|$|R

50|$|The German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband) or DWV was an {{association}} of the German state railways Länderbahnen founded in 1909. The purpose of the association was to guarantee the unrestricted exchange of goods wagons between the member railway administrations.

It developed a total of eleven different <b>wagon</b> <b>types,</b> the Verbandsbauart (literally: association <b>type)</b> or DWV <b>wagons.</b> In addition to entire goods <b>wagons,</b> <b>types</b> of bogie were also specified.|$|R
