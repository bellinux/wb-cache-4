60|$|The {{discovery}} of a toy duck in the <b>soap</b> <b>dish,</b> presumably the property of some former juvenile visitor, contributed not a little to this new and happier frame of mind. What with one thing and another, I hadn't played with toy ducks in my bath for years, and I found the novel experience most invigorating. For the benefit of those interested, I may mention that if you shove the thing under the surface with the sponge and then let it go, it shoots {{out of the water}} in a manner calculated to divert the most careworn. Ten minutes of this and I was enabled to return to the bedchamber much more the old merry Bertram.|$|E
60|$|When Fan awoke, {{physically}} {{well and}} refreshed by her long slumber, {{it had been}} light some time, with such dim light as found entrance through the clouded panes of one small window. The day was gloomy, with a bitterly cold blustering east wind, which made the loose window-sashes rattle in their frames, and blew the pungent smell of city smoke in at every crack. She sat up and looked round at the small cheerless apartment, with no fireplace, and for only furniture the bed she was lying on, one cane- chair over which her clothes were thrown, and a circular iron wash-stand, with yellow stone jug and ewer, and underneath a shelf for the <b>soap</b> <b>dish.</b>|$|E

40|$|The water {{pollution}} is {{mainly caused by}} the residual of bathing <b>soap,</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>soap,</b> and detergent {{that comes from the}} household activities. Those three pollutant often mixed up with the domestic pollutant and it causes the death of microorganism. One of the ways of reducing the {{water pollution}} especially those coming from the household activities is by doing the isolation on microorganism in that pollutant. The previous researches are: the specification of inoculums microorganism of pollutant decomposer of detergent tolerance: the effort of biodegradation of domestic household pollution which is environmentally friendly in the crowded area by Lud Waluyo in 2007. in this study we can find many kinds of isolate of the fungi and fom those are chosen seven isolate in which we find many colonies in it for example B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, B 5, B 6, B 8, B 15 and B 19. They are all the chosen isolate. From the chosen isolate we find those pollutant coming from the household activities that is those coming from the bathing <b>soap,</b> detergent, and <b>dishes</b> <b>soap</b> residue. Detergent and bathing <b>soap</b> and <b>dishes</b> <b>soap</b> is one of the disinfectant and antiseptic often used in daily life. By knowing the fungi isolate of those pollutant then we can know the detergent decomposer of bathing soap and detergent. This study aims at determining which fungi isolate that has a high tolerance of detergent, bathing <b>soap</b> <b>dishes</b> <b>soap.</b> This is a descriptive study in which all the observation is done whatever it is without giving the intended treatment just to show the object observed. The population in this study is the fungi in the pollutant which is isolated from the household water residue in Malang which is divided into 5 district; they are Lowok waru, Blimbing, Klojen, Sukun and Kedung Kandang. The result of the study based on the diameter of range zone in the highest concentration says that the isolate affect the tolerance of the detergent. It is B 6 isolate which has the potency to be tolerant to the detergent, and B 8 isolate which has the potency to be tolerant to the bathing soap, the B 19 isolate has the potency to be tolerant to <b>dishes</b> <b>soap.</b> Keywords: the durability test, isolate, fungi, detergent, bathing <b>soap,</b> detergent, and <b>dishes</b> <b>soap...</b>|$|R
60|$|Heaven {{knows that}} I had no {{intention}} of touching the child's work then or later; but, that evening, a stroll through the garden brought me unawares full on it; so that I trampled, before I knew, marigold-heads, dust-bank, and fragments of broken <b>soap</b> <b>dish</b> into confusion past all hope of mending. Next morning, I came upon Muhammad Din crying softly to himself over the ruin I had wrought. Some one had cruelly told him that the Sahib was very angry with him for spoiling the garden, and had scattered his rubbish, using bad language the while. Muhammad Din laboured for an hour at effacing every trace of the dust bank and pottery fragments, and it was with a tearful and apologetic face that he said, 'Talaam, Tahib,' when I came home from office. A hasty inquiry resulted in Imam Din informing Muhammad Din that, by my singular favour, he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased. Whereat the child took heart and fell to tracing the ground-plan of an edifice which was to eclipse the marigold-polo-ball creation.|$|E
60|$|Then he jumped. The {{head was}} lying a little {{clear of the}} water jar, under the curve of it; and, as his teeth met, Rikki braced {{his back against the}} bulge of the red {{earthenware}} to hold down the head. This gave him just one second's purchase, and he made the most of it. Then he was battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and fro on the floor, up and down, and around in great circles, but his eyes were red and he held on as the body cart-whipped over the floor, upsetting the tin dipper and the <b>soap</b> <b>dish</b> and the flesh brush, and banged against the tin side of the bath. As he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter, for he made sure he would be banged to death, and, for the honor of his family, he preferred to be found with his teeth locked. He was dizzy, aching, and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a thunderclap just behind him. A hot wind knocked him senseless and red fire singed his fur. The big man had been wakened by the noise, and had fired both barrels of a shotgun into Nag just behind the hood.|$|E
60|$|The tumbler {{was secured}} {{in a more}} curious manner still. It {{was placed in a}} brass ring, which {{projected}} from the wall in a corner over the wash stand, and which was made just large enough to receive it. The <b>soap</b> <b>dish</b> and the brush tray were also placed in sockets cut to receive them in the marble slab, which formed {{the upper part of the}} wash stand. The looking glass was round, and was screwed to the wall by means of a stem and a ball or socket joint, in such a manner that it could be set in any position required, according to the height of the observer, and yet it could not by any possibility fall from its place. There were very few pegs or pins for hanging clothes upon, because, when clothes are thus hung, they are found to swing back and forth whenever the ship is rolling in a heavy sea, in a manner that is very tiresome and disagreeable for sick passengers to see. Nor were there many shelves about the state room; for if there had been, the passengers would be likely to put various articles upon them when the sea was smooth; and then, when the ship came to pitch and roll in gales of wind, the things would all slide off upon the floor. So instead of shelves there were pockets made of canvas or duck, several together, one above another. These pockets formed very convenient receptacles for such loose articles as the passengers might have in their state rooms, and were, of course, perfectly secure.|$|E

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} referred to as the (African) rainbow crab, (Nigerian) moon crab or patriot crab. Adults are sometimes labelled as soapdish crabs in the pet industry.

The names moon crab and soapdish crab are sometimes applied to other similar crab species, leading to frequent confusion with other colourful crabs such as the three remaining species of Cardisoma, Gecarcinus ruricola and G. quadratus (all except C. carnifex from the Americas).|$|R
