5|$|ATP {{is also a}} {{substrate}} of adenylate cyclase, {{most commonly}} in G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction pathways and is transformed to <b>second</b> <b>messenger,</b> cyclic AMP, which is involved in triggering calcium signals by the release of calcium from intracellular stores. This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function, although it {{is involved in the}} regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{function}} of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, {{as part of}} a <b>second</b> <b>messenger</b> system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum.|$|E
5|$|Calcium is {{the fifth}} most {{abundant}} element {{in the human body}} and the most abundant metal. Calcium ions {{play a vital role in}} the physiology and biochemistry of organisms and the cell as electrolytes. They play an important role in signal transduction pathways, where they act as a <b>second</b> <b>messenger,</b> in neurotransmitter release from neurons, in contraction of all muscle cell types, and in fertilization. Many enzymes require calcium ions as a cofactor. Calcium ions outside cells are also important for maintaining the potential difference across excitable cell membranes, as well as proper bone formation.|$|E

The concentration of these <b>second</b> <b>messengers</b> is determined to a large extent by the relative synthetic activity of adenylate cyclase and degrative activity of cyclic nucleotide PDE. The role of PDE1 enzymes is to degrade both cGMP and cAMP.|$|R
5|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} {{has several}} essential roles in metabolism. It {{acts as a}} coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the <b>second</b> <b>messenger</b> molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases {{and a group of}} enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.|$|E
5|$|The low {{concentration}} of calcium in the cytosol allows calcium ions {{to function as}} a <b>second</b> <b>messenger</b> in calcium signaling. Here, a signal such as a hormone or an action potential opens calcium channels so that calcium floods into the cytosol. This sudden increase in cytosolic calcium activates other signalling molecules, such as calmodulin and protein kinase C. Other ions such as chloride and potassium may also have signaling functions in the cytosol, but these are not well understood.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates {{to respond to}} changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These signals are usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These signals are then transmitted inside the cell by <b>second</b> <b>messenger</b> systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.|$|E

5|$|Synapses {{are the key}} {{functional}} elements of the brain. The essential function of the brain is cell-to-cell communication, and synapses are the points at which communication occurs. The human brain has been estimated to contain approximately 100 trillion synapses; even the brain of a fruit fly contains several million. The functions of these synapses are very diverse: some are excitatory (exciting the target cell); others are inhibitory; others work by activating <b>second</b> <b>messenger</b> systems that change the internal chemistry of their target cells in complex ways. A large number of synapses are dynamically modifiable; that is, {{they are capable of}} changing strength {{in a way that is}} controlled by the patterns of signals that pass through them. It is widely believed that activity-dependent modification of synapses is the brain's primary mechanism for learning and memory.|$|E

Therefore it is important to mimic their behavior in the model, where the activation of the G-protein initiates the liberation of <b>second</b> <b>messengers.</b> Due to the volume of the biological system under study, the signaling pathway is simulated also with stochastic algorithm.

25|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{acts as a}} <b>second</b> <b>messenger</b> {{because it}} is a free radical that can diffuse through the plasma {{membrane}} and affect nearby cells. It is synthesised from arginine and oxygen by the NO synthase and works through activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase, which when activated produces another <b>second</b> <b>messenger,</b> cGMP. NO can also act through covalent modification of proteins or their metal co-factors; some have a redox mechanism and are reversible.

25|$|For {{several types}} of {{intercellular}} signaling molecules that are unable to permeate the hydrophobic cell membrane due to their hydrophilic nature, the target receptor is expressed on the membrane.

40|$|SummaryMore {{than half}} of human cancers have aberrantly {{upregulated}} phosphoinositide signals; yet how phospholipid signals are controlled during tumorigenesis is not fully understood. We report here that TIPE 3 (TNFAIP 8 L 3) is the transfer protein of phosphoinositide <b>second</b> <b>messengers</b> that promote cancer. High-resolution crystal structure of TIPE 3 shows a large hydrophobic cavity that is occupied by a phospholipid-like molecule. TIPE 3 preferentially captures and shuttles two lipid <b>second</b> <b>messengers,</b> i. e., phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphateÂ and phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate, and increases their levels in the plasma membrane. Notably, human cancers have markedly upregulated TIPE 3 expression. Knocking out TIPE 3 diminishes tumorigenesis, whereas enforced TIPE 3 expression enhances it inÂ vivo. Thus, the function and metabolism of phosphoinositide <b>second</b> <b>messengers</b> are controlled by a specific transfer protein during tumorigenesis...|$|R

Endothelial prostacyclin binds to prostanoid receptors on the surface of resting platelets.
