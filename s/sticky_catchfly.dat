50|$|A special plant {{community}} has grown on the granite rocks. Plants {{such as the}} snowy mespilus (Amelanchier ovalis), dyer’s greenweed (Genista tinctoria), browntop bent (Agrostis capillaris), <b>sticky</b> <b>catchfly</b> (Lychnis viscaria), blue stonecrop (Sedum reflexum) are particularly common.|$|E
50|$|Silene caroliniana (common names <b>sticky</b> <b>catchfly</b> {{and wild}} pink) is a spring {{flowering}} perennial forb with pink flowers, which {{is native to}} the Eastern United States. It is listed as an endangered species {{by the state of}} Florida. It is found growing in habitats such as dry rocky or sandy forests, barrens, and outcrops.|$|E
40|$|Bumble bee {{abundance}} in agricultural landscapes {{is known to}} decrease with increasing distance from seminatural grasslands, but whether the pollination of bumble-bee-pollinated wild plants shows a similar pattern is less well known. In addition, the relative effects of landscape composition (landscape heterogeneity) and landscape configuration (distance from seminatural grassland) on wild plant pollination, and the interaction between these landscape effects, have not been studied using landscape-level replication. We performed a field experiment to disentangle these landscape effects on the pollination of a native herb, the <b>sticky</b> <b>catchfly</b> (Lychnis viscaria), while accounting for the proportion of oilseed rape across landscapes and the local abundance of bee forage flowers. We measured pollen limitation (the degree to which seed set is pollen-limited), seed set, and seed set stability using potted plants placed in landscapes that differed in heterogeneity (composition) and distance from seminatural grassland (configuration). Pollen limitation and seed set in individual plants {{did not respond to}} landscape composition, landscape configuration, or proportion of oilseed rape. Instead, seed set increased with increasing local bee forage flower cover. However, we found within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to increase with increasing distance from seminatural pasture. Our results suggest that average within-plant levels of pollen limitation and seed set respond less swiftly than the within-plant variability in pollen limitation and seed set to changes in landscape configuration. Although landscape effects on pollination were less important than predicted, we conclude that landscape configuration and local habitat characteristics play larger roles than landscape composition in the pollination of L. viscaria...|$|E
40|$|Evolution {{does not}} run {{backward}} in any literal sense: The second law of thermodynamics determines that. However, as the quote above from Darwin indicates, regressive evolution, {{such as the}} loss of something once possessed, leaving only a vestige, {{is a very important}} facet of evolution and one of the strongest pieces of evidence for the evolutionary process. A famous example is the human vermiform appendix, which is hard to explain unless humans evolved from ancestors possessed of a leaf-eater’s caecum. In the first edition of the Origin (1859), not only does Darwin have a section entitled “Rudimentary, atro-phied, or aborted organs, ” but he also mentions rudiments or rudimentary organs more than 100 times throughout the work. Another section of the Origin is titled “Reversion to long lost characters, ” further indicating the importance of regressive evolution to the development of his theory. In the age of molecular biology, we have the opportu-nity to explain these phenomena at the level of genes and molecules, an endeavor that both deepens the evolution-ary synthesis and strengthens the evidence for evolution that Darwin realized comes from regressive evolution. In the quotation above, Darwin refers to the experiments by Koelreuter (1775) on crosses between the dioecious red campion (Silene dioica), with vestigial sex organs, and the hermaphrodite white <b>sticky</b> <b>catchfly</b> (Silene viscosa). Darwin realized that the intermediate size of the organs in the hybrids was excellent evidence that vestigial traces were indeed rudiments of the sexual organs and not some different class of structure, thus forestalling any argu-ments from his opponents on this score. This must be the first example of the use of genetics for homology deter-mination, and Darwin’s line of thought harmonizes well with modern evolutionary developmental genetics...|$|E
