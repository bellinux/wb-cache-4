40|$|Effects of {{nutrient}} solution concentration on cut flower yield, quality {{and characteristics of}} seasonal nutrient absorption of spray carnation ‘Barbara’ grown by cultivation in drip fertigation were investigated. 'Barbara' was grown with a {{nutrient solution}} (N: 15 %, P: 6. 5 %, K: 12. 5 %, Ca: 3. 6 %, Mg: 0. 9 %), at three concentration levels which were high concentration (1, 000 times), middle concentration (1, 500 times) and low concentration (3, 000 times). The daily amount of nutrient solution was ranged from 0. 0 mm to 13. 9 mm. The total cut flower yield of middle concentration and high concentration were bigger than that of low concentration. The weight of the second cut flower of low concentration was decreased as {{compared to that of}} middle concentration and high concentration. Nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) in the plant nutrient ratio were decreased as the increase of dry matter and phosphorus (P) was increased at autumn and spring. With a reduction in the soil nutrient contents, Nitrogen and potassium in the plant nutrient ratio of low concentration were decreased. Nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil nutrient contents of high concentration were increased at the end of cultivation. In the total nutrient absorbed amount of middle concentration, 2, 807. 9 mg nitrogen, 493. 5 mg phosphorus, 3, 667. 4 mg potassium, 1, 615. 8 mg calcium (Ca) and 320. 9 mg magnesium (Mg) were absorbed per plant. In spring, the ratio of nitrogen absorbed amount to nutrients absorbed amount was increased 1. 3 times. Phosphorus ratio and phosphorus absorbed amount in spray carnation were fewer than that of <b>standard</b> <b>carnation.</b> There were no differences in total nitrogen, potassium, calcium and magnesium absorption between spray carnation and <b>standard</b> <b>carnation.</b> スプレーカーネーションのかん水同時施肥法における養分吸収特性を‘バーバラ’で調査した．窒素：リン（P）：カリウム（K）：カルシウム（Ca）：マグネシウム（Mg）の含有率（%）が 15 ： 6. 5 ： 12. 5 ： 3. 6 ： 0. 9 の液肥を，低濃度（ 3, 000 倍），中濃度（ 1, 500 倍），高濃度（ 1, 000 倍）の 3 水準で，毎日 0. 0 ～ 13. 9 ㎜ずつ点滴給液した．切り花収量は中濃度区と高濃度区が多く，切り花品質は 2 番花において低濃度区の切り花重が減少した．植物体の窒素およびカリウム含有率は乾物増加量が増大するにつれて低下し，リンは秋期と春期に減少した．低濃度区の窒素，カリウムの含有率は土壌養分含有量の減少にともない，低下した．高濃度区では土壌の窒素およびリン含有量が栽培終了時に大幅に増大した．中濃度での給液における１株当たりの総養分吸収量は窒素が 2, 807. 0 ㎎，リンが 493. 5 ㎎，カリウムが 3, 667. 4 ㎎，カルシウムが 1, 615. 8 ㎎，マグネシウムが 320. 9 ㎎であった．リン，カリウム，カルシウム，マグネシウムの窒素に対する吸収割合はいずれも春期に約 1. 3 倍に上昇した．スタンダードカーネーションとの比較では，スプレーカーネーションでは，ややリンの植物体含有率と吸収量が少ないが，窒素，カリウム，カルシウム，マグネシウムの植物体含有率および吸収量には，ほとんど差がなかった...|$|E
40|$|The {{cut flower}} {{business}} requires exact synchronicity between product offer and demand in consumer countries. Having tools {{that help to}} improve this synchronicity through predictions or crop growth monitoring could provide an important advantage to program standards and corrective agronomic practices. At the Centro de Biotecnologia Agropecuaria, SENA (SENA’s Biotechnology, Agricultural and Livestock Center), located in Mosquera, Cundinamarca, a trial with <b>standard</b> <b>carnation</b> cv. Delphi grown under greenhouse conditions was carried out. The objective {{of this study was}} to build a simple model of dry matter (DM) production and partition of on-carnation flower stems. The model was based on the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) MJ m- 2 d- 1 and temperature as exogenous variables and assumed no water or nutrient limitations or damage caused by pests, disease or weeds. In this model, the daily DM increase depended on the PAR, the light fraction intercepted by the foliage (FLINT) and the light use efficiency (LUE) g MJ- 1. The LUE in the vegetative and reproductive stages reached values of 1. 31 and 0. 74 g MJ- 1, respectively. The estimated extinction coefficient (k) value corresponded to 0. 53 and the maximum FLINT was between 0. 79 and 0. 82. Partitioning between the plant vegetative and reproductive stages was modeled based on the hypothesis that the partition is regulated by the source sink relationship. The estimated partition coefficient for the vegetative stage of the leaves was 0. 63 and 0. 37 for the stems. During the reproductive stage, the partitioning coefficients of leaves, stems and flower buds were 0. 05, 0. 74, and 0. 21, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) is an {{important}} flower crop, having substantial commercial value as a cut-flower due to the long vase-life and wide array of flower colours and forms. <b>Standard</b> <b>carnation</b> varieties perform well under cool climates but are very susceptible to high temperatures which adversely affect the yield {{and the quality of}} the cut-flowers. Despite several studies of carnation contributing to the number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), transcriptomic information of this species remains very limited, particularly regarding abiotic stress-related genes. Here, transcriptome analysis was performed to generate expression profiles of heat stress (HS) -responsive genes in carnation. We sequenced a cDNA library constructed with mixed RNA from carnation leaves subjected to 42 oC HS (0, 0. 5, 1 and 2 h) and 46 oC HS (0. 5, 1 and 2 h), and obtained 45, 604, 882 high quality paired-end reads. After de novo assembly and quantitative assessment, 99, 255 contigs were generated with an average length of 1053 bp. We then obtained functional annotations by aligning contigs with public protein databases including NR, SwissProt, KEGG and COG. Using the above carnation transcriptome as the reference, we compared the effects of high temperature treatments (42 oC: duration 0. 5, 2 or 12 h) delivered to aseptic carnation seedlings, relative to untreated controls, using the FPKM metric. Overall, 11, 471 genes were identified which showed a significant response to one or more of the three HS treatment times. In addition, based on GO and metabolic pathway enrichment analyses, a series of candidate genes involved in thermo-tolerance responses were selected and characterized. This study represents the first expression profiling analysis of D. caryophyllus under heat stress treatments. Numerous genes were found to be induced in response to HS, the study of which may advance our understanding of heat response of carnation...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] During 2001, $ 1. 7 {{billion in}} U. S. imports {{from the four}} Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) {{beneficiary}} countries entered the United States duty-free under provisions in the ATPA; however, {{a significant portion of}} these duty-free entries (36 percent or $ 589 million) probably would have qualified for duty-free entry under other existing U. S. trade preference programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences. Thus, approximately 64 percent ($ 1. 1 billion) of these duty-free entries represent the unique benefits of the ATPA to the ATPA-beneficiary nations. These unique ATPA benefits represented 11. 1 percent of total U. S. imports from the ATPA beneficiary nations and 0. 1 percent of total U. S. imports from all nations in 2001. Over 94 percent of the items eligible for ATPA duty-free treatment actually entered duty-free. The main finding of this report is: Preferential tariff treatment under the ATPA {{does not appear to have}} had an adverse impact on, or have constituted a significant threat to, U. S. employment. While declines in production and possibly employment in some sectors of the cut flower industry (<b>standard</b> <b>carnations,</b> <b>standard</b> and pompon chrysanthemums, and roses) may have been affected to some extent by the tariff preferences granted under the ATPA program, other factors may also have contributed to these production and employment declines...|$|R
40|$|Most {{important}} breeding {{goals in}} ornamental crops are plant appearance and flower characteristics where selection is visually performed on direct offspring of crossings. We developed an image analysis toolbox for {{the acquisition of}} flower and petal images from cultivated carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.) that was validated by {{a detailed analysis of}} flower and petal size and shape in 78 commercial cultivars of D. caryophyllus, including 55 standard, 22 spray and 1 pot carnation cultivars. Correlation analyses allowed us {{to reduce the number of}} parameters accounting for the observed variation in flower and petal morphology. Convexity was used as a descriptor for the level of serration in flowers and petals. We used a landmark-based approach that allowed us to identify eight main principal components (PCs) accounting for most of the variance observed in petal shape. The effect and the strength of these PCs in <b>standard</b> and spray <b>carnation</b> cultivars are consistent with shared underlying mechanisms involved in the morphological diversification of petals in both subpopulations. Our results also indicate that neighbor-joining trees built with morphological data might infer certain phylogenetic relationships among carnation cultivars. Based on estimated broad-sense heritability values for some flower and petal features, different genetic determinants shall modulate the responses of flower and petal morphology to environmental cues in this species.

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Science (Plant Protection)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. Maize is {{the most}} {{important}} cereal crop produced in southern Africa. Worldwide, Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum are the most commonly reported fumonisin producing fungi to infect maize. Both are important producers of fumonisins that are associated with animal mycotoxicoses. F. verlicillioides-infected maize has also been associated with human oesophageal cancer in South Africa, northern Italy and Iran, Increased incidence of liver cancer has also been reported from certain endemic areas of the People's Republic of China due to ingestion of F. verticillioides-infected maize. The carcinogenic risk that fumonisins pose to humans was evaluated by the World Health Organisation's - International Agency for Research on Cancer (WHO-IARC). They were classified as Group 2 B carcinogens, which means that they are probably carcinogenic to humans. This potential threat highlights the necessity for screening human and animal foodstuffs for fumonisins. A primary concern in evaluating potential health risks associated with mycotoxin-contaminated foodstuffs is the reliability of fumonisin detection methods, A number of detection methods have been developed, but results are not consistent when compared. Substantial mycotoxin research has been carried out but high variation in mycotoxin results and species identification confounded statistical analysis of data. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify and address sources of variation in the quantification of species identification and fumonisin quantification. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of the importance of maize as a primary crop for subsistence, resource-poor and commercial farmers and the potential threat fumonisins pose to the safety of humans and animals. The objective of chapter 2 was to determine whether fumonisin levels in milled maize samples increase or decrease over time prior to testing for fumonisins, Grain samples from Sannieshof, Ventersdorp and Lichtenburg was evaluated for fumonisin levels every two months for a year. High variation in fumonisin levels quantified with the same samples was observed over time, indicating sources of variation which needs to be studied. Chapter 3 addressed sources of variation associated with sampling and improving sampling procedures to reduce this variation. Maize kernel samples were selected from five localities with high fumonisin levels. These samples were used for investigating the following four sources of variation, namely 1) subsample size (increasing from 25 g to 1000 g, 2) establish variation of fumonisins within a single maize sample, 3) number of replications (5 to 25) using prescribed 25 g subsamples and modified 250 g subsamples and 4) variation between laboratories and techniques for fumonisin detection. In chapter 4 the incidence of F. verticillioides, F. subglutinans, F. proliferaturn and fumonisins in maize from warmer production areas of South Africa was evaluated to determine 1) the incidence and geographic spread of Fusarium pathogens from maize grain silos in South Africa, 2) to study the relationship between isolation frequency, fumonisin incidence and ergosterol concentration and 3) to establish the relationship between fumonisin tevels and weather parameters. Chapter 5 aimed to 1) determine Fusarium spp, variation in maize samples, 2) compare the accuracy of Fusarium spp. identification on rose bengal-glycerine-urea (RbGU) as selective and identification medium with split plates containing <b>standard</b> <b>Carnation</b> Leaf (CLA) & Potato Dextrose Agars (PDA) as identification media and 3) detect and quantify potential bias among enumerators (inter-enumerator reliability) in direct microscopic identifications of F. verticillioides, F. proliferaturn and F. subglutinans. Reducing variation in quantification of fumonisins and improving Fusarium spp. identification on maize kernels, would increase confidence and accuracy in this technology. This will improve the value of research on this topic. Improved accuracy in detection and quantification of fumonisins will also contribute directly to the establishment of realistic and safe tolerance levels for this toxin in basic and processed foodstuffs. This in turn is important in ensuring food safety for humans and animals. Master...|$|E
