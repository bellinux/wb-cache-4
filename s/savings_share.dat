40|$|Firms {{increasingly}} issue {{shares for}} the purpose of cash savings. During the 1970 s, $ 1. 00 of issuance resulted in $ 0. 23 of cash savings; over the most recent decade, $ 1. 00 of issuance resulted in $ 0. 60 of cash savings. This increase is caused by increasing precautionary motives. Proxies for precautionary motives increase over the sample period, and firm-level increases in these proxies are associated with firm-level increases in share issuance-cash <b>savings.</b> <b>Share</b> issuance-cash savings are inversely related to issuance costs, suggesting that firms issue and save when costs are low, so as to avoid issuing when costs are high. This framework can also help explain patterns and trends in share issuance activity over time.

40|$|Background In several countries, {{health care}} {{policies}} gear toward strengthening {{the position of}} primary care physicians. Primary care physicians are increasingly expected to take accountability for overall spending and quality. Yet traditional models of paying physicians do not provide adequate incentives for taking on this new role. Under a so-called <b>shared</b> <b>savings</b> program physicians are instead incentivized to take accountability for spending and quality, as the program lets them <b>share</b> in cost <b>savings</b> when quality targets are met. We provide a structured approach to designing a <b>shared</b> <b>savings</b> program for primary care, and apply this approach {{to the design of}} a <b>shared</b> <b>savings</b> program for a Dutch chain of primary care providers, which is currently being piloted. Methods Based on the literature, we defined five building blocks of <b>shared</b> <b>savings</b> models that encompass the definition of the scope of the program, the calculation of health care expenditures, the construction of a savings benchmark, the assessment of savings and the rules and conditions under which <b>savings</b> are <b>shared.</b> We apply insights from a variety of literatures to assess the relative merits of alternative design choices within these building blocks. The <b>shared</b> <b>savings</b> program uses an econometric model of provider expenditures as an input to calculating a casemix-corrected benchmark. Results The minimization of risk and uncertainty for both payer and provider is pertinent to the design of a <b>shared</b> <b>savings</b> program. In that respect, the primary care setting provides a number of unique opportunities for achieving cost and quality targets. Accountability can more readily be assumed due to the relatively long-lasting relationships between primary care physicians and patients. A stable population furthermore improves the confidence with which savings can be attributed to changes in population management. Challenges arise from the institutional context.

We support the concept ofACOs because shared accountability for beneficiary health will address both gaps in quality and unnecessary costs caused by fragmented and poorly coordinated care. Moreover, <b>shared</b> <b>savings</b> will support activities that improve care and lower health care costs—namely, care coordination services—which are not currently reimbursed under the Medicare fee-for-service program.

Meeting the Core Objectives of the Shared Savmgs Program NASW supports the three core objectives of the <b>Shared</b> <b>Savings</b> Program: better care for individuals, better health for populations, and lower growth in health care expenditures. We believe these goals cannot be achieved, however, without the participation of a broader array of providers in the ACO health care team. In particular, we recommend greater specificity regarding the types of psychosocial supports and services that ACOs must provide. In the absence of such requirements, ACOs may fail to address the social determinants of health an...|$|R

40|$|This paper quantifies {{lifetime}} redistribution in Dutch occupational {{pension schemes}} associated with uniform pricing. Information {{about the extent}} of redistribution is important because it will influence the public acceptance of the pension system. The uniform contribution rate is split up into a <b>saving</b> <b>share</b> and a transfer share for different socioeconomic groups. The transfer share, in turn, consists of intergenerational and intragenerational transfers. We find that the relative size of the saving- and transfer shares strongly depends on socioeconomic characteristics, such as gender and level of education. The saving part is higher for females than for males and it increases with the level of education, which implies that uniform pricing involves a large transfer from males to females and from low educated to higher educated workers. The impact of intergenerational transfers is modest. ...|$|R

Themes emerged surrounding preserving and using mementos, qualities that imbue value to mementos, meanings associated with sharing mementos, and tensions around saving, clutter, and discarding. The themes highlight qualities of ambivalence and ambiguity surrounding sentimental behavior.
