5|$|Acetic acid , {{systematically}} named {{ethanoic acid}} , is a colourless liquid organic compound with the chemical formula CH3COOH (also written as CH3CO2H or C2H4O2). When undiluted, {{it is sometimes}} called glacial acetic acid. Vinegar is roughly 3–9% acetic acid by volume, making acetic acid {{the main component of}} vinegar apart from water. Acetic acid has a distinctive sour taste and pungent <b>smell.</b> <b>In</b> addition to household vinegar, it is mainly produced as a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and cellulose acetate. It is classified as a weak acid since it only partially dissociates in solution, but concentrated acetic acid is corrosive and can attack the skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the rhinarium {{does not have any}} {{olfactory}} receptors, so it is not used for <b>smell</b> <b>in</b> terms of detecting volatile substances. Instead, it has sensitive touch receptors (Merkel cells). The rhinarium, upper lip, and gums are tightly connected by a fold of mucous membrane called the philtrum, which runs from the tip of the nose to the mouth. The upper lip is constrained by this connection and has fewer nerves to control movement, which leaves it less mobile than the upper lips of simians. The philtrum creates a gap (diastema) between the roots of the first two upper incisors.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of <b>smell</b> <b>in</b> tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, Baroš {{was accused}} of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian {{opponent}} Stéphane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his nose in front of Mbia and waved his hand as if to waft away an unpleasant <b>smell.</b> <b>In</b> the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture {{was not intended to}} be racist in any way, and he was only trying to tell Mbia to get out of his face and leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E

30|$|Other studies {{proposed}} {{different approaches}} to detect code <b>smells</b> <b>in</b> software. Oizumi et al. (2016) proposed that code smells are related, appearing together in the source code to compose different design problems. In this approach, code smells are detected as agglomerations, unlike our work, where we focus on strategies that identify code smells individually. Another study by Fontana et al., (2015) applied 16 different machine-learning algorithms in 74 software systems to detect four code <b>smells</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to avoid some common problems of code smell detectors.|$|R
30|$|As {{explained}} before, {{we compare}} developers using agglomeration with {{a control group}} using non-agglomerated smells. Thus, we divided the participants into two groups. The first group would identify design problems using agglomerations in the first step. After that, they would identify design problems using non-agglomerated <b>smells</b> <b>in</b> the second step. The second group of participants would make the identification inversely: using the non-agglomerated <b>smells</b> <b>in</b> the first step and, then, using the agglomerations in the second step. Thus, in each step, we have two groups of participants: a group using agglomerations and a control group.|$|R

25|$|Most {{non-human}} mammals {{have a much}} keener {{sense of}} smell than humans, although the mechanism is similar. An example of <b>smell</b> <b>in</b> non-mammals is that of sharks, which combine their keen sense of smell with timing to determine {{the direction of a}} smell. They follow the nostril that first detected the smell. Insects have olfactory receptors on their antennae.|$|E
30|$|In {{this second}} study, {{we use the}} code smell {{reference}} lists (Section 3.2) to analyze the evolution of code <b>smells</b> <b>in</b> MobileMedia and in Health Watcher.

25|$|Manatees emit a {{wide range}} of sounds used in communication, {{especially}} between cows and their calves. Their ears are large internally but the external openings are small, and they are located four inches behind each eye. Adults communicate to maintain contact and during sexual and play behaviors. Taste and <b>smell,</b> <b>in</b> addition to sight, sound, and touch, may also be forms of communication.|$|E
25|$|The soul is {{sometimes}} plainly {{perceived to be}} but one in its own sensorium, while the body is understood to be all that so variously modifies impressions as to make them in the one instance <b>smell,</b> <b>in</b> another taste, another sight, and thus on, ad finem. Thus the hasheesh-eater {{knows what it is}} to be burned by salt fire, to smell colors, to see sounds, and, much more frequently, to see feelings.|$|E
25|$|Wood ash or sawdust {{can also}} be added {{on top of the}} feces to {{decrease}} the smell. However, this is rarely done for pit latrines (more commonly done for dry toilets) as the users find that too much hassle and generally do not expect a pit latrine to be odour free and rather put up with some <b>smell.</b> <b>In</b> the case of Arborloos it is recommended to add some leaves, soil or compost into the pit after defecation.|$|E

25|$|The ancient Romans planted {{vineyards}} near garrison towns so wine {{could be}} produced locally rather than shipped over long distances. Some {{of these areas}} are now world-renowned for wine production. The Romans discovered that burning sulfur candles inside empty wine vessels kept them fresh and free from a vinegar <b>smell.</b> <b>In</b> medieval Europe, the Roman Catholic Church supported wine because the clergy required it for the Mass. Monks in France made wine for years, aging it in caves. An old English recipe that survived in various forms until the 19th century calls for refining white wine from bastard—bad or tainted bastardo wine.|$|E
25|$|The resort used United States Steel's then newly {{developed}} construction process for its original longhouses; steel frames were erected on-site, and pre-constructed modular rooms were lifted into these frames via crane, similar to Disney's Contemporary Resort. This {{method of building}} caused problems in both Disney's Polynesian and Contemporary Resorts, with guest complaints of a moldy <b>smell</b> <b>in</b> their rooms. It was found that mold and debris had collected in the spaces between each room. The spaces were filled in, stopping the problem, and Longhouses built {{as part of the}} resort's later expansions were built using conventional building techniques.|$|E
25|$|Chemical senses {{include the}} use of chemoreceptors, related to taste and smell, {{affecting}} mating, habitat selection, feeding and parasite-host relationships. Taste is usually located on the mouthparts of the insect but in some insects, such as bees, wasps and ants, taste organs can also be found on the antennae. Taste organs can also be found on the tarsi of moths, butterflies and flies. Olfactory sensilla enable insects to smell and are usually found in the antennae. Chemoreceptor sensitivity related to <b>smell</b> <b>in</b> some substances, is very high and some insects can detect particular odours that are at low concentrations miles from their original source.|$|E
40|$|Code smells are {{characteristics}} of software that indicate that code {{may have a}} design problem. Code smells have been proposed {{as a way for}} programmers to recognize the need for restructuring their software. Because code smells can go unnoticed while programmers are working, tools called smell detectors have been developed to alert programmers to the presence of <b>smells</b> <b>in</b> their code, and to help them understand the cause of those <b>smells.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we propose a novel smell detector called Stench Blossom that provides an interactive ambient visualization designed to first give programmers a quick, high-level overview of the <b>smells</b> <b>in</b> their code, and then, if they wish, to help in understanding the sources of those code smells. We also describe a laboratory experiment with 12 programmers that tests several hypotheses about our tool. Our findings suggest that programmers can use our tool effectively to identify smells and to make refactoring judgements. This is partly because the tool serves as a memory aid, and partly because it is more reliable and easier to use than heuristics for analyzing smells...|$|R

25|$|M. flavitarsis wasps also locate prey by <b>smell.</b> <b>In</b> one study, holes {{were made}} in a leaf and placed near a plant that had holes made in its leaves twelve days prior. Once {{caterpillar}} larvae {{were placed on the}} leaf, the time for the wasp to locate the larvae was recorded. It was found that M. flavitarsis are more likely to approach the freshly damaged leaf, which release mechanical odors that serve as cues for the wasps. In studies, these wasps are more likely to approach a leaf based on olfactory cues, rather than visual cues. This shows that presented olfactory stimuli are processed before the wasp processes visual stimuli.|$|E
25|$|As {{the centre}} of trade gravitated towards Amsterdam, Haarlem {{declined}} in the 18th century. The Golden age had created a large upper middle class of merchants and well-to-do small business owners. Taking advantage of {{the reliability of the}} trekschuit connection between Amsterdam and Haarlem, many people had a business address in Amsterdam and a weekend or summer home in Haarlem. Haarlem became more and more a bedroom community as the increasingly dense population of Amsterdam caused the canals to <b>smell</b> <b>in</b> the summer. Many well-to-do gentlemen moved their families to summer homes in the Spring and commuted between addresses. Popular places for summer homes were along the Spaarne in southern Haarlem. Pieter Teyler van der Hulst and Henry Hope built summer homes there, as well as many Amsterdam merchants and councilmen. Today, it is still possible to travel by boat along the Spaarne and this has turned into a popular form of tourism in the summer months. In the 18th century Haarlem became the seat of a suffragan diocese of the Old Catholic Church of Utrecht.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} ORS are unknown. It {{is thought that}} {{significant}} negative experiences may trigger the development of ORS. These have been considered as two types: key traumatic experiences related to smell, and life stressors present when the condition developed but which were unrelated to <b>smell.</b> <b>In</b> one review, 85% of reported cases had traumatic, smell-related experiences, and 17% of cases had stress factors unrelated to smell. Reported smell-related experiences usually revolve around family members, friends, co-workers, peers or other people making comments about an odor from the person, which causes embarrassment and shame. Examples include accusation of flatulence during a religious ceremony, or being bullied for flatulence such at school, accidental urination in class, announcements about a passenger needing to use deodorant over speaker by a driver on public transport, sinusitis which caused a bad taste in the mouth, mockery about a fish odor from a finger which had been inserted into the person's vagina {{in the context of}} a sexual assault, and revulsion about menarche and brother's sexual intimacy. It has been suggested that a proportion of such reported experiences may not have been real, but rather early symptom of ORS (i.e. referential thoughts). Examples of non smell-related stressful periods include guilt due to a romantic affair, being left by a partner, violence in school, family illness when growing up (e.g. cancer), and bullying.|$|E

30|$|Since we {{compiled}} {{the code}} smell reference list {{to measure the}} tools accuracy, we conducted a secondary study to analyze the evolution of code <b>smells</b> <b>in</b> nine versions of MobileMedia and in ten versions of Health Watcher. We found that for MobileMedia, only the number of God Classes increases as the system evolves, while for Health Watcher, the number is constant. We also found that most smelly classes and methods are already created with the smell. That {{is the case for}} 74.4 % of the <b>smells</b> <b>in</b> MobileMedia and 87.5 % in Health Watcher. This result confirms the findings of Tufano et al. (2015). Due to this result, Tufano et al. (2015) recommends that developers should apply code <b>smell</b> detection tools <b>in</b> classes and methods before commits, instead of running the detection tools in the entire system from time to time. However, in case running the tools during commit tasks is not possible, detection tools could be used before new releases to avoid or at least reduce the number of code <b>smell</b> instances introduced <b>in</b> the system.|$|R
