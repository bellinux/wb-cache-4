5000|$|Dovetail: Typically seen on <b>square,</b> <b>hewn,</b> or chink-style logs. A {{dovetail}} joint is {{cut on the}} end of a log, where it would rest in a corner—one to the right and one to the left; this creates a tight, interlocking corner. Handcrafted dovetails can be [...] "full dovetail" [...] (notch surface slopes in two directions simultaneously) or [...] "half dovetail" [...] (notch surface slopes in one direction).|$|E
5000|$|The tomb or {{mausoleum}} {{in which}} the bodies were deposited was constructed of the lumber of a broken-up flatboat. First a cross was made from timbers one foot <b>square,</b> <b>hewn</b> out of logs which had drifted down the river, and erected {{on the crest of}} the hill. It was twenty-two feet high, and the cross-beam was twelve feet long. Around this cross was built a box twenty-two feet long, six feet wide, and two feet deep, located exactly on a north and south line. After the bodies had been placed in the box it was covered with plank. A ridge-pole sixteen feet long was then framed into the cross five feet above the top of the box, and its ends were supported by timbers sloping outward. A roof was then formed by placing timbers side by side against the ridge-poles and ends. The whole outside was then covered with stones, and when completed it resembled a pyramidal mound of stones surmounted by a cross.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{excavation}} area {{is situated}} on the North-East slope of the earthenwork. The first stage of field work involved {{the eastern part of}} the excavation area and then proceeded in an East-West direction. In the second stage of the excavation the central western and southern sectors were excavated. The excavation ended on 23 / 10 / 1997 with the discovery of an area of 23 squares for a total of almost 575 sq. m [...] During the first stage of the excavation, facing the northern part, a classical three-piered gate was found with the central axis oriented NE-SW. The North side rests directly on the main part of the rampart, to which is connected by stratified layers of compacted red soil containing heavy deposit of limestone, arranged in horizontal strips almost intentionally, like a hinge between the two, uniting them (door and rampart) architecturally. The structure is constructed entirely of stone, but each part has distinctive technical and constructive features. The eastern end of the area consists of a long wall oriented in an East-West direction which establishes the boundaries of a hypothetical outer forecourt, which is situated in front of the entrance to the gate. In the central eastern area of the North front, the discovery of a probable substructure has been found of a more or less square, angular, defensive tower (M. 7030), measuring 4 x 4 m., which is raised by using rows of medium and large stones arranged in three horizontal rows. These stones in the eastern façade form a stepped wall which could possibly have been, originally, used as access stairs to the fortification. The upper part of the substructure features a surface drawing, consisting of well arranged small stones, possibly the base for the collapsed mudbrick wall which was removed during the excavation. The wall defining in the North the passage of the gate M. 7010 features a structural body built of medium large stones arranged in superimposed rows, sloping towards the surface of the inner passage. The low revetment of the façade is composed of large, attractive, well-hewn squared stones arranged in a way to draw the three-piered plan, that is a classical architectural and structural element of Middle Bronze city gates. The eastern part of the façade was badly damaged and shows the superimposition of constructions work done at a later date (taken down and removed). These last structures also covered the southern façade of the so-called M. 7030 tower. The West part of the exterior perimeter of the gate, presumed to be the third pier delimiting the room L. 7015, has been completely removed, but its existence is well documented by a mark, where the low revetment of the gate and the stone-paved road L. 7015, were in contact. The inner gate access consisted of an impressive stone-paved road (L. 7015), under which was located a well built drain (L. 7007), that allowed the lower city’s sewage to be transported outside of the rampart. The road is seriously damaged in its eastern half, because of continued usage for remover up until recent times. Plundering of these stones are also a reason for the disappearance of the entire southern section of the gate. In the western area of the excavation a small, rectangular room with an entrance on the south side and an axial niche obtained from the northern part of the wall, was identified. The foundations of the North and West sides abutted the rampart. Only after the removal of an Iron Age small installation that had a similar orientation, which concealed the original southern structure of the Middle Bronze room, while reusing the North and West walls, was it possible to reach the building. The southern area of the excavation is also seriously damaged, nevertheless it was possible to find traces of a large wall oriented NW-SE (M. 7031), delimited on the West by a row of regular, <b>square,</b> <b>hewn</b> stones. This structure was reached after the removal of collapsed boulder sized stones, which were positioned in a North-South line. The body of the wall was constructed, like M. 7010, of a bed of large stones positioned horizontally to form a stepped western side. The upper part was a surface made up of stones of varying dimensions, probably the base for the mudbrick structure. A well made floor of small pebbles and mortar (4 cm. thick) abuts the West side of M. 7031, so that it is difficult to value the stratigraphic relation between the two architectural elements (the floor L. 7021 and the wall M. 7031). The short wall M. 7049 is the South-West border between the zone behind the gate and the lower city; the beaten floor found outside the wall is similar to the one that originally was connected to the paved road. On the North side of M. 7031 a limestone orthostat has been found, perfectly cut, that probably was part of the low outer revetment of the gate’s South-West limit. A small door socket, immediately on the East, if in situ, should indicate, along with the orthostat, the South limit of the gate’s inner road...|$|E
50|$|Most rafts {{were made}} up of <b>squared</b> timbers, either <b>hewn</b> <b>square</b> by hand or sawn square by upcountry sawmills. Some timbers were carefully, {{smoothly}} hewn, {{and there was a}} demand for them, especially in England, after steam sawmilling became common. On the Altamaha, for many years during the rafting era, most rafts were {{made up of}} “scab” timber, that is, logs roughly squared by broad ax for tighter assembly and for gang sawmills which could cut flat-face timber only.|$|R
5000|$|A {{log house}} or log {{building}} is a structure built with horizontal logs interlocked at the corners by notching. Logs may be round, <b>squared</b> or <b>hewn</b> to other shapes, either handcrafted or milled. The term [...] "log cabin" [...] generally refers to a smaller, more rustic log house, such as a hunting cabin in the woods, {{that may or may}} not have electricity or plumbing.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the timbers {{would have}} been <b>hewn</b> <b>square</b> using a felling axe and then surface-finished with a broadaxe. If required, smaller timbers were ripsawn from the hewn baulks using pitsaws or frame saws. Today, timbers are more {{commonly}} bandsawn, and the timbers may sometimes be machine-planed on all four sides.|$|R
50|$|In 1989, the Jerusalem Municipality {{conducted}} routine {{development work}} in the area. Upon widening a narrow street {{near one of the}} approached to the Silwan Village, bulldozers uncovered a number of <b>square</b> openings <b>hewn</b> into rock. The Israel Antiquities Authority immediately stopped the road construction. After uncovering the underground spaces, archeologists found themselves standing inside large burial complexes which appeared intact. Moving carefully from one chamber to another, flashlights revealed an abundance of artifacts scatters on the floors, pottery and glass vessels, oil lamps and many ornamental ossuaries. The three large caves proved to be part of an extensive Jewish burial ground in use {{at the end of the}} Second Temple Period, which terminated in the year 70 AD, when Jerusalem was conquered and the Temple destroyed by the Roman legions.|$|R
60|$|The four great {{outer walls}} of Roccaleone stood ranged into a mighty square, {{of which the}} castle proper {{occupied}} but half. The other half, running from north to south, was a stretch of garden, broken into three terraces. The highest of these {{was no more than}} a narrow alley under the southern wall, roofed from end to end by a trellis of vines on beams blackened with age, supported by uprights of granite, <b>square</b> and roughly <b>hewn.</b>|$|R
6000|$|To {{the left}} of the road North of the Fiumara, and leading to the mountains, stands Hamzah's Mosque, which, like the Harim of Al-Madinah, is a Mausoleum as well as a fane. It is a small {{strongly}} built <b>square</b> of <b>hewn</b> stone, with a dome covering the solitary hypostyle to the South, and the usual minaret. The Westward wing is a Zawiyah or oratory,[FN#18] frequented by the celebrated Sufi and Saint, Mohammed al-Samman, the [...] "Clarified Butter-Seller," [...] one of whose blood, the reader will remember, stood by my side in the person of Shaykh Hamid. On the Eastern side of the building a half wing projects; and a small door opens to the South, upon a Mastabah or stone bench five or six feet high: this completes the square of the edifice. On the right of the road opposite Hamzah's Mosque, is a large erection, now in ruins, containing a deep hole leading to a well, with huge platforms for the accommodation of travellers. Beyond, towards the mountains, are the small edifices presently to be described.|$|R
60|$|Thus, as we {{saw that}} unity demanded for its {{expression}} what at first might have seemed its contrary (variety) so repose demands for its expression the implied capability of its opposite, energy, and this even in its lower manifestations, in rocks and stones and trees. By comparing the modes in which the mind is disposed to regard the boughs of a fair and vigorous tree, motionless in the summer air, with the effect produced by one of these same boughs <b>hewn</b> <b>square</b> and used for threshold or lintel, the reader will at once perceive the connection of vitality with repose, and the part they both bear in beauty.|$|R
500|$|The Red Feather Inn is a {{heritage}} listed building in Hadspen's main street. It was {{built as a}} coaching inn and {{in the 21st century}} has been used for a restaurant and accommodation. The building's frontage is a substantial sandstone single-storey building. Land falls away sharply from the street and the building's rear has two-storeys. Rising affluence in the 1840s had enabled growth of the coach transport industry. When built the Red Feather Inn was the first horse-change point on the road from Launceston, [...] away, to Deloraine, {{and it was one of}} the colony's earliest coaching inns. It was built, starting in 1842, for local police magistrate Charles Arthur. It was built [...] by John Sprunt, also builder of Macquarie House in Launceston's civic <b>square,</b> using convict <b>hewn</b> sandstone blocks.|$|R
60|$|Without {{a word he}} rose, and, {{taking me}} politely by the hand, {{advanced}} with a lamp {{to one of the}} small passages that I had noticed opening out of the central cave. This we followed for about five paces, when it suddenly widened out into a small chamber, about eight feet <b>square,</b> and <b>hewn</b> out of the living rock. On one side of this chamber was a stone slab, about three feet from the ground, and running its entire length like a bunk in a cabin, and on this slab he intimated that I was to sleep. There was no window or air-hole to the chamber, and no furniture; and, on looking at it more closely, I came to the disturbing conclusion (in which, as I afterwards discovered, I was quite right) that it had originally served for a sepulchre for the dead rather than a sleeping-place for the living, the slab being designed to receive the corpse of the departed. The thought made me shudder in spite of myself; but, seeing that I must sleep somewhere, I got over the feeling as best I might, and returned to the cavern to get my blanket, which had been brought up from the boat with the other things. There I met Job, who, having been inducted to a similar apartment, had flatly declined to stop in it, saying that the look of the place gave him the horrors, and that he might as well be dead and buried in his grandfather's brick grave at once, and expressed his determination of sleeping with me if I would allow him. This, of course, I was only too glad to do.|$|R
5000|$|In 630 {{his brother}} Rusticus, the Bishop of Cahors, was killed during a riot, whereupon the clergy {{and people of}} that city {{requested}} from the king Desiderius as his successor. By a letter of April 8, 630, Dagobert made known his consent, and Desiderius was consecrated Bishop of Cahors. With the other bishops of his time, many of them educated {{with him at the}} royal court, he maintained an active correspondence. He was a zealous promoter of monastic life and founded a monastery in the vicinity of Cahors, the church of which was dedicated to St. Amantius; later on the convent was called after its founder St Géry (i.e. Dierius, from Desiderius). He directed also a convent of women, as we see from a letter written by him to the Abbess Aspasia. Under him and with his support was likewise founded in his diocese the monastery of St. Peter of Moissac. Desiderius built three large basilicas in and near Cahors (St Maria, St Peter and St Julian) and an oratory in honor of St Martin. The finished style of his building was notable, not of vernacular materials of wood, wattle and thatch, butin the manner of the ancients out of <b>squared</b> and <b>hewn</b> stones, not indeed in our Gallican fashion, but just as a whole circuit of ancient walls is wont to be built; thus from the foundations to the topmost pinnacle he completed the work with squared stones' (quoted in Greenhalgh) He also built an aqueduct to serve Cahors, and rebuilt the walls and towers (castella) that protected the city, as well as the Castrum Mercurio in Cahors itself. His actions show how much the bishop acted for the public good with the authority of a count or of a patricius. Desiderius persuaded the nobles of his diocese to endow churches and monasteries.|$|R
5000|$|Kluge House, {{also known}} as Maverick House, is a rare example of Silesian fachwerk, log and half-timber construction, located in Helena, Montana. In mid-1964 the home was almost {{destroyed}} as a fire hazard as it had fallen into disrepair and transients were living in it. A shed {{is attached to the}} north side of the house. The second floor was built in 1882. Prior to that Kluge had apparently done significant work on the original cabin's first floor, which has <b>hewn</b> <b>squared</b> logs. The second floor is half-timber filled in with bricks. The second floor diagonal logs brace the framing logs. The overall dimensions of the house are 30'-11" [...] x 16'-4" [...] with a foundation of stone found locally. There are front and rear doors on the first floor. The front door is asymmetrically located and the rear door is near a corner. The second floor is reached only via an exterior staircase. The house has a brick fireplace. The first floor has an entrance vestibule and two rooms of dissimilar size. The smaller room has a hatch leading to a cellar. The second floor has a floor plan that is very similar to that of the first floor but it is reversed, i.e., two rooms and a vestibule. Floors are wooden.|$|R
60|$|Woolstone-lane was a {{locality}} that sorely tried the coachmen of Mrs. Charlecote's West End connections, situate {{as it was}} on the very banks of the Thames, and containing little save offices and warehouses, in the midst of which stood Honora's home. It was not the rectory, but had been inherited from City relations, and it antedated the Fire, so {{that it was one of}} the most perfect remnants of the glories of the merchant princes of ancient London. It had a court to itself, shut in by high walls, and paved with round-headed stones, with gangways of flags in mercy to the feet; the front was faced with <b>hewn</b> <b>squares</b> after the pattern of Somerset House, with the like ponderous sashes, and on a smaller scale, the Louis XIV. pediment, apparently designed for the nesting-place of swallows and sparrows. Within was a hall, panelled with fragrant softly-tinted cedar wood, festooned with exquisite garlands of fruit and flowers, carved by Gibbons himself, with all his peculiarities of rounded form and delicate edge. The staircase and floor were of white stone, tinted on sunny days with reflections from the windows' three medallions of yellow and white glass, where Solomon, in golden mantle and crowned turban, commanded the division of a stout lusty child hanging by one leg; superintended the erection of a Temple worthy of Haarlem; or graciously welcomed a recoiling stumpy Vrow of a Queen of Sheba, with golden hair all down her back.|$|R
