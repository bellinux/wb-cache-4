50|$|Service on a Virginia {{corporation}} may be effected on any {{officer or}} {{director of the}} company, or on the company's registered agent (every company is required to name a registered agent); however, if no registered agent has been named (or the named agent {{can not be found}} at the address provided), then <b>substituted</b> <b>service</b> can be effected on the clerk of the State Corporation Commission. Similarly, service on a foreign corporation may be effected through the company's registered agent, or through the clerk of the State Corporation Commission (who will mail a copy to the corporation's registered office), or to any officer or director of the company who can be found in Virginia. A foreign corporation which has not registered to do business in Virginia may still be sued in Virginia courts if it does extensive business in the state. Service on a general partnership may be effected on any general partner, which Virginia law holds to be sufficient to give notice to both the partnership as an entity, and to all named partners.|$|E
5000|$|Personal {{service is}} {{service of process}} {{directly}} to the (or a) party named on the summons, complaint, or petition. In most lawsuits in the United States, personal service is required to prove service. Most states allow <b>substituted</b> <b>service</b> in almost all lawsuits unless you are serving a corporation, LLC, LLP, or other business entity; in those cases, personal service must be achieved by serving (in hand) the documents to the [...] "Registered Agent" [...] of a business entity. Some states, e.g. Florida, do not require that the documents actually be handed to the individual. In California and most other states, the documents must be visible to the person being served, i.e., not in a sealed envelope. If the individual refuses to accept service, flees, closes the door, etc., and the individual has been positively identified as the person to be served, the documents may be [...] "drop served" [...] (placed {{as close to the}} individual as possible); this is considered a valid service. Personal service of process has been the hallmark for initiating litigation for nearly 100 years, primarily because it guarantees actual notice to a defendant of a legal action against him or her. Personal service of process remains the most reliable and efficacious way to both ensure compliance with constitutionally imposed due process requirements of notice to a defendant and the opportunity to be heard.|$|E

40|$|Web {{services}} are {{programs that are}} self-contained, self-describing, interoperable, platform-independent, and accessible over a network. These properties allow several Web services to be combined {{together to form a}} Web service composition. However, when a component service within a Web service composition becomes unavailable or unusable, it is necessary to identify a <b>substitute</b> <b>service</b> that can replace the failed component while preserving the original functionality of the composition. This is the problem of Web service substitution. Most existing work that addresses this problem requires strict functional equivalence between the original component and its substitute. In contrast, Pathak et al. have shown in 2007 that it is sufficient for a <b>substitute</b> <b>service</b> to provide the same functionality with respect {{to the rest of the}} composition as the component it is replacing. Pathak et al. apply a technique called quotienting to determine the portion of the composition 2 ̆ 7 s overall functionality that is satisfied by the original component. The quotienting operation yields the property that must be satisfied by a substitute for that component. While the use of quotienting allows more possible <b>substitute</b> <b>services</b> to be accepted, it is possible to relax the substitutability condition even further by considering asynchronous communication between component services within the Web service composition model. Our work accomplishes this task by providing a formal framework for representing asynchronous communication within a Web service composition. In our framework, the asynchronous communication is encapsulated in a buffer process, which stores each message until a component is ready to consume it.

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} {{popularity of}} XML Web services motivates us to examine {{if it is}} feasible to substitute one vendor service for another when using a Web-based application, assuming that these services are “derived from ” a common base. If such substitution were possible, end users could use the same application {{with a variety of}} back-end vendor services, and the vendors themselves could compete on price, quality, availability, etc. Interoperability with substituted services is non-trivial, however, and four types of incompatibilities may arise during such interoperation – structural, value, encoding and semantic. We address these incompatibilities three-fold: (1) static and dynamic analysis tools to infer whether an application is compatible with a <b>substituted</b> <b>service,</b> (2) semiautomatically generated middleware components called cross-stubs that actually resolve incompatibilities and enable interoperation with substituted services, and (3) a lightweight mechanism called multi-option types to enable applications to be written from the ground up in an interoperation-friendly manner. Using real applications and services as examples, we both demonstrate and evaluate our tools and techniques for enabling interoperation with substituted services. ...|$|E
40|$|Williams v. North Carolina I {{simplified}} the law {{on interstate}} divorce by compelling the recognition of foreign divorces it the petitioner was domiciled in the state granting the divorce, and without reference to which of the spouses was at fault. · In doing so, it overruled {{the doctrine of the}} Haddock case, according to which the domiciliary state of the respondent, who was not personally before the divorce court, need not recognize the foreign divorce. It also did away with the special doctrine laid down in Atherton v. Atherton, which made the recognition of the foreign decree upon <b>substituted</b> <b>service</b> compulsory if it was rendered by the courts of the last matrimonial domicil, that is, of the state in which the parties last lived together as husband and wife. Williams v. North Carolina I was tried on the assumption that North Carolina had the power under the Haddock doctrine to attack the Nevada decree because the Nevada court had no personal jurisdiction over the respondent. For that reason it did not challenge the finding of the Nevada court that the petitioners had acquired a domicil in Nevada. The Supreme Court of the United States did not find it necessary, therefore, to discuss the subject of domicil as a prerequisite for divorce jurisdiction. The existence of domicil in Nevada became the decisive issue upon review by certiorari, in Williams v North Carolina II, of the judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina which convicted the Nevada divorcees of bigamous cohabitation...|$|E

40|$|Runtime service {{reconfiguration}} is {{put forward}} {{as one of}} the means by which we may provide dependable service-oriented architectures (SOA), and more precisely, continuity in service provisioning, and robustness in the presence of change. Indeed, with the advent of wireless networks, computing environments are becoming highly dynamic. From a user-oriented point of view, this dynamics comes at the price of dependability, due to runtime variations in terms of (1) service availability, and (2) network connection/infrastructure availability, according to user/service mobility. In this context, the main focus of this thesis is to incorporate support for dynamic reconfiguration in SOA systems, in order to tolerate runtime variations and ensure continuity in service provisioning for the users. In particular, we focus on middleware support for runtime service reconfiguration. Our main contribution consists in enabling service continuity by (1) substituting a service that becomes unavailable at runtime with a semantically similar one, and (2) translating and transferring the current state of interaction to the substitute service in order to resume the execution after its interruption. The need for state translation is due to the environments' heterogeneity, since the unavailable and substitute services are not assumed to be identically implemented, nor are they identically described. However, state translation may not be sufficient to guarantee state compatibility between the substitute service and the unavailable one: in some cases, the substitute service may be compatible with an earlier state of interaction, instead of the last one. Hence, we need to invalidate a set of results performed by the unavailable service, in order to synchronize the state of the substitute service. Indeed, the execution of the substitute service may provide different results from those provided by the execution of the unavailable service. In the case of service composition, still-available services –involved in the SOA system– may be affected by the substitution due to their data dependencies with the <b>substituted</b> <b>service.</b> Thus, the middleware synchronizes the state of still-available services according to the state transferred to the substitute service. The outcome of our contribution is SIROCCO (ServIce Reconfiguration upOn serviCe unavailability and Connectivity lOss), a middleware infrastructure that enables transparent runtime reconfiguration of SOA systems upon service unavailability. The middleware discovers candidate substitute services {{that can be used in}} the place of the service that becomes unavailable. It then tries to identify the best service amongst these candidates that can be used as an actual substitute. In the best case, the selected substitute service must be such that its current state can be synchronized with the last state of the service that is substituted. In the case of service composition, the middleware also checks data dependencies with the still-available services and synchronizes their state with respect to the transferred state. The above concepts of SIROCCO are discussed along with an experimental evaluation of our prototype. Our findings show that SIROCCO provides the necessary means for achieving dynamic service reconfiguration, where the gain in close-to-seamless continuity in service provisioning outweighs the computing and communication overhead on the execution of the SOA system.
