40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} is to explore how <b>specialist</b> cancer <b>nurses</b> carry out first {{assessments}} of patients in the community, their use of the Symptoms and Concerns Checklist (SCC) and their views on first assessments. Methods & Sample: An ethnographic approach was taken. The data were collected by use of non-participant observation of <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> carrying out a first assessment of patients with cancer, followed by semi-structured interviews with six <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses.</b> Data were analysed using iterative thematic analysis. Key results: All the <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> recognised the value of facilitating the patients’ narrative. Use of the SCC was seen to jar with the overall theme of building relationships during the first assessment visit. It was recognised by the <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> that the SCC was beneficial in prompting the patients to discuss psycho-social concerns. Conclusions: This study gives insight into the conflict and ambiguity for <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> when using the SCC during the first assessment visit. It confirms the SCC as beneficial in cueing some patients to identify specific concerns and for these concerns to be recognised by the <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses...</b>|$|R

40|$|Venous leg ulcer {{management}} in the UK varies significantly. Judgements made by nurses contribute to this variability and it is often assumed that <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> make better judgements than non-specialist nurses. This paper compares the judgements of community tissue viability <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> and community generalist nurses; specifically, the ways they use clinical information and their levels of accuracy. To compare specialist and non-specialist UK community nurses' clinical information use when managing venous leg ulceration and their levels of accuracy when making diagnoses and judging the need for treatment. Judgement analysis. UK community and primary care nursing services. 18 community generalist nurses working in district (home) nursing teams and general practitioner services and 18 community tissue viability <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses.</b> Data were collected in 2011 and 2012. 18 community generalist nurses and 18 community tissue viability <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> made diagnostic and treatment judgements on 110 clinical scenarios and indicated their confidence in each of their judgements. Scenarios were generated from real patient cases and presented online using text and photographs. An expert panel made judgements, and reached consensus on the same scenarios. These judgements were used as a standard against which to compare the participants. Logistic regression models and correlational statistics were used to generate various indices of judgement "performance": accuracy, consistency, confidence calibration and information use. Differences between groups of nurses with different levels of characteristics linked to expertise were explored using analysis of variance. <b>Specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> had similar cue usage to the generalist nurses but were more accurate when making diagnostic and treatment judgements. It is not obvious why the tissue viability <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> were more accurate. One possible reason might be the greater opportunities for 'deliberate practice' afforded to specialists. However, restricting aspects of practice only to <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> is likely to hinder the judgement performance of generalists...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Increasing {{the number}} of {{patients}} participating in research studies is a current priority in the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom. The role of <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> in inviting patients to participate is important, yet little is known about their experiences of doing so. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the perceptions of barriers and facilitators held by <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> with experience of inviting adult NHS patients to a wide variety of research studies. Methods A cross-sectional qualitative descriptive study was conducted between March and July 2015. Participants were 12 <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> representing 7 different clinical specialties and 7 different NHS Trusts. We collected data using individual semi-structured interviews, and analysed transcripts using the Framework method to inductively gain a descriptive overview of barriers and facilitators. Results Barriers and facilitators were complex and interdependent. Perceptions varied among individuals, however barriers and facilitators centred on five main themes: i) assessing patient suitability, ii) teamwork, iii) valuing research, iv) the invitation process and v) understanding the study. Facilitators to inviting patients to participate in research often stemmed from specialist nurses’ attitudes, skills and experience. Positive research cultures, effective teamwork and strong relationships between research and clinical teams at the local clinical team level were similarly important. Barriers were reported when <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> felt they were providing patients with insufficient information during the invitation process, and when <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> felt they did not understand studies to their satisfaction. Conclusion Our study offers several new insights regarding the role of <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> in recruiting patients for research. It shows that strong local research culture and teamwork overcome some wider organisational and workload barriers reported in previous studies. In addition, and in contrast to common practice, our findings suggest research teams may benefit from individualising study training and invitation procedures to specialist nurses’ preferences and requirements. Findings provide a basis for reflection on practice for <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses,</b> research teams, policymakers, and all with an interest in increasing patient participation in research...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{concept of}} a ‘specialist nurse’ has existed {{for many years and}} related {{education}} programmes are proliferating. However, while literature clearly outlines the roles and practice of registered nurses and advanced practice <b>nurses,</b> those of <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> remain unclear and nursing specializations across Europe need clarifying. Aim: This pilot study aimed to explore the competencies, education requirements and regulation of <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses</b> in Europe. Design: A descriptive cross-sectional survey. Methods: An online questionnaire named ‘Specialist nurse and specialization in Europe’ was sent to 550 members of the European Federation of Nurse Educators and ten members of the European <b>Specialist</b> <b>Nurses</b> Organizations. Snowball sampling was then used to build a convenience sample of nurse educators, clinical <b>nurses</b> and <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses,</b> national nursing association members, and chief nursing officers from all European countries. Besides quantitative aspects, responses to open-ended questions were analysed using a qualitative content analysis process. Results: A total of 77 experts from 29 European countries responded to the questionnaire. Findings highlighted variations in titles, levels and length of education, certification, regulation and scope of practice for specialized nurses in Europe. Analysis of the promoted competencies revealed dominant clinical and technical aspects of the role {{with a high level of}} knowledge. Conclusions: The study emphasized the need to improve standards for education, certification and regulation for <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses.</b> Interpretation of the role and competencies is diverse with a weak presence of health policy that would enhance and develop the specialities. Implications for nursing and health policy: To address the current lack of provisions for automatic recognition of <b>specialist</b> <b>nurses,</b> common training frameworks corresponding to the relevant level of the European Qualifications Framework should promote lifelong learning and mobility, and enhance levels of health care and patient safety.

40|$|Abstract Background Specialist nurses {{may play}} an {{important}} role in helping to improve the experiences of patients with prostate cancer, however there is concern that the <b>specialist</b> <b>nurse</b> role is under threat in the UK due to financial pressures in the NHS. This study explored the role and value of specialist nurses in prostate cancer care via a survey and patient interviews. Methods This paper reports findings from two studies. A survey of patients from three hospitals across the UK (289 / 481, 60 %), investigated whether patients who saw a <b>specialist</b> <b>nurse</b> had different experiences of information provision and involvement in decision-making, to those who did not. Qualitative interviews were also carried out with 35 men recently tested or treated for prostate cancer, recruited from two hospitals in the UK. Interviews explored patients' views on the role and value of the <b>specialist</b> <b>nurse.</b> Results Survey findings indicated that patients who saw a <b>specialist</b> <b>nurse</b> had more positive experiences of receiving written information about tests and treatment, and about sources of advice and support, and were more likely to say they made the treatment decision themselves. In interviews, patients described <b>specialist</b> <b>nurse</b> input in their care in terms of providing information and support immediately post-diagnosis, as well as being involved in ongoing care. Two key aspects of the <b>specialist</b> <b>nurse</b> role were seen as unique: their availability to the patient, and their ability to liaise between the patient and the medical system. Conclusion This study indicates the unique role that specialist nurses play in the experience of patients with prostate cancer, and highlights the importance of maintaining <b>specialist</b> <b>nurse</b> roles in prostate cancer care. </p...|$|E
