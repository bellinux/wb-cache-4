40|$|The {{level of}} {{accessibility}} to <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> {{is an important}} issue because it is closely related to social inclusion and social capital, key aspects of societal well-being. There is a large and growing literature on access to health care in an era of dwindling public resources due to recent economic downturns. Health care is an essential service, {{but it is not the}} only <b>basic</b> <b>service.</b> The literature on access to <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> including, but not limited to, health care is relatively small. The paper aims at contributing to the literature by providing a new index to measure and monitor household accessibility to <b>basic</b> <b>services.</b> A study of Italian regions is presented. It is shown that northern regions have more accessible <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> than central, southern and island regions. A longitudinal comparison has been performed. The results are very worrying because show that policy makers have failed in reducing regional (and in particular north–south) disparities in <b>basic</b> <b>service</b> accessibility. Measuring and monitoring the level of accessibility is central for an adequate provision of <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> and for exploring how the delivery of <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> in the most problematic regions can be improved...|$|R

(Development Economics) According {{to section}} 152 (1) of the Republic of South African Constitution Act (No. 108 of 1996), the {{municipalities}} {{are required by}} law to provide <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> in a sustainable manner to their respective communities. However, the municipalities have been facing challenges in carrying out their mandate successfully. One of the major obstacles in this regard has been the increasing rate of urbanisation due to various factors. Service delivery protests by the respective communities continue to be on the rise as well due to insufficient access to the <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> provided by the municipalities. The main aim of this paper was to explore the impact of urbanisation on the delivery of <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> by the municipalities in Gauteng Province. In this study, the four <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> categories namely, access to water, electricity, sewerage and sanitation as well as solid waste management formed {{an integral part of the}} weighted service delivery index and thus the dependent variable. Urbanisation, capital expenditure and operating expenditure were the explanatory variables. The research has demonstrated that urbanisation does have an impact on the level of <b>basic</b> <b>service</b> delivery. Even though the government mobilises resources towards the delivery of <b>basic</b> <b>services,</b> these resources are insufficient to cater for the needs of the population as a whole...|$|R

Efficiency in managing and maintaining urban <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> ultimately dictates the quality of an urban government. In the last three decades, Dhaka‘s urban <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> governance has been tumbling behind the required standard. Specially, in the last five/six years the situation has reached to an alarming state— resulting to {{a high degree of}} inconvenience in urban living and loss of potentials in city economy. Frequent malfunctioning, limited capacity to expand, bureaucratic complexity in availing services, lack of public accountability etc. are some of the common characteristics of urban <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> in Dhaka. There is a general understanding in the concerned sphere that fragmented mode of governing these has attributed the service environment with a complex texture. In fact, fragmentation contributed in terms of multiparty involvement, overlapping of responsibility, obsolete organizational planning, monopoly management etc. Presently, Dhaka‘s urban <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> governance can‘t assure better living, competitive business environment and sustainable economic growth. As a potential remedy, adoption of a general purpose ?metropolitan government? mechanism with prerogatives to plan, develop, maintain service provisions; adequately command the service providers; govern development initiatives; realize taxes and revenues have been in discussion for quite a period within the concerned political and administrative domain. This article discusses the rationale, potentials of a general purpose ?metropolitan government? mechanism to improve Dhaka‘s present state of urban <b>basic</b> <b>services.</b> Additionally, the paper attempted to frame out the structure and operational mechanism of the proposed government.

In contrast, we find no evidence that <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> affect performance on their own. Our results are most relevant for ecosystem accelerators that attract young and early-stage businesses and suggest that entrepreneurial capital matters in new ventures...|$|R

The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to {{critically}} examine the role of restructured intergovernmental transfers in assisting the local government to fulfil its commitment to provide free <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> to the poor. To meet this goal, the role of transfers was analysed by assessing how policies and legislation applicable to free <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> and indigent management influenced the provision of services to the poor in Mogale City, and by dissecting how commodification of services and non-payment of services affected the provision of these services. A comprehensive literature review showed how the transfer practices in South Africa have impacted on the provision of <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> at the municipal level. Findings obtained through in-depth interviews and content analysis demonstrated that transfers, despite the constitutional prescription and official aims to achieve equitability, have failed to boost Mogale City’s capabilities to provide <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> to most of its poor residents. A number of reasons for this are expounded here, but the key conclusion is that transfers are insufficient in helping the local government to provide free <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> to the poor...|$|R

However, the proliferation and diversification of platform <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> and the available providers increase the challenge for the application developers to integrate them and deal with the heterogeneous providers' web APIs. Therefore, a new approach of developing applications should be adopted in which developers leverage multiple platform <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> independently from the target application platforms. To this end, this paper presents a development framework whose objective is to enable the consistent integration of the platform services, and to allow the seamless use of the concrete providers by alleviating the heterogeneities among them...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) - University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. This thesis {{investigates the}} {{challenges}} facing local government in South Africa by developing a means of exploring {{to what extent the}} problems of providing <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> currently experienced by municipalities are influenced by the political, administrative and financial configuration of the decentralized system of governance. It is argued here that the design of the intergovernmental governance system does not promote the constitutional objectives of decentralisation. The current system of governance does not empower local government to become more distinctive and autonomous. The problem in many cases is not what to decentralize or whether a <b>basic</b> <b>service</b> should be provided by national, provincial or local government, but rather how to align shared rule or concurrency of the particular service with the various levels of government. One of the key questions posed in this thesis is to what extent the system of decentralized governance in South Africa enables or hinders municipalities. abilities to provide <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> in an autonomous and sustainable manner. It focuses particularly on their authority to make and implement autonomous political, administrative and financial decisions pertaining to the provision of <b>basic</b> <b>services.</b> While this study cannot conclusively report on the impact of decentralisation on <b>basic</b> <b>service</b> delivery in South Africa, it does identify some of the systemic and structural aspects that impact on the manner or way in which local municipalities provide <b>basic</b> <b>services.</b> It raises concerns that the <b>basic</b> <b>service</b> delivery obligations of local municipalities are strenuous and financially challenging, {{and will continue to be}} as long as local municipalities rely on or are controlled by other spheres of government in meeting their constitutional mandate, especially with regard to the intergovernmental transfers of fiscal resources...|$|R
