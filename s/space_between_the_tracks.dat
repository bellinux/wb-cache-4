50|$|Frankfurt am Main Messe station (Bahnhof Frankfurt am Main Messe) is an S-Bahn {{station in}} Frankfurt am Main, Germany, in the {{district}} of Bockenheim {{in the middle of the}} Frankfurt Trade Fair grounds. The station was opened in 1999 to improve the fair’s public transport connections. It consists of two platform tracks facing a central platform. Constructing the platform was a complex procedure as the <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks</b> had to be enlarged. The road next to the line had to be moved and a bridge had to be rebuilt.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Cypress Hills station, {{opened on}} May 30, 1893, had two tracks and one island platform and was located along Crescent Street, reaching the cemetery. This station was the terminal for the Jamaica Line when it opened. It formerly had an island platform and stub-end located directly along Crescent Street {{just south of}} Jamaica Avenue that can still be seen approaching the cemetery east of the station. The rebuilt station was constructed under the Dual Contracts and was opened on May 28, 1917. The rebuilt station has two tracks and two side platforms. The removal of the island platform resulted in a <b>space</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>tracks.</b> This space would allow for an express third track, but one was never built.

The six Rundbahn motor cars, which, due to their low powered motors, had been used only as summer trailers, were converted to closed vehicles that could be used all year round. Three vehicles became trailers, and the tramcars that had actually been procured as summer trailers were sold to the Städtische Strassenbahn Zürich.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{different}} criteria for detecting unusual motion in surveillance cameras. Initially, a certain environment is observed within a time interval, and cap-tured trajectories {{are used as}} examples of usual trajecto-ries. These trajectories are used to build a Spatial Occu-pancy Map (SpOM, which is introduced in this paper) of the observed people, as well as main flow directions. In the test period, each new trajectory is classified as normal or unusual with respect to spatial occupancy and trajectory consistency. The spatial occupancy criterion considers the relation of <b>space</b> occupancy <b>between</b> <b>the</b> new <b>tracked</b> tra-jectory and <b>the</b> observed period. The trajectory consistency criterion considers the agreement of the new trajectory with the main flows extracted in the training period. Experimen-tal results showed that these criteria {{can be used as}} an au-tomatic pre-screening of suspect motion in surveillance ap-plications. ...|$|R
40|$|Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most flexible geophysical tools that can be effectively and efficiently used in many different applications. In the field of pavement engineering, GPR can cover a wide range of uses, spanning from physical to geometrical inspections of pavements. Traditionally, such inferred information are integrated with mechanical measurements from other traditional (e. g. plate bearing test) or non-destructive (e. g. falling weight deflectometer) techniques, thereby resulting, respectively, in time-consuming and low-significant measurements, or in a high use of technological resources. In this regard, the new challenge of retrieving mechanical properties of road pavements and materials from electromagnetic measurements could represent a further step towards a greater saving of economic resources. As far as concerns unpaved and bound layers it is well-known that strength and deformation properties are mostly affected, respectively, by inter-particle friction and cohesion of soil particles and aggregates, and by bitumen adhesion, whose variability is expressed by the Young modulus of elasticity. In that respect, by assuming a relationship between electromagnetic response (e. g. signal amplitudes) and bulk density of materials, a reasonable correlation between mechanical and electric properties of substructure is therefore expected. In such framework, a pulse GPR system with ground-coupled antennae, 600 MHz and 1600 MHz centre frequencies was used over a 4 -m× 30 -m test site composed by a flexible pavement structure. The horizontal sampling resolution amounted to 2. 4 × 10 - 2 m. A square regular grid mesh of 836 nodes with a 0. 40 -m <b>spacing</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> GPR acquisition <b>tracks</b> was surveyed. Accordingly, a light falling weight deflectometer (LFWD) was used for measuring the elastic modulus of pavement at each node. The setup of such instrument consisted of a 10 -kg falling mass and a 100 -mm loading plate so that the influence domain of the elasticity measure could be comparable to that of the radar signal. Good agreement were found between high Young modulus values and repaved zones, whereas damaged areas were characterized by lower values of E. Tomographic maps of amplitudes along the z axis were extracted up to a depth of z < 200 mm, consistent with the depth domain of the LFWD, and some values on the nodes were randomly selected and thus related to the corresponding elastic modulus both for calibration and validation of <b>the</b> model. Comparison <b>between</b> predicted and measured elastic modulus showed relatively good results. Percentage errors ranging from - 44 % and + 34 % demonstrated an overall underestimate of the model with respect to the real truth. Future research activities could be addressed towards an improvement of the model by calibrating in laboratory environment under controlled conditions, and by using different GPR centre frequencies of investigation.
