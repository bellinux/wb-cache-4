40|$|In {{the current}} practice, to {{determine}} the <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> of a slope with two-dimensional circular potential failure surface, one of the searching methods for the critical slip surface is Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the method to calculate the slope <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> is Fellenius’ slices method. However GA needs to be validated with more numeric tests, while Fellenius’ slices method is just an approximate method like finite element method. This paper proposed a new method {{to determine the}} minimum slope <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> which is the determination of slope <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> with analytical solution and searching critical slip surface with Genetic-Traversal Random Method. The analytical solution is more accurate than Fellenius’ slices method. The Genetic-Traversal Random Method uses random pick to utilize mutation. A computer automatic search program is developed for the Genetic-Traversal Random Method. After comparison with other methods like slope/w software, {{results indicate that the}} Genetic-Traversal Random Search Method can give very low <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> which is about half of the other methods. However the obtained minimum <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> with Genetic-Traversal Random Search Method is very close to the lower bound solutions of slope <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> given by the Ansys software...|$|R

Suction and volumetric water content data from different depths {{over a five-year period}} and mechanical soil properties from laboratory tests have been used to esti- mate <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor.</b> First, a brief description of test site with geotechnical soil properties is reported and in situ data monitoring used for the estimation of <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor</b> are introduced. Then, in order to analyse the effect of the seasonal trend of pore pressure on the <b>Safety</b> <b>factor</b> of the slope, a limit equilibrium analysis is performed by modelling the slope at the test site as an infinite one. In the analysis Bishop’s effective stress approach is used. In particular the <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor</b> over five years is plotted and the effects of matrix suction on the slope stability is examined. Profiles of <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor</b> at fixed days during wet period are also shown to locate the critical sliding surface. Moreover parametric analyses were carried out, in particular the suction values on the sliding surface assumed at 2. 00 meters from the ground surface were calculated varying the slope angle of the monitored infinite slope keeping constant the value of <b>Safety</b> <b>Factor...</b>|$|R

Dr. Bea has also questioned the size of the design safety margins. He said the corps applied a 30%margin over the maximum design load. A doubling of strength would be a more typical margin for highway bridges, dams, off-shore oil platforms and other public structures.

Fourier analysis is reliable technique for mode detection in tokamaks. For this purpose we used a poloidal array of Mirnov coils and hot limiter biasing system. After Fourier analysis of Mirnov coils data in presence of hot biased limiter, Power Spectral Density (PSD) diagram was plotted.

In {{order to}} study the safety {{situation}} in each part of rock mass, the element <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> Fe is introduced to estimate the micro-stability of rock mass; the equation for the element <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> is deduced by the theoretical analysis. Rather than base an engineering design decision on a single calculated <b>factor</b> of <b>safety,</b> an approach which is frequently used to give a more rational assessment of {{the risks associated with}} a particular design is to carry out a sensitivity study. This involves a series of calculations in which each significant parameter is varied systematically over its maximum credible range in order to determine its influence upon the <b>factor</b> of <b>safety.</b> In the present paper, the element <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> Fe is introduced to estimate the micro-stability of rock mass; the equation for the element <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> is deduced by the theoretical analysis, and the influential factors to the element <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> is studied...|$|R

In this manuscript, we formulated five models with numerical example and solved these models using three methods, namely expected value modeling, chance-constrained programming, and an approach using interval approximation of fuzzy number. We have seen that if we introduce a <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> in a transportation problem, the transportation cost for the whole transportation system increases, which was found in these five models. The transportation cost for the second, third, fourth, and fifth models were more than the transportation cost of the first model due to the <b>safety</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|R
