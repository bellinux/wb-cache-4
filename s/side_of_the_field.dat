5|$|Clemson's post-touchdown kickoff was bobbled by kick {{returner}} Andre Kendrick at the Tech one-yard line, but Kendrick {{broke free}} of the Clemson defense for a 34-yard return to the 35-yard line. Tech's first play after the return was an 11-yard run by Lee Suggs up the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> After the first down, Suggs ran straight ahead for a short gain, then Vick scrambled to the Clemson 37-yard line and another first down. Suggs then gained 18 yards on a run to the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> At the Clemson 19-yard line, Suggs was stopped for a loss of one yard, then Vick was sacked for a loss of five yards. The third-down play was an incomplete pass, and Carter Warley entered the game to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick bounced off the field goal crossbar but did not cross it, thus denying the Hokies three points. With 10:33 remaining in the half, Tech still had a 147 lead.|$|E

5|$|Taylor's {{favorite}} passing {{targets were}} wide receiver Danny Coale, who finished the game having caught three passes for 52 yards, and tight end Greg Boone, who caught 3 balls for 41 yards. On the Bearcats' <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> Cincinnati's Mardy Gilyard led all receivers with 7 catches for 158 {{yards and a}} touchdown.

Fellow Cincinnati receiver Dominick Goodman caught 6 passes for 51 yards, in the process becoming Cincinnati's all-time leader in career receiving yards.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{first drive}} began inauspiciously for the Hokies. Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} {{pass on the}} first Tech play, then was sacked for a four-yard loss. Facing third down, Druckenmiller evaded another sack and connected with Oxendine on a 41-yard pass that picked up a first down and pushed Tech into the Nebraska <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> Despite the gain, the Hokies were unable to gain another first down as Oxendine ran for one yard before Druckenmiller threw two successive incomplete passes. Virginia Tech punter Jimmy Kibble kicked the ball back to Nebraska, which returned it to its 15-yard line, and the Nebraska offense returned to the field.|$|E

5|$|After the Virginia Tech kickoff {{and a short}} return, Miami {{began the}} first drive of the game at its 32-yard line. The game's first play was an {{incomplete}} pass from Miami quarterback Jim Kelly. After a one-yard rush, Kelly completed his first pass of the game, an 18-yard toss that drove Miami to the Tech 49-yard line and gave the Hurricanes a first down. Miami then committed a 15-yard penalty, pushing the Hurricanes back into their <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> On the second play after the penalty, Kelly completed a 29-yard pass that gave Miami a first down. The Hurricanes were further aided by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Virginia Tech, giving Miami a first down at the Tech 20-yard line. From there, it took Miami just three plays to score a touchdown, the final play being a 15-yard pass from Kelly to Larry Brodsky. With 12:37 remaining in the quarter, Miami took a 70 lead.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, North Carolina had a {{first down}} at the Tech 34-yard line. Keldorf threw an eight-yard pass to Crumpler, North Carolina, was stopped for a one-yard loss on a running play, then the Tar Heels earned {{a first down}} with a four-yard run by Geter. On first down, Keldorf threw an {{incomplete}} pass. Second down resulted in a 15-yard gain and a first down on a run by Geter along the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> Now at the Tech eight-yard line, Geter ran straight ahead for a five-yard gain. Geter was stopped for a two-yard loss on the next play, but North Carolina recovered from the loss with a five-yard pass from Keldorf to Carrick for a touchdown. The extra point kick was blocked, but a penalty against Virginia Tech allowed Carolina kicker Josh McGee another chance at the extra point. The second attempt was successful, and the kick gave the Tar Heels a 423 lead with 5:01 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|As quarterback, Georgia Tech's Josh Nesbitt {{was the top}} performer. In {{addition}} to his rushing performance, Nesbitt completed 9 of 16 pass attempts for 136 yards and one touchdown. On the opposite <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> Clemson's Kyle Parker was successful on 10 of his 17 pass attempts for 91 yards, but also had two interceptions, the game's only turnovers. Nesbitt set an ACC Championship Game record for longest pass play with his 70-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas in the third quarter. The two teams also set records for total offense: Georgia Tech's 469 total yards and Clemson's 414 total yards each broke the previous record for total offense, as did each team's rushing total break the previous team rushing record.|$|E

5|$|As with Georgia, Virginia Tech's {{kicking and}} special teams proved {{to have more}} success than either aspect of the offense. Virginia Tech kicker Brandon Pace scored a single 28-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, and punter Nic Schmitt blasted four punts {{for a total of}} 195yards, {{averaging}} 48.8yards a punt. Pace's field goal helped to trigger a late-game rally by Virginia Tech, which had been stunned by a Georgia onside kick and several interceptions thrown by Glennon. Schmitt's long punts, meanwhile, denied Georgia good field position {{in the first half of}} the game. Only in the second half, when Glennon's interceptions allowed Georgia to start on the Tech <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> was the Georgia offense able to reach the end zone. In the first and second quarters, Georgia's average starting position was their own 19-yard line and own 26-yard line, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Because Air Force {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech returned the kickoff to its 25-yard line, where the Hokie offense began the first drive {{of the second half}}. The Tech offense used rushes by Lee Suggs and passes by Bryan Randall to pick up several first downs and drive into Air Force territory. But once on the Falcons' <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> Tech proved unable to gain another first down and was even pushed back into its own territory by a penalty. Tech was forced to punt, and Air Force began its first offensive possession of the second half at its 20-yard line after a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Because NC State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech received NC State's kickoff and returned it to the 10-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Tech began working down the field, running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains. Tech picked up three first downs, then reached NC State territory on a pass to Donnelly. Once on the NC State <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> Tech picked up another first down, but Tech's quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away. The ball landed at the NC State 12-yard line where the Wolfpack began a drive.|$|E

5|$|Because Tech {{committed}} a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the touchdown, NC State {{was able to}} acquire good field position during the kickoff return, starting their drive at their 44-yard line. On the second play of the drive, Erik Kramer completed an 18-yard pass to Nasrallah Worthen, driving State into the Tech <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> After a short play, Kramer again completed a long pass, this time to Bobby Crumpler for 24yards. Now inside the Tech red zone, Kramer was tackled for a big loss, losing some of the yardage that he had gained with the previous play. NC State was unable to pick up another first down and sent in Mike Cofer to attempt a 33-yard kick, which was successfully completed. The field goal regained NC State a 2422 lead.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia Tech to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, and the ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo to Swarm. Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush up the middle. Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the ball was intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E

Noel and Jones each carried the ball, together gaining enough for a first down at the Tech 39-yard line. A completed pass and a short run by Jones resulted in another first down, this time at the 50-yard line. Florida State committed a five-yard offsides penalty, but the Hokies were unable to gain a first down on the Seminoles' <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> Rather than attempt to convert another fourth down, the Hokies punted the ball.|$|E
