40|$|AbstractProteasome pathway regulates TGF-β signaling; {{degradation}} of activated Smad 2 / 3 and receptors turns TGF-β signal off, while {{degradation of}} negative modulators such as <b>Ski</b> <b>and</b> SnoN maintains the signal. We {{have found that}} anisomycin is able to downregulate <b>Ski</b> <b>and</b> SnoN via proteasome as TGF-β does, but through a mechanism independent of Smad activation. The mechanism used by anisomycin to downregulate <b>Ski</b> <b>and</b> SnoN is also independent of MAPK activation and protein synthesis inhibition. TGF-β signal was the only pathway described causing <b>Ski</b> <b>and</b> SnoN degradation, thus this new effect of anisomycin on endogenous <b>Ski</b> <b>and</b> SnoN proteins suggests alternative processes to downregulate these negative modulators of TGF-β signaling...|$|R
