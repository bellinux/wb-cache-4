60|$|Mary's brother, the EARL OF MURRAY, {{and head}} of the Protestant party in Scotland, had opposed this marriage, partly on {{religious}} grounds, and partly perhaps from personal dislike of the very contemptible bridegroom. When it had taken place, through Mary's gaining over to it the more powerful of the lords about her, she banished Murray for his pains; and, when he and some other nobles rose in arms to support the reformed religion, she herself, within a month of her wedding day, rode against them in armour with loaded pistols in her <b>saddle.</b> <b>Driven</b> out of Scotland, they presented themselves before Elizabeth--who called them traitors in public, and assisted them in private, according to her crafty nature.|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{process through}} a marginal state (<b>saddle</b> point) <b>driven</b> by colored noise is studied. For small correlation {{time of the}} noise, the mean first-passage time and its variance are calculated using standard methods. When the correlation time of the noise is finite or large, an alternative approach, based on simple physical arguments, is proposed. It {{will allow us to}} study also the passage times of an unstable state. The theoretical predictions are tested satisfactorily by the use of computer simulations.

50|$|The {{upper reach}} {{may be defined}} as {{that portion of the}} {{watershed}} above Montecito Boulevard, most of which is in the unincorporated area of Sonoma County. In these reaches the creek has little modification, save for residential development along Anderson Drive which encroaches into the riparian area. Thus there are no flood control channel improvements, other than the Middle Fork Brush Creek reservoir constructed near <b>Saddle</b> Creek <b>Drive.</b> Above Badger Road there is a dam across Brush Creek, forming this small reservoir. Headwaters of Brush Creek flow into the reservoir from two forks. There is virtually no public access to the creek or reservoir in the upper reach. There is less cattail vegetation and more mature Garry oaks and Valley oaks in this reach. Above Baird the landscape turns into chiefly agricultural grazing land in the lower foothills of the Mayacmas western slopes.|$|R
5000|$|Roberts built a {{range of}} machine tools, some to his own design, the first being a gear-cutting machine. For {{accurately}} checking {{the dimensions of the}} gears he adapted the sector, which he developed for sale to other engineers. [...] Roberts adopted rotary cutters, which he had seen used at Maudslays. This is one of the earliest records of a milling cutter used in engineering. In 1816 he made the first reliable wet gas meter. In 1817 he made a lathe able to turn work 6 ft. This had a back gear to give an increased range of speeds, and a sliding saddle to move the tool along the work. The <b>saddle</b> was <b>driven</b> by a screw through gearing which could be disengaged when the end of the cut was reached. Also in 1817 he built a planing machine to allow the machining of flat surfaces. Previous to this flat surfaces were laboriously made by hand with the fitter using hammers and chisels, files and scrapers to get a true surface.|$|R

40|$|The linear {{stability}} {{properties of}} Alfven modes are studied on JET using an active excitation technique. The <b>Saddle</b> Coils <b>drive</b> low amplitude, vertical bar #delta#B/B vertical bar #approx# 10 "-" 6, stable plasma modes with toroidal mode number n= 0 / 2. The diagnostic technique uses repetitive sweeps {{of the driving}} frequency in a pre-defined range, controlled in real-time. The plasma response is extracted from background noise using synchronous detection, and is used to identify in real-time the resonance corresponding to a global mode. When a resonance is found, the real-time controller locks to that frequency and tracks the mode. This provides a direct evaluation of the mode damping rate, #gamma#/#omega# from {{the width of the}} frequency sweep. Two systems are used to measure fast fluctuation data. The KC 1 F system is a 8 -channel, 1 MHz/ 4 s continuous digitizer used to analyze magnetic and reflectometry data in the frequency range 5 #<=#f(kHz) #<=# 500. This system is particularly suitable to follow the time evolution of the instability. The CATS system collects and digitizes a large number of channels generally using short time snapshots. This system is useful to determine the position of the instability using the cross-correlation between the magnetic and other radially localized measurements, such as soft X-rays, reflectometry or electron cyclotron emissionIncludes bibliographical referencesAvailable from British Library Document Supply Centre- DSC: 3829. 715695 ((01) 34) / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreSIGLEGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
60|$|The {{operations}} of the siege were in a great measure suspended while the men were obtaining a new supply of stones, and the whole disposable force of the army was employed in {{going back and forth}} to bring them. At length an immense quantity were collected; but then the Mongul general changed his plan. Instead of throwing the stones from his engines toward the fortress on the island, which it had been proved was beyond his reach, he determined to build out a jetty into the river toward it, so as to get a stand-point for his engines nearer the walls, where they could have some chance of doing execution. So he set his men at work to prepare fascines, and bundles, and rafts of timber, which were to be loaded with the stones and sunk in the river to form the foundation for the proposed bank. The men would bring the stones down to the bank in their hands, and then horsemen, who were ready on the brink, would take them, and, resting them on the <b>saddle,</b> would <b>drive</b> their horses in until they came near the place where the stones were to go, when they would throw them down and then return for others. In this way they could work upon the jetty in many parts at once, some being employed in building at the end where it abutted on the shore, while the horsemen were laying the foundations at the same time {{out in the middle of}} the stream. The work of the horsemen was very difficult and dangerous, on account of holes in the sandy bottom of the river, into which they were continually sinking. Besides this, the garrison on the walls were doing their utmost all the time to impede the work by shooting arrows, javelins, stones, and fiery darts among the workmen, by which means vast numbers, both of men and horses, were killed.|$|R
40|$|After {{many years}} of {{successful}} operation, the JET saddle coil system was dismantled during the 2004 - 2005 shutdown. A new antenna system was installed to replace it and excite MHD modes in the Alfvén frequency range [1]. Due to their geometry, the <b>saddle</b> coils could <b>drive</b> only low toroidal mode numbers, |n|= 0 - 2. Conversely, the Alfvén Eigenmodes (AEs) that can be driven unstable in JET (and ITER: [2]) by fusion generated alphas or other fast particles have toroidal mode numbers in the range n~ 5 - 20. This, and {{because most of the}} previous JET measurements were obtained in plasmas with low edge magnetic shear, makes it difficult to extrapolate the low-n results to ITER. These reasons prompted the design of a new system of compact antennas for excitation and measurements of high-n modes. In this paper we review the antenna design principles and present the first measurements of the frequency and damping rate for n~ 1 - 20 TAEs obtained with this new antenna system. These data have been obtained not only in limited plasmas, but also in ITER-relevant X-point plasma configurations with high edge magnetic shear and moderate heating power.

6000|$|Every {{generation}} has its memories. The first memories of Mr. Nicholas B. {{might have been}} shaped {{by the events of}} the last partition of Poland, and he lived long enough to suffer from the last armed rising in 1863, an event which affected the future of all my generation and has coloured my earliest impressions. His brother, in whose house he had sheltered for some seventeen years his misanthropical timidity before the commonest problems of life, having died in the early fifties, Mr. Nicholas B. had to screw his courage up to the sticking-point and come to some decision as to the future. After a long and agonising hesitation he was persuaded at last to become the tenant of some fifteen hundred acres out of the estate of a friend in the neighbourhood. The terms of the lease were very advantageous, but the retired situation of the village and a plain comfortable house in good repair were, I fancy, the greatest inducements. He lived there quietly for about ten years, seeing very few people and taking no part in the public life of the province, such as it could be under an arbitrary bureaucratic tyranny.
