40|$|<b>Soil</b> {{phosphorus}} (P) <b>tests</b> {{are used}} for P fertilization recommendations, environmental evaluations, and occasionally for legislation purposes. The basis of fertilization recommendation as function of soil P status {{was established in the}} 1950 s- 1960 s. Since then the agroeconomic environment has altered: Environmental protection became increasingly important and P rock resources for fertilizers appeared exhaustible. Also, new insights in <b>soil</b> <b>testing</b> and fertilization recommendations reflecting more efficient use of P became available. However, these new insights seem hard to implement into agricultural practice, to a large extent because replacing existing <b>soil</b> <b>tests</b> and recommendations would imply a very significant effort with respect to introducing new tests and recommendations by fertilization trials in practice. The same would apply for environmental evaluations. Here, a novel, three-step schedule for introducing new <b>soil</b> <b>tests</b> is proposed: (1) establishing new promising <b>soil</b> <b>tests,</b> (2) creating regression models between the old and new <b>soil</b> <b>tests,</b> and (3) implementing the new <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> stepwise by fertilization trials. In this way, the knowledge based on the old <b>soil</b> <b>tests</b> can be used until the new <b>soil</b> <b>tests</b> and their subsequent crop responses are validated sufficiently. As a novel P test we considered combining soil P intensity [as reflected by P-calcium chloride (CaCl 2) ] with P capacity [as reflected by P-ammonium lactate (Al) ] and P-buffering capacity (as reflected by P-Al/P-CaCl 2 ratio) characteristics. Researchers tested whether this novel <b>soil</b> <b>test</b> can predict P water (Pw), P-calcium lactate / acetate (CAL), and P-Olsen values. To test the hypothesis, four datasets were used (two with Pw, one with P-CAL, and one with P-Olsen). In all datasets additional soil characteristics were available including soil type. Regression models with R-adj (2) from 0. 80 to 0. 93 were obtained by using P-Al, P-CaCl 2, and soil type. It can be concluded that these regressions {{can be used as a}} helpful intermediate instrument when introducing fertilization recommendations based on new <b>soil</b> <b>tests.</b> Predicting one <b>soil</b> P <b>test</b> out of other soil characteristics, analogous to the predicted Pw, P-CAL, and P-Olsen, could also be helpful in comparing P statuses of agricultural land in different nations...|$|R

40|$|Expansive clayey soils produce heaving and {{cracking}} of floor slabs and walls. Expansive soils owe their characteristics {{to the presence}} of swelling clay minerals. This soil expands and contracts due to changes in the moisture content of the soil. In this study the surcharge required to counteract soil expansion was measured in natural expansive soils (untreated soils) and lime treated soils starting at 19. 61  kPa (2  Ton/m 2) and continuing with increments of 19. 61  kPa. Additionaly in lime treated soils the amount of lime was determined under different surcharges {{in order to reduce the}} expansion. The test results indicated that the surcharges applied to untreated soils were not proportional to the decrease of expansion which is probably due to the increase of soil density. In fact, only the initial surcharge of 19. 61  kPa significantly decreased the expansion. According to the results, the soil expansion was considerably reduced (1. 54 %) with the surcharge of 78. 45  kPa, therefore this surcharge can be considered as the Swelling pressure. On the other hand the <b>soil</b> <b>tested</b> (high compressibility clay) was stabilized with 6 % of lime (without surcharges) which was determined with the lowest value of liquid limit and plastic index as well as expansion test. After the application of surcharges and lime treatment to expansive soil, the surcharges of 39. 22  kPa and 58. 84  kPa decreased expansion and increased their resistance. This was concluded by similar low values of expansion (without settlements) under both surcharges of each treated <b>soil</b> <b>tested</b> (2, 4 and 6 % of lime). It can be concluded that the surcharge contributed to the decrease of soil expansion due to the decrease of the amount of lime required (6 %) without surcharge. So, 4 % of lime was enough for the surcharge of 19. 61  kPa and 2 % of lime required the surcharge minimum of 39. 22  kPa.
