5|$|Front-end loaders are {{commonly}} used to remove snow especially from sidewalks, parking lots, and other areas too small for using snowplows and other heavy equipment. They are sometimes used as snowplows with a <b>snowplow</b> attachment but commonly have a bucket or snowbasket, which {{can also be used}} to load snow into the rear compartment of a <b>snowplow</b> or dump truck. Front end loaders with large box-like front end attachment are used to clear snow in parking lots in malls and other institutions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a <b>snowplow</b> attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a <b>snowplow</b> or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, the plow blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} {{increase}} in paved roads and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city of Milwaukee began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with snowplows. The horse-drawn <b>snowplow</b> quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.|$|E

5|$|Slalom is a single-player game {{in which}} players race {{downhill}} {{in a series of}} slalom races. There are 24downhill runs total that are evenly spread across three mountains. Before the game starts, players choose their mountain based on difficulty: Snowy Hill for beginners, Steep Peak for intermediate players, and Mount Nasty for experts. The goal for each run is to reach the finish line within the allotted time. Players must dodge obstacles including trees, flags, snowmen, sledders, and other skiers on their way downhill, or else they will tumble and lose time. With enough momentum, players can jump over these obstacles. Players must ski around flags to maintain their speed. If they ski {{on the wrong side of}} the flag, the racer will <b>snowplow</b> and slow down.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots first {{played the}} Miami Dolphins in 1966 in the AFL, when Miami {{was one of}} two {{expansion}} teams to debut that year in that league. The Dolphins dominated the Patriots in the 1970s and 1990s, but the two teams remained competitive with each other for years before the rise of Tom Brady. Brady, however, struggled occasionally against the Dolphins in the 2000s before reasserting dominance in the 2010s. The Patriots and Dolphins are the only two teams in the Super Bowl era to post undefeated regular season records, with Miami going 14-0 in 1972 and the Patriots going 16-0 in 2007. Notable moments between the clubs include the <b>Snowplow</b> Game, three playoff matchups, and the Dolphins revealing their Wildcat offense against the Patriots.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the Bergen Line, the Gjøvik Line and the Roa–Hønefoss Line, was {{electrified}} in February 1961. This allowed diesel and electric locomotives to haul all trains from Oslo to Bergen. In 1962 the Nordland Line was completed to Bodø, but the increased need for locomotives was more than compensated by the electrification of the Bergen Line being extended to Ål. The first Di 3 ran on the Røros Line in 1964, {{that had previously been}} denied due to bridges with insufficient axle load permits. In 1965, the Bergen Line was electrified, and all but one Di 3 was transferred to Trondheim. A single unit, usually no. 610, was stationed at Finse Station as a <b>snowplow.</b> Along with additional deliveries, there were sufficient Di 3 units to terminate most steam operations.|$|E

5|$|The first {{services}} {{started on}} 1 July 1907 from Voss to Myrdal. An official opening train attempted to cross {{part of the}} line to Gulsvik on 9 December 1907, but got stuck in heavy snow and had to return. It {{turned out that the}} railway had to close and it took one and a half months to clear it for snow. Even a rotary <b>snowplow</b> at 750kW was not powerful enough {{to get rid of the}} snow. A new attempt to open the line in 1908 succeeded, and a train went from Gulsvik to Bergen. The line from Roa to Gulsvik was still under construction, so passage was along the Drammen Line via the Krøder Line with ship over Krøderen to Gulsvik. The first scheduled train from Oslo West Station en route to Bergen departed 10 June 1908.|$|E
5|$|The Exeter Township snow emergency, {{which was}} {{declared}} on the 14th, was extended through 4 PM on the 15th.

Across the Lehigh Valley: In Lehigh County, The city of Allentown declared a snow emergency early on the 14th, which was then lifted at 8 PM on the 14th. The weight of snow and ice, on the 14th, brought down the dome over the swimming pool at the West End Racquet and Fitness Club in South Whitehall Township. The dome itself was destroyed. Also, the Brookside Country Club in Wescosville also reported dome damage {{as a result of}} the snow and ice. In Northampton County, an 83-year-old woman was found dead on the rear porch of her home from hypothermia. Also in Bethlehem, a pedestrian was hospitalized after a private <b>snowplow</b> operator backed over him while clearing the Sheetz gas station parking lot at 3201 Schoenersville Road on the 14th. County Emergency Dispatch officials reported about a dozen or so minor vehicle accidents due to the slippery conditions.

40|$|Sweden {{experiences}} heavy snowfall {{during the}} winter season and cost effective road maintenance is significantly affected by the routing of <b>snowplows.</b> The routing problem becomes more complex as the SwedishNational Road Administration (Vägverket) sets operational requirements such as satisfying a time window for each road segment. This thesis focuses on route optimization for <b>snowplows</b> after snowfall; {{to develop and implement}} an algorithm for finding combinations of generated routes which minimize the total cost. The results are compared to those stated in the licentiate thesis by Doctoral student Nima Golbaharan (2001). The algorithm calculates a lower bound to the problem using a Lagrangian master problem. A common subgradient approach is used to find near-optimal dual variables to be sent to a column-generation program which returns routes for the <b>snowplows.</b> A greedy heuristic chooses a feasible solution, which gives an upper bound to the problem. This entire process is repeated as needed. This method for routing <b>snowplows</b> produces favorable results with {{a relatively small number of}} routes and are comparable to Golbaharan's results. An interesting observation involves the allocation of vehicles in which certain depots were regularly over- or under-utilized. This suggests that the quantity and/or distribution of available vehicles may not be optimal...|$|R

25|$|On 1 February 2004 an inbound train derailed at Makrellbekken {{after it}} struck a tractor with a <b>snowplow.</b> The {{cause of the}} {{accident}} was a wind gust blowing snow against the tractor, disorienting the driver and causing him to drive {{too close to the}} platform edge with the shovel sticking out just as the train arrived. The only injury, to the train driver, was minor.

While it is not needed as the tourist season is only in the summer months, it is a spectacle in operation, and the White Pass runs the steam plow for railfan groups once or twice a winter, pushed by two diesel locomotives (in 2000 only, it was pushed by two steam locomotives, Nos.73 and 40).|$|E
25|$|With the {{delivery}} of the Class SS starting 1914, the older Class S trains became less popular due to their limit size and comfort. However, they were still technically suited for service. Nos. 48, 49 and 66 were converted to trailers in 1916, being renumbered 247–249. By 1918 the class was removed from regular service. That year no. 57 collided and KSS decided to rebuild it. The body was removed and the undercarriage and motors were used to construct a <b>snowplow</b> unit. The plow itself {{came out on the}} side and could be maneuvered from within.
