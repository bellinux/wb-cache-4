40|$|This paper proposes the {{integration}} of the resolution rule for Max-SAT with unsatisfiability-based Max-SAT solvers. First, we show that the resolution rule for Max-SAT can be safely applied as dictated by the resolution proof associated with an unsatisfiable core when such proof is read-once, that is, each clause is used at most once in the resolution process. Second, we study how this property can be integrated in an unsatisfiability-based solver. In particular, the resolution rule for Max-SAT is applied to read-once proofs or to read-once <b>subparts</b> of <b>a</b> <b>general</b> proof. Finally, we perform an empirical investigation on structured instances from recent Max-SAT evaluations. Preliminary results show that the use of read-once resolution substantially improves the performance of the solver. ...|$|R
40|$|U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has {{monitored}} groundwater on the Hanford Site {{since the}} 1940 s {{to help determine}} what chemical and radiological contaminants have {{made their way into}} the groundwater. As regulatory requirements for monitoring increased in the 1980 s, there began to be some overlap between various programs. DOE established the Groundwater Performance Assessment Project (groundwater project) in 1996 to ensure protection of the public and the environment while improving the efficiency of monitoring activities. The groundwater project is designed to support all groundwater monitoring needs at the site, eliminate redundant sampling and analysis, and establish a cost-effective hierarchy for groundwater monitoring activities. This document provides the quality assurance guidelines that will be followed by the groundwater project. This QA Plan is based on the QA requirements of DOE Order 414. 1 C, Quality Assurance, and 10 CFR 830, <b>Subpart</b> <b>A</b> [...] <b>General</b> Provisions/Quality Assurance Requirements as delineated in Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s Standards-Based Management System. In addition, the groundwater project is subject to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans (EPA/ 240 /B- 01 / 003, QA/R- 5). The groundwater project has determined that the Hanford Analytical Services Quality Assurance Requirements Documents (HASQARD, DOE/RL- 96 - 68) apply to portions of this project and to the subcontractors.

40|$|Shallow-water lagoons, {{which are}} common {{features}} along coastlines, are important sites for elemental cycling in this environmentally-sensitive terrestrialemarine interface. Factors governing mercury (Hg) cycling in these lagoons are poorly characterized, but critical {{to understanding the}} links between sources and higher trophic levels, that are ultimately vectors of human exposure in lagoon environments. This article discusses the processes controlling the fate of Hg from various sources, including methylation of Hg, demethylation of methylmercury, and benthic fluxes of Hg species {{in three of the}} most thoroughly studied lagoons worldwide, namely Thau (France), Venice (Italy) and Marano and Grado (Italy). Although each lagoon system experiences differences in sources of Hg and details of how Hg is transformed and transported, Hg in each system is strongly affected by biogeochemical transformations of other elements, especially redox sensitive, microbially important elements such as sulphur, iron and manganese, and their interaction with organic matter. The shallow nature of lagoons and the rapid rates of microbially mediated organic matter decomposition result in seasonally dynamic processes that influence Hg bioavailability. Despite considerable work to date, the current understanding of Hg dynamics in lagoon ecosystems, through Hg distribution, MeHg production and degradation, and trophic transfer, is still limited and {{more research is needed to}} link all <b>subparts</b> into <b>a</b> <b>general</b> coherent picture...|$|R

This refines the partition given by Cooper (2006) [10], which required an additional non-interval exceptional class. We also introduce a distance between permutations that plays an important rôle in the study of convergence of a permutation sequence...|$|R

Under certain conditions a given AF A can be split into <b>subparts</b> <b>A</b> 1 and A 2 such that extensions of A can be computed by (1) computing an extension E 1 of A 1, (2) modifying A 2 based on E 1, and (3) combining E 1 and an extension E 2 of the modified variant of A 2.
