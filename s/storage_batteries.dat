Introduction: The first {{storage cell}} {{was invented in}} 1801 by M. Gautherot but not until 1881 was it used to any extent. There is record of the {{application}} of a <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> in England in that year. The first battery installed in this country was at a central station in Phillipsburg, Pa., in 1885 while 1889 marks the beginning of the general application of the <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> in the commercial world. The <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> or accumulator consists of two inert plates of metal or some oxide of metal placed in an electrotype which is incapable of acting upon than chemically, until by the action of an electric current passed through the cell, the nature of the material on the plates is changed...|$|R
5|$|Photovoltaic (PV) arrays powered Mir. The station used a 28volt DC supply which {{provided}} 5-, 10-, 20- and 50-amp taps. When {{the station was}} illuminated by sunlight, several solar arrays mounted on the pressurised modules provided power to Mirs systems and charged the nickel-cadmium <b>storage</b> <b>batteries</b> installed throughout the station. The arrays rotated in only one degree of freedom over a 180° arc, and tracked the sun using sun sensors and motors installed in the array mounts. The station itself also had to be oriented to ensure optimum illumination of the arrays. When the station's all-sky sensor detected that Mir had entered Earth's shadow, the arrays were rotated to the optimum angle predicted for reacquiring the sun once the station passed out of the shadow. The batteries, each of 60Ah capacity, were then used to power the station until the arrays recovered their maximum output on the day side of Earth.|$|E

This is because, in most telecommunication application, <b>storage</b> <b>batteries</b> are already in use and the electrical system is basically DC. In hilly and mountainous terrain, radio and TV signals may not reach as they get blocked or reflected back due to undulating terrain. At these locations, low power transmitters (LPT) are installed to receive and retransmit the signal for local population.|$|E

2500|$|Vapour-compression {{distillers}} {{were installed}} on US submarines shortly before World War 2. Early attempts {{had been made}} with evaporators running from diesel engine exhaust heat, but these could only be used when the submarine was running at speed on the surface. A further difficulty with submarines was the need to produce high-quality water for topping up their large <b>storage</b> <b>batteries.</b> Typical consumption on a war patrol was around [...] per day for hotel services, drinking, cooking, washing etc. and also for replenishing the diesel engine cooling system. A further 500gallons per week was required for the batteries. The standard Badger model X-1 for diesel submarines could produce 1,000gallons per day. Tank capacity of 5,600gallons (1,200 of which was battery water) was provided, around 10 days reserve. With the appearance of nuclear submarines and their plentiful electricity supply, even larger plant could be installed. The X-1 plant was designed {{so that it could}} be operated when snorkelling, or even when completely submerged. As the ambient pressure increased when submerged, and thus the boiling point, additional heat was required in these submarine distillers and so they were designed to run with electric heat continuously.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Lead is {{a highly}} toxic heavy metal. The {{investigation}} was conducted to remove Pb(II) from <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> industry wastewater by using electrodialysis (ED) in laboratory. The <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> industry wastewater has an initial Pb(II) concentration of 8. 5 mg/L. The performance of ED is determined {{by a set of}} fixed and variable process parameters such as inlet concentration, operating current density, and operating flow rate. Like all the efficient ED operations, the process has to be optimized in terms of overall costs considering cell component designs and properties as well as all operating parameters. Under the conditions of operating current density at 3 A/cm 2, liquid flow rate of 300 L/h and circulation time of 5 ~ 6, the Pb(II) concentration of <b>storage</b> <b>battery</b> industrial outlet wastewater can be reduced to below 0. 01 mg/L and the conductivity could be reduced below 10 µs/cm.
