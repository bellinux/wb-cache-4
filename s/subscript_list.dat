A comment may appear anywhere in a program where a space is permitted and is preceded by the characters forward slash, asterisk and is terminated by the characters asterisk, forward slash (i.e. [...] ). Statements may have a label-prefix introducing an entry name ( [...] and [...] statements) or label name, and a condition prefix enabling or disabling a computational condition e.g. [...] ).

40|$|This paper {{concerns}} parallel, local computations with a {{data structure}} such a graph or mesh, {{which may be}} structured or unstructured. The target machine is a distributed-memory parallel processor with vector or pipeline hardware on the processors, but software based on voxel databases also runs efficiently on shared-memory and uniprocessor machines with and without vector hardware. A voxel database (VDB) is a distributed shared memory, where entities which share memory are those at the same geometric position. A VDB may {{be thought of as}} a dictionary of position-subscript pairs, so that data may be associated with points in space by using the subscript of that point as an index into data arrays. The use of subscripts allows ease of programming and vectorization. The shared memory at each point is weakly coherent and may be either single-writer, multiple reader, also known as the ghost node method; or multiple-combiner, multiple-reader memory. The VDB may be sorted to put special points at the beginning or end of the <b>subscript</b> <b>list,</b> and also to reduce cache-miss inefficiencies. Support is also provided for arbitrary distribution of data entities between processors for load-balancing. The idea of VDBs and the corresponding software tool provide a clear and efficient way to program a large variety of mesh computations in Fortran or C, such that the execution of the program is independent of the distribution of data to processors, and the mesh may be topologically adapted and load balanced.

40|$|Mata is Stata's matrix language. In the Mata Matters column, we {{show how}} Mata {{can be used}} interactively to solve {{problems}} and as a programming language to add new features to Stata. Subscripting {{is the subject of}} this column. Stata has three subscripting modes, and two of them are about more than accessing an element of a vector or matrix. The advanced forms of subscripting can, by themselves, be the solution to some problems.

For example, using Integer, the {{factorial}} code above easily computes factorial 100000 {{as a number of}} 456,574 digits, with no loss of precision.|$|R
50|$|Many other {{compatibility}} characters constitute what Unicode considers {{rich text}} and therefore outside {{the goals of}} Unicode and UCS. In some sense even compatibility characters discussed {{in the previous section}} — those that aid legacy software in displaying ligatures and vertical text — constitute a form of rich text, since the rich text protocols determine whether text is displayed in one way or another. However, the choice to display text with or without ligatures or vertically versus horizontally are both non-semantic rich text. They are simply style differences. This is contrast to other rich text such as italics, superscripts and <b>subscripts,</b> or <b>list</b> markers where the styling of the rich text implies certain semantics along with it.|$|R
50|$|The consonants {{and their}} <b>subscript</b> forms are <b>listed</b> in the {{following}} table. Usual phonetic values are given using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA); variations are described below the table. The sound system is described in detail at Khmer phonology. The spoken name of each consonant letter is its value together with its inherent vowel. Transliterations are given using the UNGEGN system; for other systems see Romanization of Khmer.|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} with a monotonically incremental loading scheme for all connection models imitating experimental loading procedure. The connection models are analyzed in three loading steps. In the first step, a prescribed force, 40  % of minimum tensile strength of bolt, {{is applied to the}} pretension node of a predefined section of the bolt shank. As a result, the length of bolt shank at the pretension section changes by the amount necessary to carry the prescribed load. In the second step, the prescribed bolt load is replaced by changing the length of pretension section back to the initial length. Bolt pretension force of all models (excluding A 1 Po, FE 5 and FE 6) is prescribed as 40  % of the ultimate strength of bolt. For connection models A 1 Po, FE 5 and FE 6, corresponding values are 0, 20 and 60  % of the ultimate strength of bolt, respectively. Thus, A 1 Po connection model designated with <b>subscript</b> ‘Po’ as <b>listed</b> in Table  2 is analyzed considering zero pretension force of bolts. In the third step, bending moment is introduced to the beam-to-column connection by employing vertical displacement of the middle section of plane Z–X of the stub column (Fig.  3). Automatic load increment scheme is preferred because ABAQUS can select the precise incremental rate to attain the optimum computational efficiency.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to write and make available a small set of PL/ 1 computer subroutines {{that can be used}} in other computer programs attempting to do any kind of analysis of natural language data. The subroutines present in the dissertation are for some of the housekeeping, that is the jobs that must be done before analysis can begin. Four subroutines were written and tested: a subroutine called FINDONE (find one) that isolateswords in an input string of characters, and three subroutines, called the LAGADOs, that find words or word parts on lists of words or word parts. The reliability of the subroutines was tested in small testing programs and in a larger lexical diversity program that was modified to use the subroutines. FINDONE finds graphemic words and punctuation marks in an input character string. In addition, it truncates the input string from the left so that repeated calls of the subroutine finds the words in the input string in sequence. FINDONE takes as parameters the name of the input string and a name to be associated with the word found. The three LAGADO functions search for words on lists of words. Each of the functions is designed to search a list of a certain structure. LAGADO 1 searches an alphabetized list where to length of the list is known. It uses the economical binary search technique. LAGADO 1 takes as parameters the name of the word searched for, the name of the list to be searched and the length of the list to be searched. LAGADO 2 searches a list in any order that is alphabetically indexed by an indexing array. LAGADO 2 takes as parameters the name of the word being searched for, the name of the list being searched, the name of the indexing array, and the length of the list being searched. LAGAD 03 searches any list that has an end-of-list symbol. LAGADO 3 uses a linear search technique and looks at each element of the list being searched in order until it either finds the word being searched for or the final boundary symbols. LAGADO 3 takes as parameters the name of the word searced for, the name of the list being searched, and the name of the end-of-list symbol. Each of the LAGADO functions returns a positive value equal to the <b>subscript</b> of the <b>list</b> element that matches the input word if the input word is matched, or a negative number whose absolute value is the subscript of the location of the cell where the input word would have to be inserted into the list if the input word is not matched. Two of the subroutines, FINDONE and LAGADO 2, were tested by being incorporated into SUPRFRQ, a lexical diversity program developed from an earlier program written by Robert Wachal. An Appendix includes the documented texts of he subroutines and of the lexical diversity program. In addition, the appendix includes the result of a run of SUPRFQ on for short dialect texts collected, by Charles Houck in Leeds, England. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
