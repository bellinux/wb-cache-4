In this paper, we propose a method to perform spectrum sensing at the aerial eNodeB for the secondary LTE network in order to detect the incumbent user equipments on ground to avoid interfering with them. A novel approach is presented to perform this task considering the 3 GPP-LTE uplink transmission specifications.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{repeated}} Geodimeter surveys in the Matsushiro area since October, 1965. Their purpose {{is the study}} of accumulation of horizontal strains there at various stages of the seismic activity. The present paper will deal mainly with the strain events observed from March of this year, since the data for the earlier period was reported in the previous paper. Generally speaking, the mode of strain accumulation in the present period does not differ much from that previously observed. That is to say, extension predominated in the NS-direction whereas a considerable amount of contraction was observed in the EW-direction. As for the amount of strain accumulation, however, the present period shows an activity much higher than the previous one. Length of the Sorobeku base-line, for example, increased as much as 35 cm during the period March to July inclusive, and another 43 cm during the following two months. So that the total extension of this baseline after October, 1965, reached 89 cm indicating the average linear strain to be 290 × 10 - 6. Strain data thus obtained for the three independent base-lines enable us to study the horizontal deformations as a plane-strain problem. Computed principal axes harmonize very well with the seismic force system there. Strain energy associated with the deformations is roughly estimated to be comparable with the energy released by the seismic activity. It {{is hard to believe that}} the earth's crust is deformed elastically to such a high strain rate as above-mentioned. We must naturally take non-elastic deformation into consideration for understanding the present event. A fracture zone that has developed remarkably since last spring is notable from this point of view. According to geologists'reports, the systematically arranged fractures seem to suggest a buried fault of strike-slip type that crosses the Sorobeku base-line obliquely. Actual conditions and characteristics of the presumed fault should be urgently studied by taking all the available data into consideration. The authors constructed <b>supplementary</b> <b>networks</b> in the Wakaho and Nakano areas in order to watch strain accumulation in localities adjacent to the present seismic area.

As the demand for data continues to rise and new Internet protocols and technologies are invented to meet these growing needs, the role of interdisciplinary research in creating holistic analytical and experimental frameworks is becoming ever more important. My own research interests in this area arises partly from my doctoral research [9] done in collaboration between the Electrical engineering school and the Wharton School of business of the University of Pennsylvania, followed by my postdoctoral research in Electrical engineering at Princeton University during which I focused on transforming many of these theoretical ideas into experimental testbeds.

40|$|To {{alleviate}} the congestion caused by {{rapid growth in}} demand for mobile data, wireless service providers (WSPs) have begun encouraging users to offload some of their traffic onto <b>supplementary</b> <b>network</b> technologies, e. g., offloading from 3 G or 4 G to WiFi or femtocells. With {{the growing popularity of}} such offerings, {{a deeper understanding of the}} underlying economic principles and their impact on technology adoption is necessary. To this end, we develop a model for user adoption of a base technology (e. g., 3 G) and a bundle of the base plus a supplementary technology (e. g., 3 G + WiFi). Users individually make their adoption decisions based on several factors, including the technologies' intrinsic qualities, negative congestion externalities from other subscribers, and the flat access rates that a WSP charges. We then show how these user-level decisions translate into aggregate adoption dynamics and prove that these converge to a unique equilibrium for a given set of exogenously determined system parameters. We fully characterize these equilibria and study adoption behaviors of interest to a WSP. We then derive analytical expressions for the revenue-maximizing prices and optimal coverage factor for the supplementary technology and examine some resulting non-intuitive user adoption behaviors. Finally, we develop a mobile app to collect empirical 3 G/WiFi usage data and numerically investigate the profit-maximizing adoption levels when a WSP accounts for its cost of deploying the supplemental technology and savings from offloading traffic onto this technology...|$|E

RESULTS: We examine RNA-seq co-expression data generated from 1, 970 RNA-seq samples using a guilt-by-association framework, in which genes are assessed for the tendency of co-expression to reflect shared function. Minimal experimental criteria to obtain performance on par with microarrays were > 20 samples with read depth > 10 M per sample. While the aggregate network constructed shows good performance (AUROC~ 0. 71), the dependency on number of experiments used is nearly identical to that present in microarrays, suggesting thousands of samples to obtain 'gold-standard' co-expression.

40|$|The European Union evolved an {{overlapping}} Trans-European network on {{the basis}} of the transport network of its 12 (15) countries in the late 1980 s, next, in 1992, it was fixed (TEN) in the transport policy and Basic Treaty of the Union. Since that time the entire network has been pushed into the background in the documentations, and there is mostly talk about the building of 14 projects (1996), and 30 (2004) projects after the expansion of the list. The PEN (Pan-European Network) tried to cover the eastern part of Europe by extending the east-west corridors of the TEN (1994, 1997). The TINA process valid for the territory of the acceding countries of the first major eastern enlargement retained the PEN network, but it made possible the inclusion of secondary corridors and increasing the density of corridors (1995 – 1999). The TIRS process involving the seven Balkan countries regarded the PEN and TINA corridors as starting points, and supplemented the latter ones towards five more countries (2002). The REBIS has once again surveyed the latter five countries and though it did not revise the results of earlier processes, reconsidered each of the elements of the TIRS <b>supplementary</b> <b>networks</b> involving the five countries and made recommendations for the comprehensive transport networks of the REBIS space (2003). The project-oriented approach dominates in the entire process, including the changes of the TEN-network of the Fifteen from the early 1990 s on, and the network is almost exclusively influenced by the financing possibilities of the elemental projects. The revision of the TEN network missed to consider the actual function and continental structure of an overlapping network in the context of the enlarged Europe. As a consequence advices extending over the spaces of enlargement do not help recognise the need for thinking in the framework of the functional role of the overlapping network. Instead the former structures are preserved (strengthened) that have developed within the national borders, or are further fragmented because of new borders, 11 and there is no way for the emergence of a structure of European scale even in places where the networks are being built now. As a consequence, and because of the radial piecemeal mending of the TENstructure initially formed, the developing network further strengthens the dominance of more developed spaces instead of an open grill network that would promote equalisation on European scale...|$|R

In the present study, continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) was used to quantify CBF and obtain perfusion territory maps of the major cerebral arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Results show that both WKY and SHR have complementary, yet significantly asymmetric perfusion territories. Right or left dominances were observed in territories of the anterior (ACA), middle and posterior cerebral arteries, and the thalamic artery. Magnetic resonance angiography showed {{that some of the}} asymmetries were correlated with variations of the ACA. The leptomeningeal circulation perfusing the outer layers of the cortex was observed as well. Significant and permanent changes in perfusion territories were obtained after temporary occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery in both SHR and WKY, regardless of their particular dominance. However, animals with right dominance presented a larger volume change of the left perfusion territory (23 +/- 9 %) than animals with left dominance (7 +/- 5 %, P< 0. 002). The data suggest that animals with contralesional dominance primarily safeguard local CBF values with small changes in contralesional perfusion territory, while animals with ipsilesional dominance show a reversal of dominance and a substantial increase in contralesional perfusion territory.

Decision support systems {{must be able to}} deal effectively with these data types. In the expert system demonstrated here, a diversity of data types are included. These data are processed by three different methods. However, the different methods of processing are transparent to the user. An overall rule-based interface integrates the different methods into one comprehensive system. Data types include crisp data, fuzzy data, temporal data, and numerical representation of chaotic analysis. Some data items which appear to be crisp, for example, test results, are more accurately represented as fuzzy numbers which indicate the degree of precision of the test. Four types of temporal data are considered: change in value from previous value, change in value relative to a specified time interval, duration data, and sequence data. A measure developed by the authors which determines the degree of variability in time series data is also included. The knowledge-based portion of the system utilizes approximate reasoning techniques which allows weighting of antecedents and partial presence of symptoms. The rule base is used as the interface which invokes a neural network model or time series analysis if certain rules are substantiated. The neural network model is a three-level feed-forward model based on a non-statistical learning supervised learning algorithm developed by the authors. Input data can be of any ordered form, including binary, categoric, integer, or continuous. The network can categorize data into two or more classes, and also produces a degree of membership for each class.

It is shown that wireless sensor networks (sensornets) can provide fine-grained measurement and flexible coverage for the datacenter platform, and help achieve better control and energy efficiency [1]-[3]. In these applications, sensor nodes are only passive information receivers, and the use {{has so far been}} limited to auxiliary functions as an intelligent replacement of the traditional wired and embedded sensors. We argue that the combined computational and networking capability of a sensor network enables it to interact with server clusters in a much more sophisticated way and perform essential functions in the datacenter system. We design a technology to incorporating the sensornet as a core part of the datacenter system and improve datacenter management and operations. The sensornet can be easily deployed in a cluster, with sensor nodes attached in an ad hoc manner to the compute servers, and provide key system functions including reprogramming, <b>supplementary</b> authentication, and <b>network</b> signaling.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel classification-based {{algorithm}} called GeneClass for learning to predict gene regulatory response. Our approach {{is motivated by}} the hypothesis that in simple organisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we can learn a decision rule for predicting whether a gene is up- or down-regulated in a particular experiment based on (1) the presence of binding site subsequences (“motifs”) in the gene’s regulatory region and (2) the expression levels of regulators such as transcription factors in the experiment (“parents”). Thus our learning task integrates two qualitatively different data sources: genome-wide cDNA microarray data across multiple perturbation and mutant experiments along with motif profile data from regulatory sequences. Rather than focusing on the regression task of predicting real-valued gene expression measurements, GeneClass performs the classification task of predicting + 1 and- 1 labels, corresponding to up- and down-regulation beyond the levels of biological and measurement noise in microarray measurements. GeneClass uses the Adaboost learning algorithm with a margin-based generalization of decision trees called alternating decision trees. In computational experiments based on the Gasch S. cerevisiae dataset, we show that the GeneClass method predicts up- and down-regulation on heldout experiments with high accuracy. We explore a range of experimental setups related to environmental stress response, and we retrieve important regulators, binding site motifs, and relationships between regulators and binding sites that {{are known to be}} associated to specific stress response pathways. Our method thus provides predictive hypotheses, suggests biological experiments, and provides interpretable insight into the structure of genetic regulatory <b>networks.</b> <b>Supplementary</b> website...|$|R
40|$|Reinforcement {{learning}} (RL) {{has recently}} regained popularity, with major achievements such as beating the European game of Go champion. Here, {{for the first}} time, we show that RL can be used efficiently to train a spiking neural network (SNN) to perform object recognition in natural images without using an external classifier. We used a feedforward convolutional SNN and a temporal coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, while less activated ones fire later, or not at all. In the highest layers, each neuron was assigned to an object category, and {{it was assumed that}} the stimulus category was the category of the first neuron to fire. If this assumption was correct, the neuron was rewarded, i. e. spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) was applied, which reinforced the neuron's selectivity. Otherwise, anti-STDP was applied, which encouraged the neuron to learn something else. As demonstrated on various image datasets (Caltech, ETH- 80, and NORB), this reward modulated STDP (R-STDP) approach extracted particularly discriminative visual features, whereas classic unsupervised STDP extracts any feature that consistently repeats. As a result, R-STDP outperformed STDP on these datasets. Furthermore, R-STDP is suitable for online learning, and can adapt to drastic changes such as label permutations. Finally, it is worth mentioning that both feature extraction and classification were done with spikes, using at most one spike per neuron. Thus the network is hardware friendly and energy efficient.

Trata-se de um estudo de caso que teve como sujeitos os gestores e os gerentes da Secretaria de Saúde do Recife. Utilizou-se a análise de conteúdo, na tipologia temática, a partir dos conceitos de triângulo de governo, acessibilidade e rede. Verificou-se que, embora o município tenha implantado arranjos organizacionais de regulação, não incorporou os serviços especializados próprios nem analisou a capacidade potencial desses serviços. A Central de Regulação de Consultas e Exames Especializados absorveu apenas 9, 5 % dos procedimentos de média complexidade sob gestão municipal. Outrossim, pouco investiu na ampliação da resolubilidade da atenção básica, mantendo uma possível demanda artificial por serviços especializados. A perspectiva de maior acessibilidade organizacional, pela regulação assistencial, restringiu-se à "adequação" da demanda à oferta da rede complementar SUS/Recife. Essa oferta, por vezes, foi determinada pelos interesses do próprio setor privado, e a regulação implementada pela gestão municipal teve reduzido poder de definição. A atuação centralizadora da gestão estadual de saúde dificultou a conformação de um complexo regulador compartilhado entre esferas de gestão. Conclui-se que a regulação assistencial, na esfera dos municípios, dificilmente promoverá acesso equânime e integral enquanto atuar somente sobre uma parcela dos serviços sob gestão municipal, intervir sem a formação de redes de atenção regionais, sem pactos efetivos entre entes públicos pela continuidade do cuidado e agir sem subordinar os interesses privados às necessidades assistenciais da população. The research {{analyzed the}} evolution of a service of regulation of care at the Municipal Health Management in Recife, between 2001 to 2008, {{from the point of view}} of access with equity and integrality. A case study was conducted, having the managers from Municipal Health Department of Recife as its subjects. Content analysis was used in a thematic typology, taking as basis the concepts of government triangle, accessibility and network. It was seen that although the municipality implemented organizational arrangements for care regulation, it has neither invested in the regulation of its own specialized services, nor analyzed the potential capacity of these services. The Consultation and Specialized Exams Regulation Service absorbed only 9. 5 % of the procedures of medium complexity under municipal management. Moreover, little was invested in the expansion of the solvability of primary care, which contributed to keep a possibly artificial demand for specialized services. The possibility of greater organizational accessibility through the regulation of care was reduced to a process of organizing the existing demand to the capability of supply of SUS' <b>supplementary</b> (private) <b>network</b> in Recife. In some cases, this was defined by the interests of the very private sector, over which the regulation implemented by the municipal administration had reduced power of definition. The centralizing action of the Municipal Health Department hindered the creation of a shared regulatory complex between different levels of management. It is concluded that the regulation of care in the sphere of the municipalities can hardly promote full and equal access if it acts only over the services under municipal management, if it does not form regional networks of care and agreements between public entities for continued care and if it acts without subordinating private interests to the welfare needs of the population...|$|R
