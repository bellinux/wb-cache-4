5|$|According to Celtic mythology scholar James MacKillop, {{because the}} calves of water bulls and {{ordinary}} cows might bring disaster to the herd, {{they are supposed}} to be killed at birth; it is impossible to kill them by drowning, <b>so</b> <b>other</b> methods have to be used. Conversely, stories published in 1937 by the clergyman George Sutherland suggest these hybrids are considered to be of superior quality to normal pedigree cattle in the far north of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans outside their houses <b>so</b> <b>other</b> neighbors could easily hear them play.

5|$|The Asch Airfield {{had been}} {{constructed}} in November 1944 and {{was home to}} the 352nd Fighter Group, 8th Air Force, and the 366th Fighter Group, Ninth Air Force.

Only six of I./JG 1′s pilots took part, and just four of Stab./JG 1′s pilots participated. III./JG 11 had more aircraft than pilots, and <b>so</b> <b>other</b> Staffel made up the numbers. Just 41 Fw 190s of JG 11 took part in Bodenplatte; four from the Stab., six from I Gruppe and 31 of III Gruppe. The 20 fighters from II. Gruppe were Bf 109s.|$|E

5|$|While some mythological {{beings are}} common to all Slavic ethnic groups, ale seem to be {{exclusive}} to Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serb folklore. Even <b>so,</b> <b>other</b> Slavic groups also had demons of bad weather. Among East Slavs, this witch was called Baba Yaga, and was imagined as a woman of gigantic stature with a big nose, iron teeth, and protruding chin; {{it was believed that}} she ate children, and her presence brought thunderstorms and cold weather. The term baba is present in customs, beliefs, and toponyms of all Slavic groups, usually as a personification of wind, darkness, and rain. This leads some scholars to believe there was a proto-Slavic divinity or demon called Baba, associated with bad weather.|$|E
5|$|By 1823 Cofresí was {{probably}} on {{the crew of the}} corsair barquentine El Scipión, captained by José Ramón Torres and managed by his cousin (the first mayor of Mayagüez, José María Ramírez de Arellano). Historians agree, since several of his friends and family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods. Cofresí may have joined to evade the authorities, honing skills he would use later in life. El Scipión employed questionable tactics later associated with the pirate, such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia <b>so</b> <b>other</b> ships would lower their guard (as she did in capturing the British frigate Aurora and the American brigantine Otter). The capture of Otter led to a court order requiring restitution, affecting the crew. At this time, Cofresí turned to piracy. Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear, several theories have been proposed by researchers. In Orígenes portorriqueños Ramírez Brau speculates that Cofresí's time aboard El Scipión, or seeing a family member become a privateer, may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew's pay was threatened by the lawsuit. According to Ursula Acosta, a lack of work for privateers ultimately pushed Cofresí into piracy.|$|E
5|$|Other proffered {{explanations}} are the possible {{appearance of a}} displaced iceberg; the fear of running aground while becalmed, and a sudden seaquake. Hydrographical evidence suggests that an iceberg drifting so far south was improbable, and had it done <b>so</b> <b>other</b> ships would have seen it. Begg gives more consideration to a theory that Mary Celeste, while becalmed, began drifting towards the Dollabarat reef off Santa Maria Island. The theory supposes that Briggs, fearing his ship would run aground, launched the yawl {{in the hope of}} reaching land. The wind could then have picked up and blown Mary Celeste away from the reef, while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been becalmed, all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet the ship was found with many of its sails furled.|$|E

5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do <b>so.</b> <b>Other</b> footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} meat ants on other species varies, {{depending}} on the habitat and type of food source, and the ecological role the ant plays. The deliberate exclusion of meat ants show that not only can they alter the amount of sources available, but the dynamics of resource use on entire outcrops. If present, meat ants rely on rapidly discovering food sources and retain their dominance <b>so</b> <b>other</b> ants cannot collect them, as well as exploitation and interference which helps displace other ants. The habitat meat ants live in may affect their dominance among the fauna. They are less successful in complex habitats and more successful in open areas, allowing workers to forage efficiently; for example, workers forage around rocks and collect food sources more successfully in contrast to those in vegetation. Meat ants are even more dominant than other I. purpureus species group members in non-complex habitats. Meat ants are normally larger than other Iridomyrmex species and can displace or even kill those trying to compete for food sources. The similar behaviours among meat ants and certain Iridomyrmex species have increased the level of conflict among each other, especially those in open habitats.|$|E
