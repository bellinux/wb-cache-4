The line is not assumed to be electrically short or “closed”, thus being suitable for assessing the emission/immunity of actual transmission lines as in the automotive domain. A practical procedure employing this model is proposed and it is shown to excellently agree with the experimental results obtained in a mode-stirred reverberation chamber. An application to unshielded multi-conductor transmission lines (MTL) is also proposed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to provide an {{overview}} of polynomial chaos (PC) based methods for the statistical analysis of transmission lines. The underlying idea of PC is to represent stochastic line voltages and currents as expansions of predefined orthogonal polynomials. The determination of the expansion coefficients allows obtaining pertinent statistical information and is generally much faster than running, e. g., a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis. There exist several approaches to calculate the PC expansion coefficients. The article briefly reviews virtually all existing methods, whilst focusing on the popular and accurate stochastic Galerkin (SG) method as well as on the recent, more efficient and non-intrusive formulation of the so-called stochastic testing (ST) method. These two techniques are introduced by way of a simple illustrative example, i. e., a <b>single-wire</b> <b>line</b> running above a ground plane. Numerical comparisons in terms of accuracy and efficiency are also provided for a four-wire line with nonlinear terminations.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the bandwidth shortcomings of conventional inductive coupling biotelemetry systems for implantable devices, and presents two approaches toward an end-to-end biotelemetry system {{for reducing the}} power consumption of implanted devices at increased levels of bandwidth. By leveraging the transition zone between the near and far field, scattering in the near field at UHF frequencies for increased bandwidth at low power budgets can be employed. Additionally, taking advantage of surface wave propagation permits the use of <b>single-wire</b> RF transmission <b>lines</b> in biological tissue, offering more efficient signal routing over near field coupling resulting in controlled implant depth at low power budgets. Due to the dielectric properties of biological tissue, and the necessity {{to operate in the}} radiating near field to communicate via scattered fields, the implant depth drives the carrier frequency. The information bandwidth supplied by each sensing electrode in conventional implants also drives the operating frequency and regime. At typical implant depths, frequencies in the UHF range permit operation in the radiating near field as well as sufficient bandwidth. Backscatter modulation provides a low-power, high-bandwidth alternative to conventional low frequency inductive coupling. A prototype active implantable device presented in this thesis is capable of transmitting data at 30 Mbps over a 915 MHz link while immersed in saline, at a communication efficiency of 16. 4 pJ/bit. A prototype passive device presented in this thesis is capable of operating battery-free, fully immersed in saline, while transmitting data at 5 Mbps and consuming 1. 23 mW. This prototype accurately demodulates neural data while immersed in saline at a distance of 2 cm. This communication distance is extended at similar power budgets by exploiting surface wave propagation along a <b>single-wire</b> transmission <b>line.</b> Theoretical models of <b>single-wire</b> RF transmission <b>lines</b> embedded in high permittivity and conductivity dielectrics are validated by measurements. A <b>single-wire</b> transmission <b>line</b> of radius 152. 4 um exhibits a loss of 1 dB/cm at 915 MHz in saline, and extends the implant depth to 6 cm while staying within SAR limits. This work opens the door for implantable biotelemetry systems to handle the vast amount of data generated by modern sensing devices, potentially offering new insight into neurological diseases, and may aid in the development of BMI's.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{compatibility}} (EMC) investigations often {{involve the}} assessment of whether signal integrity (SI) and radiated susceptibility (RS) in transmission lines comply with design margins and/or maximum levels provided by EMC regulations. Hence, worst-case analysis is a useful tool to flag potential problems in the early design stage. This paper presents a novel paradigm for the worst-case SI/RS analysis of <b>single-wire</b> transmission <b>lines.</b> The method {{is based on the}} theoretical framework of Taylor arithmetic, which represents each variable as a Taylor expansion, function of the selected design parameter, complemented by an interval remainder that encompasses all approximation and round-off errors in a conservative way. A suitable modification of the basic algebraic and nonlinear operations allows propagating this representation from the input design parameter to the desired outputs. The methodology is applied to the SI analysis of a coaxial cable with uncertain shield radius, and to the RS assessment of a wire illuminated by an impinging plane wave with uncertain polarization...|$|R
50|$|The first {{application}} for balanced lines was for telephone lines. Interference that was of little consequence on a telegraph system (which is in essence digital) {{could be very}} disturbing for a telephone user. The initial format was to take two <b>single-wire</b> unbalanced telegraph <b>lines</b> and use them as a pair. This proved insufficient, however, {{with the growth of}} electric power transmission which tended to use the same routes. A telephone line running alongside a power line for many miles will inevitably have more interference induced in one leg than the other since one of them will be nearer to the power line. This issue was addressed by swapping the positions of the two legs every few hundred yards with a cross-over, thus ensuring that both legs had equal interference induced and allowing common-mode rejection to do its work. As the telephone system grew, it became preferable to use cable rather than open wires to save space, and also to avoid poor performance during bad weather. The cable construction used for balanced telephone cables was twisted pair; however, this did not become widespread until repeater amplifiers became available. For an unamplified telephone line, a twisted pair cable could only manage a maximum distance of 30 km. Open wires, on the other hand, with their lower capacitance, had been used for enormous distances—the longest was the 1500 km from New York to Chicago built in 1893. Loading coils were used to improve the distance achievable with cable but the problem was not finally overcome until amplifiers started to be installed in 1912. Twisted pair balanced lines are still widely used for local loops, the lines that connect each subscriber's premises to their respective exchange.|$|R
40|$|Spectroscopic {{measurements}} in the terahertz-frequency-range {{can offer}} {{insight into the}} picosecond dynamics, molecular conformation, and biological function of chemical systems. Despite the recent emergence of terahertz-frequency time-domain spectroscopy {{as a tool for}} the measurement of dry, solid samples, the investigation of liquid analytes is complicated by the strong attenuation of terahertz-frequency signals in aqueous environments. The integration of microfluidic systems with on-chip waveguides offers a potential solution as picosecond pulses confined to a waveguide can interact with nano- or microlitre liquid sample volumes over a distance of several millimetres, with significantly reduced attenuation compared to free-space techniques. Specifically, the <b>single-wire</b> planar Goubau <b>line</b> waveguide has attracted attention in recent years owing to the relatively large extent of the supported evanescent field, enabling sensitive interaction between a propagating electric field and nearby samples. In this work, the first on-chip microfluidic spectrometer, capable of measuring the complex permittivity of liquids in the terahertz-frequency range is introduced. The fabrication of planar Goubau line devices with integrated photoconductive switches for the generation and detection of terahertz-frequency electric fields is discussed in detail. Given the importance of maximising the signal-to-noise ratio in spectroscopic measurements, an investigation of the signals excited from these switches is conducted, and factors such as the pump-power, generating beam polarisation, and switch geometry are found to {{have a significant impact on}} signal generation efficiency and noise. In addition to problematic signal noise, waveguide geometries can introduce artefacts that complicate further analysis. To simplify later modelling of these structures, the sources of unwanted reflections and propagation modes are identified, and prevented by design. The integration of microfluidic systems with on-chip waveguides presents several interesting challenges. Intimate contact between the waveguide and analyte allows for sensitive measurement of the sample properties, yet the electronic circuitry required to generate and detect a probing terahertz field must be isolated from the risk of a short-circuit presented by the potentially conductive liquid. A device structure is proposed that simultaneously overcomes these design limitations, and comprises a geometry that can be accurately modelled. Given the lack of analytical models with which the planar Goubau line can be described, numerical modelling techniques are used to create an accurate simulation of the device structure. A method is then introduced that allows interpretation of experimental data, such that the complex permittivity of unknown liquid samples can be calculated. This new technique is used to measure the complex permittivity of a selection of well-studied polar alcohols, and the results are found to compare well to those available in literature. A free-space terahertz spectroscopy system is then used to measure liquid samples that have not been published in order to verify the results of the on-chip spectrometer when used to measure a wider range of liquid samples...|$|R
