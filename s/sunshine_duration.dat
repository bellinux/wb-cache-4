40|$|Based on {{monitoring}} data of 123 meteorological stations from 1960 to 2000 near {{or in the}} Yellow River Basin, the spatial and temporal distributions and their trends for pan evaporation (PE) are investigated in this study. The results indicate that, despite the annual mean air temperature over the Yellow River Basin has, on average, increased by 0. 6 (0) over the past 40 years, the rate of PE has steadily decreased, especially in summer and spring. Compared with the period of 1960 s to 1970 s, the rate of annual pan evaporation during 1980 s to 1990 s has decreased by 126 mm or 7. 0 percent. Spatial distribution of {{the rate of change}} show that this kind of trend is general but not universal, PE has significantly decreased over the upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River but increased to a small degree over the middle reaches.

These researches figured out {{a fact that the}} rainfalls variable is a key factor on effects between economic activities, social stability, and degree of national democracy development. For example, Brückner and Ciccone (2011) investigated the political changes in these countries located on Sahara area and found that with the heavy volatility of rainfalls, the policymakers will partly open the political environment in order to the residents can attend and join the parties, and then the degree of democracy will be risen. André and Platteau (1998) studied the fact of Rwandan genocide and indicated that the events of civic wars or race fighting for resources will rise due to the rapidly increased times from extreme climate changes. The authors also pointed out that, in Rwandan, some causal relations between climate changes, legal or illegal land lawsuits, national wars and ethnic massacres are existed. Here, we wonder that rainfalls would effectively work on economic variables at these countries with higher average rainfalls in subtropical or tropical regions.|$|R

The distributed catchment model TAC D, which is widely {{based on the}} HBV model, was further developed for the application in highly glacierized catchments on a daily timestep and applied to the Nepalese Himalayan headwater Langtang Khola (360 km 2). Low laying reference stations are taken for temperature extrapolation applying a second order polynomial function. Probability based statistical methods enable bridging data gaps in daily precipitation time series and the redistribution of cumulated precipitation sums over the previous days. Snow and ice melt was calculated in a distributed way based on the temperature-index method employing calculated daily potential <b>sunshine</b> <b>durations.</b> Different melting conditions of snow and ice and melting of ice under debris layers were considered. The spatial delineation of hydrological response units was achieved by taking topographic and physiographic information from maps and satellite images into account, and enabled to incorporate process knowledge into the model.

40|$|Given the {{complexity}} of vegetation dynamic patterns under global climate change, multi-scale spatiotemporal explicit models are {{necessary in order to}} account for environmental heterogeneity. However, there is no efficient time-series tool to extract, reconstruct and analyze the multi-scale vegetation dynamic patterns under global climate change. To fill this gap, a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Modeling (MSSTM) framework which can incorporate the pixel, scale, and time-specific heterogeneity was proposed. The MSSTM method was defined on proper time-series models for multitemporal components through wavelet transforms. The proposed MSSTM approach was applied to a subtropical mountainous and hilly agro-forestry ecosystem in southeast China using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time-series data sets from 2001 to 2011. The MSSTM approach was proved to be efficient in characterizing and forecasting the complex vegetation dynamic patterns. It provided good estimates of the peaks and valleys of the observed EVI and its average percentages of relative absolute errors of reconstruction was low (6. 65). The complexity of the relationship between vegetation dynamics and meteorological parameters was also revealed through the MSSTM method: (1) at seasonal level, vegetation dynamic patterns are strongly associated with climatic variables, primarily the temperature and then precipitation, with correlations slight decreasing (EVI–temperature) /increasing (EVI–precipitation) with altitudinal gradients. (2) At inter-annual scale, obvious positive correlations were primarily observed between EVI and temperature.

50|$|Welburn is {{situated}} within the North East England climate range. Its climate {{is influenced by}} the locations Eastern and Western boundaries. The high altitude of the nearby Pennines results in a wet, dull, frequently cool environment. The Pennines also casts a 'rain shadow' throughout the area that mixes with the prevailing westerly winds. The North sea also contributes to the climate as it exerts a moderate control on coastal areas in which it keeps summer conditions relatively cool.The average temperature of Welburn depend upon the altitude and its proximity to the coast. Temperature shows a dirunal and seasonal variation. January is usually the coldest month with daily temperatures varying from −0.5 °C on the highest ground to 1.5 °C along the coast in the area of South Yorkshire. The lowest known temperature recorded in the region was in Houghall near Durham, which is located approximately 70.4 miles from Welburn. The temperature recorded was −21.1 °C on 5 January 1941.The summer months are considerably warmer, especially the months of July and August with a mean daily temperature ranging from 21 °C in the South of Yorkshire, to a temperature of 16 °C or less in areas situated in the higher Pennines.
