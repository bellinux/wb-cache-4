40|$|This project {{tests for}} the effect of social status in a {{laboratory}} experimental market. We consider a special "box design" market in which a vertical overlap in supply and demand ensure that there are multiple equilibrium prices. We manipulate the relative social status of our subjects by awarding high status to {{a subset of the}} group based on one of two procedures. In the first, a subject's score on a trivia quiz determines his or her status; in another, subjects are assigned randomly to a higher-status or lower-status group. In both treatments we find that average prices are higher in markets where higher-status sellers face lowerstatus buyers, and lower when buyers have higher status than sellers. Across all sessions, the higher-status side of the market captures a greater share of the <b>surplus,</b> <b>earning</b> significantly more than their lower-status counterparts. © 2000 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} if actors {{are defined as}} more {{knowledgeable}} when they possess more information, and if actors are defined as more powerful when they can extract greater surplus while exchanging resources, {{there is a fundamental}} trade-off in the social structural foundations of power and knowledge. This trade-off derives from the opposing implications of having redundant (i. e., directly or indirectly linked) contacts. Insofar as ego's alters are nonredundant, ego can be expected to become more knowledgeable more quickly. And such nonredundancy can also be the basis for great power as ego monopolizes the flow of resources (including information) between ego's alters. However, the very same mechanism that is behind ego's power as a provider of resources—i. e., the possession of nonsubstituitable resources on the part of disconnected contacts—also implies that that ego's alters will themselves be monopolists, thus weakening ego as an acquirer of resources. Furthermore, while the <b>surplus</b> <b>earned</b> from providing resources on monopoly terms is potentially much greater than the <b>surplus</b> <b>earned</b> from acquiring resources on competitive terms, the former strategy carries the risk that socially distant actors will not value one another's resources. Beyond elucidating the trade-off in the social structural foundation of knowledge and power, our framework also shows how the opposing implications of redundancy are the basis for a broad family of well known trade-offs (cosmopolitanism versus localism; exploration versus exploitation; insider versus stranger; robust versus simple identities) whose relationships with one another and with power and knowledge have not been appreciated. For all such trade-offs, the greater potential returns afforded by nonredundancy are balanced by the surer returns available from redundancy. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper aims to link three {{prominent}} issues {{relevant to}} the financial world today – the mounting level of financialization, heterodox perspective on functionless investors, and compatibility of Islamic principles to heterodox thinking particularly in regards to interest and uncertainty. Examining the vast array of burgeoning literature the paper argues that the trend of financialization in the capitalist countries {{has created a new}} class of capitalist with huge accumulation of wealth ensued merely from financial transactions. Income gap between the rich and poor has widened which is at odd with heterodox perception of equality among social classes. In the Marxian and Keynesian traditions, there is little room for functionless investors to expropriate <b>surplus</b> <b>earned</b> by working and entrepreneurial classes particularly through financing means or rent. We find Islamic prohibition of interest and uncertainty compatible with this heterodox thesis. Islam does not allow rentier income from interest; rather it encourages profit and loss sharing financial contracts so that uncertainty involving with the future income is shared by contracting parties.

5000|$|The Court {{stated that}} it needed to examine the {{boundaries}} of the definition of income for several reasons. First, the Revenue Act of 1916 expressly stated that a “stock dividend shall be considered income, to the amount of the cash value.” In a previous case, Towne v. Eisner, the Court had ruled, however, that a stock dividend made in 1914 against <b>surplus</b> <b>earned</b> prior to January 1, 1913 was not taxable under the Act of October 3, 1913, which provided that net income included “dividends.” The district court in that case had noted that: “It is manifest that the stock dividend in question cannot be reached by the Income Tax Act, and could not, even though Congress expressly declared it to be taxable as income, unless it is in fact income.” The Court had held, however, that the stock dividend was the equivalent of income. The Supreme Court in Towne v. Eisner then reversed the lower court, finding that the dividend was not income because the “proportional interest of each shareholder remains the same … and the stockholder is no richer than they were before.” ...|$|R

40|$|For {{many reasons}} {{a group of}} workers may have {{sufficient}} bargaining power to claim for themselves some share of any monopoly <b>surplus</b> <b>earned</b> by an enterprise and (in the short run) {{a share of the}} return on fixed assets. This paper explores the effect of the threat of collective action on wages and employment in firms which wish to avoid collective bargaining with their employees. The threat of collective action analyzed here is a stylized representation of the institutional situation created by U. S. labor laws. If a firm wishes to avoid collective bargaining it must choose wages and employment so that no coalition {{greater than or equal to}} a fixed fraction of its workforce can be formed around a feasible bargaining agreement. The constraint this implies on employment and wages is analyzed for several assumptions about how bargained surplus is distributed among workers. It is found that the threat may affect only employment, or both wages and employment. For a firm with monopoly power a threat may either increase or decrease employment. Effects on wages and employment are found to be possible even in a market with price competition and free entry if firms must make fixed investments to produce output. Even when union contracts are efficient a threat of collective action can be expected to distort employment and investment decisions. If a threat causes firms to pay a wage above the reservation wage there will be an excess supply of labor to the firm. Under certain conditions this may manifest itself as involuntary unemployment. Further, unemployed workers will be unable to bid wages down. Like efficiency wage models, the threat of collective action provides an explanation for industry wage differences and the dual structure of the labor market. The model may also be able to provide some insight into the reasons for the stability of nominal and real wages over the business cycle. ...|$|R

The SBM model is non-radial and can deal with inputs/outputs individually, contrary to the radial approaches that assume proportional changes in inputs/outputs.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{tensions}} between the ethos and values of third sector organisations and the environment within which they operate. Many third sector organisations have an innovative, flexible, and person-centred way of working, which often results in them being better placed than the state to provide informal services {{in the field of}} health and social care. However, a drive towards greater efficiency has compelled organisations to adopt business principles, with the concept of the ‘social enterprise’ being promoted. Organisations are also increasingly subject to regulatory requirements, and are often required to provide compelling evidence that they tangibly benefit the communities that they serve. Critics have argued that this increased statutory influence has prevented third sector organisations from engaging with their communities in an innovative and effective manner. 	Arts and health projects face particular challenges when responding to statutory pressures. Many projects focus on ‘softer’ outcomes such as improvements to self esteem and confidence, which can be at odds with the kind of evidence demanded by the state. In addition, third sector organisations, including the majority of social enterprises, are largely reliant upon statutory sources of income. They are therefore susceptible to ‘institutional isomorphism’, whereby their structures and procedures are influenced in the direction of dominant stakeholders. While the adoption of social enterprise activity can allow organisations to diversify their sources of income, thereby minimising the possibility of dependency on particular stakeholders, this can create tensions and challenges of its own. Organisations may focus on maximising their <b>surplus,</b> or <b>earned</b> income, to the detriment of their social goals. 	Drawing on data obtained from an ethnographic case study of a small community-focussed ‘arts and health’ organisation that self-identified as a social enterprise, this thesis explores how the ethos of third sector organisations manifests itself through their day to day workings, discussing the mechanisms by which ethos can be threatened, prioritised, or altered. Important examples of organisational tension that emerged during the period of fieldwork were explored in depth. 	This thesis utilises a number of concepts and theories, including Foucauldian governmentality, institutional theory, organisational legitimacy, and impression management, to explain the nature of the tensions organisations may face, why these tensions can threaten the third sector ethos, and the ways by which organisations can manage these tensions strategically. This research argues that rather than acquiesce to dominant institutional pressures, organisations often have the means to resist, rework, or negotiate any external demands, thereby maximising the opportunities available to them. ...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{growth in}} {{contract}} farming schemes particularly {{in developing countries}} has sparked controversy over its economic and welfare impacts on participating smallholders. This {{has given rise to}} a body of literature that analyses various aspects of the phenomenon. However, the question of why smallholders choose to participate in a contract farming scheme has not been thoroughly explored. Seldom are smallholders themselves asked explicitly why they choose to produce on contract for agribusiness firms, as many studies take it axiomatic that smallholders produce on contract solely because of the income benefits they expect to derive. This study explores the motivational factors behind smallholders decision to produce traditional staple foods on contract for local agribusiness firms in Tampola, a typical farming community in the north-eastern part of Ghana. The goal is to ascertain and highlight smallholder constraints that are embedded in such motivational factors to enhance agricultural policy intervention. Using a qualitative research method, I find among other things that, the volatility of the mainstream input and output markets for agriculture were sources of motivation for smallholders to produce on contract. I also find that the urge to sell farm produce in weight rather than in volumes was another motivating factor. The desire to <b>earn</b> <b>surplus</b> food induced by the high yields potential of contract farming for household consumption was also another source of motivation for smallholders. The study concludes with some recommendations for agricultural policy that are meant to address some smallholder constraints that emanates from the motivational factors. Among them is the need for the state and other development agencies to give the needed attention to the development of food crop value chains, not only to enhance food security, but also the creation of non-farm employment opportunities for smallholders...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses laboratory economic {{experiments to}} test the incentive effects of regulatory policies and practices under asymmetric information conditions. Significant results and policy implications are obtained on the traditional use of rate-of-return regulation (RORR) to regulate natural monopolies, and on the practice of restricting such firms from entering ancillary markets. The objective of the first several chapters is {{to test the}} incentive effects of RORR on market performance. Results confirm long-standing theories of incentive malfunctions of RORR. One result shows that under voluntary compliance, RORR is completely ineffective for regulating single sellers when cost information is private to firms, allowing them to misrepresent costs and earn monopoly profits. When firm's do not know market demand, they capture less <b>surplus,</b> but still <b>earn</b> above RORR expected returns. When stochastic auditing is added varying penalty rates and audit probabilities, significant cost overestimates remain common. Theoretical analysis explains the potential source of this anomaly as being the use of historical cost information in rate setting when excess profits are used as the audit benchmark. Other results show that in perfect repeated static implementations of RORR, wasteful input use will occur manifested as rate base padding or Averch-Johnson type selection of inefficient input combinations. Another chapter addresses the consequences of deregulating RORR franchise firms allowing them to enter ancillary markets. A stylized model of the telecommunications industry is created and experimentally tested to determine if anti-competitive firm behavior results when entry restrictions are lifted. Results offer no support for the arguments that regulated firms will use monopoly market earnings to underwrite ancillary market operations ("deep pocket"), engage in predatory pricing, or unfair competition. Economic arguments for removing entry barriers to improve market performance (increased output and lower prices) are substantiated...|$|R
40|$|At last {{there are}} some signs that Victoria has a Labor {{government}} that deserves the name, writes David Hayward THE best Labor governments charge into office raring to go. They’ve got lots to do and too little time to do it. They enjoy the big following that accompanies governments of passion. The Bracks government has so far not played it this way, and has veered {{too far to the}} right to be feted as a Labor champion. But as it approaches the midway point of its second term, things are starting to look much better. The Bracks government’s most recent budget was undoubtedly its best, and it deserved the warm accolades it received. After a cautious first term, spending is now on its way up in real terms, and the state’s public service is, thankfully, being rebuilt. Under Steve Bracks, public service employment is up by 38, 000, or 18 per cent, which is more {{than the rest of the}} states and territories combined. By the end of this financial year, government expenses will have risen by 40 per cent, a significant rise on any criteria. Capital works will be a record $ 2. 3 billion, or more than double the level when Labor came to power. All this spending has not sent the Treasury broke, for it has been made possible by rapid economic growth. Government spending will account for only a slightly larger share of the state’s economy this year than it did in Jeff Kennett’s last. Nor have taxes skyrocketed as some would have us believe, for they have simply maintained their share of a booming economy. Yes, stamp duties have provided more than their share, but let’s not forget that they follow the housing market, rising when it goes up and shrinking when it falls. They are a consequence, not a cause of more expensive housing. And throughout it all Labor has delivered a succession of large budget <b>surpluses</b> that have <b>earned</b> it the title of the nation’s most frugal administration. Where has the money gone? Most of the cash has poured into health, which has enjoyed a 50 per cent spending boost over the past five years. The latest figures suggest that per capita spending on hospitals is now almost 30 per cent more than the all-state average. And while there’s still so much more to be done, this is because we are getting older and with old age comes ill health and a rising medical bill. Bracks has also put 2800 teachers back into the schools where they belong, but it will take another term and another 1500 jobs before we employ the same number of state teachers that we did when Joan Kirner crept out of office more than a dozen years ago. Nevertheless, falling student numbers have enabled Labor to cut class sizes to levels we haven’t seen before, and this is a major achievement. The number of school support staff has also risen to record levels, and the government has gradually broadened its focus away from primary schools to the middle years of secondary schooling as well. Education Minister Lynne Kosky has recently pledged a new school funding formula that is based on need, as well as a performance regime that tries to improve schools in stress, and a school management framework that is devolved, yet inclusive, and premised on the idea of collective improvement rather than self interest. The harsh language of competition and a rugged individualism has, thankfully, given way to a policy framework designed to lift all children in state schools to new highs, rather than just the few in the wealthiest suburbs. Labor is also turning heads with its new approach to water management. Its recently released white paper has won glowing approval for its market-based pricing designed to conserve our water in combination with a substantial increase in the concessions to low-income households and especially those with large families. It is a clever mix of efficiency and equity to the benefit of the environment, of which Labor can be justly proud. And then, of course, there is the democratisation of the upper house, which Bracks quite rightly points to as his government’s greatest achievement. All this is not to say that Steve Bracks has become a Gough Whitlam, or that Labor has suddenly turned red. It continues to be heavily constrained by a budget framework that was first constructed by Alan Stockdale. Its community building initiatives are more rhetoric than reality, and public-private partnerships are still in favour, when everyone who looks closely at them sees a neat way for private financiers to fleece us all. And this government has been strangely reluctant to renationalise public transport, when that was the obvious thing to do. It has decided to privatise the Mitcham to Scoresby freeway, even though it could easily have debt-funded the road itself at a substantial saving. It is in the process of squandering a cool $ 125 million on a badly designed first home owners’ subsidy, which will give a lucky few new home buyers $ 6000 to spend on whatever they wish, when the money should have been used on public housing and the homeless. It has decided to set up another Competition Commission, when what we really needed was a Commission for Effectiveness and Equity to give Labor’s priorities a better balance. These are all disappointments, and they show that there is considerable room for improvement. But remember, Labor is still only halfway through its second term and it’s got a lot of untapped talent. Labor governments typically begin with a cracking first generation of ministers full of ideas, who eventually retire to leave holes that are increasingly hard to fill. This will not be a problem for the Bracks government, for there is an untapped, swollen back bench waiting for something to do, as well as junior ministers now ready for a bigger challenge. Some ministerial retirements perhaps induced by a mid-term shuffle could indeed be beneficial, so that the likes of John Lenders, Jacinta Allan, Gavin Jennings, Tim Holding and Rob Hudson can leave their mark in the way that Labor ministers ought to. The best Labor governments know that time is their enemy, for their better days are always behind them. The Bracks government has charted a different course, and there is good reason for believing that it’s precisely because of this that its best days lie ahead.
