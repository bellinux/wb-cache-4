25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} â€“ use sturdy outrigger booms for towing a beam trawl, one warp {{on each side}}. Double-rig beam trawlers can tow {{a separate}} trawl {{on each side of}} the trawler. Beam trawling is used in the flatfish and shrimp fisheries in the North Sea. They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with <b>safety</b> <b>release</b> systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is also restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety.|$|E

Though it is possible to barefoot with a normal 75.00 foot nylon tow rope and handle, many skiers use special ropes made out of Poly-E or Spectra to reduce spring. Barefoot handles have plastic tubing around them, so the skier can wrap their feet around the rope without getting rope burn and can have small modifications for frontward and backward toe holds.|$|E
50|$|The {{range is}} a new {{generation}} of fire extinguisher designed in response to customer demand. Incorporating innovative features, this is the most user-friendly design of fire extinguishers released this century. With a new quick release mechanism and an ergonomically redesigned handle, lever and hose grip, the Chubb range is easier to use and many models offer improved fire ratings.In terms of the <b>safety</b> <b>release</b> mechanism, the traditional â€˜pinâ€™ that prevents the extinguisher from being discharged accidentally has been replaced with an Easy-Pull Clip with arrows to show a clear direction of â€˜pullâ€™ in order to activate the extinguisher. The photoluminescent version ensures the clip is visible even if the lights fail. When the clip is pulled, the word â€˜USEDâ€™ then appears.|$|E

50|$|The fuel {{region is}} {{surrounded}} by a concentric ring of beryllium reflector approximately 1 ft (0.30 m) thick. This in turn is subdivided into three regions: the removable reflector, the semi permanent reflector, and the permanent reflector. The beryllium {{is surrounded by}} a water reflector of effectively infinite thickness. In the axial direction, the reactor is reflected by water.The control plates, in the form of two thin, nuclear poison-bearing concentric cylinders, are located in an annular region between the outer fuel element and the beryllium reflector. These plates are driven in opposite directions to open and close a window at the core mid-plane. Reactivity is increased by downward motion of the inner cylinder and the upward motion of the four outer quadrant plates. The inner cylinder is used for shimming and power regulation and has no fast safety function. The outer control cylinder consists of four separate quadrant plates, each having an independent drive and <b>safety</b> <b>release</b> mechanism. All control plates have three axial regions of different neutron poison content designed to minimize the axial peak-to-average power-density ratio throughout the core lifetime. Any single quadrant plate or cylinder is capable of shutting the reactor down.|$|E
50|$|All modern {{pressure}} cookers {{will have}} a pressure regulator valve and a pressure relief valve as a safety mechanism to prevent explosion {{in the event that}} the pressure regulator valve fails to adequately release pressure. Some older models lack a <b>safety</b> <b>release</b> valve. Most home cooking models are built to maintain a low and high pressure setting. These settings are usually between 7 and 15 PSI. Almost all home cooking units will employ a very simple single-stage pressure regulator. Older models will simply use a small weight on top of an opening that will jiggle to allow excess pressure to escape. Newer models usually incorporate a spring-loaded valve that lifts and allows pressure to escape as pressure in the vessel rises. Some pressure cookers {{will have a}} quick release setting on the pressure regulator valve that will, essentially, lower the spring tension to allow the pressure to escape at a quick, but still safe rate. Commercial kitchens also use pressure cookers, in some case using oil based pressure cookers to quickly deep fry fast food. In this case, {{and in the case of}} cooking at home, pressurized vessels can be used to cook food much more rapidly than it would take to cook large amounts of food without pressure. Pressure vessels of this sort can also be used to sterilize small batches of equipment and in home canning operations.|$|E
