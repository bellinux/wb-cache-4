The PID controller design is based on using the Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) technology. Parameters tuning of the PID controller is achieved by using the genetic algorithm (GA). The FPAA controller based technology gives the advantage of low power, no quantization noise, high bandwidth and high speed response. The practical results show that a self-tuning controller can outperform a hand-tuned solution and demonstrate adaptability to plant drift; also it gives very acceptable results in the reduction of overshoot, stability time and the steady-state transient response of the controlled plant...|$|E
40|$|A {{complete}} modelling and {{numerical simulation}} {{of a system}} comprising a <b>separately</b> <b>excited</b> <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>motor</b> fed from a single-phase, single-way rectifier are presented in this paper. The strategy {{of this approach is}} based on the cascade combination of a diode bridge rectifier and a Sepic (single-ended primary inductance converter) circuit. Both step-up and step-down characteristics of the output voltage can be obtained. The supply current is approximately sinusoidal and its power factor is high. A good performance is achieved with a simple control circuit and only one switch for the converter. Differential equations describing the system behaviour in different modes of operations are presented. Solving these equations enable the predication of the motor performance in both transient and stead-state conditions. The total harmonic distortion of the supply and motor currents are obtained using the numerical simulation of this system. Moreover, the effect of the duty ratio of the converter on the system performance is investigated. The experimental and simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis. The proposed configuration provides a useful rectifier with sinusoidal input current and a satisfactory motor speed regulation...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a closed loop speed {{control of a}} <b>separately</b> <b>excited</b> <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> <b>motor.</b> The d. c. motor is fed from an a. c. supply through a cascade combination of a diode bridge rectifier and a Single-Ended Primary Inductance Converter (SEPIC). This converter offers both step-up and step-down characteristics of the motor terminal voltage {{as well as an}} approximately sinusoidal supply current with an improved power factor. A high performance is achieved with a simple control circuit having only one switch for the converter. A Fuzzy Logic speed controller is used to deal with system nonlinearity and parameters change. A wide range of speed and load control tests showed satisfactory performance of the proposed controller. The system is modelled by using its nonlinear differential equations for different modes of operation. An experimental laboratory model is implemented and the controller is investigated using a digital signal processing board (DSP 1102). Experimental results are given to verify the simulation results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller. The results confirm the relevance of the proposed configuration as a useful rectifier that achieves d. c. motor speed control with sinusoidal supply current and high power factor...|$|E

Drives expanse depends on progress in {{different part of}} science like power system, electronic, control methods and so on. Because the fuzzy logic techniques {{can be used to}} control any type of system. The mathematical background and initial assumptions on which the conventional method relies on. On the other hand the fuzzy control is based on fuzzy logic, a logical system that is much closer to the human thinking and natural language compared with the classical control methods. Usually the synthesis of controller includes both the controller type selection and the adjustment of its parameters. In some cases the controller's type might be more complex than a PI (D) type controller. In all the cases, the tuning problem must be satisfactorily solved. These types of situations can be solved more easily with a fuzzy controller which has made possible the establishment of intelligent control. This study presents efficient method for speed control of a <b>separately</b> <b>excited</b> <b>D.</b> <b>C</b> <b>motor</b> using fuzzy logic control (FLC). However, the controllers based on fuzzy logic theory are used only in simple configurations and their analytical knowledge is still poor.

When a variable load condition occur the load voltage get changed, simultaneously other parameters such as torque, speed at load side and voltage, current profiles at source side get affected. Due to which there is lot of distortion in the sending end parameters. To overcome these drawbacks the essential variables are analyzed by feeding these variables back to the converter switches, which regulates the output voltage, fed to <b>separately</b> <b>excited</b> DC-Drive, which indicates that, at the ac interface the harmonic profile of the <b>separately</b> <b>excited</b> dc drive fed by the improved power quality dual converter is achieved using closed loop system...|$|R

The influence of smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> and pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> discharge power on films thickness, crystallinity, surface morphology, photocatalytic activity (methylene blue degradation) and hydrophilic activity were studied. At pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> sputtering, plasma generator has been used to provide the asymmetric pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> bias of the target at 100 kHz and pulsed off-time 4016 ns. The structures of the films at 100 nm and 300 nm thick showed nano-grain size structure. The pulsed <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode deposition exhibited a considerably lower surface roughness, but higher grain size compared to the films deposited with the smooth <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> mode.

40|$|Abstract. On each nonreflexive Banach space X {{there exists}} a {{positive}} continuous convex function f such that 1 /f is not a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function (i. e., a difference of two continuous convex functions). This result together with known ones implies that X is reflexive {{if and only if}} each everywhere defined quotient of two continuous convex functions is a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function. Our construction gives also a stronger version of Klee’s result concerning renormings of nonreflexive spaces and non-norm-attaining functionals. A function on a Banach space X is called a <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function if it can be represented as a difference of two continuous convex functions (all functions considered in this note are realvalued). Thus the system of all <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on X is the smallest vector space containing all continuous convex functions. Moreover, it is well-known, and not difficult to show, that it is even an algebra and a lattice (see, e. g., [2, III. 2]). While an everywhere defined quotient g/f of two <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> functions on a finite-dimensional Banach space is always <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> (cf. [1, Corollary]), the situation is completely different for infinite-dimensional spaces: by [7, Corollary 5. 7], on each infinite-dimensional Banach space {{there exists a}} positive <b>d.</b> <b>c.</b> function such that 1 /f is not <b>d.</b> <b>c...</b>|$|R
