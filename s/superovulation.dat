25|$|Embryo {{collection}} is more demanding and requires more training than semen collection because the female reproductive organs are located {{inside of the}} body cavity. <b>Superovulation</b> is a technique used {{in order to have}} a female release more oocytes than normal. This can be achieved by using hormones to manipulate the female's reproductive organs. The hormones used are typically gonadotropin-like, meaning they stimulate the gonads. Follicle stimulating hormone is the preferred hormone in cattle, sheep and goats. While in pigs, equine chorionic gonadotropin is preferred. However, this is not commonly done in the swine industry because gilts and sows (female pigs) naturally ovulate more than one oocyte at one time. <b>Superovulation</b> can be difficult because not all females will respond the same way and success will vary by species. Once the female has released the oocytes, they are fertilized internally—in vivo—and flushed out of her body. In vivo fertilization is more successful than in vitro fertilization. In cattle, usually 10 or more embryos are removed from the flushing process. In order to flush the uterus, a technician will first seal off the female's cervix and add fluid, which allows the ovum to be flushed out of the uterine horns and into a cylinder for analysis. This process typically takes 30 minutes or less. Technicians are able to determine the sex of the embryo, which can be especially beneficial in the dairy industry because it is more desirable for the embryo to be a female. Vitrification is the preferred method of embryo freezing because it yields higher quality embryos. It is crucial technicians handle the embryos with care and freeze them within 3–4 hours in order to preserve viability of the greatest percentage of embryos.|$|E

40|$|<b>Superovulation</b> or ovarian {{stimulation}} is currently an indispensable assisted reproductive technology (ART) for human subfertility/infertility treatment. Recently, increased frequencies of imprinting disorders have been correlated with ARTs.

In many cases, increased risk of genomic imprinting disorders {{has been attributed to}} <b>superovulation</b> in combination with inherent subfertility. To distinguish between these contributing factors, carefully controlled experiments are required on spontaneously ovulated, in vivo-fertilized oocytes and their induced-ovulated counterparts, thereby minimizing effects of in vitro manipulations. To this end, effects of <b>superovulation</b> on genomic imprinting were evaluated in a mouse model, where subfertility is not a confounding issue. This work represents the first comprehensive examination of the overall effects of <b>superovulation</b> on imprinted DNA methylation for four imprinted genes in individual blastocyst stage embryos. We demonstrate that <b>superovulation</b> perturbed genomic imprinting of both maternally and paternally expressed genes; loss of Snrpn, Peg 3 and Kcnq 1 ot 1 and gain of H 19 imprinted methylation were observed. This perturbation was dose-dependent, with aberrant imprinted methylation more frequent at the high hormone dosage. <b>Superovulation</b> is thought to primarily affect oocyte development; thus, effects were expected to be limited to maternal alleles. Our study revealed that maternal as well as paternal H 19 methylation was perturbed by <b>superovulation.</b> We postulate that <b>superovulation</b> has dual effects during oogenesis, disrupting acquisition of imprints in growing oocytes, as well as maternal-effect gene products subsequently required for imprint maintenance during pre-implantation development...|$|E

Twenty Boer goat does were allocated into two groups comprising of 10 animals per group. For the Day 0 protocol, does oestrous cycles were synchronized for 9 days and superovulated with pFSH starting 84 h after the termination of progesterone treatment. For the traditional pFSH protocol, the oestrous cycle of does was synchronized for 9 days, followed by <b>superovulation</b> with pFSH initiated 48 h before CIDR withdrawal. For both groups does had two timed cervical inseminations with fresh undiluted semen. Embryos from both groups were flushed on day 6 following AI. The response to <b>superovulation</b> did not differ significantly between treatments but a tendency (P = 0. 06) was found for both fertilization and number of unfertilized ova in favour of the Day 0 protocol. The number of follicles 2 – 3 mm, 4 – 5 mm and total number offollicles atthe beginning of a <b>superovulation</b> treatment was positively correlated to the total number of structures and embryos recovered.

The mean TCL, TNE and TVE were 6. 9, 2. 8 and 2. 1 and 8. 2, 3. 3 and 2. 5 for control and treatments respectively. The peak progesterone level was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in treatment group (6. 8 ng/ml) than those in control (5. 6 ng/ml). Repeated the <b>superovulation</b> after 3 months did not significantly affect the number of embryo collected. In conclusion, <b>superovulation</b> in buffaloes can be performed using a types of FSH and prime injection of FSH on day 1 of estrus cycle increase the number of embryo recovered. The <b>superovulation</b> can be conducted after 3 months...|$|E
40|$|To {{optimise}} the use {{of juvenile}} in vitro embryo transfer technologies in young rabbit females, <b>superovulation</b> was performed in New Zealand White young rabbit females at different ages and the expression mode of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) was explored using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and in vitro maturation (IVM) together with fertilisation (IVF) was conducted immediately after <b>superovulation.</b> The results showed that (1) the age factor significantly affected <b>superovulation</b> in young rabbit females, with 60 d as an optimal age; (2) the mRNA level of FSHR exhibited a rising trend, though it was lower at 30 to 40 d of age; (3) the maturation rate of the oocytes from 60 d old rabbits {{was significantly higher than}} in those from 50 d old rabbits; (4) the fertilisation rate of oocytes was not significantly different among rabbits 50, 60 and 70 d old...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>superovulation</b> by {{pregnant}} mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) on autologous transplanted ovaries in the lumbar muscles of mice was histomorphometrically evaluated using the indices of number and volume of {{different kind of}} follicles and volume of corpora lutea, ovary, and stroma. Angiogenesis was observed after mouse ovarian transplantation on days 14 and 21 after ovarian grafting. After transplantation, the total number and volume of primary and secondary follicles reduced, while PMSG <b>superovulation</b> increased the total number and total volume of tertiary follicles and also the ovarian volume after transplantation. Transplantation increased the average size of primary, secondary, and tertiary follicles. Therefore, primary and secondary follicles can survive after autologous transplantation but their reservations diminished by increasing the time of transplantation. However, number of tertiary follicles and their response to <b>superovulation</b> increased over time after transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Eight superovulated Toda buffaloes {{were studied}} ultrasonographically {{to record the}} {{biometry}} of the ovarian structures and superovulatory response during <b>superovulation</b> and flushing programme, conducted in this breed as a breed conservation measure. Ovarian size (10 buffaloes) and structural changes (eight superovulated buffaloes) were monitored on a) the 10 th day post heat (before initiation of FSH) b) Post SOV heat (the 3 rd day of superovulatory heat) and c) {{on the day of}} flushing. The animals were subjected to <b>superovulation</b> with either 400 or 600 mg FSH (Folltropin V). The <b>superovulation</b> was initiated from the 10 th day of the estrous cycle, and embryos were collected on the 5. 5 to 6 day of post superovulatory (SOV) heat. Before SOV programming, the average size of the left ovary was found to be 24. 67 + 2. 35 mm while the right ovary measured 26. 11 + 1. 71 mm and the average size of CL was 14. 50 + 3. 28 mm. There was significant increase in the length and width of ovaries post <b>superovulation</b> and on the day of flushing. A greater number of ovarian structures (CL/follicles) were found at the time of flushing than during post SOV heat indicating late/ an-ovulations (post heat). The average size of the follicle showed increase on the day of flushing, due to cystic ovarian condition in a few buffaloes. Late ovulation and a lower number of recruited follicles during <b>superovulation</b> may be the reason for lower response in Toda buffaloes than in other breeds of buffaloes...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of <b>superovulation</b> on the {{circulating}} levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 1 (IGFBP- 1) has been investigated. IGFBP- 1 levels were measured in singleton pregnancies achieved either naturally (n = 203) or following <b>superovulation,</b> in-vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) with either pituitary desensitisation with buserelin and <b>superovulation</b> with human menopausal gonadotrophin (b/hMG) followed by IVF-ET (n = 15) or with clomiphene citrate and hMG (CC/hMG) followed by IVF-ET (n = 15, 1 st trimester only). The circulating levels of IGFBP- 1 were similar in all three groups during the first trimester, and in both normal and b/hMG pregnancies in the second, but were significantly higher during the third trimester in b/hMG pregnancies than in normal pregnancies (P = 0. 0002). The birth weights were significantly lower in the b/hMG group (P = 0. 04), {{but not in the}} CC/hMG group compared with natural conceptions. Gestational age at delivery was similar in control and b/hMG pregnancies, but significantly reduced in CC/hMG pregnancies (P = 0. 04). These data suggest that pregnancies achieved following <b>superovulation</b> with b/hMG are associated with elevated levels of IGFBP- 1 during the third trimester of pregnancy and reduced birth weight...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND:Common {{marmoset}} monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) {{are readily}} used in biomedical research. However, <b>superovulation</b> for {{embryonic stem cell}} production and developmental research still remain difficult. Inexplicably, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) as key player in <b>superovulation</b> has to be administered in extremely high dosages in this non-human primate compared to human. METHODS:To evaluate whether marmoset FSH (cjFSH) is functionally more competent than its human homologue on the marmoset FSH receptor (cjFSHR), we established in vitro a homologous system characterizing homologous and recombinantly produced cjFSH. RESULTS:Upon stimulation of two cell lines stably expressing either the marmoset or the human FSH receptor (cj/hFSHR), respectively, the second messenger signaling of the activated receptor displayed {{no significant difference in}} ED(50) values. Thermostability of cjFSH was significantly prolonged by roughly 20 % on both FSHRs. CONCLUSION:High FSH dosage in marmoset <b>superovulation</b> cannot be explained by enhanced biopotency of the natural animal's gonadotropin...|$|E
40|$|Forty eight gilts {{with average}} body weight of 107. 83 + 5. 08 kg {{were used in}} {{experiments}} to study the use of {{pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin}} (PMSG) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) as <b>superovulation</b> agent in gilts to increase piglet production. Four groups of twelve gilts were injected with PMSG dan hCG dose levels of 0, 600, 1200, and 1800 IU/gilt. Injections were conducted three days before estrus. During gestation, gilts were placed in colony pigpens. On days 15, 35, and 70 of gestation, gilts were slaughtered in order to measure the number of corpus luteum, growth and development of the uterus and placenta. Blood samples were collected to determine progesterone and estradiol concentrations. The resuts showed that <b>superovulation</b> dose levels of 600 to 1200 IU/gilt increased progesterone and estradiol secretions, growth and development of the uterus and placenta in gestation ages of 15, 35, and 70 days. It is concluded that <b>superovulation</b> with dose of 600 to 1200 IU can improve the gilts reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Thirty six Etawah-grade does (BW 20. 4 - 44. 2 kg, age 2. 5 - 7 years) {{were used}} to study the {{efficacy}} of increasing secretion of endogenous hormones of pregnancy by <b>superovulation</b> of does to stimulate of growth prenatal in uterus. The does were injected with {{pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin}} (PMSG), 0 IU/kg BW [grouped into nonsuperovulation-NSO] and 15 IU/kg BW [grouped into Superovulation-SO]. Intravaginal sponge (60 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) was applied for 14 days to synchronize estrus cycle. Twenty four hours prior to sponge removal, PMSG was injected to stimulate <b>superovulation.</b> After sponge removal, five experimental does were mixed with one buck for natural mating. <b>Superovulation</b> prior to mating increased number of corpora lutea, mean of maternal serum estradiol concentration, progesterone concentration, litter size, average birth weight and average milk yield, by 112, 67, 42, 27, 32, and 35 %, respectively.

40|$|Two active {{mutations}} (A 781 G and A 1575 G) {{in growth}} hormone (GH) gene, and their associations with litter size (LS), were investigated in both a high prolificacy (Matou, n = 182) {{and a low}} prolificacy breed (Boer, n = 352) by using the PCR-RFLP method. <b>Superovulation</b> experiments were designed in 57 dams, in order to evaluate the effect of different genotypes of the GH gene on <b>superovulation</b> response. Two genotypes (AA and AB, CC and CD) in each mutation were detected in these two goat breeds. Neither BB nor DD homozygous genotypes were observed. The genotypic frequencies of AB and CC {{were significantly higher than}} those of AA and CD. In the third parity, Matou dams with AB or CC genotypes had significantly larger litter sizes than those with AA and CD (p < 0. 05). On combining the two loci, both Matou and Boer dams with ABCD genotype had the largest litter sizes when compared to the other genotypes (p < 0. 05). When undergoing like <b>superovulation</b> treatments, a significantly higher number of corpora lutea and ova, with a lower incidence of ovarian cysts, were harvested in the AB and CC genotypes than in AA and CD. These results show that the two loci of GH gene are highly associated with abundant prolificacy and <b>superovulation</b> response in goat breeds...|$|E
40|$|Thirty six Etawah-grade does (BW {{ranged from}} 20. 4 to 44. 2 kg and age ranged from 2. 5 to 7 years) {{were used to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>superovulation</b> prior to mating and zinc supplementation on milk yields. The {{experimental}} does were assigned into a randomized block design with a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement. The first factor was PMSG (pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin) injection with 2 levels (0 IU/kg BW [nonsuperovulation–NSO] and 15 IU/kg BW [Superovulation–SO]). The second factor was zinc concentration in the diet with 3 levels (40 mg/kg DM [Z- 40], 60 mg/kg DM [Z- 60], and 80 mg/kg DM [Z- 80]). Intravaginal sponge (60 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate) was applied for 14 days to synchronize estrus cycle. Twenty four hours prior to sponge removal, PMSG was injected to stimulate <b>superovulation.</b> After sponge removal, 5 experimental does were mixed with 1 buck for natural mating. During pregnancy the experimental does were fed and raised in individual stables. Udder volume was measured every other week from weeks 12 to 21 of pregnancy. During lactation (one week to 5 months post partum) kids were separated from the does, and milk was harvested by hand milking. Milk samples were taken every other week for determination of milk quality. The results indicated that <b>superovulation</b> increased udder differential growth by 80 % (822. 85 vs 1481. 25 cm 3 /head), milk yield by 32 % (567. 14 vs 746. 52 g/head/day). Zinc concentration increased udder differential growth and milk yield. Milk productions for does receiving 40, 60 and 80 mg/kg DM were 565. 68, 737. 88 and 666. 92 g/day, respectively. It was concluded that <b>superovulation</b> and zinc supplementation increased milk yield in Etawah Grade does.
