25|$|When open, doors admit people, animals, {{ventilation}} or light. The door is used {{to control}} the physical atmosphere within a space by enclosing the air drafts, so that interiors may be more effectively heated or cooled. When closed, a door normally impedes the transfer of air from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Similar structures that do allow air to be transferred through some form of a grillwork are called gates.|$|E
25|$|To begin {{making a}} rug, one needs a {{foundation}} consisting of warps and wefts: Warps are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which {{run through the}} length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> are called wefts. The warps {{on either side of the}} rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.|$|E
25|$|A funnel {{water slide}} {{requires}} riders {{to sit in}} a 2 or 4 seater round tube. Riders drop from inside a tunnel out into the ride's main element shaped like a funnel on its side. Riders oscillate from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> until they exit through the back of the funnel and into a splash pool. The most common type of funnel is the ProSlide Tornado which is installed at almost 60 locations around the world dating back to 2003. In 2010, WhiteWater West began developing a competing product known as the Abyss, utilizing a raft that holds up to six riders.|$|E

25|$|Another notable {{feature in}} some stories {{is that the}} arms {{are said to be}} {{connected}} to each other through the torso and can slide from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> While they are primarily water creatures, they do on occasion venture onto land. When they do, the plate can be covered with a metal cap for protection. In some versions of the legends, kappa spend spring and summer in the water, {{and the rest of the}} year in the mountains as Yama-no-Kami (山の神, “mountain gods”). Although they are reported to live throughout Japan, they are often said to be particular to Saga Prefecture.|$|E
25|$|Sweep rowers (one oar per person) and scullers (two oars, {{one in each}} hand) {{have similar}} stroke styles, with some {{differences}} to accommodate the number of oars held by the rower. The most notable {{difference is that the}} oar handles overlap in sculling at the midpoint of the drive, and again during the recovery. This requires the sculler to cross one hand over (left over right) and/or {{in front of the other}} hand to avoid the oar handles colliding. While sculling is a fully symmetrical movement (with exception of the handle overlap), sweep oar rowing is slightly asymmetrical and many rowers strongly prefer one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E

They {{fill the}} negative {{spaces in the}} scenes and run continuously from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The text is written in Sumerian cuneiform script. From these inscriptions, {{it is known that}} the stele was commissioned by Eannatum, an ensi or ruler of Lagash around 2460 BC. On it, he describes a conflict with Umma over a tract of agricultural land located between the two city-states. The conflict ends in a battle in which Eannatum, described as the beloved of the god Ningirsu, triumphs over Umma. After the battle, the leader of Umma swears that he will not transgress into the territory of Lagash again upon penalty of divine punishment.|$|E

His primary residence was the palace on the Neva, which was so large that his brother Grand Duke Sergei, who lived with him, used a bicycle to go from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Between his two residences in the capital region, he employed more than 400 servants.|$|E

500|$|The raised {{forecastle}} and {{the prominent}} sheer and flare {{of the bow}} ensured that the Chacal-class ships were good seaboats, but they proved to be topheavy with poor lateral stability despite [...] bilge keels.

500|$|Following the explosion, Prince of Wales was {{targeted}} by both German ships and disengaged from combat after seven direct hits, four by Bismarck and three by Prinz Eugen, at about 06:09.

The second shell passed right through the bow from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The third struck the hull underwater and burst inside the ship, flooding a generator room and damaging the bulkhead of an adjoining boiler room, partially flooding it.

500|$|Trauma or illness {{may also}} {{result in a}} cow unable to rise to its feet. [...] Such animals are {{sometimes}} called [...] "downers." [...] Sometimes this {{occurs as a result}} of muscle and nerve damage from calving or a disease such as mastitis. [...] Leg injuries, muscle tears, or a massive infection of some sort may also be causes. Downer cows are encouraged to get to their feet and have a much greater chance of recovery if they do. If unable to rise, some have survived—with medical care—as long as 14 days and were ultimately able to get back on their feet. Appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> every three hours, careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of fodder, and access to clean water.|$|E
500|$|... "Dream Scene" [...] is a {{combination}} of segments that Harrison edited together. Along with [...] "Ski-ing", it is the only track on the album that combines Indian and Western music. The song consists of three distinct pieces, the first of which is a meditative section featuring phase-shifted instrumentation such as tabla tarang, harp (swarmandal) and sitar, and singing. The music is delivered via backwards-played tape loops as the vocals pan from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> across the stereo image. The other two pieces include a section comprising Barham's piano and flutes, followed by a trumpet solo, harmonica interspersed with a police siren, and more backwards tape loops. The song fades out with a slowed-down spoken voice over the sound of church bells. Leng notes that [...] "Dream Scene" [...] was recorded several months before Lennon's experimental sound collage [...] "Revolution 9", released on the double album The Beatles.|$|E

When you are out rallying on ice or snow in country like that it is like dancing. From one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side. My dancing background helped my rallying. As soon as I started on gravel I liked it because of that. It was so nice to feel and move the car like that. Sweden, in ice and snow, like ballet!"

500|$|From 1961 onwards, Card and USNS Core {{regularly}} docked in Saigon {{to unload}} heavy artillery, M-113 armored personnel carriers, aircraft, helicopters and ammunition for the South Vietnamese government. The Port of Saigon was situated between the Te and Ben Nghe Canals, {{and was about}} [...] wide from one <b>side</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> To facilitate the arrival of Card and other American ships which pulled into Saigon, the South Vietnamese military often deployed navy vessels to conduct patrols around the port, while the surrounding shores were protected by an elite Army of the Republic of Vietnam ("ARVN") airborne battalion. The port itself was guarded round the clock by South Vietnamese police, as undercover South Vietnamese agents operated across the river in the Thu Thiem area to disrupt Viet Cong activities there. Undeterred by the level of protection which the South Vietnamese government normally afforded to American ships, Tran Hai Phung—commander of the Viet Cong’s Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District—ordered the 65th Special Operations Group to attack USNS Card.|$|E
