5|$|Seventeen months later, Ichigo {{becomes a}} senior in high school. The start of the Lost Agent arc {{describes}} Ichigo's life after he loses his Soul Reaper powers. One day, he meets Kūgo Ginjō, a Fullbringer from the group Xcution. Ginjo offers to replenish Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers in return for helping him and his group to become ordinary humans. With their help, Ichigo unlocks his own Fullbring powers through his Substitute Soul Reaper Badge. However, Ichigo later learns that Ginjo and his ally Shūkurō Tsukishima, a Fullbringer with ability to change people's memories, used him to take Fullbring powers for Xcution's use. Luckily, Rukia transfers the Reiatsu of the Gotei 13's senior officers and other Shinigami through a special sword and restores Ichigo's Soul Reaper powers. Ichigo fights Ginjo with his improved Shinigami powers and during their duel, it is revealed that Ginjo was the first Substitute Soul Reaper. Despite learning the truth, Ichigo resolves to protect everyone (<b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> which Rukia notes has never changed) and kill Ginjo, which he does after a prolonged fight. Though learning from Ginjō that the Soul Society monitor and limit their powers, Ichigo tells the Court Squad that he will continue to fight by their side as he asks for their consent to bury Ginjō.|$|E
500|$|To Bamber's supporters, who {{over the}} years have {{included}} MPs and journalists, he is a victim of one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice. The Guardian took up his case at one point. One or more Guardian journalists began corresponding with him in 2006, and two interviewed him in 2011. Describing him as [...] "clever and strategic", they wrote that there was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that made the public unsympathetic toward him. He was [...] "handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way—he seemed to exude arrogance and indifference.... Like Meursault in the Camus novel L'Etranger, he did not seem to display the appropriate emotions." [...] He is reported to have passed a lie detector test in 2007.|$|E
500|$|He lived a frugal existence, {{his only}} source of income being a £20-a-week {{retainer}} he received from Island Records (...) [...] At one point he could not afford {{a new pair of}} shoes. He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, once saw him on a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed. [...] "There was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He's too successful," [...] said Macchiavelli, playfully. [...] "I'm sure there's <b>something</b> wrong <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> else he wouldn't {{have that}} secretaryship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I wouldn't {{say he was}} exactly... {{but there}} was {{something}} queer... there was <b>something</b> uncanny <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> I'll tell you my opinion...." ...|$|R
500|$|Jaya Bachchan as Nandini Raichand, Yash's wife. She {{shares a}} close bond with her sons but {{remains in the}} shadow of her husband. According to Karan Johar, Jaya Bachchan was the [...] "obvious" [...] choice for the {{character}} of Nandini, and added that her [...] "acting prowess and stature" [...] were the other reasons for him preferring to cast her. The film also marked the return of Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan together on screen after a gap of 18 years. Of her character, she said that Nandini was an extension of her own self. She elaborated, [...] "My personal feelings towards Shah Rukh are similar to what I was supposed to portray in the film. There's <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that makes me want to mother him." [...] She added that she modelled her character on Karan's mother, Hiroo Johar, who [...] "is a very emotional and sentimental person." ...|$|E
2500|$|.....besides {{doing his}} work with the Government, {{he spent a lot}} of time with us. He visited the Nursery School and all the {{children}} called him Uncle Gandhi. At six o'clock each morning, after his prayers, he took his walk along the canal, talking to workmen on the way.... There was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that always lives with the people.|$|E
2500|$|Noble's {{style is}} {{recognized}} as spontaneous, due to his unpredictable performance style, interruptions from hecklers or because he has drifted off into another surreal conversation. During his shows he is known to dabble onto one topic, ask {{a member of the}} audience <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> or herself and use that as material, and carry on with that, and later on seems to forget about, digressing into another topic. Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded {{at the end of his}} shows. His most famous example is in his Randomist tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after Live 8 near the beginning of a show in Newcastle, which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later. This relates to an earlier comment he made in his Regent's Park show, saying that his mind [...] "Tends to wander off [...] slightly", and later added that [...] " [...] can open up too many tangents at once... it's a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities." [...] At which point, he forgot what he was talking about.|$|E
5000|$|... "There's <b>something</b> tragic <b>about</b> <b>him....</b> His {{work would}} have a lot more nuance if he were able to see the {{situations}} he's writing about." ...|$|R
60|$|Henchard {{stood as}} if idiotized. She was so alarmed at his silence that she murmured <b>something</b> <b>about</b> lending <b>him</b> {{sufficient}} money to tide over the perilous fortnight.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so {{that was}} Cromwell Biron," [...] she said with studied carelessness. [...] "I thought there was <b>something</b> {{familiar}} <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> When did he come home?" ...|$|R
60|$|Dick {{nodded and}} {{felt that he was}} being quietly studied. It was obvious that Sanders knew <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|This sort {{of thing}} was always {{happening}} to Lord Dawlish. There was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> some atmosphere of unaffected kindliness, that invited it.|$|E
6000|$|... "We had <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> {{at school}} too. I think I {{remember}} the name. I {{think we ought}} to have ALL the American poets." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ("They're {{just by the}} wardrobe"), said Mrs Mendham. [...] "He {{always was}} a little queer, you know. There was always <b>something</b> childish <b>about</b> <b>him....</b> An Angel!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not," [...] replied Kells, passionately, {{as if his}} manhood {{had been}} affronted. [...] "It's because he's Gulden. There's <b>something</b> uncanny <b>about</b> <b>him....</b> Gulden's a cannibal!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{think he}} heard me breathe. He turned suddenly: his {{temperament}} was nervous, yet he never started, and seldom changed colour: there was <b>something</b> hardy <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{trail through}} the woods used {{to lead to the}} village of Hopdale," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps I'll learn <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> over there." ...|$|E
60|$|Lisle {{thought that}} she had a request to make. There was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that {{inspired}} confidence, and the girl had made a friend of him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are so extreme," [...] she protested. [...] "Of {{course you}} know <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> What am I to tell people? They will {{be sure to}} ask." ...|$|E
50|$|Patrick O'Leary {{is one of}} Gwen's {{teachers}} at the school. There seems to be <b>something</b> sinister <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> but he is actually Gwen's father. (portrayed by Don Halbert).|$|R
50|$|Chen {{testified that}} {{shortly before the}} {{incident}} he heard his name mentioned by colleagues. Hiroshima police believe he may have misunderstood colleagues, thinking they said <b>something</b> negative <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But he was {{not entirely}} forgotten. Elsie, from her studio door, kept close watch upon him. [...] "There's <b>something</b> fine <b>about</b> <b>him</b> after all," [...] she said to Curtis.|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't {{you think}} we ought to do <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him?</b> He's only got ten pounds between him and the workhouse. And if you'd seen the black-beetles in his basement!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is asleep}} now, {{but he has}} been very restless, and there is <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> I don't like. Did not Worth say he would come and look at the baby?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This Crowden {{was very}} {{friendly}} {{with one or}} two of the men around the stables," [...] went on the hotelkeeper. [...] "Maybe you can find out <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> from them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say," [...] said Rangely, as {{they drove}} away, [...] "he {{strikes me as a}} remarkably sound chap, Miss Flint. There is <b>something</b> unusual <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> <b>something</b> clean cut." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The man had <b>something</b> queer <b>about</b> <b>him.</b> Besides Derek's been ill, don't forget that. But it's {{too bad for}} you, Nedda. I don't like it; I don't like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll have {{to think}} <b>something</b> {{particular}} <b>about</b> <b>him</b> as he {{is a sort of}} child of the house. Papa was his guardian, and he comes here just when he pleases." ...|$|R
60|$|Somehow, {{despite the}} courteous words and {{attitude}} of Captain Carg, there was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that repelled confidence. Already Maud and Patsy were wondering {{if such a}} man could be loyal and true.|$|E
60|$|She {{had meant}} to tell Mr. Dutton {{that it was all}} her father's selfishness, but somehow she could not say so, there was <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that {{hindered}} all unbefitting outbreaks of vexation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid Lise {{has gone}} away with him," [...] said Janet. [...] "I {{thought you might}} be able to find out <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> and--whether any one had seen them. She left home {{yesterday}} morning." ...|$|E
60|$|My dear lady, {{when a man}} has had {{to leave}} his club because he plays cards too well, it's at least {{permissible}} to suppose that there's <b>something</b> odd <b>about</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Phil, [...] "I {{like your}} rector, {{in spite of}} his anthropomorphism--perhaps, as George would say, because of it. There is <b>something</b> manly <b>about</b> <b>him</b> that appeals to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay,' he said, unmoved. 'All that.' He was uneasy before her. Only he was {{not afraid}} of her. There was <b>something</b> impenetrable <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> like his eyes, which were as bright as agate.|$|R
