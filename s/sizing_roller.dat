25|$|Several <b>size</b> <b>rollers</b> {{have been}} used in the history of cricket, from light rollers that were used in the days of {{uncovered}} pitches and at some stages during the 1950s to make batting less easy, to the modern “heavy roller” universally used in top-class cricket today. Regulations permit a pitch only to be rolled at the commencement of each innings or day’s play, but this has still had a massive influence on the game by eliminating the shooters that were ubiquitous on all but light soils before heavy rollers were used. Heavy rollers have sometimes been criticised for making batting too easy and for reducing the rate at which pitches dry out after rain in the cool English climate.|$|R

This project is concerned with the automation of the manufacture of these rollers. After reviewing the various methods that could be used to cut a series of grooves into the roller shell, the aim of the project was to develop a device or machine which will automate part of the manufacture of the roller shells. Speci¯cally, the design was to meet the following requirements: - Able to handle a typical <b>sized</b> <b>roller</b> and most if not all of the <b>roller</b> <b>sizes</b> used. - Able to complete assigned operations at an equivalent production rate as current processes employed, or better. - Able to sense roller position and status and then determine the appropriate course of action. - Able to operated safely by non-technical personnel.

In this thesis, I investigate the use of auctions, a type of market-based methods, as a decentralized resource allocation approach. Agents in auctions individually submit bids that provide critical information, including agents’ private value for resources, for prioritizing resource allocation. Three issues must be addressed for wider acceptance of using auctions. First, I present empirical data of a deployed market-based resource allocator, called Mirage, for allocating sensor network resources. The data provides observations of agent bidding patterns, which varied across values, sizes, and allocation timing. Furthermore, agents exhibited strategic behaviors that validate the need to mitigate such behaviors, which create complexity for both agents and system administrators. Second, I design Roller, an online mechanism that is strategyproof with respect to agents’ submitted values and resource <b>sizes.</b> <b>Roller</b> is also configurable and able to provide different tradeoffs in regard to mis-reports of allocation timing.

40|$|Roller {{compaction}} is the densification of dry powders into a solid mass (compact). This {{densification process}} {{is achieved by}} controlled feeding of powder {{through a set of}} directly opposed, counter-rotating rollers with a controllable aperture (roller gap) between the rollers. The feed powder is passed through the rolls with the flow being induced by the friction acting at the surfaces of the rolls. In the narrow region of the gap between the rolls, the powder is subjected to high pressure, leading to the formation of a compact or briquette that is reduced in size by milling or screening to achieve the desired granule <b>size.</b> <b>Roller</b> compaction is designed to increase the bulk density and uniformity of particulate formulations, for example, to prevent the segregation of pharmaceutical drugs. It offers advantages compared with wet granulation for processing physically or chemically moisture-sensitive materials since the use of a liquid binder is not required. Another advantage {{is that it does not}} require a drying stage and therefore it is suitable for compounds that either have a low melting point or degrade rapidly upon heating [2, 3, 4, 5]...|$|R

It {{is important to}} understand bearing failure in order to replace a bearing before it affects the quality of precision. Bearing failure appears as a run-out in some applications, which is a critical factor for precision. However, previous studies have only focused on failure mechanisms, such as spalling. In this study, two types of wear models were used to predict the thrust bearings run-out: Linear and non-linear mechanisms. In order to validate the models, wear experiments of cross roller thrust bearings were performed. The average difference between the experiment and simulation run-out result was 16 %.

40|$|The {{application}} of peel tests for {{the measurement of}} adhesive fracture toughness of metal-polymer laminates is reviewed and the merits of a mandrel peel method are highlighted. The mandrel method enables a direct experimental determination of both adhesive fracture toughness (GA) and the plastic bending energy (GP) during peel, whilst other approaches require a complex calculation for GP. In this method, the peel arm is bent around a circular roller {{in order to develop}} a peel crack and an alignment load attempts to ensure that the peel arm conforms to the roller. The conditions for peel arm conformance are thoroughly investigated and the theoretical basis for conformation are established. Experimental investigations involve the study of the <b>roller</b> <b>size</b> (radii in the range 5 – 20 mm are used), the peel arm thickness (varied from 0. 635 to 2. 0 mm) and the magnitude of the alignment load. In addition, the plane of fracture is studied since fractures can vary from cohesive to interfacial and this has a profound influence on the value of GA and on interpretation of results. A test protocol for conducting mandrel peel is developed such that the <b>roller</b> <b>size</b> for peel arm conformance can be established from preliminary fixed arm peel tests. The work is conducted on two epoxy/aluminium alloy laminates suitable for aerospace applications. Comparative results of adhesive fracture toughness from mandrel peel and multi-angle fixed arm peel are made with cohesive fracture toughness from a tapered double cantilever beam test...|$|R
50|$|These are the {{standard}} form in modern installations, occasionally called vertical spindle mills. In a typical arrangement, {{the material is}} fed onto a rotating table, onto which steel rollers press down. A high velocity of hot gas flow is maintained close to the dish so that fine particles are swept away {{as soon as they}} are produced. The gas flow carries the fines into an integral air separator, which returns larger particles to the grinding path. The fine material is swept out in the exhaust gas and is captured by a cyclone before being pumped to storage. The remaining dusty gas is usually returned to the main kiln dust control equipment for cleaning. Feed size can be up to 100 mm. Roller mills are efficient, using about half the energy of a ball mill, {{and there seems to be}} no limit to the <b>size</b> available. <b>Roller</b> mills with output in excess of 800 tonnes per hour have been installed.

The first grass boxes were flat trays but took their present shape in the 1860s. James Sumner of Lancashire patented the first steam-powered lawn mower in 1893. His machine burned petrol and/or paraffin (kerosene) as fuel. These were heavy machines that took several hours to warm up to operating pressure.

30|$|A certain pre-pressure {{is applied}} on the sensor by an {{interference}} fit manner to keep the sensor working in the linearity range [96]. In fact, a certain temperature difference and thermal deformation difference exist between the outer surface of the detection roller and the internal sensor in the rolling process, and these differences may weaken or reduce the magnitude of interference and pre-pressure between sensors and the inner wall of through-holes, resulting in detection signal distortion. Therefore, the assembly of sensors must have an adequate magnitude of interference and pre-pressure. To solve the problem, the temperature field, thermal deformation, and pressure transfer of the detection roller and sensors in the rolling process were simulated with the finite element software. The structure <b>size</b> of the <b>roller</b> and the magnitude of interference were optimized according to the simulation results [97, 98].|$|R
50|$|At {{the same}} time, Look {{introduced}} their Grand Prix heel binding. This was essentially {{one half of}} a Nevada system, turned sideways so it released vertically instead of to the sides. With cable bindings the heel was normally held down by looping the cable over the heel or cupped it in a semi-circular indentation {{on the back of}} the heel. To fit these different styles of binding points, and the fact that the boots had no standardized size or shape, the rotating portion of the Grand Prix was mounted on a bracket that lifted it above the heel flange, allowing the user to adjust its height. The actual binding point was a bronze <b>roller</b> <b>sized</b> to be similar to a standard cable, this could clip on top of the heel, or would fit into the indentation cut into the heel of some boots.|$|R
30|$|Conventional {{spinning}} is a single-roller spinning process. Because {{only one}} roller is used, {{one side of}} the sheet metal bears severe asymmetrical spinning force, which can easily cause wrinkling. And point contact between the single roller and sheet metal causes very small plastic deformation after each spinning pass, which leads to more spinning passes and low production efficiency. Furthermore, conventional single-roller spinning requires the use of different <b>sizes</b> of <b>rollers</b> for different materials, shapes, and sizes of spun parts. These rollers have complex surface profiles, terrible stress conditions, low life cycled, and high manufacturing costs. In contrast, the new DRCS process uses two cylinder rollers with simple shapes and low costs to symmetrically clamp the sheet metal which bears compressive stress. Because there is sufficient pressure in the thickness direction, {{it is not easy to}} cause sheet wrinkling, and the spun parts have high dimensional accuracy. In contrast with conventional spinning, the DRCS process involves line contact between the rollers and sheet metal. Thus, the loading action area is larger than that in conventional spinning, and the plastic deformation in each spinning pass is larger. Consequently spinning efficiency is higher. In addition, in the DRCS process, the shape of the final parts is determined by the roller path, not by the profile of the mandrel, which is different from conventional spinning processes. That is, DRCS is a dieless, flexible spinning process that can be used to produce a variety of shapes of flanges, including rectangular flanges.|$|R

According to the expected motions, cams are put to use in various applications in mechanism. For a cylindrical cam, the roller follower operates in a groove cut {{on the periphery of}} an end mill with the diameter same as the roller. By using the conventional method, full-sized cutting tools, will restrict the flexibility of choosing cutting tools for wide roller guide. The manufacture of cylindrical cams is complicate and precise work that depends on the generating method and types of machine tools employed. Since the guiding curve cannot be offset exactly along the cylindrical surface, this leads to some approximating problems.

In Experiment 1, participants discriminated edge sharpness under force-alone and force-plus-contact-location conditions using a 4. 8 mm radius contact roller. Virtual objects were 2 D profiles of edges with two adjoining surfaces. For both conditions, the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) in change of edge radius increased from 2. 3 to 7. 4 mm as edge radii increased from 2. 5 to 20. 0 mm; {{there was no significant}} difference between the two conditions. A follow-up experiment with contact location alone resulted in higher edge sharpness JNDs. In Experiment 2, the same edge sharpness discrimination task was performed using a smaller contact roller (R = 1. 5 mm) to investigate the effect of <b>roller</b> <b>size.</b> The JNDs for the smaller roller were not statistically significant from those of the larger roller. Our results suggest that 1) contact location cues alone are capable of conveying edge sharpness information, but that force cues are dominant when both types of cues are available; and 2) the radius of the contact roller does not significantly affect the user’s ability to discriminate edge sharpness, indicating that the participants could use the changes in contact location to judge curvature.

Vibration based condition monitoring is the most common method for extracting some important information to identify bearing defects. However, acquired acceleration signals are usually noisy, which significantly affects the results of fault diagnosis. Wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) is a powerful method utilized effectively for the denoising of the signals acquired. Furthermore, Ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is a newly developed decomposition method to solve the mode mixing problem of empirical mode decomposi- tion (EMD), which is a consequence of signal intermittence. In this study a combined automatic method is proposed to detect very small defects on roller bearings. WPD is applied to clean the noisy signals acquired, then informative feature vectors are extracted using the EEMD technique. Finally, the states of the bearings are examined by labeling the samples using the hyperplane constructed by the support vector machine algorithm.

The optical {{intensity}} {{signals from}} surf zone waves {{in a laboratory}} flume are analyzed using several different phase-averaging techniques, and a methodology is developed for estimating wave roller lengths and local wave dissipation. The intensity signals (i. e., phase-averaged intensity profiles) of individual breaking waves are compared with the wave profiles measured by in situ wave gauges, and the optical signal of the wave roller is shown to ramp up from the toe of the wave roller on the front face of the wave to a maximum intensity at the wave crest. The remote sensing observations capture the growth, equilibrium, and decay phases of the roller as it propagates over a fixed bed arranged in a bar/trough morphology. Next, for the regular wave conditions considered here, the local maxima of the phase-averaged intensities are shown to better indicate the initial onset of wave breaking and the occurrence of wave breaking in the bar trough, {{as compared to the}} more commonly used time-averaged mean intensity. In addition, the phase-averaged profiles are used to measure the <b>size</b> of the <b>roller,</b> and these measurements are compared to previous observations of smaller-scale rollers in equilibrium. The observed roller lengths are shown to agree with predictions from a wave roller model and to provide a new physical link between the remotely sensed signal and roller dissipation. Finally, as an example application of these new data, a simple wave height inversion model is presented that allows an estimation of surf zone wave heights from the remotely sensed roller lengths...|$|R
5000|$|Turtles - The Turtles ride on tank treads {{to serve}} as {{transportation}} for First Squad and Second Squad when {{they were the first}} animals to join Big Green. They are classified as Hero 075. Some turtles are often seen wearing cannons on their backs. The Turtles come in different sizes from tank size to the <b>size</b> of <b>roller</b> skates. The Turtle King {{is the head of the}} Turtles and does not like it when the other Turtles are bullied by anyone like the time when Mighty Ray insulted his Turtle for being too fat causing the other Turtles to attack him with their cannons as seen in [...] "Rhino Castle". When Mr. No Hands asks, Turtle King states that [...] "when a turtle is hurt by a friend, the pain of the betrayal gives a tear strength to travel many miles, then the Turtles will always rush to the aid of a crying comrade." [...] When not transporting First Squad to the scene where Commander ApeTrully is in trouble, they are often used in the Turtle Cannon Competitions between First Squad and Second Squad. In [...] "Big Baby Turtles", the turtles associated with First Squad get exhausted while pursuing the Zebra Brothers after they stole the Owl Amulet from the Owls. First Squad decide to give the Turtles a vacation, but they run away from Big Green upon mishearing First Squad. The Turtles find the Zebra Brothers enabling them to give HighRoller and Twin Masters the idea to use the Owl Amulet's powers to turn the Turtles into their monstrous forms complete with fire-breathing abilities. High Roller and the Zebra Brothers disguise themselves as members of First Squad in order to trick the monstrous Turtles. Due to Mighty Ray having eaten a turtle egg at that time, he slowly turned into a Turtle causing First Squad to call in Kowloon to cover for Mighty Ray. When the monstrous Turtles attack a village, First Squad and Kowloon had to fight them. With the help of Mighty Ray's turtle form, First Squad and Kowloon had to reason with the monstrous Turtles. HighRoller attacked Mighty Ray enough for him to spit out the egg he swallowed from which a baby turtle hatched from and saw Mighty Ray as its mother. The monstrous Turtles then turn against HighRoller after he caused the baby turtle to fall on its back while attacking Ray. Lin Chung destroys the Owl Amulet breaking the spell on them.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} rolling contact on the {{microstructure}} of case carburized bearing steel {{have been studied}} experimentally, and the results examined, along with {{a review of the}} current literature and theories which are used to explain the observed phenomena. ^ All experimental work utilized tapered rollers from 6. 5 x 12 tapered roller bearings as used in the rail industry. Retained austenite, residual stress, texture and particle <b>size</b> at the <b>roller</b> surface were measured using X-ray diffraction technique. These parameters along with hardness and microstructure were also studied as a function of load-miles on new rollers, and profiles in addition these same parameters were measured as a function of depth in the case carburized layer of several samples. These characteristics were also studied {{as a function of the}} finish grinding operation, and rollers returned from long service were annealed in order to study the extent to which the changes were related to reversible processes. With all studies, whenever possible, measurements were carried out sequentially and at the same location on the rollers. ^ Results of this research has shown that the retained austenite decreases at the surface with service mileage and load, and the residual stresses in the martensite and austenite phases become more compressive. Texture and particle size measurements along with the annealing behavior of the rollers indicated that the most significant contribution to the residual stress is from the transformation of austenite to martensite, although there is evidence that work hardening of austenite is occurring. There appears to be an early limit for most of the transformation of austenite to martensite which appears to be due to the fact that the austenite has become strengthened which then makes further transformation difficult. The behavior of the retained austenite is further classified according to three stages known as shake down, steady state and unstable. ...|$|R
5000|$|At a high-level, the {{multimachine}} {{is built}} using vehicle engine blocks combined in a LEGO-like fashion. It utilizes the cylinder bores and engine deck to provide accurate surfaces. Since cylinder bores are bored exactly parallel {{to each other}} and at exact right angles to the cylinder head surface, multimachine accuracy begins at the factory where the engine block was built. In the most common version of the multimachine, one that has a roller bearing spindle, this precision is maintained during construction with simple cylinder re-boring of the #3 cylinder to the <b>size</b> of the <b>roller</b> bearing outside diameter (OD) and re-boring the #1 cylinder to fit the overarm OD. These cylinder-boring operations can be done in almost any engine shop and at low cost. An engine machine shop provides the most inexpensive and accurate machine work commonly done anywhere and guarantees that the spindle and overarm will be perfectly aligned and at an exact right angle to the face (head surface) of the main engine block that serves as the base of the machine. Use a piece of pipe made to fit the inner diameter of the bearings as the spindle. A three-bearing spindle is used because the [...] "main" [...] spindle bearings just [...] "float" [...] in the cylinder bore so that the third bearing is needed to [...] "locate" [...] the spindle, act as a thrust bearing, and support the heavy pulley. The multimachine uses a unique way of clamping the engine blocks together that is easily built, easily adjusted, and very accurate. The multimachine makes use of a concrete and steel construction technique that was heavily used in industry during the First World War and resurrected for this project.|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} the working rollers used for rolling rails of {{different}} profiles {{is determined by the}} chemical and structural composition of the material of the rollers and the production technology The requirements for the quality cannot be ensured without a perfect knowledge of the course of the solidification, the cooling and the heat treatment of the cast rollers as well as the kinetics of the temperature field of the casting and the mould. The solidification and cooling of the ductile-cast-iron roller in metal and non-metal moulds is a very complicated problem of heat and mass transfer with the phase and structural changes described by the Fourier equation. An original application of ANSYS simulated the forming of the temperature field of the entire system, comprising the casting, the mold and the ambient. The simulation of the release of the latent heats of the phase or structural changes is carried out by introducing the thermodynamic enthalpy function. In the experimental investigation of the temperature field, an original methodology for the measurement of the distribution of temperatures and heat flows in the roller-mould system had been developed and verified in operation. In the design of the original procedure, {{there were a number of}} problems connected with the large <b>size</b> of the <b>roller</b> and the mould, the uneven dimensional changes of the solidifying roller and the mould, the installation and the insulation of the thermocouples, the wiring of the thermocouple system, etc. The findings regarding the kinetics of the temperature field of the roller and the mould, obtained from experimental research, were used to determine the boundary conditions and for the verification of the numerical simulation program. The calculation of the temperature field focused on an analysis of the effect of the mould separator on the course of the solidification of the roller. The results of the mathematical modelling indicate that the distribution of the temperatures and the solidification in the vertical direction is significantly uneven – and this has an effect on the internal {{quality of the}} casting.

40|$|Planetary roller drives (PRD) with axial {{backlash}} {{have the highest}} load capacity amongst the prospective roller drives. PRD consists of a screw and a nut, between which thread rolls are installed in separators, force calculation of which is sufficient to assess the PRD force loading. For several reasons, the load is unevenly distributed between the roll turns operating with the screw and nut turns. These include <b>rollers</b> <b>size</b> variation by the average diameter of their thread, PRD parts' thread manufacturing errors, primarily thread pitch errors, and other reasons. The article discusses one of them – a special feature of thread roll loading. If we neglect the circumferential forces due to their smallness, then the roll's turns mating with the nut along one of the roll's generatrices and the roll turns mating with the screw along the opposite generatrix will be loaded with axial and radial forces. Since the PRD parts thread turn flank angle is symmetrical and equal to 90 °, then the radial force {{is equal to the}} axial one on each turn. If we sum the axial forces on the mating roll turns along one of the generatrices, then from the equation of equilibrium one gets that the sum vector value is equal to the sum vector value along the other roll generatrix. Here the sum vectors will have the opposite direction, and the arm between them equals to the average roll thread diameter. Multiplying the sum vector modulus by that arm, one gets the roll overturning moment that does not depend on the distribution of the axial forces along the roll axis. This moment is the cause of uneven load distribution between the roll turns mating with the nut and the screw. The overturning moment can be balanced on the two forming roll generatrices only by radial forces, distribution of which along the roll axis will be uneven. The PRD parts thread turns load distribution irregularity factor is introduced as the ratio of the maximum force acting on the most loaded roll turn to a nominal force. It is determined in the example that the value of this factor is equal to 1. 454 or 45. 4 %, i. e. the influence of the PRD roll loading characteristics on the drive threaded parts turns loading irregularity is strong...|$|R
