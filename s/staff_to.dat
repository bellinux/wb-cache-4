5|$|At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff {{agreed to}} {{establish}} a <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> plan operations in north west Europe in 1944. It was envisaged that the Supreme Allied Commander would be British, and the usual practice was for the commander and the chief of <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> be of the same nationality, so {{it was decided to}} appoint a British officer for the role of chief of <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Allied Commander (Designate) (COSSAC), with an American deputy. In March 1943 Morgan became COSSAC. Brigadier General Ray Barker became his American deputy. Initially, Morgan's staff consisted of an aide, two batmen and a driver with a car purloined from I Corps headquarters. Morgan established his headquarters in Norfolk House at 31 St James's Square. However, by October 1943, it was clearly too small for COSSAC needs, which called for accommodation for a staff of 320 officers and 600 other ranks. In November and December part of the staff moved to the South Rotunda, a bombproof structure that had originally been fitted up as an anti-invasion base, which was connected to the various ministries by the Whitehall Tunnel. Other staff were accommodated at 80 Pall Mall.|$|E

5|$|The {{outside of}} the mantle may be any color, {{typically}} red, while the inside is white or sometimes yellow to distinguish it from a secular mantle. David Johnson suggested that the mantle of all bishops should be white inside, excepting only patriarchs who use ermine, to indicate that all bishops are equally bishops.

The earliest examples of the arms of Orthodox hierarchs have the cross to the dexter of the mitre and the bishop's <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> sinister, but opposite examples exist. An abbot (archimandrite or hegumen) should display a veiled abbot's <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> distinguish it from the bishop's staff.|$|E
