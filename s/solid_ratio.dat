Experimental {{data show that}} when the vitamins B content in the defatted extract reached 0. 63 % (wt), the extract was healthy. The effects of the solvent to <b>solid</b> <b>ratio</b> and the extraction time on the total yield, extraction efficiency, purification factor and purity of vitamins B in the extract were also determined. A two-factor center composite response surface method was adopted to optimize the condition for ultrasonic water extraction. Both parameters are important. The solvent to <b>solid</b> <b>ratio</b> has a greater influence on total yield than the extraction time. However, the extraction time {{is the most important}} in increasing the efficiency of extraction of vitamins B. Given an appropriate solvent to <b>solid</b> <b>ratio,</b> the vitamins B content in the defatted rice bran extract increased substantially with extraction time, exceeding that of the raw rice bran extract. Ultrasonic water extraction at a solvent to <b>solid</b> <b>ratio</b> of 10. 0 at 323 K for 1. 5 h yields a vitamin B content of 0. 63 %, a purification factor of 4. 55 and a recovery rate of vitamins B of 92. 8 % in the dried defatted rice bran extract...|$|E

40|$|AbstractCarbon dioxide {{capture and}} storage by {{mineralization}} (CCSM), {{also known as}} ex-situ mineralization, is an important technology for industrial CCS. The integration of CO 2 capture using aqueous ammonia with ex-situ mineralisation avoids stripping CO 2 as pure gas from absorbents and compression of c, and therefore, potentially reduces the high energy consumption of capture. It {{was found that the}} <b>solid</b> liquid <b>ratio</b> has a large influence on the energy consumption cost. Therefore, in this study, two different <b>solid</b> liquid <b>ratios</b> values were used for evaluating the OPEX in terms of energy consumption, chemical costs and feedstock cost.

Using low <b>solid</b> to liquid <b>ratio</b> (50 g/l) resulted in large streams in the process, and thus resulting in a high energy consumption.

The {{effects of}} various {{factors such as}} time (t), temperature (T), ultrasound power (I), particle size (S), solvent to <b>solid</b> <b>ratio</b> (R) and solvent concentration (C) on the yield of target components were investigated. The experimental results indicated that the extraction by UAE is six times faster than those by conventional thermal extraction. It is also found that fast extraction rate was obtained in the first 30 min of sonication. Prolonged sonication did not give a proportional increase in the yield. For the effect of ultrasound power, the maximum yield was obtained at the power level of around 21 W.

Bacteria agglomerate as settleable robust aggregates leading to low organic matter and turbidity final effluents. However, when the operating conditions are not perfect some malfunctions may occur leading to bulking problems. Classical methods to survey the bacteria aggregation and contents resided on manual counting which are, rather tiring, imprecise and time-consuming urging the development of faster automated image analysis methods. Therefore, the prime objective of this work resided on surveying the activated sludge filamentous bacteria and aggregates contents and morphology, and establish relationships between the biomass and some operating parameters by multivariable statistical techniques.
