50|$|Rosco Sweeney, who was Sawyer's comic-relief sidekick, was {{the lead}} {{character}} of the Buz Sawyer Sunday strip, a comedy about rural and suburban life. Sweeney largely disappeared from the dailies after World War II. Beginning in the late 1940s, Crane assigned the writing and drawing chores for the Sunday strip to cartoonist Clark Haas, who was a pioneer jet pilot. Later, Al Wenzel did the Sunday <b>strip,</b> which <b>Crane</b> brought to a conclusion on May 19, 1974.|$|R
5000|$|The entire 1924-43 run of <b>Crane’s</b> <b>strip</b> was {{reprinted in}} Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy, an 18-volume series with biographical and {{historical}} commentary by Bill Blackbeard and design by Bhob Stewart.

50|$|In {{the middle}} of 1949, Win Mortimer took over the daily strip from Wayne Boring. Stan Kaye {{continued}} inking Mortimer’s work until Kaye temporarily left, and Mortimer inked his own work until he left DC in 1956 to publish his David <b>Crane</b> <b>strip.</b> Curt Swan took over the daily strip on June 18, 1956, along with Stan Kaye. Swan continued on the strip until November 12, 1960.|$|R

50|$|The Tubbs and Easy {{characters}} were {{owned by the}} Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate. Crane left that syndicate and abandoned the strips in 1943 to begin Buz Sawyer, a strip he would own outright. After Crane’s departure, control of the <b>strips</b> passed to <b>Crane’s</b> assistant, Leslie Turner, who had worked on Captain Easy, Soldier of Fortune since 1937. With Tubbs an increasingly unimportant character, Turner officially renamed the daily and Sunday strips Captain Easy in 1949.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} has a {{steel and}} timber mezzanine {{floor and the}} ceiling is lined with fibrous cement sheeting and timber cover <b>strips.</b> The travelling <b>crane</b> survives complete with ropes and pulleys. It runs north to south on steel rails supported on corbelled brickwork and intermittently {{by a series of}} engaged piers. The face brickwork is variously painted and unpainted and a number of remnant openings and brackets provide evidence of the building's previous function.|$|R
5000|$|Roy Crane {{was one of}} the innovators of the {{adventure}} comic strip. Wash Tubbs began in 1924 as a humorous story about the romantic adventures of Washington Tubbs, but increasingly Tubbs became involved in exciting adventures in exotic places. With the creation of the popular soldier of fortune Captain Easy in 1929, the strip became, along with Tarzan of the Apes and Buck Rogers, one of the first adventure <b>strips.</b> However, <b>Crane</b> was an employee of the Newspaper Enterprise Association syndicate, which owned the rights to the Tubbs and Easy characters. Crane approached King Features with an idea for a new strip, and when they offered him ownership, he abandoned Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy in 1943, giving full concentration to launching Buz Sawyer. Crane remembered the events this way: ...|$|R
5000|$|Mortimer {{began working}} for DC Comics in 1945, and {{quickly became a}} cover artist for comics {{featuring}} Superman, Superboy and Batman. His first known comics work is as the penciler and inker of the 12-page lead Batman story, [...] "The Batman Goes Broke" [...] by writer Don Cameron, in Detective Comics #105 (Nov. 1945); contractually credited to Bob Kane, it is also signed [...] "Mortimer." [...] The introduction of Batman's Batboat in Detective Comics #110 (April 1946) was another Cameron/Mortimer collaboration. Mortimer launched a Robin feature in Star-Spangled Comics #65 (Feb. 1947).He succeeded Wayne Boring on the Superman newspaper strip in 1949, leaving it in 1956 to create the adventure <b>strip</b> David <b>Crane</b> for the Prentice-Hall Syndicate. Following his run on that series, Mortimer produced the Larry Bannon strip for the Toronto Star beginning in 1960.|$|R
5000|$|Almost {{the entire}} 1924-43 run of <b>Crane’s</b> <b>strip</b> was reprinted in Wash Tubbs and Captain Easy, an 18-volume {{black-and-white}} series featuring biographical and historical commentary by Bill Blackbeard. With production, design and strip restoration by Bhob Stewart, this series {{was published by}} NBM Publishing (Nantier, Beall, Minoustchine) on a quarterly schedule from 1987 to 1992. Fantagraphics Books has reprinted all of the Captain Easy Sundays by Roy Crane in color, in four volumes edited by Rick Norwood.

50|$|Theresa, {{convinced}} {{that it was only}} a momentary setback, stood by Ethan after he was <b>stripped</b> of all <b>Crane</b> rights and privileges, as he struggled to learn who had outed him to the tabloids, but she never revealed that she had known before the newspaper had created the scandal, nor did she suspect Gwen and Rebecca were to blame until much later. That summer, desperate to prevent Theresa and Ethan's wedding, Gwen once again contacted the tabloid and told them that the information had come from Theresa's computer, implying that Theresa, rather than Gwen and her mother, {{was the one who had}} revealed Ethan's true paternity.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} Superman {{stories were}} written by Siegel, and drawn by Shuster in a style heavily influenced by comic <b>strip</b> artist Roy <b>Crane.</b> According to Jules Feiffer, [...] "Shuster represented the best of old-style comic book drawing. His work was direct, unprettied - crude and vigorous; as easy to read as a diagram.... Slickness, thank God, was beyond his means" [...] (Feiffer,The Great Comic Book Heroes, 1965). In the last interview Shuster gave before his death, {{he explained that he}} had modeled the visual appearance of Clark Kent on himself and movie star Harold Lloyd, and that of Superman on Douglas Fairbanks Senior. Lois Lane was modeled after Joanne Carter, who would later marry Jerry Siegel after the comic became a success. The skyscape of Metropolis was inspired by that of the city of Toronto, where Shuster had spent most of his childhood, and the newspaper employing Clark Kent, originally the Daily Star, was named after the Toronto Star for which Shuster had been a paperboy.
