Methodology: Blood was cultured {{as part of a}} microbiological prospective surveillance study. Identification of Salmonella isolates was performed by conventional methods and serotyping. Antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed using disk diffusion, MicroScan and E-test macromethod. Clonal relationships were assessed by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis; PCR and sequencing for detection of mutations in Gyrase and Topoisomerase IV and presence of qnr genes. Principal Findings: Seventy-two Salmonella isolates grew from 58 patients (mean age 34. 2 years, range 8 – 71). Twenty isolates were identified as Salmonella Typhi, 2 as Salmonella Paratyphi A, 37 as Salmonella Choleraesuis and 13 as other non-typhoid Salmonella spp. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was present in 21 of 24 (87. 5 %) patients with S.

40|$|Background A high {{proportion}} of children with persistent diarrhoea in middle and low income countries die. The best treatment is not clear. We conducted a systematic review {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of antimicrobial drug treatment for persistent diarrhoea of unknown or non-specific cause. Methods We included randomized comparisons of antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of persistent diarrhoea of unknown or non-specific cause in children under the age of six years in low and middle income countries. We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, WEB OF SCIENCE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to May 2008 for relevant randomized or quasi randomized controlled trials. We summarised the characteristics of the eligible trials, assessed their quality using standard criteria, and extracted relevant outcomes data. Where appropriate, we combined the results of different trials. Results Three trials from South East Asia and one from Guatemala were included, all were small, and three had adequate allocation concealment. Two were in patients with diarrhoea of unknown cause, and two were in patients in whom known bacterial or parasitological causes of diarrhoea had been excluded. No difference was demonstrated for oral gentamicin compared with placebo (presence of diarrhoea at 6 or 7 days; 2 trials, n = 151); and for metronidazole compared with placebo (presence of diarrhoea at 3, 5 and 7 days; 1 trial, n = 99). In one small trial, <b>sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim</b> appeared better than placebo in relation to diarrhoea at seven days and total stool volume (n = 55).

40|$|Otitis {{media is}} the {{bacterial}} {{infection of the}} middle ear usually accompanied with inflammation, effusions and pain. It can present clinically in two major forms: Acute Otitis Media (AOM) and Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) and {{it is one of the}} leading cause of hospital visits and antibiotic prescriptions amongst children and even adults. Antibiotic resistance is a global public health problem and Extended Spectrum Î²-Lactamase (ESBL) enzymes is one of the new mechanisms of resistance in especially Gram negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ESBLs are plasmid-mediated Î²-lactamase enzymes that hydrolyze extended-spectrum oxyimino 3 rd generation cephalosporins and monobactams. Organisms producing ESBLs have remained important nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens over the years. Ear swab specimens of children (aged 0 - 7) with suspected Otitis media infections and who attended a tertiary hospital in Enugu, Nigeria were cultured on growth media. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were isolated and identified by standard microbiological techniques. Antibiogram was conducted on all isolated ear pathogens by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and ESBL production was evaluated by the Double Disk Synergy Test (DDST) method. Imipenem and meropenem were the most active antibiotics against the E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa ear pathogens. <b>Sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim</b> was the least active agent against the tested ear pathogens and this was followed by ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime. None of the E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa ear pathogens produced ESBLs by the method used. ESBL production by pathogenic bacteria confers on organisms the ability to be multidrug resistant. Their prompt and accurate detection from clinical specimens, together with reporting them along with hospitals routine antibiogram results is vital as this will help to guide therapy and forestall any treatment failure in the face of an ESBL infection...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSI) cause {{important}} {{morbidity and}} mortality worldwide. In Cambodia, no surveillance data on BSI are available so far. METHODS: From all adults presenting with SIRS at Sihanouk Hospital Centre of HOPE (July 2007 -December 2010), 20 ml blood was cultured. Isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques; antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed using disk diffusion and MicroScan®, with additional E-test, D-test and double disk test where applicable, according to CLSI guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 5714 samples from 4833 adult patients yielded 501 clinically significant organisms (8. 8 %) of which 445 available for further analysis. The patients' median age was 45 years (range 15 - 99 y), 52. 7 % were women. HIV-infection and diabetes were present in 15. 6 % and 8. 8 % of patients respectively. The overall mortality was 22. 5 %. Key pathogens included Escherichia coli (n = 132; 29. 7 %), Salmonella spp. (n = 64; 14. 4 %), Burkholderia pseudomallei (n = 56; 12. 6 %) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 53; 11. 9 %). Methicillin resistance was seen in 10 / 46 (21. 7 %) S. aureus; 4 of them were co-resistant to erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin and <b>sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim</b> (SMX-TMP). We noted combined resistance to amoxicillin, SMX-TMP and ciprofloxacin in 81 E. coli isolates (62. 3 %); 62 isolates (47. 7 %) were confirmed as producers of extended spectrum beta-lactamase. Salmonella isolates displayed high rates of multidrug resistance (71. 2 %) with high rates of decreased ciprofloxacin susceptibility (90. 0 %) in Salmonella Typhi while carbapenem resistance was observed in 5. 0 % of 20 Acinetobacter sp. isolates.

Subsequent microbial analysis of meat paste components and ingredients (fresh meat, water, spices, equipment) identified only the spices used as positive for S. aureus (coriander, cinnamon, badian, mustard – (10 - 40 cfu/g)) and S. haemolyticus strains (juniper, ginger). The collection of sixteen collected strains (S. aureus (n = 4), S. haemolyticus (n = 4), S. epidermidis (n = 8)) has been typed with the rep-PCR method utilising (GTG) 5 primer. Analysis of the fingerprints using the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA) clustering method revealed presence of eleven strain clusters with similarity lower than 90 %: two fingerprint clusters of S. aureus, three individual clusters characteristic for S. haemolyticus and six different S. epidermidis specific clusters. The S. aureus strains from different types of spice were identical, resp. very similar. Molecular tracking composed from the rep-PCR analysis of acquired isolates and comparison among all collected fingerprints confirmed the spices to be the source of both S. aureus and S. haemolyticus strains identified in raw meat paste. The additional rep-PCR analysis of the S. epidermidis collection confirmed usability and performance of this method. The antibiotic susceptibility to fourteen individual antibiotics has been examined among the collected staphylococci strains. The predominant erythromycin resistance (68. 8 %) was followed with the resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (56. 2 %). Other resistances observed were less frequent (clindamycin – 12. 5 %, oxacillin – 6. 3 %, tetracycline – 6. 3 %, <b>sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim</b> – 6. 3 %, chloramphenicol – 6. 3 %, novobiocin – 6. 3 %). As shown by our experimental results, rep-PCR with the (GTG) 5 primer is an applicable tool for typing of bacterial strains and may be used for identifying the source of contamination.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the association between}} Plasmodium falciparum malaria and non-typhi Salmonella in children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional hospital based study. SETTING: Kilifi District Hospital (KDH) between January 1997 and June 2001. SUBJECTS: Children aged between three months to 123 months (mean age 28. 28 months) and who had been admitted to the paediatric or High Dependency Research Ward (HDRW) of the KDH. METHODS: A total of 19, 118 blood cultures routinely obtained for all admissions and 1, 820 clinically indicated stools samples were obtained from 9, 147 children admitted with malaria. The specimens were cultured and antibiotic sensitivity done using standard laboratory procedures with stringent internal and external quality control in place. RESULTS: The total bacterial pathogens isolated from blood and stool were 1, 395 / 19, 118 (7. 3 %) and 342 / 1, 820 (19 %) respectively. Non-typhi salmonella consisted of 260 / 1, 395 (18. 6 %) of the positive blood cultures and 92 / 324 (28. 4 %) of the stool cultures out of which a total of 101 NTS occurred in children with severe malaria. Out of the 9, 147 malaria cases admitted, 101 / 9, 147 (1. 10 %) had concomitant NTS infection. NTS with severe malaria {{as a proportion of}} all malaria admissions for the period varied between 0. 8 % and 1. 5 %. There was a significant association (p-value= 0. 032) between clinical outcome of death and female sex of the patient. The NTS isolates which occurred with severe malaria showed various levels of antibiotic resistance. They were resistant to ampicillin (35 %), chloramphenicol (18 %), gentamicin (22 %), cefuroxime (29 %), <b>sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim</b> (39 %), ciprofloxacin (3 %), cefotaxime (14 %), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (26 %) and tobramycin (18. 0 %). Multidrug resistance (MDR) was seen in 34 (33. 6 %) of the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: NTS and severe malaria occurring together are a problem in this area and {{that a large number of}} the isolates are MDR. An elaborate case-controlled study is required to elucidate the chain of events of both NTS and malaria parasite co-existence...|$|E
