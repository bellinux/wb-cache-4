2500|$|Food {{security}} is a condition related to the supply of food, and individuals' access to it. Concerns over food security have existed throughout history. There is evidence of Granaries being in use over 10,000 years ago, with central authorities in civilizations including ancient China and ancient Egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine. At the 1974 World Food Conference the term [...] "food security" [...] was defined {{with an emphasis on}} supply. Food security, they said, is the [...] "availability at all times of adequate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices". Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security [...] "exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>nutritious</b> <b>food</b> to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life".|$|E

As defined by the 1996 World Food Summit, [...] "food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>nutritious</b> <b>food</b> that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy lifestyle." [...] There has not been much successful improvement on this issue of food security within recent years. Burkina Faso's rapidly growing population (around 3.6% annually) continues to put a strain on the country's resources and infrastructure, which can further limit accessibility to food. Because the country is landlocked and prone to Natural disasters, including drought and floods, many families struggle to protect themselves from severe hunger. While recent harvest productions have improved some, much of the population is still having a hard time overcoming the continuous food and nutrition crises of the past decade. Malnutrition is especially common in women and children, with large amounts of the population suffering from stunted growth and micronutrient deficiencies such as anemia. Food insecurity has grown to be a structural problem in Burkina Faso, only to be intensified by high food prices. All of these factors combined with high poverty levels have left Burkina Faso vulnerable to chronic high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition.|$|E

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Evidence supports the health promoting benefits of berries, {{particularly with regard}} to the prevention and manage-ment of chronic diseases such cardio- and cerebrovascular disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Two related patho-physiological features common to many of these conditions are oxidative stress and the accumulation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). Whereas antioxidant properties are well-established in several species of berries and are believed central to their protective mechanisms, few studies have investigated the effects of berries on AGE formation. Here, employing a series of complementary in vitro assays, we evaluated a collec-tion of wild berry extracts for 1) inhibitory effects on fluorescent-AGE and Nε- (carboxymethyl) lysine-albumin ad-duct formation, 2) radical scavenging activity and 3) total phenolic and anthocyanin content. All samples reduced AGE formation in a concentration-dependent manner that correlated positively with each extract’s total phenolic content and, to a lesser degree, total anthocyanin content. Inhibition of AGE formation was similarly related to radical scavenging activities. Adding antiglycation activity to the list of established function-al properties ascribed to berries and their phenolic metabolites, our data provide further insight into the active compounds and protective mechanisms through which berry consumption may aid in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases associ-ated with AGE accumulation and toxicity. As widely available, <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>nutritious</b> <b>foods,</b> berries represent a promising dietary intervention worthy of further investigation...|$|R

The act also titled Natives with [...] "44 million acres of Alaska and extinguished remaining claims with a $1 billion payment." [...] Natives received compensation under this act, but it did not protect subsistence hunting.

5000|$|The term food {{security}} {{was first used}} in the 1960-1970s to refer to food supply and consistent access to food in international development work. [...] In 1966 the treaty titled the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was created to ensure economic, social and cultural rights including the “inalienable right to adequate nutritious food”. [...] In 1974 the World Food Conference focused on producing enough food for the world, ensuring the supply was reliable, and reducing dramatic price fluctuations. [...] Even early on {{it was clear that}} there was a great discrepancy between the world’s food supply and people’s access to food. Advances in agricultural technology in non-industrialized countries resulting in production of more food did not necessarily result in improved food access as evidenced by the Green Revolution. Rather, many environmental problems such as insecticide resistant pests, soil erosion, and pesticide poisoning of both people and wildlife resulted. During the 1980s and 1990s {{food security}} became recognized as a major public health concern in industrialized countries. [...] The concept of food entitlement was introduced in 1981 along with a shift in focus to ensured food access with adequate supply at the individual or household level in industrialized nations. [...] Food security was measured directly by anthropometric means or by food intake assessment, and indirectly by indicators of poverty, comparison of wages to food costs, employment rates and the use of emergency food programs. [...] At the 1996 World Food Summit, the Rome Declaration on World Food Security reaffirmed, “the right of everyone to have access to <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>nutritious</b> <b>food,</b> consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger”. [...] Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most responses to food insecurity tended to occur at the community level. [...] Community level initiatives allowed for more long lasting solutions to food issues as they were designed to empower individuals and increase knowledge and skills as opposed to providing only a temporary solution to food access. These efforts contributed largely to the evolution of the concept of CFS in the 1990s when environmental concerns were gaining recognition. [...] The emerging concept of CFS captured the central idea that addressing food security at the community level would allow more interested parties to become involved in the decision-making and planning process as well as enable a larger range of issues to be addressed such as environmentally sustainable food production, fair wages for local producers, and more sustainable food assistance programs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A global recession, {{along with}} highly {{increased}} food prices {{in many countries}} in unregenerate manner, have caused some 100 million more people than last year suffering from silent hunger and poverty that would leave the world extremely vulnerable. The global food crisis potentially imposes a serious risk towards world peace and security. The crop production however {{will have to be}} dramatically increased to meet the need. The ability of biotechnology to act as a tool to assist in solving the issue is far from being fully exploited. Low crops production is considered to be the main reason for poverty and food insecurity in the world. High percentage of poor and food insecure people are living in developing countries and in rural aereas. Therefore, biotechnology can: 1) in-crease the crops yield through introducing high-yielding varieties resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses; 2) reduce pest– associated losses; and 3) increase the nutritional values of foods which is a very important factor in rural areas or develop-ing countries. Furthermore, in order to reduce or eliminate food insecurity, postharvest approach in wasting less is of a vi-tal strategy to supplement increasing food productivity. Hence, the environmental issues in supplying <b>safe</b> <b>and</b> <b>nutritious</b> <b>foods</b> in a sustainable manner should be taken into account. Biotechnology research and development have already produced significant products on the market, and will further have a pivotal role to play in encouraging and enhancing food production, considering the safety and environmental quality.

Almost a thousand different GE lines of small-market and specialty crops 1 were among the almost 17, 000 regulated field trials approved by USDA since 1987. In spite of this large public investment—as well as early technical successes and promising results in field trials—only a few GE specialty crops developed in public institutions have been released to date: virus-resistant papaya, virus-resistant plum, and a now defunct flax intended to be used for bioremediation. These are very sparse returns considering substantial public investment over a quarter century. In fact, the majority of scientists at public institutions do not even consider further development of GE crops for commercial utility, even for traits that could advance agricultural systems, improve human health and help feed the increasing global population. On the other hand, there are signs that this trend is changing. Several transgenic events in specialty crops, are now moving towards commercialization as a result of collaborative efforts involving universities, industry, and regulatory agencies.
