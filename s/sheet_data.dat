Until 2001 {{it was called}} Rural Bank of Loans and Deposits in Faetano (Cassa Rurale di Depositi e Prestiti di Faetano), then its name was changed to Bank of San Marino (Banca di San Marino SpA [...] ). A first branch was opened {{in the capital of}} San Marino in 1974. Today there are 12 branches, with more than 140 employees. It is the parent company of Leasing Sammarinese, Banca Impresa di San Marino, BSM Immobiliare, San Marino Business, Easy Business SpA and Easy Holding SpA. Its total assets are more than 216 million euros; its solvency ratio is more than 20% and the bank provides 23% of the total San Marino bank system capital, according to the 2010 balance <b>sheet</b> <b>data.</b>|$|E

It is primarily a training document for users and compilers to indicate the potential analyses and policy applications. It uses UK published figures, but not the most recent in all cases. Both documents have been prepared by Geoff Tily, an economist in ONS working on the compilation, analysis and presentation of UK national accounts and balance of payments statistics.
