In this paper, we study an H-ψ formulation for the nonlinear eddy current problem in laminated conductors. By omitting the insulating films between neighboring laminations, we propose an approximate but effective H-ψ formulation for the nonlinear eddy current problem, which reduces the scale ratio by 2 – 3 orders of magnitude. The well-posedness of the original problem and the approximate problem are established by examining their weak formulations.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{design solutions}} {{able to reduce}} the Cogging Torque (CT) amplitude of Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machines (PMSMs). The common point of these solutions is the particular constructions of the stator magnetic core from two concentric <b>steel</b> <b>lamination</b> stacks {{that leads to a}} closed stator slots structure in the air-gap region. The efficiency of the studied solutions is evaluated by Finite Element (FE) analysis for two different types of PMSMs: the first one with Surface Permanent Magnets (SPMs) and the second one with Interior Permanent Magnets (IPMs). The influence of the special stator constructions on the performances of the two types of machines is emphasized also in the paper, with positive and negative effects. This study proves that a PMSM whose stator magnetic core is designed as shown, leads to an important decrease of CT amplitude in comparison with a classical machine. Moreover, the studied design solutions may be mixed with other CT reduction methods so as to optimize the overall PMSM performance.

To validate the computations, numerical results are generally compared to analytical solutions. But {{this can only}} be applied to simple cases. The best way to validate a new model is to compare the numerical results to measurements (For example, simulation results from a loss model [1] should be validated through their comparison to experimental measurements).

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} thermal {{management}} aspects of electric machinery used in high-performance  applications  with  particular  focus put  on electric machines designed for {{hybrid electric vehicle}} applications. In {{the first part of}} this thesis,  new thermal models of liquid (water and oil) cooled electric machines are proposed.   The proposed thermal models are based on a combination of lumped parameter (LP)   and numerical methods. As  a first  case study,  a permanent-magnet  assisted  synchronous reluctance machine (PMaSRM) equipped with a housing water jacket is considered.   Particular focus is put on the stator winding and a thermal model is proposed that divides the stator slot into a number of elliptical copper and impregna- tion layers.   Additionally, an analysis, using results from a proposed simplified thermal finite element (FE)   model representing only a single slot of the sta- tor and its corresponding end winding, is presented in which the number of layers and the proper connection between the parts of the LP thermal model representing the end winding and the active part of winding are determined. The approach is attractive due to its simplicity  and the fact  that it closely models the actual temperature distribution for common slot geometries.   An oil-cooled induction machine where the oil is in direct contact with the stator laminations  is also considered.   Here, a multi-segment structure is proposed that  divides  the  stator,  winding and cooling  system  into  a number  of an- gular  segments.    Thereby,  the  circumferential  temperature  variation  due to the  nonuniform distribution  of the  coolant  in the  cooling  channels  can be predicted. In the  second part  of this  thesis,  the  thermal  impact  of using  different winding impregnation  and steel  lamination  materials  is  studied.    Conven- tional varnish, epoxy and a silicone based thermally conductive impregnation material are investigated and the resulting temperature distributions in three small induction machines are compared. The thermal impact of using different <b>steel</b> <b>lamination</b> materials is investigated by simulations using the developed thermal  model  of the water  cooled  PMaSRM. The  differences  in alloy con- tents and <b>steel</b> <b>lamination</b> thickness are studied separately and a comparison between the produced iron losses and the resulting hot-spot temperatures is presented. Finally, FE-based approaches  for  estimating  the  induced  magnet  eddycurrent losses in the rotor of the considered PMaSRM are reviewed and compared in the  form  of a case  study  based on simulations.    A  simplified three-dimensional  FE model  and an analytical  model,  both  combined  with time-domain 2 D FE analysis, are shown to predict the induced eddy current losses with a relatively good accuracy compared to a complete 3 D FE based model.   Hence, the two simplified approaches are promising which motivates a possible future experimental verification.

40|$|As NASA {{seeks to}} fulfill its goals of {{exploration}} and understanding through missions planned to visit the moons of Saturn and beyond, a number of challenges arise {{from the idea of}} deep space flight. One of the first problems associated with deep space travel is electrical power production for systems on the spacecraft. Conventional methods such as solar power are not practical because efficiency decreases substantially as the craft moves away from the Sun. The criterion for power generation during deep space missions are very specific, the main points requiring high reliability, low mass, minimal vibration and a long lifespan. A Stirling generator, although fairly old in concept, {{is considered to be a}} potential solution for electrical power generation for deep space flight. A Stirling generator works on the same electromagnetic principles of a standard generator, using the linear motion of the alternator through the stationary stator which produces electric induction. The motion of the alternator, however, is produced by the heating and cooling dynamics of pressurized gases. Essentially heating one end and cooling another of a contained gas will cause a periodic expansion and compression of the gas from one side to the other, which a displacer translates into linear mechanical motion. NASA needs to confirm that the materials used in the generator will be able to withstand the rigors of space and the life expectancy of the mission. I am working on the verification of the epoxy adhesives used to bond magnets to the <b>steel</b> <b>lamination</b> stack to complete the stator; in terms of in-service performance and durability under various space environments. Understanding the proper curing conditions, high temperature properties, and degassing problems as well as production difficulties are crucial to the long term success of the generator. system and steel substrate used in the stator. To optimize the curing conditions of the epoxies, modulated differential scanning calorimetry analysis was done as a function of cure time and temperatures. Adhesion bond strength was tested at various temperatures with lap shear samples using Hiperco 50 substrate to ensure that the proper adhesive is being used. To try and solve the problem of bondline thickness, micro glass beads of 0. 0017 " in diameter were investigated to see if any other physical properties of the epoxy were affected. Efforts will be made to develop a standard, optimized, fabrication process/procedure of sub-scale magnet-stator assemblies for various adhesive performance evaluation studies under simulated generator conditions. Also, accelerated aging testing will be done in a pressurized canister with stator assembly samples for three years to verify if any degassing or thermal degradation of the epoxy occurs. The necessity of verifying the correct epoxy adhesive system for the stator magnet in the SRG is crucial because failure of the stator assembly would jeopardize the electrical system, and thereby the entire mission itself.
