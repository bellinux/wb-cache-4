K-Feldspar destruction is predominantly by dissolution, though in-situ alteration to albite also occurs. Dissolution can remove up to 15 % solid {{volume of the}} rock by 4. 5 km, so that primary arkosic snadstones become diagenetic quartzarenites at depth, with increased secondary:primary porosity ratios.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{evaluate}} the association between distance of residence from a steel factory, a point source of air pollution within an industrial area in Udine (Friuli Venezia Giulia Region, Northern Italy), and cancer mortality. DESIGN: retrospective study. To evaluate the association between mortality rates and distance from the source, a Stone test analysis for all cases occurred in the entire area was conducted. The significance level was determined using Monte Carlo simulations. <b>SETING</b> AND PARTICIPANTS: a GIS mapped residential history of Friuli Venezia Giulia population was completed. Among residents within 5 km from the principal industrial plant of the area from 1989 to 2012, deaths caused by cancer were selected. Furthermore, according to the prevalent wind direction, an analysis was conducted also in a subgroup of residents located into the South-Western quadrant. A set of 8 bands with increasing distance from the point-source was defined. The total population was 37, 473 inhabitants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: in each band, observed and expected cancer-related deaths (calculated {{on the basis of}} mortality rates in the entire area) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed to test for decline in risk of mortality at different distances from the main chimney. Stone test, in which a decline in risk of disease with an increase in distance from the source of pollution is tested, was used. RESULTS: the risk for all cancers and lung cancer was higher than expected. For male residents located within 2 km into the South-Western quarter there were 21 observed deaths from lung cancer vs. 13 expected (SMR: 1. 62; p-value= 0. 02). CONCLUSION: despite {{the fact that in the}} whole area cancer mortality is not increased, this study seems to support evidence of an excess of cancer deaths, especially lung cancer among males, near a steel factory. However, the study has limitations because of the small number of cases and the lack of individual exposure data and information about confounders (e. g., smoke habits and professional exposure). Therefore, a possible cause-effect interpretation of this association should be considered with caution...|$|R

The Portuguese state faced a challenge of promoting a quality education for immigrant children within the course on integration. After the initial lack of response to the linguistic diversity in Portugal’s schools, the Portuguese government formulated political guidelines for language-in-education diversity management. Most recent studies about multilingual contexts in education have gradually shifted the focus to teaching as a social practice while considering teachers, educators, caregivers, parents and students as actors of this practice. This change in perspective reinforces the link between practices and discourses that shape them. Drawing on the interview and observational data from a longitudinal linguistic ethnography around the site of an informal school organized by immigrant parents (2004 - 2012), this paper aims to discuss the ways in which language teaching practices and their interpretation by institutional agents, parents and children reﬂect the changes in offcial discourses in mainstream educational <b>setings</b> (e. g., PLNM discourses). The main emphasis is placed on identifying the discursive spaces available for other languages in Portuguese mainstream education and on the impact the commonly accepted language ideologies may have on identities of multilingual speakers...|$|E
40|$|Although a clear {{correlation}} between levels of fungi {{in the air}} and health impacts has not been shown in epidemiological studies, fungi must be regarded as potential occupational health hazards. Fungi can have an impact on human health in four different ways: (1) they can infect humans, (2) they may act as allergens, (3) they can be toxigenic, or (4) they may cause inflammatory reactions. Fungi of concern in occupational hygiene are mostly non-pathogenic or facultative pathogenic (opportunistic) species, but are relevant as allergens and mycotoxins producers. It is known that the exclusive use of conventional methods for fungal quantification (fungal culture) may underestimate the results due to different reasons. The incubation temperature chosen will not be the most suitable for every fungal species, resulting in the inhibition of some species and the favouring of others. Differences in fungi growth rates may also result in data underestimation, since the fungal species with higher growth rates may inhibit others species’ growth. Finally, underestimated data can result from non-viable fungal particles that may have been collected or fungal species that do not grow in the culture media used, although these species may have clinical relevance in the context. Due to these constraints occupational exposure assessment, in <b>setings</b> with high fungal contamination levels, should follow these steps: Apply conventional methods to obtain fungal load information (air and surfaces) regarding the most critical scenario previously selected; Guideline comparation aplying or legal requirements or suggested limits by scientific and/or technical organizations. We should also compare our results with others from the same setting (if there is any); Select the most suitable indicators for each setting and apply conventional-culture methods and also molecular tools. These methodology will ensure a more real characterization of fungal burden in each setting and, consequently, permits to identify further measures regarding assessment of fungal metabolites, and also a more adequate workers health surveillance. The methodology applied to characterize fungal burden in several occupational environments, focused in Aspergillus spp. prevalence, will be present and discussed...|$|E
