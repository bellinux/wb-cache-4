5000|$|The {{house itself}} is a weatherboarded {{structure}} two stories tall. [...] Different sections of the house have different roof styles: the east-facing front rises to a gable, five bays wide on the first story and three on the second, while a projection on the southern side {{is covered with a}} hip roof. Porches <b>shelter</b> <b>parts</b> of the front and southern sides, and numerous shuttered windows, many six-over-six, are placed throughout the facade. [...] The main entrance pierces the gabled front section; situated in the central bay of the first story, it is surrounded by sidelights and a transom light. Components of the facade demonstrate both the Greek Revival origins of the design and its vernacular interpretation: fluted columns in the Doric order support the porch roof, but the bottom section of the gable's pediment is interrupted by all three second-story windows.|$|E
30|$|At {{initial stage}} of etching, since the {{standard}} reduction potential of MnO 4 − (1.51 eV) {{is larger than}} that of Ag (0.78 eV) [22], injected holes are provided mainly from S 2. As the reactions (S 2 and S 3) continuously proceed, the concentration of SiF 62 − increases gradually. When the concentration of SiF 62 − is accumulated sufficiently, K 2 SiF 6 can heterogeneously nucleate at the silicon surface and grow up to K 2 SiF 6 particles, covering dense silver NPs (as described in Figure[*] 4 B). So, K 2 SiF 6 particles <b>shelter</b> <b>parts</b> of Ag NPs and further prevent the etchant solution from the contact with Ag NPs. It is difficult for hole injection from Ag NPs to silicon areas covered by K 2 SiF 6 particles. At the same time, at the areas of silicon surface without K 2 SiF 6 particles, silicon is still subjected to the etching assisted by the catalysis of Ag NPs. Therefore, the silicon under K 2 SiF 6 particles was retained, while the silicon not covered with K 2 SiF 6 particles was etched away, leading to micropillar structure on the silicon substrate. As the reaction continuously performs, the concentration of MnO 4 − in the solution is reducing; injected holes are provided mainly by S 1. On the surface of silicon without K 2 SiF 6 particles covered, nanowire array form closely around micropillars and simultaneously accompanied the deposition of silver dendrites (as described in Figure[*] 4 C), which is clearly illustrated by the formation model of SiNW array in HF/AgNO 3 solution [2, 23]. Finally, the silicon MP/NW composite structure was obtained after the cleaning by HNO 3, as described in Figure[*] 4 D.|$|E

50|$|A Japanese {{study in}} 1979 {{suggested}} that Polyptychoceras lived and travelled in schools, similarly to modern cuttlefish. Individual fossil specimens {{of a particular}} species of Polyptychoceras are frequently found in sediments laid down {{in the same bed}} of water, around the Santonian and Upper Coniacian faunal stages of the Late Cretaceous Epoch. Polyptychoceras was probably buoyant, and swam in a slow, somewhat up-and-down locomotion. It also likely preferred living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>parts</b> of deep sea levels, although how deep is uncertain. Subptychoceras yubarense was likely very long like an eel, and preferred a benthic mode of life.|$|R
50|$|The E.O. Manees House is a {{historic}} house at 216 West Fourth Street in North Little Rock, Arkansas. It is a -story T-shaped brick house with Colonial Revival and Classical Revival styling.

One is above the main entrance, supported by two-story Doric columns, and <b>shelters</b> <b>part</b> of a two-story porch that covers the right half of the front {{and part of the}} side.

The survivor's information was that the captain of Santa Maria de la Rosa had called the pilot a traitor and run him through with a sword just as the ship began to sink; he also asserted that the Prince of Ascoli, son of the king of Spain, had gone down with the ship — this information was false, but proved useful propaganda for the English.|$|R

Dripping Cave (once used by the local Native Americans as a shelter), tucked into a <b>sheltered</b> <b>part</b> of Wood Canyon, became a [...] "base of operations" [...] of outlaws, led by Juan Flores, who robbed stagecoaches traveling between Los Angeles and San Diego. Long after the bandits were arrested, it retains the nickname [...] "Robbers Cave". In 1871 Eugene Salter, the first white settler along Aliso Creek, claimed 152 acre in the canyon just outside the Rancho Niguel. The next year, the homestead was taken over by the Thurston family who irrigated an orchard using water from Aliso Creek.|$|R

Although over half a million native plants have been established under a planting programme, two thirds of island will remain in grass and coastal shrublands.

This suits most bird life and allows for natural regeneration. The plantings have been mainly of hardy pioneer species best able to withstand the rigorous conditions.
