On designing the system, we mainly consider a simple structure with low vibration and high accuracy. In stead of the traditional two level stages, we used a surface plate as the reference of the main stage. Therefore, it has low profile and simple structure. Surface plate {{was made of the}} ceramic glass with very low thermal expansion. The stage is positioned on the surface plate of 800 mm x 800 mm. It is guided horizontally by a cross structure with two precision bars perpendicularly linked and vertically by the surface plate.

The Y-axis guide bar is attached to the X-axis moving plate and moved to the Y-direction. Finally the Y-axis guide bar guides the XY-stage plate, so the XY-stage plate can be moved to two directions. This global stage also has the two-axis flexure structure machined by the precision wire-cutting machine. By combining global stage and micro-stage, the fast and long movement and the fine positioning can be provided.

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the urgent, presently, problem that is to ensure the best level of the passive safety of car seats with active head restraints, as well as to assess the {{effectiveness}} of such constructional designs. This is an impact-related task, to be, as a consequence, essentially nonlinear with large deformations, strains and accelerations. To solve this problem finite element models of three types of seat designs with active head restraints have been developed. When creating the simulation FEM a number of CAD (Computer Aided Design) /CAE (Computer Aided Engineering) software was used. This work was performed {{within the framework of the}} developed technique, which allows an efficient creation of the car seat designs with passive and active head restraints that meet requirements of the passive safety. The results of calculations and experiments allowed us to find that the active head restraint significantly reduced a NIC (Neck Injury Criterion) value, namely up to 36. 92 (4 %) when using the active headrest with articulated tilting couch, 29. 23 (per 24 %) when using the active headrest with <b>sliding</b> <b>pad,</b> and 26. 15 (31 %) when using the active head restraint, which is provided with an airbag. We have also managed to achieve significantly reduced head acceleration under impact.

40|$|The Curved Surface Slider, {{also known}} as the Friction Pendulum System, has become in the last years a very popular antiseismic {{hardware}} for base isolation of buildings and structures. A potential issue for sliding isolation systems is the degradation of the coefficient of friction caused by the temperature growth within the bearing due to the dissipation of the seismic energy as frictional heat. Both experimental and numerical investigations have pointed to the importance of the issue, and models accounting for the temperature dependence of the coefficient of friction at the material level have been recently proposed, which can be used in finite element analyses of the whole isolator. In this study, a three-dimensional finite element model of a Curved Surface Slider unit developed by the Authors is used to investigate in detail the influence of the path of motion on the temperature growth. In the first part, the finite element formulation and its validation are presented. The generation of frictional heat is reproduced in the model by locating a heat source {{on the surface of the}} <b>sliding</b> <b>pad,</b> with intensity of the heat flux depending on the coefficient of friction, the axial pressure, and the velocity. The coefficient of friction at the material level is routinely adjusted by the software at each calculation step on the current levels of pressure, velocity and temperature. In the second part, either unidirectional and multidirectional displacement-controlled orbits are challenged in finite element thermal-mechanical analyses in order to investigate the temperature growth inside the bearing and the relevant changes in the mechanical response of the device. The result point to the unsuitability of the unidirectional trajectories performed in the tests prescribed in current standards to reproduce the temperature rises that may possibly occur within the Curved Surface Slider unit under more general multidirectional orbits typical of real earthquakes...|$|R

40|$|Many insects {{cling to}} {{vertical}} and inverted surfaces with pads that adhere by nanometre-thin films of liquid secretion. This fluid is an emulsion, consisting of watery droplets in an oily continuous phase. The detailed function of its two-phasic nature has remained unclear. Here {{we show that}} the pad emulsion provides a mechanism that prevents insects from slipping on smooth substrates. We discovered {{that it is possible}} to manipulate the adhesive secretion in vivo using smooth polyimide substrates that selectively absorb its watery component. While thick layers of polyimide spin-coated onto glass removed all visible hydrophilic droplets, thin coatings left the emulsion in its typical form. Force measurements of stick insect <b>pads</b> <b>sliding</b> on these substrates demonstrated that the reduction of the watery phase resulted in a significant decrease in friction forces. Artificial control pads made of polydimethylsiloxane showed no difference when tested on the same substrates, confirming that the effect is caused by the insects' fluid-based adhesive system. Our findings suggest that insect adhesive pads use emulsions with non-Newtonian properties, which may have been optimized by natural selection.

40|$|The {{chemical}} and mechanical properties of wafer materials {{have a direct}} impact on the performance of the CMP process. This report presents a systematic study to characterize surface films on copper wafers in the presence of simple peroxide solutions as well as representative bulk copper and copper barrier CMP slurries offered by the Dow Chemical Company. Measurements are made of chemical composition, thickness, modulus, and removal rate of films formed under both static etch and CMP conditions. Sample aging—a major obstacle in past efforts of this type—is minimized by temporarily setting up the equipment for wafer film preparation in close proximity to the surface analytical instruments. It is found that Dow’s commercial bulk and barrier Cu CMP slurries form permeable surface films less than 4 nm deep consisting of reaction products with copper. Compared to native copper, the films have compressive and shear moduli that are 5 X and 2 X lower respectively—enabling mechanical removal by <b>sliding</b> contact with <b>pad</b> asperities at a lower threshold contact pressure.

40|$|AbstractDuring {{training}} and competition in short track speed skating, skaters commonly {{fall on the}} ice and <b>slide</b> into crash <b>pads</b> that line the boards of the rink. Skaters wear helmets to protect their heads from such impacts. Nevertheless, concussion injuries are not uncommon, especially from impacts into the crash pads. Basic mechanical principles suggest that, all other things being equal, smaller sized and rounder shaped helmets should reduce peak impact forces when hitting relatively soft crash pads. This study validates these assumptions and determines the magnitude of these effects using drop tests and a 3 D accelerometer. Hemispherical head forms of various radii, each weighing approx. 4. 5 kg, were dropped from four heights (0. 3 - 4. 0 m) onto a crash pad. Peak linear decelerations were recorded. In one set of tests, complete hemispheres were used, highlighting the effect of helmet size (radius). In a second set of tests, another set of hemispheres of various radii were sliced to produce caps each with a diameter of 8 ” but each with a different radius of curvature. Impact tests at four drop heights using these caps revealed the effect of helmet shape. Size was found to be more important than shape, with the greatest effects being in the 10 - 20 cm radius range, a range which is relevant to helmets used in the sport today...|$|R
40|$|For {{several years}} the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT), Iowa State University, the Federal Highway Administration, and several Iowa {{counties}} {{have been working}} to develop accelerated bridge construction (ABC) concepts, details, and processes. Throughout this development, much has been learned and has resulted in Iowa being viewed as a national leader {{in the area of}} ABC. However, at this time, the Office of Bridges and Structures does not have a complete set of working standards nor design examples to accompany ABC portions of the bridge design manual (now called the Load and Resistance Factor Design/LRFD Bridge Design Manual). During the fall of 2013, the Iowa DOT constructed a bridge on IA 92 in Cass County using an ABC technique known as slide-in bridge construction. During the design of the Cass County Bridge, several questions were raised about the performance of critical design and construction details: the pile-to-pile cap connection and the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated bearing pads on which the bridge would slide. The timing of this specific need and the initiation of this project offered a unique opportunity to provide significant short- and long-term value to the Office of Bridges and Structures. Several full-scale laboratory tests, which included several variations of the pile-to-pile cap connection and bearing <b>pad</b> <b>slides,</b> were completed.

2500|$|Once {{the disc}} has {{some level of}} {{variation}} in thickness, uneven pad deposition can accelerate, sometimes resulting in changes to the crystal structure of the metal that composes the disc in extreme situations. As the brakes are applied, the <b>pads</b> <b>slide</b> over the varying disc surface. As the pads pass by the thicker section of the disc, they are forced outwards. The foot of the driver applied to the brake pedal naturally resists this change, and thus more {{force is applied to}} the pads. The result is that the thicker sections see higher levels of stress. This causes an uneven heating of the surface of the disc, which causes two major issues. As the brake disc heats unevenly it also expands unevenly. The thicker sections of the disc expand more than the thinner sections due to seeing more heat, and thus the difference in thickness is magnified. Also, the uneven distribution of heat results in further uneven transfer of pad material. The result is that the thicker-hotter sections receive even more pad material than the thinner-cooler sections, contributing to a further increase in the variation in the disc's thickness. In extreme situations, this uneven heating can actually cause the crystal structure of the disc material to change. When the hotter sections of the discs reach extremely high temperatures ( [...] ), the metal can undergo a phase transformation and the carbon which is dissolved in the steel can precipitate out to form carbon-heavy carbide regions known as cementite. This iron carbide {{is very different from the}} cast iron the rest of the disc is composed of. It is extremely hard, very brittle, and does not absorb heat well. After cementite is formed, the integrity of the disc is compromised. Even if the disc surface is machined, the cementite within the disc will not wear or absorb heat at the same rate as the cast iron surrounding it, causing the uneven thickness and uneven heating characteristics of the disc to return.|$|R
40|$|In {{heavy-duty}} {{disc brake}} systems, braking is a transient, non-linear and asymmetrical thermo-mechanical process. Surface cracking, rather than wear, {{is the major}} factor limiting the brake disc's life. The disc material (cast-iron), heat transfer boundary conditions and pad-disc frictional reactions are characteristically non-linear and asymmetrical during the friction process. Non-uniform deformation and surface cracks in brake discs result from the accumulation of excessive residual stress/strain. During braking processes, many factors affect the distributions of the residual stress and strain in discs, and hence the propagation of the surface cracks. The disc material, structure and boundary conditions are three of the crucial aspects. From the structure, a brake disc could be either solid or ventilated. In practice, solid structures always have higher anti-cracking performance than the same class of ventilated designs. However solid discs cost more material and have lower cooling efficiency. This thesis presents an improved finite element analysis for heavy-duty disc brakes and identifies design improvements. As the friction <b>pads</b> <b>slide</b> against the disc's surfaces continuously, the thermal and mechanical loads are functions of time and spatial coordinates. A 3 -D asymmetrical finite element model was developed to achieve more accurate simulations of the thermo-mechanical behaviour of brake discs during braking processes. A non-linear inelastic material model for cast-iron was employed in the FE model. Permanent plastic stress and strain fields were predicted and analysed for multi-stop drag operations. The residual stress/strain fields in the discs are investigated to {{understand the differences between}} solid and ventilated discs in terms of the cracking resistance ability. Several engineering solutions are recommended for optimising the performance of the disc brake system. _ The thesis is organized in five chapters.
