25|$|After {{leaving the}} Army in 1943, Wills moved to Hollywood, {{moving into a}} rented house in September, and began to reorganize the Texas Playboys.

25|$|Fields {{regularly}} {{performed in}} TV appearances, {{being the first}} entertainer to perform on Val Parnell's <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>at</b> the London Palladium.

This followed on from her popularity on Stars on Sunday, a religious programme on Britain's ITV, in which well known performers sang hymns or read extracts from the Bible.

25|$|There was {{tremendous}} anticipation {{ahead of}} the release—thousands of fans had ordered the group's next single as early as June, well before a title had been known. By the day before it went on sale, some 500,000 advanced orders had been placed for it. The single set several British sales records. It entered the charts on 31 August and remained in the charts for 31 consecutive weeks, 18 of those weeks {{in the top three}} (including every week of the months of September, October, November and December 1963). During that period, it claimed the ranking of number one on 14 September, stayed number one for four weeks, dropped back to the top three, then regained the top spot for two weeks starting on 30 November. This re-gaining of the top spot was very unusual at the time. It then made its way back into the charts for two weeks on 11 April 1964, peaking at No. 42. It passed sales of a half million copies by early June and a million by late November, whereupon it was awarded a gold record. The song's run on the charts coincided with the 13 October 1963 performance of the group on <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>at</b> the London Palladium and the emergence of full-blown Beatlemania in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|From April to October 1963, {{when the}} Beatles starred on Val Parnell's <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>at</b> the London Palladium, the UK's top variety show, the band had two further UK hit singles, [...] "From Me to You" [...] and [...] "She Loves You", each {{successively}} building {{the excitement of}} Britain's teenagers. The Beatles' performance on <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>at</b> the London Palladium was televised live and watched by 15million viewers. One national paper's headlines {{in the days following}} finally gave the phenomenal and increasingly hysterical nationwide interest in the Beatles a name, one which from that day on would be adopted universally: [...] "Beatlemania".|$|E

500|$|At {{his weekly}} <b>Sunday</b> <b>Night</b> <b>at</b> the Tunnel Palladium shows, {{sometimes}} even experienced and accomplished comedians failed {{to complete a}} whole set against the unforgiving crowd and razor-sharp heckling. When the club became established, it attracted groups of men apparently from the suburb of [...] 'Eltham' who Malcolm referred to as 'Herberts'. They [...] were usually drunk and in the Tunnel club as it offered after hours drinks on a Sunday night, a rarity back then. They usually ended the evening by fighting, fortunately usually between themselves, leaving everybody else as spectators. It was at the Tunnel Club that comedian Jim Tavare once began his act with the unwise opener, [...] "Hello, I'm a schizophrenic" [...] – to be met with the lightning rejoinder from a heckler in that night's audience, [...] "Well, you can both fuck off then!". Julian Clary together with Fanny the Wonder dog were surprising hits at such evenings.|$|E
500|$|The Confessions Tour {{received}} positive critical response. Steve Baltin of Rolling Stone wrote: [...] "Madonna {{had played}} many {{roles in the}} first night of her Confessions tour – but confessor was not one of them. Apparently, in all the pomp and circumstance, {{there was no room for}} warmth, or even the attitude that made her recent Coachella festival performance so memorable." [...] Don Chareunsy of The San Diego Union-Tribune commented that Madonna's previous tours, Drowned World Tour (2001) and Re-Invention World Tour (2004), [...] "were excellent concerts... but she stepped it up a few notches" [...] for the Confessions Tour. Ben Wener of The Orange County Register reported that [...] "No one – but no one – stages elaborate eye-candy productions like Madonna, whose highly impressive Confessions Tour opened <b>Sunday</b> <b>night</b> <b>at</b> a packed Forum so sweltering it seemed as though it were being prepped for the world's largest Bikram yoga session." [...] Lina Das from the Daily Mail complimented the show, saying that Madonna still had the ability to grab the headlines with her shock tactics. Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine complimented the finale of the tour saying, [...] "There's not a better way the Confessions Tour could’ve closed." [...] Tom Young from the BBC called the show [...] "a big fat neon light of a pop-dance explosion. There's a party going on, and unless you were there in the first place, you’re not invited. Whistles and whoops rarely cease and applause ripples throughout building into regular raptures for a consistently first-class performer. It's almost enough to make those who weren’t there jealous. Almost." ...|$|E
