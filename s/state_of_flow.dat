5000|$|Csíkszentmihályi's flow concept {{relates to}} the idea of being at one with things or as {{psychology}} expert, Kendra Cherry, describes it: [...] "complete immersion in an activity". Practitioners of the varied schools of Zen Buddhism apply concepts similar to flow to aid their mastery of art forms, including, in the case of Japanese Zen Buddhism, Aikido, Cheng Hsin, Judo, Honkyoku, Kendo and Ikebana. In yogic traditions such as Raja Yoga, reference is made to a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> in the practice of Samyama, a psychological absorption in the object of meditation. Theravada Buddhism refers to [...] "access concentration", which is a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> achieved through meditation and used to further strengthen concentration into jhana, and/or to develop insight.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{situations}} in which autonomy is encroached upon (for example, if the individual must always control his/her actions to abide by rules imposed by the task) are thought to inhibit flow. This implies that another requirement of flow is {{to be free from}} constraints that force controlled processes to be used. Additionally, several areas of research indicate that during a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> an otherwise-controlled process becomes automatic allowing it to behave dominant over all other automatic processes.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the concept}} of [...] "serious play" [...] may sound like an oxymoron, it is the dual nature of the concept that makes it powerful. It is play with a purpose and {{intentionality}} that goes beyond simply having fun. The serious aspect requires a degree of focus on a task or challenge, while the play aspect emphasizes imagination and toying with boundaries. Together, these seemingly juxtapose components are able to foster a deeper engagement - {{also known as a}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> where participants lose track of time and their inner critique. Being playful also enables us to better tolerate the ambiguity and uncertainty that characterizes many of the problems modern organizations face.|$|E
50|$|Musicians, {{especially}} improvisational soloists, {{may experience}} a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> while playing their instrument.Research {{has shown that}} performers in a flow state have a heightened quality of performance as opposed to {{when they are not}} in a flow state. In a study performed with professional classical pianists who played piano pieces several times to induce a flow state, a significant relationship was found between the flow state of the pianist and the pianist's heart rate, blood pressure, and major facial muscles. As the pianist entered the flow state, heart rate and blood pressure decreased and the major facial muscles relaxed. This study further emphasized that flow is a state of effortless attention. In spite of the effortless attention and overall relaxation of the body, the performance of the pianist during the flow state improved.|$|E
50|$|Defined by {{flows through}} a system, a flow {{process is a}} steady <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> {{into and out of}} a vessel with {{definite}} wall properties. The internal state of the vessel contents is not the primary concern. The quantities of primary concern describe the states of the inflow and the outflow materials, and, on the side, the transfers of heat, work, and kinetic and potential energies for the vessel. The states of the inflow and outflow materials consist of their internal states, and of their kinetic and potential energies as whole bodies. Very often, the quantities that describe the internal states of the input and output materials are estimated on the assumption that they are bodies in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. Because rapid reactions are permitted, the thermodynamic treatment may be approximate, not exact.|$|E

30|$|The {{basic idea}} of the model is that we assume there are some flows, such as those given by demand and service rates, which are clearly related between each other and other variables, for instance, money price, {{consumer}} budget, etc. Setting up a business then should be performed so that the resulting adjustment <b>of</b> these <b>flows</b> returns the maximum expected profits. Our model internalizes the corresponding relationships (or internal forces) and the proposed solution describes the final (expected) <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flows</b> and their consequences for money price, waiting time, and waiting room size.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{challenges}} to staying in flow include states of apathy, boredom, and anxiety. Being {{in a state of}} apathy is characterized when challenges are low and one's skill level is low producing a general lack of interest in the task at hand. Boredom is a slightly different state in that it occurs when challenges are low, but one's skill level exceeds those challenges causing one to seek higher challenges. Lastly, a state of anxiety occurs when challenges are so high that they exceed one's perceived skill level causing one great distress and uneasiness. These states in general differ from being in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow,</b> in that flow occurs when challenges match one's skill level. Consequently, Csíkszentmihályi has said, [...] "If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills." ...|$|E
50|$|Flow {{in games}} {{has been linked}} to the Laws of Learning as part of the {{explanation}} for why learning-games (the use of games to introduce material, improve understanding, or increase retention) have the potential to be effective. In particular, flow is intrinsically motivating, {{which is part of the}} Law of Readiness. The condition of feedback, required for flow, is associated with the feedback aspects of the Law of Exercise. This is exhibited in well designed games, in particular, where players perform at the edge of their competency as they are guided by clear goals and feedback. The positive emotions associated with flow are associated with the Law of Effect. The intense experiences of being in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> are directly associated with the Law of Intensity. Thus, the experience of gaming can be so engaging and motivating as it meets many of the Laws of Learning, which are inextricably connected to creating flow.|$|E

5000|$|In {{many parts}} of Europe, a hybrid {{empirical}} approach to traffic design is used, combining macro-, micro-, and mesoscopic features. Rather than simulating a steady <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> for a journey, transient [...] "demand peaks" [...] of congestion are simulated. These are modeled by using small [...] "time slices" [...] across the network throughout the working day or weekend. Typically, the origins and destinations for trips are first estimated and a traffic model is generated before being calibrated by comparing the mathematical model with observed counts of actual traffic flows, classified by type of vehicle. [...] "Matrix estimation" [...] is then applied to the model to achieve a better match to observed link counts before any changes, and the revised model is used to generate a more realistic traffic forecast for any proposed scheme. The model would be run several times (including a current baseline, an [...] "average day" [...] forecast based {{on a range of}} economic parameters and supported by sensitivity analysis) {{in order to understand the}} implications of temporary blockages or incidents around the network.

40|$|Stationary <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> a {{barotropic}} {{fluid in}} a β channel {{has been shown}} by Charney and De Vore (1979) to possess multiple-equilibrium solutions when sinusoidal topographic forcing is exerted within the region of resonance near the wavenumber of stationary Rossby waves, and nonlinear effects are taken into account. Charney and De Vore associate the different solutions with zonal and blocking <b>states</b> <b>of</b> global circulation. However, real topography is non-sinusoidal and, most of the time, observed blocking configurations display a pronounced regional character. On the other hand, the problem of superimposing different harmonics is made difficult here by the essential role played by nonlinearity {{in the theory of}} multiple equilibria. In this paper, the mathematical problem of determining the stationary <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> barotropic fluid in a β plane when topography is nonsinusoidal is analyzed {{with the help of the}} perturbative assumptions that the latitudinal scale <b>of</b> the <b>flow</b> is very large and topography has the form of a slowly modulated sinusoid. The multiple <b>states</b> <b>of</b> stationary <b>flow</b> described by Charney and De Vore are found to exist simultaneously in different regions of the β plane. Theoretical solutions corresponding to different kinds of resonant forcing are analyzed. The theoretical solutions are discussed in relationship to the problem of blocking as a “regional” phenomenon and are shown to have several different features in common with observed persistent blocking patterns...|$|R

As the stream-line is smooth in what is called a streamline-shaped dike (steep in front and gentle in back), a short distance is required for restoration. But the streamline in what is called the streamline-shaped dike yields relatively more, smaller rotational eddies, so they restore faster. C.
