5000|$|A {{variety of}} oncogenes and tumor {{suppressor}} genes {{have been found}} to be mutated or possess altered expression in pediatric ependymomas. KIT receptor tyrosine kinase and phospho-KIT have been suggested to play a role in the development of pediatric ependymomas, NOTCH1 mutations have been found in approximately 8% of pediatric ependymomas, and MEN1 mutations are occasionally found in pediatric ependymomas. [...] MMP2 and MMP14 appear to also play a role in tumor growth and progression in intracranial cases. [...] Two candidate genes, TPR and CHIBBY, have been identified on commonly altered chromosome regions in pediatric ependymomas, chromosomes 1q25 and chromosome 22q12-q13. [...] Expression of two additional candidate genes, S100A6 and S100A4 on chromosome 1q have also been found to correspond to <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> development and tumors occurring before the age of 3 years old, though it is unclear exactly what role these genes play in the etiology.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the effects of 3 {{inhalation}} agents that combined with dexmedetomidine infusion on hemodynamic stability and postoperative recovery in patients undergoing <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> surgery. After the institute’s ethics committee approved this study and written informed consent was obtained from each participant, 90 patients with ASA I and III, who were scheduled for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> surgery, were recruited for this prospec-tive, randomized controlled study. Routine monitoring was applied for unpremedicated patients on arrival in the operating room. All the patients received IV dexmedetomidine 0. 5 mg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by 0. 9 mg/kg/h infusion during maintenance. Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups. Anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane in group 1, desflurane in group 2, and isoflurane in group 3. Hemodynamic variables, brain relaxation scores, intraoperative anesthetics requirement, and recovery characteristics were recorded. Demographic values, hemodynamic variables, and brain relaxation scores were similar among the groups. Mean arterial pressure was higher after intubation at the first minute in all groups than at baseline values. Hypertension was reported in 4 of 30 patients in group 1, 8 of 30 patients in group 2, and 5 of 30 patients in group 3, intraoperatively. Eye opening, following the verbal commands, was significantly lesser in patients receiving des-flurane-dexmedetomidine than the other groups (P= 0. 001). We conclude that dexmedetomidine infusion is not sufficient for suppressing hemodynamic responses, decreasing the require-ment of inhalation agents, and providing adequate brain relaxation in patients undergoing supratentorial craniotomy. Desflurane-dexmedetomidine anesthesia offers lesser eye open-ing and a slower response to verbal commands postoperatively...|$|E

40|$|Background: The optimal {{ventilated}} status under total intravenous or inhalation anesthesia in neurosurgical {{patients with}} a <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> has not been ascertained. The {{purpose of this study}} was to intraoperatively compare the effects of moderate hyperventilation on the jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjO 2), cerebral oxygen extraction ratio (O 2 ER), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and heart rate (HR) in {{patients with a}} <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> under different anesthetic regimens. Methods: Twenty adult patients suffered from supratentorial tumors were randomly assigned to receive a propofol infusion followed by isoflurane anesthesia after a 30 -min stabilization period or isoflurane followed by propofol. The patients were randomized to one of the following two treatment sequences: hyperventilation followed by normoventilation or normoventilation followed by hyperventilation during isoflurane or propofol anesthesia, respectively. The ventilation and end-tidal CO 2 tension were maintained at a constant level for 20 min. Radial arterial and jugular bulb catheters were inserted for the blood gas sampling. At the end of each study period, we measured the change in the arterial and jugular bulb blood gases. Results: The mean value of the jugular bulb oxygen saturation (SjO 2) significantly decreased, and the oxygen extraction ratio (O 2 ER) significantly increased under isoflurane or propofol anesthesia during hyperventilation compared with those during normoventilation (SjO 2 : t = - 2. 728, P = 0. 011 or t = - 3. 504, P = 0. 001; O 2 ER: t = 2. 484, P = 0. 020 or t = 2. 892, P = 0. 009). The SjO 2 significantly decreased, and the O 2 ER significantly increased under propofol anesthesia compared with those values under isoflurane anesthesia during moderate hyperventilation (SjO 2 : t = - 2. 769, P = 0. 012; O 2 ER: t = 2. 719, P = 0. 013). In the study, no significant changes in the SjO 2 and the O 2 ER were observed under propofol compared with those values under isoflurane during normoventilation. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the optimal ventilated status under propofol or isoflurane anesthesia in neurosurgical patients varies. Hyperventilation under propofol anesthesia should be cautiously performed in neurosurgery to maintain an improved balance between the cerebral oxygen supply and demand...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the analgesic efficacy of intravenous PCA using tramadol in patients, undergoing <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> resection with craniotomy. Material and Method: One hundred and fifty patients with ASA I-II between 18 and 70 years of age scheduled for an elective supratentorial craniotomy for tumor resection, were assigned to receive standardized general anesthesia. Postoperative pain was assessed at standard time intervals using a visual analogue scale (VAS) score. When the VAS score was > 3, 1 to 1. 5 mg/kg of tramadol was administered intravenously and PCA using tramadol was started. For 48 h postoperatively, the VAS, Glasgow coma, sedation, comfort, and nausea and vomiting scores were assessed. Results: During the first 48 hours, 46 % of the patients needed analgesic therapy and PCA with tramadol was adequate for these patients. Most patients needed analgesic drugs at 2 hours and their mean analgesic usage was higher at that point than at other periods in the first 2 h (p< 0. 05).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Brain {{tumors are}} {{frequently}} accompanied by abnormal low frequency magnetic activity (ALFMA). The prevalence and clinical meaning of ALFMA {{are not well}} known, although a relation with epileptic brain tissue has been suggested. We studied the prevalence, characteristics and clinical correlates of ALFMA in 20 patients with brain tumors. METHODS: In 20 patients with clinical seizures due to a <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor,</b> MEG was performed, followed by MR imaging. MEG signals were band pass-filtered (1 - 4 Hz); the sources of this activity were localized and projected onto the MRI of the patient. RESULTS: Peritumoral ALFMA could be detected in 13 of 20 patients. A pattern of ALFMA distribution around the tumor could be recognized. In eight cases ALFMA also appeared to be localized within the tumor. In three cases ALFMA was also detected in peritumoral white matter. CONCLUSIONS: Automatic detection of abnormal delta-activity in patients with a brain tumor and seizures can be performed in a clinical setting. When detected, ALFMA is mostly present in circumscribed regions around the tumor. Presence of ALFMA within the tumor might be an important warning signal for the neurosurgeon that the tumor area comprises functional brain tissu...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Supratentorial {{atypical}} teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) in {{many cases}} has a distinctive appearance on post-gadolinium MRI. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine {{whether this is a}} unique appearance allowing ATRT to be distinguished accurately from other types of pediatric supratentorial tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of all available preoperative MRI of pediatric supratentorial tumors at two tertiary children's hospitals, and systematic literature review of case series and reports describing the MRI imaging appearances of supratentorial ATRT. RESULTS: We had 61 supratentorial tumors, including 32 gliomas, 6 ATRT, 8 ependymomas, 6 gangliogliomas, 2 pilomyxoid astrocytomas, 3 primitive neuro-ectodermal tumors, 2 choroid plexus papillomas, and 2 meningiomas. ATRT presented in significantly younger patients than astrocytomas (mean age 2. 6 years vs. 9. 9 years, P[*]<[*] 0. 05). The visual pattern of a thick, wavy (irregular) heterogeneously enhancing wall around a cystic center was seen in 5 / 6 (83 %) ATRTs and only 3 / 55 (5. 4 %) other tumors (P[*]<[*] 0. 0001), for specificity of 95 %, sensitivity of 83 %, positive predictive value of 63 % and a negative predictive value of 95 %.

40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Ependymal tumors with oligodendroglioma like clear {{cells have}} never been {{reported}} from Pakistan. We aimed to see the features and outcomes of this rare entity. METHODS: It was retrospective cohort conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery, Aga Khan University from 2003 to 2013. The medical records and radiology of patients with proven histopathology were reviewed. Analysis was done on SPSS 20. RESULTS: Eleven cases of ependymal tumors with clear cells were found, which equated to 1. 5 % of the total tumor burden in 11 years. The median age was 49 years. Most common presenting symptom was headache 54. 5 %. Out of 11 patients, 9 patients had a <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor.</b> Magnetic resonance imaging showed hypointense signals on T 1 and hyperintense signals on T 2 -weighted images in all cases. Contrast enhancement was found in 9 patients (77. 8 %), necrosis and hemorrhage was found in 4 (36 %) and 3 (27 %) patients, respectively. Immunohistochemistry showed glial fibrillary acidic protein and epithelial membrane antigen positivity in all cases. Ki- 67 showed high proliferative index in 6 patients. According to the World Health Organization grading of ependymal tumors, 2 patients had Grade II tumors, and 9 patients had Grade III tumors with clear cells. Gross total resection was achieved in 6 (54. 5 %) and subtotal resection in 5 patients (45. 4 %). Recurrence was observed in 9 patients. Six patients died of the disease. Median progression-free survival and overall survival was 8 months and 10 months, respectively.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} of this work is to introduce a set of similarity metrics for comparing surgical process models (SPMs). SPMs are progression models of surgical interventions that support quantitative analyses of surgical activities, supporting systems engineering or process optimization. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Five different similarity metrics are presented and proven. These metrics deal with several dimensions of process compliance in surgery, including granularity, content, time, order, and frequency of surgical activities. The metrics were experimentally validated using 20 clinical data sets each for cataract interventions, craniotomy interventions, and <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor</b> resections. The clinical data sets were controllably modified in simulations, which were iterated ten times, {{resulting in a total}} of 600 simulated data sets. The simulated data sets were subsequently compared to the original data sets to empirically assess the predictive validity of the metrics. RESULTS: We show that the results of the metrics for the surgical process models correlate significantly (p< 0. 001) with the induced modifications and that all metrics meet predictive validity. The clinical use of the metrics was exemplarily, as demonstrated by assessment of the learning curves of observers during surgical process model acquisition. CONCLUSION: Measuring similarity between surgical processes is a complex task. However, metrics for computing the similarity between surgical process models are needed in many uses in the field of medical engineering. These metrics are essential whenever two SPMs need to be compared, such as during the evaluation of technical systems, the education of observers, or the determination of surgical strategies. These metrics are key figures that provide a solid base for medical decisions, such as during validation of sensor systems for use in operating rooms in the future...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the cytogenetic results of 58 pediatric {{central nervous system}} (CNS) tumors of variable histology, investigated between 1992 and 2000. Successful cytogenetics were obtained for 53 patients, with clonal chromosome abnormalities demonstrated in 25. Notable findings included (1) 2 p abnormality in four primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET); (2) 1 p loss in four low-grade gliomas and two PNET; (3) telomeric associations in one pilocytic astrocytoma; (4) chromosome 7 gain in four astrocytomas and two PNET; (5) 17 p loss in four PNET; (6) double minutes in one PNET and three glioblastomas; and (7) chromosome 10 loss in four PNET. Higher grade tumors demonstrated greater karyotype complexity. Low-grade tumors showed either minimal simple chromosome changes or a normal karyotype. Chromosome abnormalities were more frequent in <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> than their infratentorial counterparts. Our results add weight to the limited existing body of cytogenetic documentation for pediatric CNS tumors and provide further evidence that 2 p loss is a consistent region of chromosome involvement in PNET.

40|$|Long term {{quality of}} life data of adult {{patients}} harboring intracranial ependymomas have not been reported. The role of adjuvant radiation therapy in Grade II ependymomas is unclear and differs from study to study. We therefore sought to retrospectively analyze outcome and {{quality of life}} of adult patients that were operated on intracranial ependymomas at four different surgical centers in two countries. All patients were attempted to be contacted via telephone to assess quality of life (QoL) {{at the time of the}} telephone interview. The standard EORTC QoL Questionnaire C 30 (EORTC QLQ-C 30) and the EORTC QLQ-Brain Cancer Module (QLQ-BN 20) were used. 64 adult patients with intracranial ependymomas were included in the study. The only factor that was associated with increased survival was age < 55 years (p < 0. 001). Supratentorial location was correlated with shorter progression free survival than infratentorial location (PFS; p = 0. 048). In WHO Grade II tumors local irradiation did not lead to increased PFS (p = 0. 888) or overall survival (p = 0. 801). Even for incompletely resected Grade II tumors local irradiation did not lead to a benefit in PFS (p = 0. 911). In a multivariate analysis of QoL, irradiated patients had significantly worse scores in the item "fatigue" (p = 0. 037) than non-irradiated patients.

40|$|Background: Intracranial {{brain tumor}} in {{children}} is a rare but severe diagnosis. In {{children under the age}} of 15, it covers 1 / 3 of all cancers. The symptomatology is complex and the time to diagnosis can often be prolonged as the symptoms may mimic other less severe conditions in children. Misinterpretations can lead to a prolonged diagnostic delay time (DDT) and affect the prognosis. A study done in Britain showed that it did exist a prolonged DDT, which initiated the Head Smart campaign. The purpose of our study was to discover if the same delay was present in Norway, and to look at the symptomatology in these children. As younger children often have a different clinical presentation, a topic less immersed in earlier literature, this review is concerning children below five years of age. Methods: The study is done as a retrospective consecutive study of the children below five years of age present in the protocol of surgery at the neurosurgical department at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet in the period from 2005 through 2011. In total 70 patients primarily treated for intracranial brain tumor in the infra- and supratentorial compartment were included. Information was systematically gathered from the electronic journal system. Results: In the material, there were 36 girls and 34 boys. Twenty-one children were diagnosed in their first year of life, 13 in their second, 13 in their third, 11 in their fourth and 12 in their fifth. Forty-six of the tumors were supratentorial and 24 were infratentorial. In the first year of life, 90 % had a <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumor.</b> Twenty-five were high-grade tumors, PNET being most frequent, 45 were low-grade, astrocytomas being most frequent. The five-year overall survival was 90 % among the low-grade tumors and 58 % among the high-grade ones. The median DDT was 8, 1 weeks among the low-grade tumors and 4, 5 weeks among the high-grade ones. Distribution of symptoms were: nausea and vomiting (57 %), unsteadiness and poor coordination (36 %), headache (30 %), decreased general state (27 %), seizures (24 %), decreased well-being (17 %), altered level of consciousness (13 %), other symptoms (3 %). Distribution of signs were: Abnormal eye movements (27 %), other neurological signs (19 %), macrocephaly (17 %), bulging of the fontanelle and splayed sutures (17 %), squint (16 %), cranial nerve palsy (14 %), paretic limbs and focal motor weakness (11 %), reduced visual aquity (10 %), other signs (10 %), head tilt (9 %), other visual/eye related signs (9 %), no eye contact (7 %), nutritional problems (3 %).

We hypothesized that any adverse consequence with use of nitrous oxide should affect the patient so as to prolong his/her stay in the hospital. The primary aim of this preliminary trial was to evaluate if avoidance of nitrous oxide could decrease the duration of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital stay after elective surgery for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumors.</b> Patients and Methods : A total of 116 consecutive patients posted for elective craniotomy for various <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> were enrolled between April 2008 and November 2009. Patients were randomly divided into Group I: Nitrous oxide - Isoflurane anesthesia (Nitrous oxide-based group) and Group II - Isoflurane anesthesia (Nitrous oxide-free group). Standard anesthesia protocol was followed for all the patients. Patients were assessed till discharge from hospital. Results : The median duration of ICU stay in the nitrous group and the nitrous-free group was 1 (1 - 11 days) day and 1 (1 - 3 days) day respectively (P = 0. 67), whereas the mean duration of hospital stay in the nitrous group was 4 (2 - 16) days and the nitrous free group was 3 (2 - 9) days (P = 0. 06).

40|$|Overall, {{pediatric}} high-grade glioma (pHGG) has a poor prognosis, in {{part due}} to the lack of understanding of the underlying biology. High-resolution 244 K oligo array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to analyze DNA from 38 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded predominantly pretreatment pHGG samples, including 13 diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs). The patterns of gains and losses were distinct from those seen in HGG arising in adults. In particular, we found 1 q gain in up to 27 % of our cohort compared with 9 % reported in adults. A total of 13 % had a balanced genetic profile with no large-scale copy number alterations. Homozygous loss at 8 p 12 was seen in 6 of 38 (16 %) cases of pHGG. This novel deletion, which includes the ADAM 3 A gene, was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Loss of CDKN 2 A/CDKN 2 B in 4 of 38 (10 %) samples by oligo array CGH was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization on tissue microarrays and was restricted to <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumors.</b> Only ∼ 50 % of <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> were positive for CDKN 2 B expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), while ∼ 75 % of infratentorial tumors were positive for CDKN 2 B expression (P = 0. 03). Amplification of the 4 q 11 – 13 region was detected in 8 % of cases and included PDGFRA and KIT, and subsequent qPCR analysis was consistent with the amplification of PDGFRA. MYCN amplification was seen in 5 % of samples being significantly associated with anaplastic astrocytomas (P= 0. 03). Overall, DIPG shared similar spectrum of changes to supratentorial HGG with some notable differences, including high-frequency loss of 17 p and 14 q and lack of CDKN 2 A/CDKN 2 B deletion. Informative genetic data providing insight into the underlying biology and potential therapeutic possibilities can be generated from archival tissue and typically small biopsies from DIPG. Our findings highlight the importance of obtaining pretreatment samples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Supratentorial</b> {{primitive}} neuroectodermal <b>tumors</b> predominantly {{occur in}} children, and are {{rare in the}} adult population. Less than 100 cases of <b>supratentorial</b> primitive neuroectodermal <b>tumor</b> {{have been reported in}} adults internationally. Our case study reports this rare incident. Case presentation A 22 -year-old Hispanic man presented with headaches, blurry vision, diplopia, intermittent vomiting, and grossly decreased vision. A magnetic resonance image showed a left posterior parietal heterogeneously enhancing mass measuring 4. 2 cm × 7. 2 cm × 7. 0 cm. After craniotomy for resection and decompression, the mass was histologically revealed to be a <b>supratentorial</b> primitive neuroectodermal <b>tumor.</b> Standardized immunohistochemical studies for this mass were carried out. Conclusion We have concluded that immunohistochemical and genetic workup {{should be included in the}} standardized pathological workup for primitive neuroectodermal tumors in order to provide more prognostic information. Based on our current literature review, we propose an immunohistochemical panel. </p...|$|R
40|$|Gangliogliomas {{are well}} differentiated, usually low grade, neuroepithelial tumors that {{comprise}} of neoplastic ganglion cells {{in combination with}} neoplastic glial cells. Occasionally, glial cells may show anaplastic features and are then labeled as anaplastic gangliogliomas. Most of the reported gangliogliomas are <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumors,</b> predominantly in the temporal lobe. Brainstem location has been reported infrequently. As with cortically based gangliogliomas, though the primary treatment is resection, this is often not possible due to the eloquence of surrounding involved parenchyma. Here, we report a case of brainstem tumor in an 8 -month-old child that was substantially resected and was histopathologically Grade 1 ganglioglioma. As per review of English literature, {{there has been no}} case of brainstem ganglioglioma reported in an infant (less than 1 year age). We discuss the surgical difficulties in the radical excision of such benign tumors and review literature on pediatric brainstem gangliogliomas...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE To prospectively study {{cognitive}} {{deficits and}} predictors 3 years after diagnosis {{in a large}} series of pediatric patients treated for pilocytic astrocytoma (PA). PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-one of 67 children were grouped according to infratentorial, supratentorial midline, and supratentorial hemispheric site. Intelligence, memory, attention, language, visual-spatial, and executive functions were assessed. Included predictors were sex, age, relapse, diagnosis-assessment interval, hydrocephalus, kind of treatment, and tumor variables. Results All children with PA had problems with sustained attention and speed. In the infratentorial group, there also were deficits in verbal intelligence, visual-spatial memory, executive functioning, and naming. Verbal intelligence and verbal memory problems occurred in the brainstem <b>tumor</b> group. The <b>supratentorial</b> hemispheric <b>tumor</b> group had additional problems with selective attention and executive functioning, and the <b>supratentorial</b> midline <b>tumor</b> group displayed no extra impairments. More specifically, the dorsal <b>supratentorial</b> midline <b>tumor</b> group displayed problems with language and verbal memory. Predictors for lower cognitive functioning were hydrocephalus, radiotherapy, residual tumor size, and age; predictors for better functioning were chemotherapy or treatment of hydrocephalus. Almost 60 % of children had problems with academic achievement, for which risk factors were relapse and younger age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION Despite normal intelligence at long-term follow-up, children treated for PA display invalidating cognitive impairments. Adequate treatment of hydrocephalus is important for a more favorable long-term cognitive outcome. Even children without initial severe deficits may develop cognitive impairments years after diagnosis, {{partly because of the}} phenomenon of growing into deficit, which has devastating implications for academic achievement and quality of life (QOL).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{randomized}} double blinded controlled {{study was}} to evaluate the effect of SNB during craniotomies for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> in pediatric patients, with respect to intra- and postoperative hemodynamics, intraoperative anesthetic and analgesic consumption and postoperative analgesic requirements. Thirty children, aged 6 to 12 years, scheduled for elective craniotomies for <b>supratentorial</b> <b>tumors</b> {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two groups: control group (n = 15) and Scalp Nerve Block (SNB) group (n = 15). After a standardized induction and 5 min prior to head pinning, a SNB was performed. In the control group the block was performed with normal saline, while in the SNB group the block was performed with bupivacaine 0. 25 %. Intraoperative Mean Arterial blood Pressure (MAP) and Heart Rate (HR) were recorded before induction (baseline), 5 min after induction, at head pinning and at skin incision, together with sevoflurane and fentanyl consumption. Postoperative MAP and HR were measured and recorded. Postoperative pain assessment was done using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score. Rescue analgesia (IV paracetamol, 15 mg kg - 1) was given for a VAS> 3. Time to first rescue analgesic, number of patients who required analgesia as well as number of paracetamol doses in the first 24 h postoperative were recorded. The SNB group showed more stable intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamics and a significant reduction in the total intraoperative fentanyl dose required. VAS scores were significantly lower in the SNB group compared to the control group till 12 h postoperative. Significantly fewer patients in the SNB group required rescue analgesic in the first 24 h postoperative (8 vs. 15, p< 0. 05). Time to first rescue analgesic was significantly longer in the SNB group compared to the control group (6. 6 ± 1. 9 h vs. 1. 7 ± 0. 8 h, p< 0. 05). Number of paracetamol doses required in the first 24 h postoperative was significantly higher in the control group compared to the SNB group. We conclude that SNB using bupivacaine 0. 25 % results in decreased intraoperative analgesic requirements and more stable intra- and postoperative hemodynamics. It also reduces postoperative pain leading to decreased postoperative analgesic consumption...|$|R
