40|$|The top-pair tt̅ {{production}} {{cross section}} close to threshold in e^+e^- collisions is strongly {{affected by the}} small lifetime of the top quark. Since the cross section is defined through final states containing the top decay products, a consistent definition of the cross section depends on prescriptions how these final states are accounted for the cross section. Experimentally, these prescriptions are implemented for example through cuts on kinematic quantities such as the reconstructed top quark invariant masses. As long as these cuts do not reject final states that can arise from the decay of a top and an anti-top quark with a small off-shellness compatible with the nonrelativistic power-counting, they can be implemented through imaginary phase <b>space</b> <b>matching</b> conditions in NRQCD. The prescription-dependent cross section can then be determined from the optical theorem using the e^+e^- forward scattering amplitude. We compute the phase <b>space</b> <b>matching</b> conditions associated to cuts {{on the top and}} anti-top invariant masses at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) order and partially at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (N^ 3 LL) order in the nonrelativistic expansion and, together with finite lifetime and electroweak effects known from previous work, analyze their numerical impact on the tt̅ cross section. We show that the phase <b>space</b> <b>matching</b> contributions are essential to make reliable NRQCD predictions, particularly for energies below the peak region, where the cross section is small. We find that irreducible background contributions associated to final states that do not come from top decays are strongly suppressed and can be neglected for the theoretical predictions.

In this paper, {{we focus on the}} simplest example of these new dualities, arising from the orbifold singularity C 3 /Z 3. We present extensive checks of the duality, including anomaly <b>matching,</b> partial moduli <b>space</b> <b>matching,</b> matching of discrete symmetries, and matching of the superconformal indices between the proposed duals. We then present a related duality for the dP 1 singularity, as well as dualities for the F 0 and Y 4, 0 singularities, illustrating the breadth of this new class of dualities. In a companion paper, we show that certain infinite classes of geometries which include C 3 /Z 3 and dP 1 all exhibit such dualities, and argue that their ten-dimensional origin is the SL(2,Z) self-duality of type IIB string theory. ar X i...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of the {{distributed}} multi-target tracking with labeled set filters in the framework of Generalized Covariance Intersection (GCI). Our analyses show that the label space mismatching (LS-DM) phenomenon, which means the same realization drawn from label spaces of different sensors does not have the same implication, is quite common in practical scenarios and may bring serious problems. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we provide a principled mathematical definition of "label <b>spaces</b> <b>matching</b> (LS-DM) " based on information divergence, which is also referred to as LS-M criterion. Then, to handle the LS-DM, we propose a novel two-step distributed fusion algorithm, named as GCI fusion via label <b>spaces</b> <b>matching</b> (GCI-LSM). The first step is to <b>match</b> the label <b>spaces</b> from different sensors. To this end, we build a ranked assignment problem and design a cost function consistent with LS-M criterion to seek the optimal solution of matching correspondence between label spaces of different sensors. The second step is to perform the GCI fusion on the <b>matched</b> label <b>space.</b> We also derive the GCI fusion with generic labeled multi-object (LMO) densities based on LS-M, which is the foundation of labeled distributed fusion algorithms. Simulation results for Gaussian mixture implementation highlight the performance of the proposed GCI-LSM algorithm in two different tracking scenarios. Comment: 9 pages, 10 figures, conferenc...|$|R
