5|$|In April 2004 the South Carolina Supreme Court {{dismissed}} the <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> Thompson and Meyer, but allowed the suit against W. W. Norton to proceed. The court stated that South Carolina's long-arm jurisdiction {{did not apply}} to Thompson and Meyer, but did to W. W. Norton.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 2008, U.S. District Court judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York {{dismissed}} the families' <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> all the U.S. based defendants under {{the premise of}} forum non-conveniens. Without ruling {{on the merits of}} the cases, and while allowing discovery to continue, Cogan recommended the Brazilian court system as a more appropriate jurisdiction for the dispute.|$|E
5|$|Attorney Hy Mayerson was {{an early}} pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with {{environmental}} attorney Victor Yannacone in 1980 on the first class-action <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, {{one of the first}} civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor. The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.|$|E

50|$|On January 25, 2016, John Crane filed to {{intervene}} in the <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> Simon Greenstone and made racketeering claims distinct from those made by Garlock. Simon Greenstone filed a breach-of-contract <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> John Crane in federal court in Los Angeles, California alleging that John Crane violated previous settlement agreements when it filed {{to intervene}}. In June 2016, John Crane filed an independent RICO <b>suit</b> <b>against</b> Simon Greenstone.|$|R
5|$|In 1990, {{after being}} sued for libel by the Church of Scientology, Steven Fishman, {{a former member}} turned critic, offered {{a large amount of}} the group's highly {{confidential}} teachings in court. The documents, contained in {{what is known as the}} Fishman Affidavit, included detailed accounts of the church's space opera narratives. This material was subsequently posted on alt.religion.scientology and a website of Dutch journalist Karin Spaink. The church filed <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> those who posted the documents, claiming copyright violations. Lengthy court battles ensued, but the church was unable to prevent the materials' dissemination over the internet.|$|E
5|$|LaRouche lawyers filed {{a series}} of related civil <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> individuals, {{agencies}} and businesses. They sued Weld and former Attorney General William French Smith {{to try to stop}} the FBI investigation of the credit card case. They sued the New Jersey bank that had frozen their credit card merchant accounts; and they sued Chemical Bank in a similar suit. Edward Spannaus, a treasurer for LaRouche campaigns, filed complaints with the state bar and the U.S. Justice Department against one of the Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the case.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge for}} the wager, {{the editor of}} Field magazine, {{declared}} Wallace the winner, but Hampden {{refused to accept the}} result. He sued Wallace and launched a campaign, which persisted for several years, of writing letters to various publications and to organisations of which Wallace was a member denouncing him as a swindler and a thief. Wallace won multiple libel <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> Hampden, but the resulting litigation cost Wallace more than the amount of the wager and the controversy frustrated him for years.|$|E

5|$|After being enslaved for 12 years, Northup is {{restored}} to freedom {{and returned to}} his family, leaving behind the other slaves. As he walks into his home, he sees his wife with their son and daughter (fully grown) and her husband, who present him with his grandson and namesake, Solomon Northup Staunton. Solomon apologizes for his long absence while his family comforts him. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics recounting Northup's unsuccessful <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> Brown, Hamilton and Burch, along with the 1853 publication of Northup's slave narrative memoir, Twelve Years a Slave. The memoir describes his role in the abolitionist movement, and the mystery surrounding details of his death and burial. Patsey and Solomon never met again.|$|E
5|$|He also prosecuted {{a number}} of {{contempt}} of court cases, including <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> Dow Jones Publishing Company (Asia), Inc. for material published in The Wall Street Journal Asia; against US-based lawyer Gopalan Nair for comments on his blog; and against three Singapore Democratic Party supporters, John Tan Liang Joo, Isrizal bin Mohamed Isa and Muhammad Shafi'ie Syahmi bin Sariman, who wore T-shirts bearing {{the image of a}} kangaroo dressed in a judge's gown outside the Supreme Court Building. On 15 March 2010, in one of his last cases before his term of office ended, he defended the constitutionality of capital punishment in Singapore before the Court of Appeal in an appeal by a man sentenced to death for drug trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Years {{after the}} attacks, legal {{disputes}} over {{the costs of}} illnesses related to the attacks {{were still in the}} court system. On October 17, 2006, a federal judge rejected New York City's refusal to pay for health costs for rescue workers, allowing for the possibility of numerous <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> the city. Government officials have been faulted for urging the public to return to lower Manhattan in the weeks shortly after the attacks. Christine Todd Whitman, administrator of the EPA {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks, was heavily criticized by a U.S. District Judge for incorrectly saying that the area was environmentally safe. Mayor Giuliani was criticized for urging financial industry personnel to return quickly to the greater Wall Street area.|$|E

5|$|Discussing {{the larger}} culture of {{violence}} that Chicago police had created, journalist Spencer Ackerman in February 2015 reported that Zuley, by then retired from COPD, had served in 2003-2004 with the US Navy Reserve as an interrogator at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, established by the George W. Bush administration. (Zuley {{had returned to the}} CPD after his Navy service.) In 2003, one of his subjects was the high-profile detainee Mohamedou Ould Slahi, for whom the Secretary of Defense had authorized extended interrogation techniques, since classified as torture. Slahi's memoir, Guantanamo Diary, was published in January 2015, and quickly became an international bestseller. He detailed the torture he suffered. Ackerman noted that inmates with claims or <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> Zuley had recounted details that are similar to the physical and psychological abuse against Slahi. Local Chicago publications identified Zuley as a protege of Burge, but Ackerman said that the two officers never served together. Zuley primarily served on the North Side.|$|E
5|$|The PAP {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} returned to power by voters and has thus formed the Cabinet since Singapore's 1959 general election. The Government is generally {{perceived to be}} competent in managing the country's economy, and largely free from political corruption. Transparency International's 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index, which compares countries according to {{the degree to which}} corruption is perceived to exist among public officials and politicians, ranked Singapore in joint first place with Denmark and New Zealand out of 178 countries. In addition, Singapore was second only to New Zealand in the Asia-Pacific region. On the other hand, the Government has been criticized for using unfair election tactics, such as discouraging voting for opposition parties in the 2006 general election by stating that wards that elect opposition candidates will receive state-subsidized improvements to public housing only after all PAP-held wards have been attended to. It has also been accused of violating freedom of speech through Ministers bringing defamation <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> opposition politicians, and by restricting the circulation of foreign newspapers deemed to have engaged in domestic politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression, which is {{guaranteed}} to Singapore citizens by Article 14 of the Constitution of Singapore, is essential to the concept of representative democracy. Mechanisms available for the exercise of the right include the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, Speakers' Corner, and the new media. However, Article 14 enables Parliament to restrict the right to free speech on various grounds. One of these is the protection of reputation. Critics have charged that Cabinet ministers and members of the ruling People's Action Party have used civil defamation <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> opposition politicians to inhibit their activities and exclude them from Parliament. The Government has said that there is no evidence substantiating such claims. In addition, both media ownership and content are carefully regulated by the Government. Article 14 protects the right {{to freedom of}} assembly which is relevant to free speech as the latter is often exercised at assemblies and gatherings. Free assembly is restricted in Singapore through laws that require permits to be obtained before events are held, though an exception is made for indoor events involving organizers and speakers who are citizens.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, Apple {{was named}} among others as a {{defendant}} in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology. The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights. Ultimately, Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself {{a reputation as a}} patent troll. Typhoon acquired two pre-existing patents, (filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997), in mid-2007 for $350,000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees. The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents, it began enforcement by bringing suit against exploiters of the technology who had not paid licensing fees. Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> some small companies, and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones. Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission. Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but, in mid-2008, amended its complaint to add Apple, Fujitsu, Toshiba, Lenovo, Panasonic, HTC, Palm, Samsung, Nokia, and LG. In 2010, Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010. The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon's claims, and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation.|$|E
5|$|The acts became {{controversial}} {{from prosecution}} thereunder of a Congressman {{and a number}} of newspaper editors. Indeed, the Federalist administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> five of the six most prominent Democratic–Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial {{on the eve of the}} 1800 presidential election – timing that hardly appeared coincidental, according to biographer Ferling. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Democratic–Republicans. However, other historians have emphasized that the Acts were employed for political targeting from the outset, causing many aliens to leave the country. The Acts as well allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists, even on the floor of Congress. In any case, the election of 1800 in fact became a bitter and volatile contest, with each side expressing extraordinary fear of the other and its policies; after Democratic–Republicans prevailed in the elections of 1800, they used the acts against Federalists before the laws finally expired.|$|E
25|$|While—under Ex parte Young—tribes may obtain some prospective, {{equitable}} relief in suits nominally against state officials (generally, for treaty rights), the Supreme Court in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe (1997) held that state sovereign immunity barred not only quiet title suits but also <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> state officials which would constitute {{the equivalent of}} quiet title. Although Coeur d'Alene involved sovereign title to a lake bed, this precedent {{has been applied to}} bar even <b>suits</b> <b>against</b> states in their capacity as ordinary property owners.|$|E
