40|$|Tool safely disassembles {{relief valves}} without damage to {{sensitive}} parts. Relief-valve disassembly tool used to extract valve nozzle from its housing. Holding device on tool grops nozzle. When user <b>strikes</b> <b>hammer</b> against impact disk, holding device pulls nozzle from press fit. Previously, nozzle dislodged by striking spindle above it, but practice often damaged retaining screw. New tool removes nozzle directly. With minor modifications, tool adapted to valves from different manufacturers...|$|R
50|$|The {{free end}} of the dog (called the hammer) rests on the {{soundboard}} of the hurdy-gurdy and {{is more or less}} free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned slowly the pressure on the string (called the trompette on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is accelerated, the <b>hammer</b> <b>lifts</b> up and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.|$|R
50|$|Until 2011, {{the bells}} hung in a steel yoke. In {{the course of}} the cathedral renovations of 2011/2, this yoke was {{replaced}} with a new oak wood yoke, intended to produce a softer ring. The new yoke consists of 24 m3 of wood and its load-redistributing substructure weighs 6 tonnes. In addition, the electrical system was renovated: the motor was replaced and each bell was equipped with its own electronically-operated <b>strike</b> <b>hammer.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{free end}} of the dog (called the hammer) rests on the {{soundboard}} of the hurdy-gurdy and {{is more or less}} free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string (called the trompette on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is striken, the <b>hammer</b> <b>lifts</b> up suddenly and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hammer</b> {{has been}} <b>lifted</b> by Earth itself when {{animated}} by magical means.|$|R
25|$|Operation Black Lion (15 June – 19 October 1972) was a Royal Lao Government counter-offensive {{against a}} People's Army of Vietnam thrust that cut the Kingdom of Laos in two at Khong Sedone during May 1972. Two regiments of Royalist {{military}} irregulars retaliated on 15 June 1972, attacking the Communist 39th Regiment {{in an air}} assault while Royal Lao Air Force tactical air <b>strikes</b> <b>hammered</b> the 39th. During the next month, the 39th Regiment would suffer an estimated 360 casualties and be rendered ineffective for attacks. On 18 July, they retreated, leaving a rear guard to be overrun.|$|R
5000|$|Americus's {{innovation}} was {{the addition}} of an [...] "escapement" [...] to Silbermann's realization of a string striking action design. Unlike Cristofori's design (to which of course Americus had no access) which interposed an intermediate lever between the lever that the key <b>lifts</b> and the <b>striking</b> <b>hammer,</b> Americus placed an upstanding wooden [...] "jack" [...] pivoting from this lever acting directly on a leather clothed notch in the hammer butt. An adjustable screw mounted underneath the hammer flange support rail, known as a [...] "set-off", impacts upon the jack, disengaging it from the hammer which is thus launched into free flight before it strikes its course of strings.|$|R

50|$|The Norn Stones {{also show}} the ability, similar to Thor's <b>Hammer,</b> {{impossible}} to <b>lift</b> by {{anyone other than}} the chosen bearer.|$|R
50|$|Although the euphonicon {{resembles a}} harp piano (claviharp) in appearance, the action <b>strikes</b> strings with <b>hammers</b> rather than {{plucking}} them.|$|R
5000|$|Dominic Gill {{says that}} when the <b>hammers</b> <b>strike</b> only one string, the piano [...] "produces a softer, more {{ethereal}} tone".|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{compound}} lever translates the small movement of a piano {{key to the}} fast, hard <b>strike</b> of the <b>hammer</b> on the strings ...|$|R
60|$|Even {{above the}} din caused by so vast a {{multitude}} a sharp metallic sound was presently heard like that of innumerable <b>hammers</b> <b>striking</b> on steel.|$|R

50|$|Shorinji Kempo {{incorporates}} zen {{for mental}} training. Techniques are mainly divided into 3 categories: gōhō (剛法 hard techniques - hand <b>strikes,</b> chops, <b>hammers,</b> elbows, knees, kicks, reaps, stomps, and blocks); jūhō (柔法 soft techniques - throws, pins, chokes, joint manipulations, dodges and releases) and; seihō (整法 healing techniques - acupressure, bone setting, and resuscitation techniques).|$|R
50|$|The {{permanent}} {{magnetic field}} holds the hammer spring in stressed, ready to strike position. The driver sends electric current to hammer coil, which then creates electromagnetic field opposite to the permanent magnetic field. When both fields equalize, the energy {{stored in the}} spring is released to <b>strike</b> the <b>hammer</b> against the ribbon and prints a dot on the paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "With your favour," [...] said Dennis, [...] "the knaves can do {{good service}} notwithstanding. That Wilkin Flammock of the Green can <b>strike</b> like the <b>hammers</b> {{of his own}} fulling-mill." ...|$|R
5000|$|Absence of {{a reflex}} (areflexia): If no reflex is {{elicited}} {{then it is}} essential to try again with reinforcement, with the patient clenching his or her teeth just as the reflex <b>hammer</b> <b>strikes.</b>|$|R
50|$|On small upright pianos, {{the soft}} pedal moves the hammers {{closer to the}} strings. On grand pianos, the soft pedal moves the hammers {{sideways}} so each <b>hammer</b> <b>strikes</b> only part of its string group.|$|R
50|$|They are {{triggered}} by pressure rather than impact. This makes them safe during transport, as they normally cannot detonate {{in a bag}} or storage container. Detonating them by <b>striking</b> with a <b>hammer</b> does work.|$|R
50|$|It {{requires}} {{only one person}} to operate. Each hammer is connected by a rope to a fixed frame in the bell-ringing room. When in use the ropes are taut, and pulling one of the ropes towards the player will <b>strike</b> the <b>hammer</b> against the bell. To enable normal full circle ringing on the same bells, the ropes are slackened to allow the hammers to drop away from the moving bells.|$|R
5000|$|Piano - Each <b>hammer</b> <b>strikes</b> {{multiple}} strings {{tuned to}} {{nearly the same}} pitch (for all notes except the bass notes). Professional piano tuners carefully control the mistuning of each string to add movement without losing clarity.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{simulate}} the cloud cavitation on hydraulic machinery, the unsteady cavitation on a rectangular wing section was observed in the cavitation channel of the Miyakonojo National College of Technology. The attack angle was forced to change from 10 deg. to – 10 deg. by a <b>strike</b> of <b>hammer.</b> As the attack angle decreased, the sheet cavitation left {{the leading edge of}} wing and changed into cloud cavities on the mid-chord of wing...|$|R

50|$|A variant on the Marxophone idea is the marxoguitar or guitar-marxophone, {{created by}} Ranjit Bhatnagar. In 2010 {{he made a}} six-hammer device that could be {{attached}} to an electric guitar at the bridge, creating a Marxophone-like repeated <b>hammer</b> <b>strike.</b>|$|R
50|$|Since {{planishing}} hammers {{are generally}} {{in contact with}} the outside surface of the piece, they are flat, have rounded edges and are polished to avoid marring the work. Pneumatic (air powered) planishing <b>hammers</b> <b>strike</b> hundreds of blows per minute.|$|R
50|$|Another type, the single-stroke bell, has no {{interrupting}} contacts. The <b>hammer</b> <b>strikes</b> the gong once {{each time}} the circuit is closed. These are used to signal brief notifications, such as a shop door opening for a customer, rather than continuous warnings.|$|R
50|$|The Dulcitone has {{a similar}} sound to the {{glockenspiel}} since its sound is made by <b>hammers</b> <b>striking</b> tuning forks. The dulcitone uses soft hammers which damp the forks, compared to the hard hammers of the glockenspiel, creating a more gentle sound.|$|R
50|$|The {{blacksmith}} lapwing or {{blacksmith plover}} (Vanellus armatus) occurs commonly from Kenya through central Tanzania to southern and southwestern Africa. The vernacular name {{derives from the}} repeated metallic 'tink, tink, tink' alarm call, which suggests a blacksmith's <b>hammer</b> <b>striking</b> an anvil.|$|R
50|$|A {{tapping machine}} is a device {{used to test}} the impact sound {{insulation}} of floors. The standard tapping machine has five hammers placed in a line. Each <b>hammer</b> is <b>lifted</b> and dropped in turn, creating 20 impacts per second on the floor. In the room below, a sound level meter is used to measure the sound level created by the impacts. Because the force and frequency of the impacts is known, the impact insulation provided by the floor can be determined from the sound level.|$|R
5000|$|Flake Hammerscale forms due to {{the rapid}} {{oxidation}} of hot iron in air. A heated piece of iron will develop an external layer of iron oxide which then may separate from the original piece due to a <b>hammer</b> <b>strike</b> or differential thermal contraction [...]|$|R
5000|$|... 3. Dymák, which {{portrays a}} {{blacksmith}} at work, with strong on beats mimicking the <b>hammer</b> <b>striking</b> hot steel. This movement also increases tempo considerably over the preceding two dances, starting at an allegro but increasing to prestissimo {{to indicate the}} hot and industrious work.|$|R
50|$|Closing {{a circuit}} to render a device {{operational}} might also violate the Biblical prohibition of makeh bapatish (<b>striking</b> the final <b>hammer</b> blow, i.e. completing a product). The argument {{would be that}} an electrical device is not complete {{because it does not}} function unless the electricity is turned on.|$|R
