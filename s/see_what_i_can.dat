500|$|On {{top of his}} {{technical}} talent, Friday {{was physically}} very strong and able to withstand sustained blows or injuries. According to Hamilton, he was also uncommonly fit despite his lifestyle. He boasted an exceptional work-rate, which Dwyer recalled gave any side including him a strong boost: [...] "When {{he was in the}} line-up you'd have a centre-forward and a centre-half; not only would he be up there running them ragged, but when it broke down he'd be the first person to start tackling back". He was assisted in this by a smooth and effective sliding tackle which despite all of Friday's attacking skills Hurley considered one of the strongest parts of his game. Reading F.C. historian David Downs described Friday's style of play as [...] "really quite bizarre. It was more or less Robin standing in the middle and saying 'Give me the ball and I'll <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do with it'". On receiving the ball, he would then turn and either take on the opposing defence single-handed or run with it to the wing to cross for a teammate. [...] "We didn't need anyone else up front", Hurley later said. [...] "They couldn't get the ball off him. He was {{one of those guys who}} could beat five players easily". Andrews agreed: [...] "once he'd got the ball it was almost impossible to get it off him".|$|E
2500|$|Shaw {{recalled}} Owens {{telling the}} audience, [...] "If somebody's come all that way, I'm gonna {{do the show}} and give it my best shot. I might groan and squeak, but I'll <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do." [...] Shaw added, [...] "So, he had his favorite meal, played a show and died in his sleep. We thought, that's not too bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peterson {{believed}} he was a player that a franchise could build around. In an interview with IGN following the NFL Draft, he said, [...] "I'm a player who is coming in with the determination to turn a team around. I want to help my team get to the playoffs, win...and run wild. I want to bring people to the stands. I want {{people to come to}} the game to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do next. Things like that can change the whole attitude of an organization. I want to win." [...] He later told the Star Tribune in an interview, [...] "I want to be the best player to ever play this game." [...] Nearly three months after being drafted, he was signed by the Vikings on July 29, 2007. His contract was worth $40.5 million over five years, with $17 million guaranteed.|$|E
2500|$|Since his injury, Lewis {{has been}} cleared to {{participate}} in organized team activities, including on-field work, {{but he wants to}} make sure he remains healthy for the rigors of the preseason. He was quotes as saying [...] "As of right now I want to get through this offseason program and make sure everything is good," [...] he said. [...] "I want to get confident with my knees right now so, when training camp starts, I'm full throttle and there's no holding back whatsoever." [...] When asked about off-season conditioning, Lewis replied: [...] "I think I'm a lot stronger, especially in my upper body. My lower body feels stronger than it was prior to the injury. I'm excited to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do now with a year of NFL lifting and training without banging on (the knee)." [...] He competed for the starting job in the 2009 NFL Season.|$|E
2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it and ask me if I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give me a minute and I'll <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to see it all the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Enamelled bath-tub, {{separate}} {{room for}} a shower, and a sitz-bath!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Fitted up for a king! And I reckon some of my money went to pay for it. The place must be occupied. I found fresh-opened butter and milk tins in the pantry, and fresh turtle-meat hanging up. I'm going to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> else <b>I</b> <b>can</b> find." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the close}} of my sophomore year [...] my Greek {{professor}} [...] asked me to teach the course in elementary physics in the preparatory department during the next year. To my reply that I did not know any physics at all, his answer was, [...] "Anyone who can do well in my Greek can teach physics." [...] "All right," [...] said I, [...] "you {{will have to take}} the consequences, but I will try and <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> do with it." [...] I at once purchased an Avery's Elements of Physics, and spent the greater part of my summer vacation of 1889 at home – trying to master the subject. [...] I doubt if I have ever taught better in my life than in my first course in physics in 1889. I was so intensely interested in keeping my knowledge ahead of that of the class that they may have caught some of my own interest and enthusiasm.|$|E

The following year, on 18 May 2008, it was announced that [...] "Amebo" [...] would be the first single to be released from the album. According to Muma Gee, this song was what she had long desired to create: [...] "I have been doing my own thing. I've been experimenting even while at the University of Port Harcourt. Now, I want to <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> achieve professionally." [...] Explaining what [...] "Amebo" [...] was specifically about, she says, [...] "I am a homegirl, I am an indigenous musician. I believe so much in Nigeria. So, [...] "Amebo" [...] simply talks about our people, our values, and our heritage." [...] On 25 May, Muma Gee premiered the song at an exclusive night party in Ikoyi. Other roles she played at the event included meeting fans, and signing autographs. [...] "Amebo" [...] was sent to radio afterwards; Muma Gee also spoke briefly about the new album's content and direction, saying, [...] "I figured out that there are lots of love songs in the album. Maybe I am learning the rules to falling in love. (Laughs) and it's finding interest in my songwriting, maybe, maybe not, well I am not sure." ...|$|E
