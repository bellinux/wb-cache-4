25|$|Before {{the end of}} 1952, Boeing {{received}} a contract from the USAF to modify two B-47Bs into prototype RASCAL missile carriers. A removable missile <b>support</b> <b>strut</b> was installed {{on the right side}} of the B-47. Extra internal structure was installed to support the loads of the strut and missile. While carrying the RASCAL, the B-47 could not carry other weapons. The guidance equipment for RASCAL was added to the B-47 bomb bay. The retractable antenna needed by RASCAL was added to the rear fuselage. Both aircraft were sent to Holloman Air Force Base to support the RASCAL test program. After completion of the two DB-47B prototypes, the delays in the RASCAL's development effectively placed the DB-47 modification effort on hold until March 1955. Then in June 1955, Boeing {{received a}} contract to modify 30 DB-47Bs to carry the RASCAL.|$|E

5000|$|The Latham L.1 was {{a single}} bay biplane with a single, faired interplane strut on each side. There was slight stagger. The gap between {{the upper and lower}} wings was large, about 2.5 m or 20% of the span. This allowed the engines, a pair of [...] Lorraine 12D V-12s mounted in {{push-pull}} configuration, to be mounted between the wings. Enclosed in a continuous, streamlined cowling, they were strut-mounted from below on four pairs of longitudinal V-struts and another four smaller pairs of inverted V-struts from their upper side formed a cabane which braced the upper wing centre-section. The engines were cooled with cylindrical Lamblin radiators on each forward engine <b>support</b> <b>strut.</b> The lower wing was mounted on top of the fuselage.|$|E

40|$|An axial {{compressor}} test rig {{has been designed}} for the operation of small turbomachines. The inlet region consisted of a long flowpath region with two series of <b>support</b> <b>struts</b> and a flapped inlet guide vane. A flow test was run to calibrate and determine the source and magnitudes of the loss mechanisms in the inlet for a highly loaded two-stage {{axial compressor}} test. Several flow conditions and IGV angle settings were established in which detailed surveys were completed. Boundary layer bleed was also provided along the casing of the inlet behind the <b>support</b> <b>struts</b> and ahead of the IGV.

50|$|A {{short time}} after the Liberators {{attacked}} the United States, a white survivalist group called the Marauders attacked the military base where Arnim Zola's AI was being held and stole it, along with some other weaponry. Arnim Zola was then able to convince {{the leader of the}} Marauders to allow Zola to commence experiments on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20 ft tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest and was called Uber-Siegsoldat. He then took over the Marauders and got them to gather people for his experiments. Captain America and Falcon were sent after him and were able to defeat him by freeing the people he had kidnapped, who promptly tore apart his body, whereupon Captain America collapsed a <b>support</b> <b>strut</b> onto the Zola AI.|$|E

5000|$|Engine oil {{was added}} {{by means of}} a tube from the cabin that was fitted to pass through the firewall. Only the pilot's seat was installed. The {{remaining}} space was used for a pad on which the relief pilot slept. The right cabin door was replaced with an easy-opening, accordion-type door to allow supplies and fuel to be hoisted aboard. Early in the flight, the engine-driven electric generator failed. A Champion wind-driven generator (turned by a small propeller) was hoisted aboard, taped to the wing <b>support</b> <b>strut,</b> and plugged into the cigarette lighter socket; it served as the aircraft's source of electricity {{for the rest of the}} flight. The pilots decided to end the marathon flight because with 1,558 hours of continuously running the engine during the record-setting flight, plus several hundred hours already on the engine beforehand (considerably in excess of its normal overhaul interval), the engine's power output had deteriorated to the point at which they were barely able to climb away after refueling. The aircraft is on display in the passenger terminal at McCarran International Airport. Photos and details of the record flight can be seen in a small museum on the upper level of the baggage claim area. After the flight, Cook said: Next time I feel in the mood to fly endurance, I'm going to lock myself in our garbage can with the vacuum cleaner running. That is until my psychiatrist opens up for business in the morning.|$|E
40|$|Screening {{studies and}} Design of Experiments (DoE) were {{performed}} to evaluate measurement variation of a new, non-destructive Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) test system designed to assess age-induced degradation of Outer Pressure Pads (OPP). The test method and results from 54, 275 measurements are described. A reduction in measurement error was obtained after metal <b>support</b> <b>struts</b> were replaced with plastic <b>support</b> <b>struts</b> adjacent to the front position of the test chamber. However, remaining interference {{and a lack of}} detecting any age-related degradation prevent the use of the NMR system as a non-destructive surveillance test for OPPs. A cursory evaluation of the system with cellular silicone samples obtained more uniform results with increased error as measurements approached the sampleâ€™s edge...|$|R

5000|$|After the Liberators short {{occupation}} Captain America {{helped in}} {{the rebuilding of}} New York City until {{he found out that}} his old Nazi nemesis Arnim Zola did not die; instead the O.S.S. rescued him so as to harvest his intellect on the post-war super soldier program. Later they mapped his brain and created an artificial intelligence out of it before the tumors he had could degrade his mind. A white survivalist group called the [...] "Marauders" [...] attacked the military base where Arnim Zola's AI was being held and stole this intelligence, along with some other weaponry. Cap was furious at this and immediately went with the Falcon to Missouri to stop the Marauders and Zola. Unknown to Cap Arnim Zola was then able to convince the leader of the [...] "Marauders" [...] to allow Zola to experiment on him. Zola mutated the man until he was approximately 20-foot (6.1 m) tall and installed armor plating (and Zola's AI brain) on him with a hologram of Zola projected from the chest. He then took over the [...] "Marauders" [...] and got them to gather people for his experiments. Once they found the Marauder's camp Cap held off the marauders and Zola's new monster Seigsoldat-X while the Falcon freed the Prisoners. Together with the freed prisoners they tore apart Seigsoldat-X until all that remained was the Arnim Zola AI whereupon, Captain America collapsed a <b>support</b> <b>strut</b> onto the Zola AI, finally bringing an end to the Nazi.|$|E

40|$|Background {{noise levels}} are {{measured}} in the NASA Ames Research Center 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel following installation of a sound-absorbent lining on the test-section walls. Results show that the fan-drive noise dominated the empty test-section background noise at airspeeds below 120 knots. Above 120 knots, the test-section broadband background noise was dominated by wind-induced dipole noise (except at lower harmonics of fan blade-passage tones) most likely generated at the microphone or microphone <b>support</b> <b>strut.</b> Third-octave band and narrow-band spectra are presented for several fan operating conditions and test-section airspeeds. The background noise levels can be reduced by making improvements to the microphone wind screen or <b>support</b> <b>strut.</b> Empirical equations are presented relating variations of fan noise with fan speed or blade-pitch angle. An empirical expression for typical fan noise spectra is also presented. Fan motor electric power consumption {{is related to the}} noise generation. Preliminary measurements of sound absorption by the test-section lining indicate that the 152 mm thick lining will adequately absorb test-section model noise at frequencies above 300 Hz...|$|E

40|$|Velocity {{measurements}} {{were made in}} the near wake of the front wheel of a Formula One car using a laser Doppler anemometer. Tests were carried out on a 50 % scale in a closed-return three-quarter open-jet wind tunnel. Three configurations were investigated to determine the effect of both the car and an external wheel <b>support</b> <b>strut</b> on the wheel wake. In each of the configurations the test Reynolds number, based on the wheel diameter, was 6. 8 Ã— 105. Three components of the velocity were measured at two planes less than than 1. 0 D(whereDis the wheel diameter) downstream of the wheel axis. These data were used to visualise the extent of the wake, the flow structures present and also the streamwise turbulence intensity. The presence of the car was found to alter significantly the structure of the wheel wake when compared with an isolated wheel. In addition, the external <b>support</b> <b>strut</b> was found to have less impact {{in the presence of the}} car than previous isolated wheel studies have suggested. No previous such studies appear to have been published in the open literature...|$|E
