Let {{the height of the}} pyramid be equal to h[*]=[*] 0.7 (c 2 [*]−[*]c 1) of the S 2 face edge, then we can disregard forces acting on the pyramid sides to plot stress distribution along the y 1 axis. Thus, the analytical solution for this option does not change and will match the solution for rectangular parallelepiped <b>shape</b> <b>cavity.</b> As one can see in the graphs, stress distribution for a pyramid <b>shape</b> <b>cavity</b> almost completely coincides with the one for a parallelepiped cavity.|$|R
50|$|Gravitational failure {{includes}} {{shallow and}} rotational slides, slab and cantilever failures, and earthflows and dry granular flows. It {{is the process}} of detaching sediment primarily from a cohesive bank and transporting it fluvially.Shallow failure occurs where a layer of material moves along planes parallel to bank surfaces. Failure is typical of soils with low cohesion, and occurs when the angle of the bank exceeds the angle of internal friction. Small to medium-sized blocks are forced out at or near the base of the river bank due to excessive pore water pressure and overburden. The slab of material in {{the lower half of the}} bank will fall out, leaving an alcove <b>shaped</b> <b>cavity.</b> Failure is usually associated with steep banks and saturated finer grained cohesive bank materials that allow buildup of positive pore water pressure and strong seepage within structure. Popout failure is when small to medium-sized blocks are forced out at or near the base of the river bank due to excessive pore water pressure and overburden.

If the mask edges are aligned along the directions comprises { 111 } planes, wet anisotropic etching provides microstructures with smooth sidewalls due {{to the emergence of}} { 111 } planes at these directions. The angle between sidewall and wafer surface depends on the wafer orientation. Moreover, the number of directions along which { 111 } planes appear depend on the orientation of wafer surface. In the case of { 100 } wafer, four { 111 } planes making an angle of 54.7 ° with wafer surface expose at ⟨ 110 ⟩ directions. Hence { 100 } wafer is suitable to fabricate rectangular <b>shaped</b> <b>cavities</b> or suspended structures over rectangular <b>shape</b> <b>cavity</b> using wet anisotropic etching [3, 6, 12, 21].

Therefore, in order to fabricate microstructures with vertical sidewalls { 110 } wafer is a most appropriate choice [10, 28 – 34].

By this method, we optimized the ARCs to obtain about 0. 46 of the total radiated energy in divergence angle of 40 degree in the far field.
