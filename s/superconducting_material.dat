5|$|The actual <b>superconducting</b> <b>material</b> {{is often}} written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity. The {{reason for this is}} still not clear, but it is known that the {{vacancies}} occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E
25|$|The {{order of}} the superconducting phase {{transition}} was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no latent heat. However, {{in the presence of}} an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated that, as a consequence, when the magnetic field is increased beyond the critical field, the resulting phase transition leads to a decrease in the temperature of the <b>superconducting</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
25|$|The GP-B gyro {{consists}} of a nearly-perfect spherical rotating mass made of fused quartz, which provides a dielectric support for {{a thin layer of}} niobium <b>superconducting</b> <b>material.</b> To eliminate friction found in conventional bearings, the rotor assembly is centered by the electric field from six electrodes. After the initial spin-up by a jet of helium which brings the rotor to 4,000 RPM, the polished gyroscope housing is evacuated to an ultra-high vacuum to further reduce drag on the rotor. Provided the suspension electronics remain powered, the extreme rotational symmetry, lack of friction, and low drag will allow the angular momentum of the rotor to keep it spinning for about 15,000 years.|$|E

25|$|A {{superconductor}} {{with little}} or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value Hc. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of <b>superconducting</b> <b>material</b> containing no field. In Type II superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical value H'c1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength H'c2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are TypeI, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are TypeII.|$|E

40|$|The oxide perovskites are a {{large family}} of {{materials}} with many important physical properties.

The high Tc copper oxides are the most famous examples of superconducting perovskites, but there are many others [1]. Intermetallic compounds have been the source of many <b>superconducting</b> <b>materials</b> in the past, but they have been eclipsed in recent years by the perovskite oxides.

5000|$|The {{next great}} {{milestone}} in understanding how matter behaves at extreme cold temperatures occurred in 1933. German researchers Walther Meissner (above left) and Robert Ochsenfeld (above right) {{discovered that a}} <b>superconducting</b> <b>material</b> will repel a magnetic field (below graphic). A magnet moving by a conductor induces currents in the conductor. This is the principle on which the electric generator operates. But, in a superconductor the induced currents exactly mirror the field that would have otherwise penetrated the <b>superconducting</b> <b>material</b> - causing the magnet to be repulsed. This phenomenon is known as strong diamagnetism and is today {{often referred to as}} the [...] "Meissner effect" [...] (an eponym). The Meissner effect is so strong that a magnet can actually be levitated over a superconductive material.|$|E
5000|$|An {{exponential}} {{increase in}} heat capacity near the critical temperature also suggests an energy bandgap for the <b>superconducting</b> <b>material.</b> As superconducting vanadium is warmed toward its critical temperature, its heat capacity increases massively {{in a very}} few degrees; this suggests an energy gap being bridged by thermal energy.|$|E
50|$|The kinetic {{inductance}} detector (KID) {{is based}} on measuring the change in kinetic inductance caused by the absorption of photons in a thin strip of <b>superconducting</b> <b>material.</b> The change in inductance is typically measured via {{the change in the}} resonant frequency of a microwave resonator, and hence these detectors are also known as microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs).|$|E
