5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a hat that they found in a nearby gutter. The police took moulds of the footprints and endeavored to trace the hat, but with no success. However, during routine questioning of local residents, police learned that earlier in {{the afternoon of the}} murder, a man had been seen sitting with a heavily-pregnant young woman on a bench at one end of South Cliff Avenue; the man had also been seen wandering the street while the young woman <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> alone, leading police to suspect that the man was assessing the lay of the land.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} season of Italian football, Milan failed to win a trophy, and Blomqvist often <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench.</b> He nearly decided against going to Old Trafford {{because he did not}} want a repeat of this season. The {{defending}} champions had an equally disappointing season, finishing 11th in Serie A and failing to qualify for European football. Blomqvist was subsequently sold to Serie A runners up Parma in the summer of 1997. Blomqvist enjoyed more regular football, although the club finished 6th in the league and missed out on the knockout stages of the Champions League. The Swede's sole league goal for the club was scored in a 4–0 win over Napoli at Stadio San Paolo.|$|E

He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team's victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn't know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family's, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind the counter each time he went in.|$|E

25|$|Born in Plymouth, Devon, he {{was part}} of the Plymouth Argyle centre of excellence, before at the age of {{fourteen}} he chose to sign for Norwich City as an associate schoolboy, having been scouted by Gordon Bennett, whilst rejecting offers from Everton and Bristol City. Way spent the next two years travelling from Plymouth to Norwich, spending seven hours there and seven hours back on the train each weekend, along with future Wales international and Liverpool striker Craig Bellamy who he used to meet in Bristol. While progressing through the youth ranks at Norwich, Way played for the England schoolboys side on six occasions, alongside Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen. In May 1999, Way signed a one-year professional contract and <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> for a number of first team matches. Having only made six appearances for the reserve side in the 1999–2000 season, in March 2000, Way was informed by Norwich manager Bryan Hamilton that he would be released at the end of the season. Following this Way had a trial with Second Division side Bristol Rovers playing a game for their reserve side. On 26 April 2000, he was released from his contract having not made an appearance for the Norwich first team.|$|E
500|$|The scene between Mark and Leslie at the pit was {{mirrored}} {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", which aired in May 2010 and was Mark's final appearance as a regular cast member. During that scene, the two overlook {{what was once the}} pit, but was now a filled-in lot, and Mark gives her construction plans for a park before kissing her goodbye on the cheek and leaving. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> and kissed, and it seemed like they might be getting back together. This year, they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." ...|$|E

500|$|The Lightning signed Cullen to a one-year, $500,000 {{contract}} for the 1998–99 season. He played his first game in nearly 18 months on September 18, 1998, in an exhibition game between the Lightning and Sabres at Innsbruck, Austria. [...] Cullen scored the game-winning goal in a 3–1 victory, after which he said he <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> in disbelief over how {{he was given a}} second chance. [...] He was named to the roster and was greeted with a loud standing ovation by the fans in Tampa Bay when he was introduced prior to their season opening game.|$|E
500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] was {{the final}} episode to include Paul Schneider in any {{capacity}} after his two seasons as regular cast member as Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider left the series, and though Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having him return for guest appearances in future episodes, Schneider stated {{that he was not}} interested in returning and had never been contacted about it. The final scene between Leslie and Mark in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", in which the two sit together at Lot 48, mirrors their scenes together in the first season finale, [...] "Rock Show", in which the two shared a kiss while overlooking the lot while it was still a construction pit. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale.

This year, they <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bench</b> and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." [...] The bench they sit in during that scene is the same one they sat on during their kiss scene in [...] "Rock Show". Throughout the second season, that bench was in Leslie's office. Schur said, [...] "We decided that in the reality of the show she brought it to the lot for this moment. It's {{a little bit of a}} stretch, but, you know." ...|$|E
