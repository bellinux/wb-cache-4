Each power car has 4 traction motors connected in a <b>series-parallel</b> <b>connection.</b> The traction motor clamp voltage is controlled by means of starting resistances, as well as by changing the motors' connectivity and by field weakening. They are protected from electrical surges by various protective units: a fast-acting circuit breaker, an overload relay, a differential relay, etc. Early units also had a fuse in the traction motor circuit, but later units had more reliable protective equipment, which led to the fuse being removed as redundant.|$|E

50|$|To {{accelerate}} the train still further, the traction motors are reconnected in <b>series-parallel</b> <b>connection</b> (2 parallel circuits with 2 series-connected traction motors in each). For this purpose, in starting notch #12 the controller closes {{a pair of}} parallel contactors and opens the bridge contactor. After this the controller moves to starting notch #13, which closes contactors #1 and #2 and opens both field-weakening contactors; this assembles 2 parallel circuits, each of which comprises 2 traction motors {{and a group of}} starting resistances connected in series and has a total resistance of 4.97 ohm. Further notching out of the controller shorts out the starting resistances in pairs until in starting notch #16 all of the starting resistances are shorted out; this corresponds to running notch #3 on the engineer's controller. Moving the controller to starting notch #17 weakens the traction motor field to 67%, and in starting notch #18 the field is weakened to 50%. Starting notch #18 corresponds to running notch #4 on the engineer's controller; this is the maximum notch and allows the train to reach top speed. To coast, the engineer moves the controller handle to 0; this opens the line contactors, thereby shutting off all power to the traction motors, and moves the controller into starting notch #1 (therefore if the traction motors are turned on again, they are connected in series and all the starting resistances are in the circuit).|$|E

Due to location constraints many of these arrays will be installed in locations where the array receives partial shading during part {{or all of the}} day due to trees or other structures. Many purchasers of PV arrays will research the efficiency of the solar panels but give very little attention to the configuration of the PV array. The order of series and parallel connections of the array to increase voltage and current respectively greatly affects the overall efficiency of the PV array when it is partially shaded. ^ In this thesis, the effects of partial shading on PV arrays are modeled and simulated using MATLAB Simulink®®.

40|$|Optimisation {{techniques}} {{are used for}} the design of novel forced-periodic reactors in which there is the integration of catalytic reaction, adsorptive separation and direct fluid to solid heat exchange within a single unit operation. For such configurations, dynamic operation is utilised to generate favourable temperature (catalyst activity) profiles, and, through in situ separation, to provide reaction enhancement and the enriched recovery of the primary product(s). The work thus involves aspects of thermal and concentration swing adsorption, reverse (or bidirectional) flow reactor operation, and thermal regeneration. The design methodology is based on fully discretised mathematical models, upon which periodic constraints are imposed to yield direct cyclic steady state solutions. The models are then formulated as non-linear programming problems to yield optimal operating schedules and conditions. Models are developed for general endothermic and equilibrium limited reaction schemes; as a case study, specific consideration is given to the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane to toluene over and admixture of Pt-Al 2 O 3 catalyst and zeolite 5 A adsorbent. When compared to an equivalent and optimally operated adiabatic plug flow reactor, design and operating conditions are calculated for both single and multistage configurations in which there are significant improvements in reactant conversion, with the additional benefit of the bulk separation of the product species. These qualities of the hybrid reactors are attained for energy inputs (i. e. feed pre-heat requirements) which do not exceed that of the equivalent steady flow reactor. The results also predict larger improvements in reactor performance when there is greater flexibility {{in the way in which}} heat and material are introduced into the reactor systems.

In this work, various photovoltaic (PV) module layouts are investigated, using both full-size solar cells and halved solar cells. The performance of these module layouts is investigated under conditions where one or more cells in the module are partially shaded. A solar cell equivalent circuit model has been implemented in the SPICE soft ware Micro-Cap to investigate several different module configurations. Module configurations investigated include a standard 72 -cell module with 3 bypass diodes, one new configuration with a series of six matrices (whereby each matrix consists of two parallel strings of 12 halved cells each) with 3 bypass diodes, and another configuration with a series of 72 cells (whereby each matrix consists of two halved cells in parallel) with 3 bypass diodes.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of a {{two-dimensional}} array of cold-electron bolometers with distributed dipole antennas in the focal plane for high-sensitivity polarization measurements is proposed. The concept gives a unique combination of high polarization resolution due to a large uniforms array of cold-electron bolometers and optimal matching with {{junction field effect transistor}} (JFET) amplifiers because of flexibility in direct-current connections. The noise characteristics are improved due to arriving-signal power distribution among numerous cold-electron bolometers and an increase in their response. This should lead to {{a significant increase in the}} sensitivity and dynamic range compared with competing alternative bolometer technologies. The reliability of the two-dimensional array significantly increases due to a <b>series-parallel</b> <b>connection</b> of a large number of cold-electron bolometers.

40|$|Abstract — Photovoltaic (PV) {{systems are}} often subject to partial shading that {{significantly}} degrades the output {{power of the}} whole systems. Reconfiguration methods have been proposed to adaptively change the PV panel configuration according to the current partial shading pattern. The reconfigurable PV panel architecture integrates every PV cell with three programmable switches to facilitate the PV panel reconfiguration. The additional switches, however, increase the capital cost of the PV system. In this paper, we group a number of PV cells into a PV macro-cell, and the PV panel reconfiguration only changes the connections between adjacent PV macro-cells. The size and internal structure (i. e., the <b>series-parallel</b> <b>connection</b> of PV cells) of all PV macro-cells are the same {{and will not be}} changed after PV system installation in the field. Determining the optimal size of the PV macro-cell {{is the result of a}} trade-off between the decreased PV system capital cost and enhanced PV system performance. A larger PV macro-cell reduces the cost overhead whereas a smaller PV macro-cell achieves better performance. In this paper, we set out to calculate the optimal size of the PV macro-cells such that the maximum system performance can be achieved subject to an overall system cost limitation. This "design " problem is solved using an efficient search algorithm. In addition, we provide for in-field reconfigurability of the PV panel by enabling formation of seriesconnected groups of parallel-connected macro-cells. We ensure maximum output power for the PV system in response to any incurring partial shading pattern. This "architecture optimization" problem is solved using dynamic programming. I...|$|E
