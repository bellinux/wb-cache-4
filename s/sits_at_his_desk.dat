500|$|The Distrest Poet is an oil {{painting}} produced sometime around 1736 by the British artist William Hogarth. Reproduced as an etching and engraving, {{it was published}} in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740. The scene was probably inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad. [...] It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> in the dormer and, scratching his head, stares at the papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing.

500|$|Masereel uses an emotional, Expressionistic {{style to}} create a {{narrative}} replete with allegory, satire, and social criticism—a visual style he continued with throughout his career. [...] He expresses a broad variety of emotions through understated, unexaggerated gestures. [...] Most characters are given simple, passive expressions, which provides emphatic contrast with characters expressing more explicit emotion—love, despair, ecstasy. [...] He considered Passionate Journey partly autobiographical, which he emphasized {{with a pair of}} self-portraits that open the book—in the first, Masereel <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> with his woodcutting tools, and in the second appears the protagonist, dressed in identical fashion with the first.

You know her publisher, Mr Tiber, {{is one of the most}} successful men in the business; also generous, kind, and the soul of honour--as his treatment of Aunty proves. Well, I've rather hankered for that place; for I love books, and as I can't make them I'd like to publish them. That needs some literary taste and judgement, it brings you in contact with fine people, and is an education in itself. Whenever I go into that large, handsome room to see Mr Tiber for Aunt Jo, I always want to stay; for it's lined with books and pictures, famous men and women come and go, and Mr Tiber <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> like a sort of king, receiving his subjects; for the greatest authors are humble to him, and wait his Yes or No with anxiety. Of course I've nothing to do with all that, and may never have; but I like to see it, and the atmosphere is so different from the dark offices and hurly-burly of many other trades, where nothing but money is talked about, that it seems another world, and I feel at home in it. Yes, I'd rather beat the door-mats and make fires there than be head clerk in the great hide and leather store at a big salary.'

500|$|Several {{scenes were}} created due to onset {{accidents}} and ad-libbing. In the cold opening, Dwight tries to impress Jim with his recently purchased [...] "fitness orb". Initially dismissive, Jim pops the ball after Dwight becomes increasingly obnoxious and troublesome. Before filming, the scene had been successfully rehearsed [...] "about ten times"; each time, when Krasinski punctured the plastic, the ball slowly deflated. However, {{when it came}} time to film the scene, Krasinski accidentally hit the ball [...] "right on the seam", resulting in Wilson quickly—and dramatically—hitting the carpet. In fact, several of the cast members in the background can be seen laughing, due to the unexpected nature of the shot. Initially, the cut was relegated to the blooper reel, but Wilmore pleaded with Daniels to include it in the finished episode. The [...] "accidental boob grab" [...] scene was based on a mistake made by Carell during a rehearsal. Originally, he was supposed to pat Hardin's shoulder. Instead, however, he accidentally brushed past her breast. Hardin, finding the accident [...] "hilarious", demanded that Carell do it during the actual shooting. Furthermore, several of the scenes were improvised beyond the initial lines given to Steve Carell and Melora Hardin, such as the ending wherein Michael and Jan have a discussion about Michael's flaws. Wilson recounts that he had to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> for [...] "an hour and a half" [...] due to the ad libbing.|$|R

5000|$|The earlier {{films in}} the series were of a more serious nature and tone, whereas this {{installment}} leans more toward camp: [...] "Dr. Louis Flellis" [...] <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> {{in front of a}} glowing red lava lamp, with a plastic skeletal foot on the desk in front of him during introductions to most sequences.

60|$|One {{scorching}} {{afternoon in}} July Colonel Carvel {{came into the}} office, too hurried to remark the pain in honest Ephum's face as he watched his master. The sure signs of a harassed man were on the Colonel. Since May he had neglected his business affairs for others which he deemed public, and which were so mysterious that even Mr. Hopper could not get wind of them. These matters had taken the Colonel out of town. But now {{the necessity of a}} pass made that awkward, and he went no farther than Glencoe, where he spent an occasional Sunday. Today Mr. Hopper rose from his chair when Mr. Carvel entered,--a most unprecedented action. The Colonel cleared <b>his</b> throat. <b>Sitting</b> down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk,</b> he drummed upon it uneasily.|$|R
5000|$|Upon {{joining the}} United States Treasury Department's Intelligence Unit in 1920, the former {{accountant}} Wilson would earn a reputation throughout Prohibition as a thorough, if not obsessive, investigator of tax returns and income."Wilson fears nothing that walks.

Irey"Wilson sweats ice water" [...] - Suspect who was interrogated by Frank J. WilsonIn 1929 President Herbert Hoover and Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon decided to do whatever it would take to put notorious gangster and bootlegger Al Capone behind bars. They had been trying to get Capone for quite some time but Eliot Ness, and his group called the Untouchables (law enforcement) were unable to succeed in this effort. The two men then decided to bring the Treasury Departments Special Intelligence Unit, headed by Elmer L. Irey to take point on the investigation. Ness and the [...] "Untouchables" [...] were working under the Bureau of Prohibition tried to use brute force to take down Capone. They did manage to take some of Capone's illegal establishments out of the picture, but Ness was not the best at law enforcement. Oftentimes Ness would <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> all day calling the newspapers instead of trying to get a step closer to bringing in Capone. This is when President Hoover, Mellon, and Irey devised a new plan based on the 1927 Supreme Court decision in U.S. v.Sullivan. The case declared that any criminal activities that yield an income are subject to income taxes.|$|R
60|$|With {{the last}} chapter of Denis Duval was {{published}} in the magazine a set of notes on the book, taken for the most part from Thackeray's own papers, and showing how much collateral work he had given to the fabrication of his novel. No doubt in preparing other tales, especially Esmond, a very large amount of such collateral labour was found necessary. He was a man who did very much of such work, delighting to deal in little historical incidents. They will be found in almost everything that he did, and I do not know that he was ever accused of gross mistakes. But I doubt whether on that account he should be called a laborious man. He could go down to Winchelsea, when writing about the little town, to see in which way the streets lay, and to provide himself with what we call local colouring. He could jot down the suggestions, as they came to his mind, of his future story. There was an irregularity in such work which was to his taste. His very notes would be delightful to read, partaking of the nature of pearls when prepared only for his own use. But he could not bring himself to <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> and do an allotted task day after day. He accomplished what must be considered as quite a sufficient life's work. He had about twenty-five years for the purpose, and that which he has left is an ample produce for the time. Nevertheless {{he was a man of}} fits and starts, who, not having been in his early years drilled to method, never achieved it in his career.|$|R

25|$|After breakfast, the Prince, {{accompanied}} by the playful Bendicò, goes into his office, which is lined with century-old paintings of the Salina family's estates. As he <b>sits</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> cluttered <b>desk,</b> the Prince recalls how much he dislikes both {{the room and the}} work it represents. This dislike intensifies during visits from his accountant and one of his tenants, both of whom are allied with the Redshirts. Both of them assure the Prince that the unification of Italy will be peaceful and will benefit everyone, including the nobility. The Prince allows himself to be reassured, certain that the class system will remain unchanged no matter what. The Prince's visit to the Salina chaplain, Father Pirrone, atop a tower where the men practice their joint hobby of astronomy, reinforces this belief.|$|R

House orders Kutner to pay for the dry cleaning and storms out, leading Thirteen to question why Kutner is still alive after a prank like that, and to marvel at the fact that he got the cat to urinate on the chair. As he walks out, Kutner replies, [...] "Yeah. A cat." [...] His ironic tone prompts Thirteen to realize that it was Kutner's own urine on House's chair much to Thirteen's own disgust.|$|R
60|$|It was in {{his form}} that Philip was put on {{entering}} the school. The Rev. B. B. Gordon was a man by nature ill-suited to be a schoolmaster: he was impatient and choleric. With no one to call him to account, with only small boys to face him, he had long lost all power of self-control. He began his work in a rage and ended it in a passion. He {{was a man of}} middle height and of a corpulent figure; he had sandy hair, worn very short and now growing gray, and a small bristly moustache. His large face, with indistinct features and small blue eyes, was naturally red, but during his frequent attacks of anger it grew dark and purple. His nails were bitten to the quick, for while some trembling boy was construing he would <b>sit</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> shaking with the fury that consumed him, and gnaw his fingers. Stories, perhaps exaggerated, were told of his violence, and two years before there had been some excitement in the school when it was heard that one father was threatening a prosecution: he had boxed the ears of a boy named Walters with a book so violently that his hearing was affected and the boy had to be taken away from the school. The boy's father lived in Tercanbury, and there had been much indignation in the city, the local paper had referred to the matter; but Mr. Walters was only a brewer, so the sympathy was divided. The rest of the boys, for reasons best known to themselves, though they loathed the master, took his side in the affair, and, to show their indignation that the school's business had been dealt with outside, made things as uncomfortable as they could for Walters' younger brother, who still remained. But Mr. Gordon had only escaped the country living by the skin of his teeth, and he had never hit a boy since. The right the masters possessed to cane boys on the hand was taken away from them, and Squirts could no longer emphasize his anger by beating <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> with the cane. He never did more now than take a boy by the shoulders and shake him. He still made a naughty or refractory lad stand with one arm stretched out for anything from ten minutes to half an hour, and he was as violent as before with his tongue.|$|R

He also notices that Manise is still outside and manages to shake his tail, then he rushes home turning the house upside down looking for something and finds Cécile's notes on him, he changes his will: nothing for Cécile or Claire, all for the children with a warning not to trust their mother.|$|E

On July 11, 2005, the show premiered in its new studio, NEP Studio 52, at 733 11th Avenue, a few blocks west of its former location.The set of the new studio was given a sleeker, more formal look, including a backdrop of three large projection screens. The traditional guests couch, which had {{been a part of the}} set since the shows premiere, was done away with in favor of simple upright chairs. The change was initially not well-received, spawning a backlash among some fans and prompting a [...] "Bring Back the Couch" [...] campaign. The campaign was mentioned on subsequent shows by Stewart and supported by Daily Show contributor Bob Wiltfong. The couch was eventually featured in a sweepstakes in which the winner received the couch, round-trip tickets to New York, tickets to the show, and a small sum of money.On April 9, 2007, the show debuted a new set. The projection screens were revamped (with one large screen behind Stewart, while the smaller one behind the interview subject remained the same), a large, global map directly behind Stewart, a more open studio floor, and a J-shaped desk supported at one end by a globe. The intro was also updated; the graphics, display names, dates, and logos were all changed.|$|E

However Sasha, armed with {{a large piece of}} broken glass and blaming Harry for his mother's death, tries to stab him. Ruth intervenes and is stabbed instead. She dies from her injuries before help can arrive, leaving Harry to mourn the loss of his love. In a telephone conversation with Towers sometime later, it is evident that Harry is considering leaving the service. It also becomes clear that Harry has engaged an outside agency to assassinate Mikhail Levrov (Jeffry Wickham) and his co-conspirators. Towers requests he not be informed of the details of these actions. Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) is shown walking into Levrov's house for an appointment with him. Harry is then seen entering the memorial area of Thames House with the names of all the MI5 officers who died in service, some of whom were characters who were killed during the series (Danny Hunter, Fiona Carter, Colin Wells, Zafar Younis, Ben Kaplan, Adam Carter, Jo Portman, Ros Myers, Ruth).

40|$|A {{dramatic}} portrayal, clearly {{biased toward}} the northern point of view, of {{an incident in}} Congress which inflamed sectional passions in 1856. The artist recreates the May 22 attack and severe beating of Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner by Representative Preston S. Brooks of South Carolina. Brooks's actions were provoked by Sumner's insulting public remarks against his cousin, Senator Andrew Pickens Butler, and against Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas, delivered in the Senate two days earlier. The print shows an enraged Brooks (right) standing over the seated Sumner in the Senate chamber, about to land on him a heavy blow of his cane. The unsuspecting Sumner <b>sits</b> writing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk.</b> <b>At</b> left is another group. Brooks's fellow South Carolinian Representative Lawrence M. Keitt stands in the center, raising his own cane menacingly to stay possible intervention by the other legislators present. Clearly no help for Sumner is forthcoming. Behind Keitt's back, concealed in his left hand, Keitt holds a pistol. In the foreground are Georgia senator Robert Toombs (far left) and Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas (hands in pockets) looking vindicated by the event. Behind them elderly Kentucky senator John J. Crittenden is restrained by a fifth, unidentified man. Above the scene is a quote from Henry Ward Beecher's May 31 speech at a Sumner rally in New York, where he proclaimed, "The symbol of the North is the pen; {{the symbol of the}} South is the bludgeon. " David Tatham attributes the print to the Bufford shop, and suggests that the Library's copy of the print, the only known example, may have been a trial impression, and that the print may not actually have been released. The attribution to Homer was first made by Milton Kaplan. Probably printed by John H. Bufford, Boston. Signed with monogram: WH (Winslow Homer). Title appears as it is written on the item.
