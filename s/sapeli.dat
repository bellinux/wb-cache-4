40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the light {{permanency}} changes of some chosen tropical woods. Their trade names are garapa (Apuleia Leiocarpau), angelim (Hymenolobium Petraeum), meranti (Shorea spp), <b>sapeli</b> (Entandrophragma cylindricum), merbau (Intsia bijuga), massaranduba (Manikara), teak (Tectona grandis), iroko (Chlorophora excelsa) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus grandis). The woods are surface modified by means of four different surface modifications both with and without a usage of an alcohol base. All samples were lighted up by artificial sunlight from the xenon lamp for 106 hours by lighting 209, 7 KJ/m 2. The colour changes were measured during the exposition according to the greyscale and spectrophotometer in the CIEL *a*b* color model. Then the individual woods' color changes depending on the surface modification were assessed by the color difference deltaE*...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} two goals. One {{of them are}} {{business}} contacts with suppliers, the second is inventory management in the enterprise. Suppliers are very important for any business partner, without which it couldn`t produce, but its conditions differs in business and technical matter. It doesnt have to be based only on the deppartment diferences or company size. Companies surveyed {{in this study were}} both productive and similary sized. What made the difference was, the used material and production complexity. The company <b>Sapeli</b> has possibility of higher standard offer and therefore even compoundable evaluation especially thanks to easier accessability. The most important for the company is quality, price, delivery terms and payment options. Both companies have in common the first place given to quality above all. It has increasing importance today as world markets are saturated with poor quality products and large companies can gain greater market share mainly due to the quality...|$|E
40|$|Wavelength, power density, pulse duration, {{repetition}} rate of laser irradiation for modification {{of wood and}} surface melting processes by laser beam {{that can be seen}} from microscopic observations (SEM) were studied. The absorption of the laser beam varies with the changing wood structure during irradiation. The chemical composition, particularly the distribution of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin in the cell wall, leads to the observed changes of the threshold values for intensity and interaction time. A field of irradiation parameters has been determined which guarantees melting of wood without pyrolysis. The surface temperature is assumed to be not higher than 200 deg C because above this temperature carbonising of hemicellulose and lignin is expected. It has been found that irradiation with Nd:YAG-laser (1, 064 micron) requires an 8 to 1000 times higher beam intensity than irradiation with CO 2 - laser (10. 6 micron), depending on irradiation time, to obtain about the same effect. Both wetting behaviour and water absorption of all wood species tested here were changed by laser irradiation. The largest effect of laser irradiation was observed with spruce whereas only slight changes were obtained with <b>sapeli.</b> Until recently laser application in wood technology has been restricted to a few techniques of cutting, perforating and engraving of wood and wood products. In view of this state of art it is highly justified to apply contemporary methods of material science to wood for better understanding of its structure and diverse properties in order to modify them with the aim of extended use...|$|E
