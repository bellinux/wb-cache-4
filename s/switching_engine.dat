40|$|This reasearch studies ACO {{algorithms}} for the <b>switch</b> <b>engine</b> scheduling in a Railroad Yard. The {{cars are}} moved individually or grouped into blocks {{by a set}} of locomotives called <b>switch</b> <b>engines</b> which are dedicated to moving around the cars in the yard. The need for moving {{comes from the fact that}} the arriving trains are disassembled into blocks of cars, undergo some operations like, loading, unloading and cleaning and finally are assembled into a new train. Each moving request is called a switch order. The decision of which <b>switch</b> <b>engine</b> will execute which switch order and the sequence of that executution is the core of our problem. The optimization of this schedule reduces the overall operational costs of the yard as weel as the time to assemble new trains, thus leading to a more productive railroad system. The problem can be summarized as follows: Given the information about the railroad yard layout, the <b>switch</b> <b>engines</b> currently located in it and a list containing all pending planned switch orders the goal is to determine an assignment of <b>switch</b> <b>engines</b> to <b>switch</b> orders, and a sequencing of these such that none of th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—An optical true-time delay {{device that}} uses a binary {{counting}} system in a modified White cell is demonstrated. The <b>switching</b> <b>engine</b> uses four spherical mirrors and a three-state digital micromirror array. The delay part, as designed, provides 6 bits of delay ranging from 78 ps to 5 ns, {{using a combination of}} dielectric blocks for short delays and lens trains for longer ones. Long lens trains are folded for compactness. The authors describe the design and demonstrate two of the 6 bits of delays experimentally. Delays were accurate to within the measurement resolution of 1. 25 ps. The insertion loss varied from 3. 1 – 5. 2 dB, depending on delay. It was found that the micromirrors do not contribute significantly to the loss.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} an application-specific processor with emphasis on packet processing applications. In this domain, demands for increasing the performance and the ongoing development of network protocols both call for flexible and performance-optimized engines. We present a flexible engine that is optimized for packet switching operations. The architecture and instruction set of our packet <b>switching</b> <b>engine</b> is designed based on a quantita-tive study of packet switching applications. Based on the extracted guidelines, architecture of our proposed communication micro engine (CME) is designed and verified with functional simulation. Comparative results show that at least 2 - 3 times performance gain {{can be achieved by}} using CME. A single CME core operates at 400 Mbps, while it has an area of 1. 6 mm 2 and consumes 60 mW of power when synthesized in 0. 13 µm CMOS technology...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} that Internet service hosting centres use several logical pools to assign server {{resources}} to different applications, {{and that they}} try to achieve the highest total revenue by making efficient use of these resources. In this paper, multi-tiered enterprise systems are modelled as multi-class closed queueing networks, with each network station corresponding to each application tier. In such queueing networks, bottlenecks can limit overall system performance, and thus should be avoided. We propose a bottleneck-aware server switching policy, which responds to system bottlenecks and switches servers to alleviate these problems as necessary. The <b>switching</b> <b>engine</b> compares the benefits and penalties of a potential switch, and makes a {{decision as to whether}} {{it is likely to be}} worthwhile switching. We also propose a simple admission control scheme, in addition to the switching policy, to deal with system overloading and optimise the total revenue of multiple applications in the hosting centre. Performance evaluation has been done via simulation and results are compared with those from a proportional switching policy and also a system that implements no switching policy. The experimental results show that the combination of the bottleneck-aware switching policy and the admission control scheme consistently outperforms the other two policies in terms of revenue contribution. ...|$|E
