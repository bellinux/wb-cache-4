5|$|Following the impressive-enough {{sales of}} their first <b>Star</b> <b>Wars</b> game of , Parker Brothers went on to {{continue}} developing <b>Star</b> <b>Wars</b> titles, {{one of which is}} Star Wars: Jedi Arena, programmed by Rex Bradford.

2500|$|Losing a <b>star</b> <b>war</b> {{could be}} {{disastrous}} for the defeated party. The first recorded <b>star</b> <b>war</b> in 562, between Caracol and Tikal, {{resulted in a}} 120-year hiatus for the latter city. It saw a decline in Tikal's population, a cessation of monument erection, {{and the destruction of}} certain monuments in the Great Plaza. When Calakmul defeated Naranjo in a <b>star</b> <b>war</b> on December 24, 631, it resulted in Naranjo's ruler being tortured to death and possibly eaten. Another <b>star</b> <b>war</b> in February 744 resulted in Tikal sacking Caracol and capturing a personal god effigy of its ruler. An inscription from a monument found at Tortuguero (dating from 669) describes the aftermath of a star war: [...] "the blood was pooled, the skulls were piled".|$|R

Henson suggested to <b>Star</b> <b>Wars</b> creator George Lucas, himself a Muppets fan, that he use Frank Oz as the puppeteer and voice of Yoda. Oz voiced Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back and each of the four subsequent <b>Star</b> <b>Wars</b> films.
