40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we present}} a pixel-based, discriminative {{classification}} algorithm for automatic detection of unhealthy regions in leaf images. The algorithm is designed to distinguish image pixels as belonging {{to one of the}} two classes: healthy and unhealthy. The task is solved in three steps. First, we perform segmentation to divide the image into foreground and background. In the second <b>step,</b> <b>support</b> vector machine (SVM) is applied to predict the class of each pixel belonging to the foreground. And finally, we do further refinement by neighborhood-check to omit all falsely-classified pixels from second step. The results presented in this work are based on a model plant (Arabidobsis thaliana), which forms the ideal basis for the usage of the proposed algorithm in biological researches concerning plant disease control mechanisms. ...|$|E

The personality of products is created by implicit and explicit design features. However the translation of implicit and explicit design characteristics into new designs is difficult for designers.

40|$|Pervaporation {{experiments}} with PERVAP™ 4060 membrane {{have been performed}} to study its ability to concentrate some aroma compounds identified in the brown crab boiling juice from a model dilute aqueous solution. The effect of feed concentration, pervaporation temperature and permeate pressure on the pervaporation performance of the membrane has been analyzed. The results obtained with PERVAP™ 4060 membrane were compared with experiments performed in a previous work with a POMS/PEI membrane. Membrane material {{seems to be a}} key factor in the permeate aroma profile. The presence of non-volatile compounds, such as sodium chloride, in brown crab boiling juice slightly improves pervaporation performance in the concentration range studied in this work. Batch pervaporation experiments prove that the flavor loss percentage during long operation time is high, especially for the most volatile compounds.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a machine learning method to predict polyadenylation signals (PASes) in human DNA and mRNA sequences by analysing features around them. This method {{consists of three}} sequential steps of feature manipulation: generation, selection and integration of features.

Our study shows that true PASes in DNA and mRNA sequences can be characterized by different features, and also shows that both upstream and downstream sequence elements are important for recognizing PASes from DNA sequences. We tested our method on several public data sets as well as our own extracted data sets. In most cases, we achieved better validation results than those reported previously on the same data sets. The important motifs observed are highly consistent with those reported in literature...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a two-step face {{detection}} technique is proposed. The first step uses a conventional skin detection method to extract regions of potential faces from the image database. This skin detection step {{is based on}} a Gaussian mixture model in the YCbCr colour space. In the second step faces are detected among the candidate regions by filtering out false positives from the skin colour detection module. The selection process is achieved by applying a learning approach using multiple additional features and a suitable metric in multi-feature space. The metric is derived by learning the underlying parameters using a small set of representative face samples. In this process the parameters are optimized by a Multiple Objective Optimization method based on the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy. The learned metric in multi-feature space is then applied to a conventional classifier to filter out non faces from the first processing <b>step.</b> <b>Support</b> Vector Machines and K-Nearest Neighbours classifiers are used to test the performance of the optimized metric in multi-feature space. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a methodology to analyse orographic enhancement of precipitation using sequences of radar images and a digital elevation model. Image processing techniques {{are applied to}} extract precipitation cells from radar imagery. DEM is used to derive the topographic indices potentially relevant to orographic precipitation enhancement at different spatial scales, e. g. terrain convexity and slope exposure to mesoscale flows. Two recently developed machine learning algorithms are then used to analyse {{the relationship between the}} repeatability of precipitation patterns and the underlying topography. Spectral clustering is first used to characterize stratification of the precipitation cells according to different mesoscale flows and exposure to the crest of the Alps. At a second <b>step,</b> <b>support</b> vector machine classifiers are applied to build a computational model which discriminates persistent precipitation cells from all the others (not showing a relationship to topography) in the space of topographic conditioning factors. Upwind slopes and hill tops were found to be the topographic features leading to precipitation repeatability and persistence. Maps of orographic enhancement susceptibility can be computed for a given flow, topography and forecasted smooth precipitation fields and used to improve nowcasting models or correct windward and leeward biases in numerical weather prediction models...|$|E

This paper presents a new method based on {{the definition of a}} Multiple Classifier System on Hyperspectral and LIDAR data. In the first step, the proposed method applied some feature extraction strategies on LIDAR data to produce more information in this data set.

It was our objective to assess the sensitivity of different phylogenetic methods and various phylogenetic programs to reconstruct epidemiological links among HIV- 1 infected patients that is the probability to reveal a true transmission relationship. Multiple datasets (90) were prepared consisting of HIV- 1 sequences in protease (PR) and partial reverse transcriptase (RT) sampled from patients with documented epidemiological relationship (target population), and from unrelated individuals (control population) belonging to the same HIV- 1 subtype as the target population. Each dataset varied regarding the number, the geographic origin and the transmission risk groups of the sequences among the control population. Phylogenetic trees were inferred by neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum likelihood heuristics (hML) and Bayesian methods. All clusters of sequences belonging to the target population were correctly reconstructed by NJ and Bayesian methods receiving high bootstrap and posterior probability (PP) support, respectively. On the other hand, TreePuzzle failed to reconstruct or provide significant support for several clusters; high puzzling <b>step</b> <b>support</b> was associated with the inclusion of control sequences from the same geographic area as the target population. In contrary, all clusters were correctly reconstructed by hML as implemented in PhyML 3. 0 receiving high bootstrap support.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine effects of skipping training on physical fitness, sprint ability and sprinting form. Nine non-athlete male university students participated in the training consisted of skipping exercises three days per week for eight weeks. The experiment was performed before and after the training period. The experiment was composed of measuring physical fitness and filming 100 m dash. Variables of analysis were: 1) back strength, vertical jump, stepping effeciency while sitting on a chair, 2) maximum anaerobic power, 3) isokinetic peak torque and isokinetic endurance of knee extension and flexion, and hip flexion, 4) 100 m sprint record, and sprint record in each 20 m sections, 5) running velocity, step frequency and step length, 6) thigh angle and angular velocity, and knee angle and angular velocity, 7) time for one <b>step,</b> <b>support</b> time and nonsupport time, 8) locus of ankle around trochanter major. Results were as follows: 1. Factors of physical fitness such as back strength, maximum anaerobic power and isokinetic peak torque were significantly improved after training. 2. 100 m sprint record was significantly shortened, due to the increase of step frequency. 3. After training, the maximum running velocity was kept up for a longer period, and running velocity in 80 m to 100 m became remarkably faster. 4. After training, time for one step and nonsupport time were significantly shortened. 5. The knee lift during recovery phase became significantly higher. 6. The angular velocity of thigh of recovery leg became significantly faster.
