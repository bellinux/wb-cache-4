5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E
5|$|Other {{noble gases}} would be equally {{suitable}} {{for most of}} these applications, but argon {{is by far the}} cheapest. Argon is inexpensive, since it occurs naturally in air and is readily obtained as a byproduct of cryogenic air separation in the production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen: the primary constituents of air are used on a large industrial scale. The other noble gases (except helium) are produced this way as well, but argon is the most plentiful by far. The bulk of argon applications arise <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is inert and relatively cheap.|$|E

5|$|The team {{tries to}} call for further assistance, but find the radio is no longer working. Randall heads outside to check the power transformers, and is {{attacked}} by a large creature (Ross Sturlin) hiding in the underbrush around the station. Randall fires a few shots at the creature with his pistol and escapes unscathed. Although {{he did not get}} a good look at the creature, he describes it to the rest of the team as similar in size to a bear. Later, the team finds the infirmary has been trashed and Corcoran's body is gone. They initially believe the creature has broken in and stole the corpse, but are shocked to instead find Corcoran has mysteriously regained consciousness. Upon checking his blood again, there is no trace of the mysterious cells from before, but after investigating Corcoran's body, they find the cells have changed into lizard-like fetuses and entered into his abdominal cavity. The creature later breaks into the lab again, this time beheading Dr. Wyman. Randall and Dunlap are initially suspicious that Corcoran was involved in the death, which he denies, but it appears he has some sort of telepathic connection with the creature. Despite Wyman's death, Corcoran does not believe the creature is evil, but rather simply misunderstood. He implores the others to give the creature a chance to explain its actions, and asks that they not condemn it as a monster <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is different.|$|E

25|$|In 1881 Henry Charles Coote {{argued that}} London Stone's name and {{reputation}} arose <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{was the last}} remaining fragment {{of the house of}} Henry Fitz-Ailwin of London Stone (ca. 1135–1212), the first Mayor, although London Stone was mentioned about 100 years before Henry's time, and the Fitz-Ailwin house was some distance from the Stone {{on the other side of}} St Swithin's church.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1950s {{the many}} dirt roads and cobbled roads were crucial {{sites in the}} race. Historian Tom Van Laere states that the Tour of Flanders had never set out to use poor roads– cobblestoned roads were all that were {{available}} if the race were to be long enough. In the Interwar period, Belgium's infrastructure was severely scarred by war and only the intercity roads were smooth. Roads were laid in cobblestones, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was the cheapest material at the time. After the Second World War, Belgium picked itself up from devastation and provinces began asphalting roads.|$|E

25|$|Brian did {{not free}} Ireland from a Norse (Viking) occupation, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was never conquered by the Vikings. In {{the last decade}} of the 8th century, Norse raiders began attacking targets in Ireland and, {{beginning}} in the mid-9th century, these raiders established the fortified camps that later grew into Ireland's first cities: Dublin, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford, and Cork. Within only a few generations, the Norse citizens of these cities had converted to Christianity, intermarried with the Irish, and often adopted the Irish language, dress and customs, thus becoming what historians refer to as the Hiberno-Norse.|$|E
25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> is more convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E
25|$|Cells in the sinoatrial node, {{located in}} the right atrium of the heart, spontaneously {{depolarize}} approximately 100 times per minute. Although all of the heart's cells {{have the ability to}} generate action potentials that trigger cardiac contraction, the sinoatrial node normally initiates it, <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> generates impulses slightly faster than the other areas. Hence, these cells generate the normal sinus rhythm and are called pacemaker cells as they directly control the heart rate. In the absence of extrinsic neural and hormonal control, cells in the SA node will rhythmically discharge. The sinoatrial node is richly innervated by the autonomic nervous system, which up or down regulates the spontaneous firing frequency of the pacemaker cells.|$|E

Mixing science with human and social studies, IB works on developing intellectual skills on students, as well as communication skills, investigation methods, critical analysis and argumentative abilities that are reinforced with international experiences.|$|R

25|$|Between 41 and 44 CE, Iudaea regained its nominal autonomy, when Herod Agrippa {{was made}} King of the Jews by the emperor Claudius, thus {{in a sense}} {{restoring}} the Herodian Dynasty, {{though there is no}} indication Iudaea ceased to be a Roman province <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> no longer had a prefect. Claudius had decided to allow, across the empire, procurators, who had been personal agents to the Emperor often serving as provincial tax and finance ministers, to be elevated to governing magistrates with full state authority to keep the peace. He elevated Iudaeas's procurator whom he trusted to imperial governing status because the imperial legate of Syria was not sympathetic to the Judeans.|$|E
25|$|First Jackson {{argued that}} qualia are epiphenomenal: not causally efficacious {{with respect to}} the {{physical}} world. Jackson does not give a positive justification for this claim—rather, he seems to assert it <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> defends qualia against the classic problem of dualism. Our natural assumption would be that qualia must be causally efficacious in the physical world, but some would ask how we could argue for their existence if they did not affect our brains. If qualia are to be non-physical properties (which they must be in order to constitute an argument against physicalism), some argue that {{it is almost impossible to}} imagine how they could have a causal effect on the physical world. By redefining qualia as epiphenomenal, Jackson attempts to protect them from the demand of playing a causal role.|$|E
25|$|Diesel-powered {{vehicles}} {{can often}} transition completely to biodiesel, though the fuel {{is a very}} strong solvent, which can occasionally damage rubber seals in vehicles built before 1994. More commonly, however, biodiesel causes problems <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> removes all of the built-up residue in an engine, clogging filters, unless care is taken when switching from dirty fossil-fuel derived diesel to bio-diesel. It is very effective at 'de-coking' the diesel engines combustion chambers and keeping them clean. Biodiesel is the lowest emission fuel available for diesel engines. Diesel engines are the most efficient car internal combustion engines. Biodiesel is the only fuel allowed in some North American national parks because spillages will completely bio-degrade within 21 days. Biodiesel and vegetable oil fuelled, diesel engined vehicles have been declared amongst the greenest in the US Tour de Sol competition.|$|E

The other major problem I had with Lucifer's Crown is infuriating <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it's</b> so utterly unnecessary: The novel takes place in the final months of the year 2000.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of October, the Armada was still in no shape to depart. Lack of food and money as well as potential mutiny forcibly delayed the expedition which infuriated Philip. The Adelantado had preparation for the Armada as his main priority but soon asked to be relieved of his command to defend himself, which Philip refused. Philip instead abruptly cancelled the Irish enterprise altogether; the relenting weather, lateness {{of the season and}} disease amongst ships crews being the reasons. The Adelantado instead was to sail to La Coruna, where he was to be given orders to seize the French Port of Brest which they had briefly held in 1594 only to be defeated by Anglo French troops who took the fort there. Brest was chosen <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was closer to Spain but also {{could be used as a}} base to attack England and also to help the Irish rebels.|$|E
25|$|David Spiegel {{also argued}} that Rind et al.'s {{suggestion}} of relabeling some forms of sexual encounters between adults and children/adolescents as adult-child (or adult-adolescent) sex is fundamentally flawed, because children cannot give meaningful consent to sexual relations with an adult. Some critics {{also argued that}} using value-neutral terminology would normalize CSA and that redefining terminology {{is not in the}} interest of the general public because it confuses the underlying moral issues. Rind et al. replied that the construct of consent used in their study was misinterpreted by critics; they only asserted that children/adolescents are capable of simple consent (willingness) as opposed to informed consent used in legal contexts, and used this as a variable in their study <b>simply</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was used in the original studies - where it had predictive validity. Thus, they conclude that although the construct of willingness might be morally unacceptable, it is a scientifically valid term. A similar argument was put forward by Oellerich, who stated that considering all adult/non-adult sexual behavior as abusive and lacking consent can lead to bias in scientific research in the area, and that recognizing this distinction does not necessarily lead to considering adult/non-adult sexual interactions as morally permissible.|$|E
