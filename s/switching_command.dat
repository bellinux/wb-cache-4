40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} control a dc-dc switching power converter with an LC input filter working under continuous conduction mode. It is known that {{the interaction between the}} low-pass filter and the tightly controlled switching converter occurs, and it might lead to an instability operation. The idea of this method relies on the Lyapunov stability criterion. The <b>switching</b> <b>command</b> of this control is defined by the manner of pre-evaluating the stability of the controlled system. All state variables are controlled in the same time. Therefore, the responses of this controlled system are fast while guaranteeing a stable operation. The proposed control is applied to a boost converter to demonstrate the implementation and its performance. The simulation and experimental results validate the proposed control approach...|$|E

By considering the working status of DC/AC converter is actually switched among several definite subsystems, the switching system model of DC/AC converter is constructed. The tracking problem of converter output power can be changed {{to be that of}} its three-phase output currents. Based on the switching system model of converter, the three-phase output currents of those subsystems are predicted and the <b>switching</b> <b>command</b> is determined by examining the discrepancies between the three-phase predictive currents corresponding to each subsystem and the reference ones. Simulations demonstrate that our control scheme for DC/AC converter connected with ultra-capacitor has great advantages in output power tracking and sinusoidal output current waveforms...|$|E

40|$|A {{switching}} sliding mode controller for {{the static}} shape {{control of a}} membrane strip is considered. The membrane strip is augmented with two macro fiber composite (MFC) bimorphs. MFC patches are modeled as monolithic piezoceramics. The combined structure is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam under tensile load. The two bimorphs are actuated independently. One bimorph operates in bending, whereas the other bimorph operates in tension. The presence of the later causes the system to be nonlinear, hence {{the use of the}} sliding mode technique, and gives rise to a structural singularity. To evade this problem, a <b>switching</b> <b>command</b> is introduced. Hence, the closed loop system utilizes a hybrid control law, which can cause stability problems. Fortunately, the same Lyapunov function can be used to analyze the stability of both subsystems. Consequently, the switching is safe, and asymptotic stability is guaranteed.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a control method for a boost converter, which {{is connected to}} a dc-link of an onboard microgrid system via an LC input filter. The boost converter is considered as a load converter. This control approach {{is based on a}} Lyapunov stability analysis, where all state variables must be known. An observer is used to estimate the input current and losses in the converter. A change of load resistance can be known by evaluating the information from the estimated losses without using any sensor for the output current. These allow us to decrease a countable number of sensors. A Lyapunov function candidate is chosen to ensure that the system and the observer operate stably. The <b>switching</b> <b>command</b> for turning the semiconductor switch on or off is determined by evaluating the time-derivative of the chosen Lyapunov function and choosing the minimum one making the controlled system stable every each sampling cycle. It makes the controlled system operate under a stable zone for the bounded load resistance and input voltage. The experimental results verify the validation of the proposed control...|$|E

If the resonant frequencies of such a system are known, it is possible to determine a <b>switching</b> <b>command</b> that delivers comparable actuation without exciting these natural modes of vibration. If there is redundancy in actuation, it can be exploited to suppress vibration with a reduced amount of actuator changes in state. Minimum switching discrete switching vibration suppression (MSDSVS) involves choosing a switching function with integer amplitudes and continuously variable switch timings to force the root of the residual oscillation function with respect to frequency to be at a resonance. By minimizing the one norm of the vector of amplitudes, we obtain several desired properties. Such a vibration suppression command is developed for a flexible robotic actuator, and experimental results are presented. The proposed command reduces residual oscillation by 73 % (rms) and 74 % (largest Fourier component) and represents a 37 % energy savings over vibration suppression commands that do not exploit the redundancy in actuation...|$|E
40|$|The sliding mode {{technique}} {{is used to}} control the deformation of a membrane mirror strip augmented with two macrofiber composite bimorphs located near {{the ends of the}} strip. The first bimorph is actuated in bending and the second is actuated axially. The structure is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam under tensile load and the macrofiber composite patches are modeled as monolithic piezoceramic wafers. To cast the system into a finite-dimensional state-space form, the finite element method is used, and the model presented accounts for the dynamics of the augmented bimorphs. The membrane strip is placed under uniform tension. Because one of the bimorphs acts axially, the resulting tension in the membrane strip is discontinuous at the location of this bimorph and, consequently, the obtained model is nonlinear. First, we validate the model experimentally by considering the system in its quasi-linear state, then we consider the control problem. We formulate the regulation problem by using the sliding mode technique. Additionally, to allow coupling this system with an adaptive optics scheme, the shape-control problem is considered as well. The control law uses both actuators: the bending and axial bimorphs. However, a system singularity dictates using a <b>switching</b> <b>command</b> to avoid this singularity. Various examples are presented for the regulation and shape-control problems. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control law...|$|E

Indeed, given the scarceness of on-board resources, solutions {{that do not}} rely on asymmetric key cryptography are in demand. A few solutions {{to address this issue}} have been proposed, and some have gained the status of state of the art thanks to their effectiveness and efficiency. However, even if state of the art solutions do provide sender-receiver on-the-fly message authentication, they are not able to tackle a few relevant attacks on received messages when the time dimension is taken into account. In particular, we first introduce two types of attacks: the <b>switch</b> <b>command</b> attack (where an adversary pretends to “switch” two messages over time-that is, altering the relative time ordering), and the drop command attack (where an adversary could pretend not having received a message previously sent from the legitimate sender). We then propose a new solution for broadcast authentication that copes with the above introduced attacks: MASS. Our analysis shows that MASS is effective in detecting both <b>switch</b> <b>command</b> and drop command attacks...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} the ABB ACS 800 {{industrial}} drive using Matlab Simulink is presented in this report. The ACS 800 (ABB, 2011) is a drive designed for industrial applications and contains a rectifier, DC link, inverter and an AC drive. A choice can be made between speed control or torque control of the drive shaft. The feedback for the control loop is supplied by a motor model instead of encoders on the motor shaft. Chapter 1 shows the derivation of a full motor model {{that is used to}} approximate the behavior of the AC drive. The motor input is a three phase, AC voltage that is generated in an AC-DC-AC converter, discussed in chapter 2. Switching the gates of the inverter allows control over the generated three phase output voltage. The <b>switching</b> <b>commands</b> are generated by the controller. Speed control can be realized as scalar control, or by using vector control. The control of the torque can only be done with the latter scheme. The used scalar control uses a direct relationship between the motor input peak voltage amplitude and the rotational frequency. It is named Volts per Hertz control (chapter 3). The desired motor input voltage wave is realized as a PWM signal by choosing appropriate <b>switch</b> <b>commands</b> for the inverter. Vector control (chapter 4) uses the motor input voltage to control the magnetic flux amplitude generated in the stator of the motor and the output torque. The <b>switch</b> <b>commands</b> for the inverter are chosen through the direct torque control (DTC) algorithm where the estimated stator flux and the estimated output torque, acquired from the motor model, are compared to reference values.
