Originally being defined as an intracellular storage pool for von Willebrand factor (VWF), it has recently been shown that an increasing number of other components, including P-selectin, interleukin (IL) - 8, eotaxin- 3, endothelin- 1, and angiopoietin- 2, is present within this <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle,</b> implicating a role for WPB exocytosis in inflammation, hemostasis, regulation of vascular tone and angiogenesis. Recent studies emphasize that WPBs provide a dynamic storage compartment whose contents can be regulated depending on the presence of inflammatory mediators in the vascular micro-environment. Additionally, release of WPBs is tightly regulated and feedback mechanisms have been identified that prevent excessive release of bioactive components from this <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle.</b> The ability to regulate both contents and exocytosis of WPBs endows these endothelial cell specific organelles with a remarkable plasticity.

For a long time the mitochondria were thought to be static organelles, however, it was then discovered that they continuously fused together forming tubular networks followed by fission back into single organelles. The aim of the work was to evaluate whether liposomes could be recognized as artificial mitochondria and thereby be included in the fusion-fission cycle. Liposomes were prepared with different lipid compositions mimicking the composition of the outer mitochondrial membrane. A lipophilic fluorescent dye was incorporated in liposomes to evaluate their ability to fuse with isolated mitochondria.

40|$|The {{effects of}} metals on <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle</b> {{functions}} have been reviewed {{in relation to}} carcinogenesis. Perturbations of the normal uptake and metabolism of carcinogens can arise through changes in microsomal enzyme activities, membrane permeabilities, and cell turnover. Metal effects on heme-dependent oxidative functions are well documented and are primarily manifested by increased heme degradation rates (microsomal heme oxygenase activity), decreased heme production (mitochondrial and cytosolic heme biosynthetic enzymes) and, {{in the case of}} a few metals, through nuclear effects of metals on the induction of microsomal enzymes. Many metals are accumulated by lysosomes, but known effects of metals on the function of these organelles in sequestering and storing organic compounds are few. Studies of changes in plasma or mitochondrial membrane permeabilities by metals have centered mainly on the susceptibility of membrane ATPase activities to metal ion alteration and on the involvement of metals in lipid peroxidation and free radical formation.

The effect of conventional and non-acidic NSAIDs on rat liver mitochondrial respiration was measured in vitro in a Clarke-type oxygen electrode. â€¨Resultsâ€”The <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelle</b> marker enzymes showed mitochondrial and brush border involvement within an hour of indomethacin administration. Electron microscopy showed dose dependent mitochondrial changes following indomethacin administration consistent with uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation (or inhibition of electron transport) which were indistinguishable from those seen with the uncoupler dinitrophenol. Parenteral indomethacin caused similar changes, but not in rats with ligated bile ducts. A range of NSAIDs, but not paracetamol or non-acidic NSAIDs which have a favourable gastrointestinal tolerability profile, uncoupled oxidative phosphorylation in vitro at micromolar concentrations and inhibited respiration at higher concentrations. In vivo studies with nabumetone and aspirin further suggested that uncoupling or inhibition of electron transport underlies the "topical" phase of NSAID induced damage. â€¨Conclusionâ€”Collectively, these studies suggest that NSAID induced changes in mitochondrial energy production may be {{an important component of the}} "topical" phase of damage induction. ...|$|R

The changes in balance between the rates of mitochondrial fission and fusion directly affect {{the wide range of}} mitochondrial lengths that can be observed in different cell types. Rapid fission and fusion of the mitochondria, specifically in cultured fibroblasts, allows for the redistribution of mitochondrial green fluorescent protein (GFP) from one mitochondrion to all of the other mitochondria.

50|$|Within {{individual}} plant cells, the Mg2+ requirements are largely {{the same as}} for all cellular life; Mg2+ is used to stabilise membranes, is vital to the utilisation of ATP, is extensively involved in the nucleic acid biochemistry, and is a cofactor for many enzymes (including the ribosome). Also, Mg2+ is the coordinating ion in the chlorophyll molecule. It is the intracellular compartmentalisation of Mg2+ in plant cells that leads to additional complexity. Four compartments within the plant cell have reported interactions with Mg2+. Initially, Mg2+ will enter the cell into the cytoplasm (by an as yet unidentified system), but free Mg2+ concentrations in this compartment are tightly regulated at relatively low levels (â‰ˆ2 mmol/L) and so any excess Mg2+ is either quickly exported or stored in the second intracellular compartment, the vacuole. The requirement for Mg2+ in mitochondria has been demonstrated in yeast and it seems highly likely that the same will apply in plants. The chloroplasts also require significant amounts of internal Mg2+, and low concentrations of cytoplasmic Mg2+. In addition, {{it seems likely that the}} other <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelles</b> (e.g., Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, etc.) also require Mg2+.|$|E
50|$|Both {{members of}} the STIM family were {{identified}} in 2005 as free-calcium (Ca2+) sensors which participate in a mechanism of Ca2+ entry into the cell referred to as store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Many cellular processes and signaling pathways are started by previous release of Ca2+ stored in <b>subcellular</b> <b>organelles,</b> which needs of a continuous refilling. SOCE is considered the mechanism of store refilling and an essential mechanism of Ca2+ signaling in non-electrically excitable cells. While STIM1 triggers SOCE, research on STIM2 function suggests a major role as feedback regulator that stabilizes basal cytosolic and S/ER Ca2+ concentration Ca2+. STIM2 detects small decreases in Ca2+ content stored in the S/ER, switches to the activated state and interacts with so called store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) channels located in the plasma membrane, such as Orai or TRPC channels, allowing SOCE. Although the functional role of STIM2 has been elusive for many years, studies performed in 2009-2010 on murine models suggested that STIM2 participates in processes of the development and functioning of many cell types, including smooth muscle myoblasts, cells {{of the immune system}} and neurons, and is involved in tumorigenesis, the development of autoimmune diseases and mechanisms of neuronal damage after transient ischemic conditions.|$|E

The importance of peroxisomes for humans is stressed by the existence of a large group of genetic diseases in which either the biogenesis of peroxisomes is impaired or one of its metabolic functions. Thanks to the work on Zellweger syndrome which is the prototype of the group of peroxisomal disorders, much has been learned about the metabolism and biogenesis of peroxisomes in humans. These metabolic functions include: (1.) fatty acid beta-oxidation; (2.) etherphospholipid biosynthesis; (3.) fatty acid alpha-oxidation, and (4.) glyoxylate detoxification.
