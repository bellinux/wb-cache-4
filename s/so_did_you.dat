500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{thought that}} this was a [...] "solid episode", and that Will Arnett's {{character}} [...] "was even more entertaining in this episode" [...] compared to his appearance in the episode [...] "Fireworks". He added that [...] "there was little to complain about", and rated it 8.9 out of 10. Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide said that he [...] "preferred this episode of 30 Rock" [...] compared to the previous episode, [...] "SeinfeldVision". Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly asked his readers [...] "do you feel like Liz Lemon took a back seat, and if <b>so,</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> mind?", adding that [...] " [...] Baldwin and [...] Morgan get the laughs, but like the Tracy Jordan Meat Machine , 30 Rock requires three distinct flavors. Don't be afraid to sprinkle in the Lemon." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> go {{away from}} me so often, and keep away?' asked Florence. 'And why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{sometimes}} look <b>so</b> strangely on me, dear Mama? <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{what right}} has he {{to treat me}} <b>so?</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> ever before hear of such a thing? Why is he {{to be allowed to}} go back,--without punishment,--more than another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Could you eat any {{bread and}} meat?' said Dick, taking down his hat. 'Yes? Ah! I thought <b>so.</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> ever taste beer?' 'I had {{a sip of}} it once,' said the small servant.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you like, Fanny. Oh, how painful {{all this}} is! how doubly painful {{to know that}} ray own love is hopeless, and that yours is no less <b>so.</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> not refuse Lord Ballindine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'N--no. I never {{understood}} {{that he was at}} all blind,' said Jonas, carelessly. 'You don't consider him <b>so,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you,</b> father?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Her face flamed with color--all her sullen {{restraint}} vanished, all her girlish charm came back. [...] "Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think <b>so?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> suppose I {{could get}} him to teach me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, de Thiou. I am {{your guest}} upon this occasion, <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> take that place, and I will sit upon your right hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{did like}} it;--and <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>you.</b> I was {{so glad you}} got that poor man's horse. You were not angry then?" [...] They had now passed across the hall, and were on the bottom stair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] {{admitted}} Jenny rather grudgingly. [...] "But {{none of the}} Thrushes {{have such}} a bright brown coat. Brownie is handsome, if I do say <b>so.</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> notice what a long bill he has?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} say <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> but know what I know," [...] she {{informed}} me roguishly. [...] "Often, I confess, rumour may swell the importance of such an affaire, {{but in this case}} I do not think that rumour does it justice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They did please me, dear, and <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>you.</b> I'm {{tired of}} praise; and love is very sweet, {{when it is}} simple and sincere like this.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Northmour," [...] I cried, [...] "if {{you will}} neither help her yourself, nor let me <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know that I {{shall have to}} kill you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I pray <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not {{trouble to}} deny it. Let us {{admit that it}} is <b>so.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not think then that Queen Mary will have a like {{suspicion}} as yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might go}} {{up with him}} to your uncle," [...] said Mrs. Dale. [...] "Indeed, I promised to go up myself, and <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>you,</b> Grace, to see the microscope. I heard Mr. Dale give orders {{that one of those}} long-legged {{reptiles}} should be caught on purpose for your inspection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>you,</b> traitress!" [...] and he griped her arm, {{which was}} round his waist, till she screamed. [...] "So did you promise: {{but not to}} me. And you shall pass your bridal night in my dog-kennel, after my dog-whip has taught you not to give rings again to {{wandering}} harpers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely. But {{my little}} {{feathered}} children, dear lady, are only too like other children. They have their days of perversity, {{and this morning}} was one of them. My wife came in as I was putting them back in their cage, and said she had left you going out alone for a walk. You told her <b>so,</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Say <b>so!</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> {{ever say}} <b>so?</b> No, you only showed it. O, she <b>did</b> it <b>so</b> well!’ cries Rosa, {{in a sudden}} ecstasy with her {{counterfeit}} betrothed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tricks!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Crewe, {{the memory}} of many recent ones being fresh in his mind; [...] "I should say <b>so.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know what a caucus is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she said, [...] "I do {{not like}} to hear <b>you</b> talk <b>so.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know that when <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> make me afraid that {{something}} I have always hoped for will never come to pass?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do they? Well, I rather think <b>so.</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> {{not hear}} them scream that French name? As far as I {{am able to}} judge, only two Indians were killed instantly. The others died during the night. I had to sit here, tied and helpless, {{listening}} as they groaned and called {{the name of their}} slayer, even in their death-throes. Deathwind! They have named him well." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR,--You {{have not}} come back, as you said you would. No matter--I know the news, and I write to tell you <b>so.</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> see {{anything}} particular in my face when you left me? I was wondering, in my own mind, whether {{the day of his}} downfall had come at last, and whether you were the chosen instrument for working it. You were, and you HAVE worked it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know but}} little about delicacy--what people call delicacy; but I {{will not be}} ungenerous or unkind. Mamma, you brought us two together. Was it not <b>so?</b> <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> not do so, fearing that I might--might still care for Herbert's cousin? You did it; and half wishing to obey you, half {{attracted}} by all his goodness, I did learn to love Herbert Fitzgerald; and I did learn to forget--no; but I learned to cease to love his cousin. You did this and rejoiced at it; and now what you did must remain done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; {{but you may}} set a noble aim before you--you may render {{yourself}} {{worthy of}} her esteem and confidence, and in <b>so</b> <b>doing</b> <b>you</b> will fulfil my fondest hopes.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Something {{has been}} got from him by fraud, I know,' {{returned}} Traddles quietly; 'and <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Heep. We will refer that question, if you please, to Mr. Micawber.' ...|$|R
60|$|You {{go with me}} the self-same way - The self-same air for me you play; For I <b>do</b> {{think and}} <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> It is the tune to travel to.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] Jeanne said simply. [...] "I {{suppose it}} would have been the same anyhow; but I want to tell you, Harry, that in the first letter which she sent me when she was in prison, Marie told me, that as she might not see me again, she thought it right I should know that our father and mother had told her that night we left home that they thought I cared for you. You didn't think <b>so,</b> <b>did</b> <b>you,</b> Harry?" [...] she broke off with a vivid blush. [...] "You did not think I cared for you before you cared for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It does beat all how neat the niggers {{played their}} hand. They let {{on to be}} SORRY they was going out of this region! And I {{believed}} they WAS sorry, and <b>so</b> <b>did</b> <b>you,</b> and so did everybody. Don't ever tell ME any more that a nigger ain't got any histrionic talent. Why, the way they played that thing it would fool ANYBODY. In my opinion, there's a fortune in 'em. If I had capital and a theater, I wouldn't want a better lay-out than that--and here we've gone and sold 'em for a song. Yes, and ain't privileged to sing the song yet. Say, where IS that song--that draft?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you why, Henri. I would never consent to make myself a burden to a man {{at a moment when}} I could not make myself a comfort to him; besides, the time of {{marriage}} should be a time of joy, and this is no time for joy. Again, there is a stronger and sadder reason still. Did you ever see a young widow, who had not reached her twentieth year? if <b>so,</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> ever see a sadder sight? Would you unnecessarily doom our dear Marie to that fate! I know you so well, my dear brother, that I do not fear to speak to you of the too probable lot of a brave soldier!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} man," [...] exclaimed Edward to the Queen, [...] "and <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>you.</b> A {{handsome}} knight and a pleasant, {{but one of}} whom I have always misdoubted me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{looked in}} there for a moment," [...] Harry said, [...] "as I passed. Mother looks as hale and hearty as she did when I left, and <b>so</b> <b>do</b> <b>you,</b> dad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{should one}} say what {{one does not}} think," [...] Mary said, sturdily, [...] "it {{would be much better}} if we all <b>did</b> <b>so.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not agree with me, Mr. Hartington?" ...|$|R
