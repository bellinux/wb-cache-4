40|$|Using multispeckle x-ray photon {{correlation}} spectroscopy, we have {{measured the}} slow, wave-vector dependent dynamics of concentrated, disordered nanoemulsions composed of silicone oil droplets in water. The intermediate scattering function possesses a compressed exponential lineshape and a relaxation time that varies inversely with wave vector. We interpret these dynamics as strain {{in response to}} local stress relaxation. The motion includes a transient component whose <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity</b> decays exponentially with time following a mechanical perturbation of the nanoemulsions and a second component whose <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity</b> is essentially independent of time.

40|$|Problem statement: In Part I of this research, {{the main}} {{features}} of the fluidization behavior and <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocities</b> had been reported. Approach: In the present research, the mixtures <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity</b> profiles for various sand sizes, palm shell sizes and weight percents were presented. It was recognized that there are instances where the characteristic values remain nearly unchanged from its pure sand values. This regime of constant values {{can be observed in}} both compartments and can be established depending on the bed properties. The term "Critical loading" is then selected to define the maximum palm shell content (size and weight percent) that can be present in the mixtures where the <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocities</b> remain absolutely of pure sand values. Results: The critical loading increases with the increase of sand size but decreases with the increase of palm shell size. Moreover, it can be observed that the critical loading generally decreases with the increase in particle size ratio, although exception is sighted in the combustor for the mixture with the largest sand size. Overall, the largest sand size has the highest critical loading. Meanwhile, the selected correlations are able to describe the qualitative variation in the <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocities.</b> However, quantitatively, these correlations are unsatisfactory as they are either over-estimate or under-estimate. Conclusion/Recommendations: It is desirable to establish the regime of critical loading since the mixture <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocities</b> can be pre-determined using bed material properties made up from pure sand (inert) values. Within this regime, a single operational velocity can be set for respective compartment that is independent from variation of palm shell size and weight percent in the mixtures (especially during combustion or gasification). Ultimately, the state of fluidization (e. g., bubbling or vigorously fluidized) and mixing/segregation condition that depend on relative magnitude of operational and <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocities</b> can be identified and maintained...|$|R

40|$|We have {{experimentally}} {{determined the}} surface tension-to-shear viscosity ratio (the so-called <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity)</b> of quasiliquid layers (QLLs) on ice crystal surfaces from their wetting dynamics.

The relaxation dynamics {{is known to be}} governed by the <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity,</b> which allows us to access the physical properties of QLLs in a noninvasive way. Here we quantitatively demonstrate that QLLs, when completely wetting ices, have a thickness of 9 +/- 3 nm and an approximately 200 times lower <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity</b> than bulk water, whereas QLLs, when partially wetting ices, have a velocity that is 20 times lower than the bulk.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper a method for {{deriving}} <b>stage</b> <b>characteristics,</b> which can provide accurate prediction of a multistage compressor map is presented. The method combines optimization techniques {{with the principles of}} stage stacking. The <b>stage</b> <b>characteristics</b> are produced by modifying some initial generic ones, until the desired accuracy in the prediction at selected points on the overall map is achieved. There are several reasons why prediction based on the initial <b>stage</b> <b>characteristics</b> can be inaccurate, the following three being the main ones. The first is due to inaccuracy in the representation of the <b>stage</b> <b>characteristics</b> themselves. The second is due to lack of exact knowledge of the geometric data of the various stages. Finally the third reason consists of the 'weak' modelling representation of complex physical phenomena with one dimensional approaches. Therefore, even when the exact <b>stage</b> <b>characteristics</b> are known, this does not guarantee the accurate prediction of the compressor performance. On account of the above, it is preferable to acquire realistic 'effective' <b>stage</b> <b>characteristics</b> which can be used for synthesizing overall compressor characteristics and assessing the effects of stage faults. In this paper, both of these aspects are successfully tackled as demonstrated by applying the method to different test cases...|$|R

40|$|A set of {{universal}} laws for the scaling of pulsed elec-tric propulsion systems is presented. The Langmuir <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity</b> and another <b>characteristic</b> ve-locity defined {{here as the}} pulsed electric propulsion (PEP) <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity</b> are the two governing parameters in these scaling laws. The Langmuir and PEP <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocities</b> describe {{the relation of the}} power generator mass and the energy storage sys-tem mass to the propellant mass required to perform a given mission. An optimal exhaust velocity that maximizes the useful mass fraction of the spacecraft can be found using these two parameters. This tech-nique especially applies to low power, small space-craft where the mass of the energy storage system could make up a significant fraction of the total mass. An Ablative Pulsed Plasma Thruster (APPT) is used as an example low power pulsed electric propulsion system applied to the Pluto Express Mission. A 100 % increase in the scientific payload mass of a recent probe design is demonstrated by replacing the chem-ical propulsion system with an optimized APPT sys-tem using only well proven off-the-shelf technologies. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{hyperbolic}} dissipative systems, {{the solution}} of the shock structure is not always continuous and a discontinuous part (sub-shock) appears when the velocity of the shock wave is greater than a critical value. In principle, the sub-shock may occur when the shock velocity s reaches one of the characteristic eigenvalues of the hyperbolic system. Nevertheless, Rational Extended Thermodynamics (ET) for a rarefied monatomic gas predicts the sub-shock formation only when s exceeds the maximum <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity</b> of the system evaluated in the unperturbed state λ^_ 0. This fact agrees with a general theorem asserting that continuous shock structure cannot exist for s >λ^_ 0. In the present paper, first, the shock structure is numerically analyzed on the basis of ET for a rarefied polyatomic gas with 14 independent fields. It is shown that, also in this case, the shock structure is still continuous when s meets <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocities</b> except for the maximum one and therefore the sub-shock appears only when s >λ^_ 0. This example reinforces the conjecture that, the differential systems of ET theories have the special characteristics such that the sub-shock appears only for s greater than the unperturbed maximum <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity.</b> However, {{in the second part of}} the paper, we construct a counterexample of this conjecture by using a simple 2 × 2 hyperbolic dissipative system which satisfies all requirements of ET. In contrast to previous results, we show the clear sub-shock formation with a slower shock velocity than the maximum unperturbed <b>characteristic</b> <b>velocity.</b> Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
