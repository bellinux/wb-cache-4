50|$|Prenatal {{repair of}} neural tube defects such as myelomeningocele (<b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>cystica)</b> {{is a growing}} option in the United States. Although the {{procedure}} is technically challenging, children treated with open fetal repair have significantly improved outcomes compared to children whose defects are repaired shortly after birth. Specifically, fetal repair reduces the rate of ventriculoperitoneal shunt dependence and Chiari malformation, while improving motor skills at 30 months of age compared to post-natal repair. Children having fetal repair {{are twice as likely}} to walk independently at 30 months of age than children undergoing post-natal repair. As a result, open fetal repair of spina bifida is now considered standard of care at fetal specialty centers.|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS The {{operative}} specimens from 160 {{cases of}} <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>cystica</b> {{were examined in}} detail. In seven cases the sac contained nervous tissue {{visible to the naked}} eye, the removal of which produced no clinical disability. The form taken by this non-functioning, heterotopic nervous tissue is described. In the more severe forms of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>cystica</b> in which the spinal cord or nerves extend into the sac (meningomyelocele) or are exposed on the skin sur-face (myelocele), minute heterotopic nests of glial tissue with or without ependymal canals are fre-quently found in the surrounding meninges or sub-cutaneous tissues (Lichtenstein, 1940; Cameron, 1957).

40|$|<b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> is {{a serious}} birth defect that in-volves an {{incomplete}} closure of the spine, spinal cord, brain, and/or protective covering of the fe-tal spine. Even though the causes of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> are still uncertain, diabetes, obesity, severe hyperthermia in early pregnancies, and poor nu-trition {{are believed to be}} causes of neural tube defects (NTDs). Because <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> may go undetected by α-fetoprotein screening and am-niocentesis, sonography becomes a valuable tool in its identification. <b>Spina</b> <b>bifida</b> can also affect the fetal brain, so sonography is important in de-tecting any abnormal fetal head signs associated with Arnold-Chiari (type II) malformation. Sur-gical planning is another important part of sonography’s role when detecting NTDs. Al-though still in experimental stages, in utero re-pair has proven beneficial in some cases of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> after careful sonographic assessment as part of the treatment considerations.

40|$|Hull neurosurgeon, has {{produced}} a very lucid and succinctly topical account of aspects of hydrocephalus and <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>cystica,</b> {{and some of the}} associated minor syndromes (diastematomyelia, myelodysplasia). The critical evalua-tion by Lorber of systematic and relatively unselected commitment to active surgical treatment of hydro-cephalus and <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>cystica</b> has allowed a more discriminating applica-tion of technical skill in these conditions, and this book provides a most valuable account of the management of the array of problems commonly found. The whole book is not, however, concerned with problems of management. The first five chapters are devoted to patho-logical and historical reviews, a clinico-pathological correlation, and an outline of the epidemiology of spina bifida. Wisely, the authors resist the tempta-tion to be discursive about cerebrospinal fluid hydrodynamics, but the account of antenatal diagnosis by alpha-fetoprotein assay is rather too cursory for the many paediatricians who will fiu of special value, and fo prevention of open neural ties has the highest appeal. this monograph can be u recommended to all who in the care of patients neural tube deformities...|$|E

40|$|Patients with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> <b>cystica</b> {{commonly}} {{have significant}} disability {{from a combination}} of valgus deformity of the ankle and subtalar joints with lateral tibial torsion and plano-abduction deformity of the foot.

This procedure was carried out on 20 feet in 15 patients and the results were reviewed after an average of three years (range 18 months to 7 years). In 75 per cent of feet the combination of deformities was fully corrected, ulcers and callosities were eliminated in 95 per cent, the use of calipers minimised in 95 per cent, and in all patients the problem of shoe-wrecking was reduced.

We constructed a 5 : 1 comparison group of patients with end stage renal disease without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> matched by age at first end stage renal disease service, gender and race/ethnicity. We assessed the risk of mortality and of renal transplantation while on dialysis using multivariate cause specific proportional hazards survival analysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{provide new}} {{estimates}} {{of medical care}} utilization and expenditures over the lifespan for persons living with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> in the United States. Updated estimates are essential for calculations of lifetime costs and for economic evaluations of prevention and management strategies for <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> METHODS: We analyzed data from the 2001 – 2003 MarketScan database on paid medical and pre-scription drug claims of persons covered by employer-sponsored health insurance in the United States. Med-ical care utilization and expenditures during 2003 were analyzed for persons with a diagnosis of <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> recorded during 2001 – 2003 who had 12 months of coverage in a fee-for-service health plan. To calculate expenditures during infancy, a separate analysis was performed for those born during 2002 with claims and expenditures data during the first 12 months of life. We compared medical expenditures for persons with and without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> by age groups. RESULTS: Average incremental medical expenditures comparing patients with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> and those without were $ 41, 460 per year at age 0, $ 14, 070 at ages 1 – 17, $ 13, 339 at ages 18 – 44, and $ 10, 134 at ages 45 – 64. Children ages 1 – 17 years with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> had average medical expenditures 13 times greater than children without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida.</b> Adults with <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> had average med-ical expenditures three to six times greater than adults without <b>spina</b> <b>bifida</b> in this privately insured popula-tion.
