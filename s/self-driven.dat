However, due {{to the success of}} Coke Studio and [...] Nescafe Basement, and the general trend in music throughout the world, Pakistan is experiencing a change in music genres, with Lahore producing Indie Rock musicians like The Tamashbeens and Karachi preferring electronic music artists like Dynoman and Tollcrane.

2500|$|Essentially, Vandervert {{has argued}} that {{when a person is}} confronted with a {{challenging}} new situation, visual-spatial working memory and speech-related working memory are decomposed and re-composed (fractionated) by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation. With repeated attempts to deal with challenging situations, the cerebro-cerebellar blending process continues to optimize the efficiency of how working memory deals with the situation or problem. Most recently, he {{has argued that}} this is the same process (only involving visual-spatial working memory and pre-language vocalization) that led to the evolution of language in humans. Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers have pointed out that this blending process, because it continuously optimizes efficiencies, constantly improves prototyping attempts toward the invention or innovation of new ideas, music, art, or technology. Prototyping, they argue, not only produces new products, it trains the cerebro-cerebellar pathways involved to become more efficient at prototyping itself. Further, Vandervert and Vandervert-Weathers believe that this repetitive [...] "mental prototyping" [...] or mental rehearsal involving the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex explains the success of the <b>self-driven,</b> individualized patterning of repetitions initiated by the teaching methods of the Khan Academy. The model proposed by Vandervert has, however, received incisive critique from several authors.|$|E
