A further aim was to determine whether <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> officers from different local <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> have uniform attitudes regarding professional practice in their application of the insurance system. METHODS: A register-based investigation of 815 vocational rehabilitees served by 6 local <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> in a Swedish county. The study was supplemented with a questionnaire to 30 officers about attitudes to <b>social</b> <b>insurance.</b> RESULTS: The <b>office</b> with the lowest rate of sick-listing periods exceeding one year, and a high frequency of employment training, showed the highest degree of work resumption and the lowest pension rate after vocational rehabilitation. There were wide differences in attitude among the local <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> officers regarding professional practice in their application of the system. CONCLUSION: Intra-county differences occur in handling people on sick-leave who undergo vocational rehabilitation. The local <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> with the highest and lowest outcome rates of work resumption and disability pension, respectively, select clients for vocational rehabilitation from different categories of cases. <b>Social</b> <b>insurance</b> officers from different local offices differ in their attitudes towards the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> system and its clients...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{figures for}} {{long-term}} sickness absence and disability pension are problems for many European countries {{where they have}} increased to burdensome levels, socially and financially. In a European study in 2003, Sweden showed the highest proportion of sick-listed with 4. 5 % of the employed work force absent due to sickness. The primary aim of this thesis was to study the outcomes of decisions taken at the <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Offices</b> in a Swedish county with regard to work resumption after vocational rehabilitation (VR). Another specific aim was to evaluate whether <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> officers show conformity of attitude regarding professional practice in their application of the insurance system. The reasoning behind this is that outside the legal framework and official policy, consciously or subconsciously, there is a selection of sick-listed persons to VR, and that the selection influences the outcome with respect to work resumption or disability pension. The study is based on all 832 clients granted VR (4. 7 % of about 17, 000 cases of sick listing) from six local <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> in Sweden during 1998 - 99. Data were collected from mainframe registers and other records at each office. The register study was combined with a questionnaire study addressed to 30 <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> officers at the offices. The questions concerned attitudes to the insurance system and the officers practice and application of the system. The proportion of clients with sickness allowance that received any VR measures varied among the offices from 1. 2 % to 8. 7 %. Among those granted VR 36 % were men and 64 % women. The predominant diagnosis group was musculoskeletal disorders/pain conditions. Of all cases receiving VR, 52. 4 % resumed work and 46. 2 % ended with a disability pension allowance. Two years after finalised VR {{a large proportion of}} the temporary disability pensions had become permanent. Among cases granted VR, those undergoing detailed investigation showed the lowest figures of work resumption, while those who did job training showed higher figures. The distinguishing factor between remaining at work and relapsing into sick-leave by the two-year follow-up was the duration of sick-leave. Those most likely (odds ratios) to remain at work two years after completed rehabilitation were industrial employees who had short sickness absence, had been selected for job training as a VR measure and were aged 16 - 29 years. Intra-county differences occurred in processing cases of sick-leavers who take part in VR measures. The local <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> with the highest and lowest outcome rates of work resumption and disability pension, respectively, selected clients for VR from different categories of cases. The differences in characteristics appeared as duration of sick-listing. The offices whose clients had long sickness absence, including processing time for VR, and frequently used detailed investigation as a VR measure, showed more disability pension grants as outcomes of VR. <b>Social</b> <b>insurance</b> officers from different local <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> differed in their attitudes towards the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> system and its clients...|$|R

Gainful employment impact on employees' health and well-being, but work is only one part of everyday life and a broader perspective is essential in order to identify health-related factors. Participants: Data were obtained from employees at six <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Offices</b> in Sweden, 250 women and 50 men. Method: A questionnaire based on established instruments and questions specifically designed for this study was used. Relationships between five factors of everyday life, subjective health and well-being were investigated by means of multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: The final model revealed a limited importance of certain work-related factors. A general satisfaction with everyday activities, a stress-free environment and general control in addition to not having monotonous movements at work were found to be factors explaining 46. 3 % of subjective good health and well-being. Conclusions: A person's entire activity pattern, including work, is important, and strategies for promoting health should take into account the person's situation as a whole.

Although the Americans had reached Zwickau {{in the final stages of}} the war, the leading winning powers had already agreed new frontiers and military occupation zones for Germany, and the Americans withdrew to Bavaria after a few weeks leaving the entire central portion of what had been Germany administered as the Soviet occupation zone. In 1946 Heinz Fiedler joined, briefly, the German Communist Party. Politically there had initially been a widespread belief that military defeat, by destroying the Hitler regime, had put an end to one-party government in Germany, and in the summer As matters turned out 1946 was also the year in which the basis for a return to one-party government was established, with the contentious merger, in April of that year, of the Communist Party and, within the Soviet occupation zone, of the more moderately left-wing Social Democratic Party, forming together the Socialist Unity Party (SED / Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). Heinz Fiedler, like many German communists, lost little time in signing his party membership over to the new SED. In 1949 he took a clerical job with the [...] "Ernst Grube" [...] truck and bus factory in Werdau, where he also became Secretary of the Free German Youth, which was the youth wing of the ruling SED party in what had become, in October 1949, the German Democratic Republic, comprising the entire area that had previously been administered as the Soviet Occupation zone. The young country retained Soviet military and political sponsorship, and many of its constitutional arrangements and political power structures were directly modeled on those of the Soviet Union.

40|$|The aim of {{this report}} is to: 1. Present a {{systematic}} review of the scientific literature concerning:. the consequences of being on sick leave or disability pension;. causes behind sick leave and disability pension in general and due to three diagnostic groups (back and neck disorders, psychiatric disorders, and cardiovascular diseases);. physician practices related to the sick listing of patients. 2.

40|$|Physicians are {{supposed}} to act as sick-listing experts and they possess a role as gate-keepers to the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> system. Earlier studies have demonstrated variation between physicians and physician categories regarding sick-listing practice. In addition to the patient's disease and its severity, {{a number of other}} factors may be expected to influence sick-listing practice. Most earlier studies have focused on the patient's disease and his or her work place as cause for sickness absence. The aims of this study were to analyse variation of sick-listing practice between physician categories and the influence of physician characteristics on sick-listing practice, the influence of structure, organisation and remuneration of health care on physician sick-listing practice, the influence of local structural factors in the community, and the influence of a legislative change on physician sick-listing practice. The study was conducted as a cross-sectional epidemiological study of 57563 doctors’ certificates for sickness absence, received by 28 local <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> in eight Swedish counties, during four months in 1995 and two months in 1996. Patient age, sex, and diagnostic group, issuing physician category, presence of a hospital in the municipality, municipality population size and county were all significantly and independently correlated to number of net days of sick-listing. Physician characteristics, such as age, sex and degree of specialisation were all associated with number of net days of sick-listing. Physicians working in general practice issued significantly shorter periods of sick-listing than the other physician categories. Reimbursement of general practice and participation in financial co-operation with <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> were significantly correlated to length of sickness episode issued by general practitioners. A legislative change performed during the study period was associated with small effects in sick-listing practice. In conclusion, a number of factors other than disease and disease severity and other patient and physician linked factors were found to influence the variation of sick-listing practice. It appears that the closer the influencing factor was to the place were the decision was taken, i. e., the patient-physician consultation, the higher the impact on the decision appeared to be...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{number of}} {{individuals}} {{in need of help}} and support simultaneously fromdifferent welfare services has increased. Collaboration between professionals and authoritieshas been seen as a way to improve the efficiency in treatment and rehabilitation. In Sweden,a trial legislation called SOCSAM was introduced in 1994 with an aim to improvecollaboration and decrease costs for society through allowing co-financing and joint politicalsteering across welfare services. Aim: The main aim of this thesis was to assess if co-financed collaboration between primaryhealth care, the <b>social</b> (sickness) <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> and <b>social</b> services contributed toimproved care and rehabilitation for people with musculoskeletal disorders. Methods: This research project assessed the effects of a natural experiment. Patients withmusculoskeletal disorders attending three health centres with co-financed collaboration(DELTA health centres) were compared to similar patients attending four control healthcentres not practicing collaboration under the trial legislation. One hundred thirty eightpatients were followed prospectively for one year. Information about health status, healthcare contacts and sick leave were collected through patients interviews, through medicalrecords, through the Swedish <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> Registry, and through patient diaries. Theproject also involved a comparative qualitative study on staff-perceptions of the collaborativestructure in DELTA and control health centres. Results: Staff in both DELTA and control health centres reported fairly well functioninginternal collaboration, but only staff at DELTA health centres reported well-functioningcollaboration with <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices.</b> There were no major differences in baselinecharacteristics between the two patient groups. No significant differences between patientsin the DELTA centres and the controls concerning change in health status between baselineand 12 months follow-up were found. Mean number of sick leave days during the 12 -months period after inclusion was 94 for the DELTA patients and 87 for controls. At 12 months follow up, 31 % in the DELTA group and 32 % in the control group were on sickleave. Patients in the DELTA health centres had more contacts with physiotherapists thanthe controls, especially during the first months after inclusion. Contacts with socialinsurance office, social services or hospital did not differ significantly between the groups. The type of treatment the patient received only differed slightly between the groups. Conclusion: Staff involved in the co-financed collaboration under SOCSAM perceived thatthe model was important for the collaborative process and that it had stimulated newinterdisciplinary team structures. However, the follow-up studies of patients indicated thatthere were no major differences in the care and rehabilitation approaches, or treatmentsreceived, between DELTA and control patients. The only clear difference was that DELTApatients received more physiotherapy than controls. There is a weak evidence base for thetype of treatments that was received by patients in both groups, which may explain why nosignificant differences were observed concerning health outcome or sick leave. The studieshad some methodological limitations. Since the sample size was small and an observationaldesign was used, the data should be interpreted with caution. Results may not begeneralisable beyond rehabilitation of people with musculoskeletal disorders.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{official}} statistics {{of persons with}} mental disorders who are granted disability pension (DP) in Russia and Norway indicate large differences between the countries. Methods This qualitative explorative hypothesis-generating study is based on text analysis of the laws, regulations and guidelines, and qualitative interviews of informants representing all the organisational elements of the DP systems in both countries. Results The DP application process is initiated much later in Norway than in Russia, where a 3 year occupational rehabilitation and adequate treatment is mandatory before DP is granted. In Russia, two instances are responsible for preparing of the medical certification for DP, a patients medical doctor (PD) and a clinical expert commission (CEC) while there is one in Norway (PD). In Russia, the Bureau of Medical-Social Expertise is responsible for evaluation and granting of DP. In Norway, the local <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> (SIO) {{are responsible for the}} DP application. Decisions are taken collectively in Russia, while the Norwegian PD and SIO officer often take decisions alone. In Russia, the medical criterion is the decisive one, while rehabilitation and treatment criteria are given priority in Norway. The size of the DP in Norway is enough to cover of subsistences expenditure, while the Russian DP is less than the level required for minimum subsistence. Conclusion There were noteworthy differences in the time frame, organisation model and process leading to a DP in the two countries. These differences may explain why so few patients with less severe mental disorders receive a DP in Russia. This fact, in combination with the size of the DP, may hamper reforms of the mental health care system in Russia. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} number of sickness allowance cases have been closed with a negative decision despite the fact that a certifying doctor has recommended sick leave. At <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Offices,</b> a case file is established for each sickness allowance case. The case files for 538 rejected cases form the basis for this study.   The assessment of the entitlement to sickness allowance is a key instrument of control in the health insurance system and the sharpened borderline between the obligation to work and the entitlement to sickness allowance can be interpreted {{as the result of a}} political aim to promote work through the health insurance system. This thesis explores these demarcation practices, highlighting the ways in which this policy of work promotion is translated into and made manifest in real world cases.   Three aspects of these practices were highlighted in the study described in the thesis. The first aspect concerns the identification of those who are denied sickness allowance; their diagnoses and work situations. The second aspect relates to the interaction between the certifying doctor, the medical officer and the case officer and their respective roles in the process leading to negative decisions. The third aspect examines how the actors interpret and apply the concepts of sickness and ability to work in cases with negative decisions. In addition to these themes, in the final chapter of the thesis, I draw on theories of institutionalised organisations and moral practices to analyse the outcomes of the decision-making process.   The thesis shows that a negative decision is most likely to be applied to insured persons who are either unemployed or who are manual workers without educational qualifications, and who have received diagnoses of mental illhealth or of diagnoses of pain and ache problems in the locomotive organs. It is argued that this is a moral category formed through the interaction of government policy dictates promoting work with actors, who in their official roles must apply an extremely vague criterion for entitlement to <b>social</b> <b>insurance,</b> namely disablement caused by illness.   In this way, the dual handicap  – undervalued labour (market) position plus undervalued gravity of illness – has become a borderline marker when the right to sickness allowance is being investigated and contested. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a case study of}} the Swedish Rehabilitation Reform of 1992. Vocational {{rehabilitation}} is described as an organizational activity which takes place in the interaction between social policy regulations and organizational execution. The analytical point of departure is made up of two complementary theoretical perspectives (Chapter 3) : New institutional theory and the concept of 'negotiated order'. New institutional theory can aid inter-organizational analysis as it assumes that organizations are not only influenced, but also permeated by institutional and technical frameworks. The 'negotiated order' perspective can provide an understanding of actors' motives when they work together. This perspective also acknowledges that actors are able to exercise 'episodic power', and that this differs from 'formal power'. The first empirical study (Chapter 4) analyses the political motives behind the Rehabilitation Reform of 1992. It shows {{that at the time of}} the Rehabilitation Reform economical and political interests were pushing for a tighter regulations in Swedish social policy. The following three empirical studies focus on the 'organizational field' in which rehabilitation is practised. This field consists of the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>office,</b> employment agencies, primary health care centres and occupational health service centres. Chapter 5 deals with the regulations and environmental factors influencing the various organizations and their representatives. It points to five external forces that influence the performance of the four type of actors. The <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>office</b> is influenced by a judicial social insurance logic, the employment agencies by a holistic labour market policy logic, and the physicians in primary health care centres and in occupational health centres by a 'holistic' medical frame of reference, which contrasts with that often found in other medical sub-specialities. Finally, employers are influenced first, by a logic of profit which has a technical and institutional dimension and second, by an institutional welfare state logic. Chapter six shows that the largest 'domain conflict' in the initial phase of the rehabilitation trajectory has to do with defining 'capacity to work'. Domain conflicts are seen as resulting from different institutional logics, implying different views on illness and capacity to work. Numerous and frequent personal interaction make it possible for physicians and rehabilitation officials to avoid conflict. The operative phase is associated with two major domain conflicts. The first is related to negotiations between the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>office</b> and the employers about transferring employees to other duties. Both sides avoid exercising power that may damage clients and future trust. Episodic power resources are used to exercise the strategy of 'the golden middle path'. The other domain conflict is related to the judgement of work capacity. The labour market officials' view of work capacity differs from that of the officials at the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>office.</b> Chapter seven compares cooperative rehabilitation projects with regular rehabilitation activity. The results show that actors in cooperative projects break the sequential work order used in regular rehabilitation activity and thereby projects quickly collect comprehensive information about individuals. Cooperative projects can also achieve flexible solutions tailored to an individual clients needs. Further, cooperative projects allow time for unconventional initiatives, which regular activity do not. The process of 'returning to work' poses a challenge both kinds of work organizations. Individuals who are disabled in some way are required to meet the same labour market demands as healthy and well educated are expected to meet. Finally, regular rehabilitation work tends uses standardize clients while cooperative projects tend to treat them as individuals. digitalisering@um...|$|E
30|$|To {{measure the}} effect of {{financial}} work incentives, the Swiss Federal <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Office</b> (henceforth “FSIO”) conducted a field experiment (“Pilot Project Seed Capital”). 6 Seed capital is a conditional lump-sum payment for DI recipients who meet two requirements: First, {{they have to take}} up or expand work in the primary labour market. Second, the earnings increase has to be large enough to trigger a reduction in DI benefits by at least one quarter (e.g., from a semi pension to a quarter pension). A fall-back rule accommodates potential deterioration in health status: Within five years after the pension reduction, individuals can fall back to their old DI contract if they cannot work for 30 consecutive days.|$|E
40|$|Chronic carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning as a contested disease 1944 – 1961. By Helena Ekerholm. During World War II, wood gas became the primary fuel for Swedish motorists. Although reliable as an emergency fuel, wood gas caused concern due to its high percentage of {{carbon monoxide}}, leading to acute and chronic {{carbon monoxide poisoning}} mainly among workers in the transport sector. Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning became an intensely debated diagnosis within the medical community. The article discusses this controversy with specific regard to Thomas Gieryn’s boundary theory {{and the concept of}} culture-bound diseases in Sweden primarily associated with Karin Johannisson’s research in the field of the history of medicine. Source material includes medical scientific publications and archive material from a state research centre handling chronic carbon monoxide poisoning. Politically the diagnosis reached high credibility, but within the medical profession the diagnosis and its clinical practice were criticised. Symptoms were diffuse and included general fatigue, headache, vertigo, sleeping problems, apathy and decreased libido. Doctors diagnosing patients with chronic carbon monoxide poisoning had primarily to rely on patients’ own descriptions of their ailments, although some clinical tests were also executed. The first clinic specifically aimed at carbon monoxide poisoning, Sabbatsbergs gengasklinik, received criticism for over-diagnosing. The clinic was accused of creating a wood gas scare in the Stockholm region and causing an epidemic of imagined chronic monoxide poisoning, spurred on by extensive writings in the popular press. The controversy concerned problems of discerning those who were considered to be “objectively ill” from those who through fear had induced chronic carbon monoxide poisoning upon themselves. Notions of working-class masculinity, boundaries between physical and mental illness as well as a clash of interests between the labour movement, national <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> and private enterprise are some of the facets within a complex controversy ultimately focused on drawing boundaries between legitimate and illegitimate patient demands and achieving epistemic authority...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> {{is part of}} the Swedish {{welfare system}} that is {{intended}} to create economic security for citizens in the event of unemployment, sickness, functional disability, and old age. The Swedish sickness‐benefit insurance is based on the standard insurance principle meaning that sickness benefits are related to level of lost income. The increasing number of sick listed people and people with disability pension (DPs) in Sweden may lead to marginalisation of individuals as they {{are not part of the}} labour market. The government has decided that the number of sick‐listed people should be halved by 2008, which means a tougher judgment of the applications for sick leave compensation. To be qualified for sickness benefit the disease has to impair the work ability in relation to the specific demands of the work of that person. The evaluation of the work ability in a percentage is an important element with regard to the policy on disability. The <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> officers (SIOs) who are assessing the work ability are dependent on judgments from the physicians as expertise, and the guidelines in the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> act. The eligibility criteria for DP and the process of dealing with applications for DP is scarcely studied. Objectives: The overall aim of the thesis was to explore demographic and health differences between those, who were granted and those, who were not granted disability pension. The second aim was to study how the process from applications to decisions on disability pensions were executed and perceived by the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices</b> and to elucidate their working conditions during the decision process. Material and methods: The first two studies explored differences between those granted DP and those not granted DP. Study I was a register‐based retrospective case‐control study carried out in the area of a county in Sweden. The cases were all individuals rejected a full disability pension 1999 ‐ 2000, in all 99 cases. Controls were every tenth person who was granted a full DP during the same period, 198 controls. Determinants were recorded from the <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> (SI). In study II demographic data and medical diagnoses were obtained from the SI records. Data concerning self‐reported health, HRQoL, social networks and use of health care were collected by a postal questionnaire. The study objects were the same as in study I. In study III and IV indepth interviews were carried through to study the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> officers’ perspective on the process from application to decision on disabilitypensions as well as their experiences of prerequisites and hindrances in their work with DP applications. The transcribed data were analysed by an inductive content analysis. Results: Unemployment, living in the main municipality and age below 50 years were determinants for rejection of DP. Medical status as described in the <b>Social</b> <b>Insurance</b> records had less association with the outcome. There are variations in praxis of rejection of applicants between <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> boards in different geographical areas due to other reasons than medical. The nDP group had more often multiple diagnoses, and lower self‐reported health and HRQoL compared to those granted DP. Those not granted DP also had significantly smaller social networks. The SIOs perceived that they had to make rapid decisions within a limited time frame, based on limited information, mainly on the basis of incomplete medical certificates, and with no firm criteria for the regulations on the individual case level. Communication among the various authorities as employment offices and social services suffered from lack of common goaldirected strategy. In study IV the SIOs described their working conditions when executing the applications for DP. The SIOs perceived recurrent changes in rules and regulations as frustrating as they at the same time had to face the client. The large number of clients prevented them from being able to offer clients activities and support them in the way they were supposed to do. The SIOs powerful position and how their discretion was implemented made them feel responsible for performing their work well. SIOs are to be considered as typical street‐level bureaucrats as they have to perform their work between the policy, rules and clients. Conclusions: The individuals had an increased risk to be rejected DP if they were younger than 50 years, unemployed, and lived in the main city. No evident differences in medical diagnoses were found between the groups. The results indicate that there may be other reasons than medical in praxis. Contrary to expectations, those not granted DP do not seem to have better health, but rather to suffer from more sickness than those, who were granted DP. Unemployment leads to inability to qualify for compensation and benefits that are associated with participation on the labour market. The group not granted disability pension appears to be a disadvantaged group in need for a co‐ordination between different parts of the social welfare system. The different perspectives were perceived as obvious obstacles in the communication between professionals in the welfare system as they had other goals and demands. Clients, that have comprehensive problems and are in need of coordinated measures from many authorities to get entrance to the labour market still suffer from lack of coordination. One question is how the different public officers use their discretion when handling clients and how the cooperation can be improved.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the employers’ {{responsibilities}} for rehabilitation of employees in Sweden, who due to illness or injury are unable to work. The process of the rehabilitation will be analyzed in a gender perspective. A minor comparative study about rehabilitation in Denmark will also be carried out. The purpose is to see how the process of the rehabilitation is designed for those who due to illness or injury are unable to work, which factors that affects the rehabilitation and which differences there are between Denmark and Sweden regarding the employers responibility for rehabilitation. A juridical method has been used for in this study. It is mainly the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>office,</b> the employer and the employee who have the responsibilities for the process of the rehabilitation. The social insurance offices foremost function is to coordinate and supervise the efforts, which are needed for the rehabilitation. The employers shall take actions which are needed for an effective rehabilitation, have responsibility for the systematic work environment management and give the <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>office</b> the information that is needed. The employees responsibility is to participate in the planning of the rehabilitation and in the actual rehabilitation as good as possible. There are many factors which affect the rehabilitation for those who due to illness or injury are unable to work. It can for example be the employees own participation in the rehabilitation, the systematic work environment management and the size of the company. There are differences between Sweden and Denmark regarding the employers responsibility for the rehabilitation. The most important difference is that the employer in Denmark does not have any responsibilities for the rehabilitation.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to deepen {{knowledge}} of leaders’ conceptions, strategies and preconditions to promote and maintain health at work in human service organisations. Methods: The qualitative study I and prospective study II are both part of a research and development programme (The SAMS study) of workplace health promotion (WHP) projects and the setting was the City of Göteborg. Qualitative interviews with project leaders (n= 23) and project applications were analysed in line with grounded theory in study I. Questionnaire and sick-leave register-based {{data were collected from}} the employer in study II and analysed on individual (n= 2375) and workplace unit (n= 34) level. Study III was a qualitative grounded theory study based on interviews with first and second line managers (n= 21) in health care organisations and <b>social</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>offices.</b> Study IV was a prospective study of managers (n= 216) within a longitudinal cohort questionnaire study of employees working in a large public healthcare organisation. The prevalence of maintaining a managerial post and health were related to work and work–life balance predictors at baseline, using Cox regression. Results: Leaders’ strategies for improving employee health were related to their approaches to economic and human resources. The employees and budget were viewed as either obstacles or as resources to organisational and health development. How the workplace health promotion (WHP) projects were targeted was related to the leaders’ (a) views of responsibility for employee health and (b) focus for change. One project could deal with single or multiple factors. Leadership qualities and WHP strategies {{had a significant impact on}} increased work attendance in projects that had goals clearly focusing on changeable factors, in multi-focused projects and in units where leaders viewed the organisation or the society (rather than individual workers) as being responsible for employee health. Leaders attempted to handle stress at the workplace by acting as shock absorbers, characterised as leading in continuous change whilst maintaining trust. To manage their own stress, leaders tried to sustain their own integrity, characterised as either identifying with or distancing themselves from the leadership role. Sixty percent remained as healthcare managers after four years and 52 percent of them had a balanced work attendance. Maintaining as a manager was predicted by moderate/high job control and not having daily contact with patients. Maintained good health was predicted by having energy left for domestic work and feeling invigorated after sleep. Conclusion: Leaders’ conceptions of employees as either obstacles to or opportunities for development and their views on responsibility for employee health seem to influence their WHP strategies. Leadership qualities and WHP strategies have an important effect on implementation processes and on health in the workplace. Supportive structures and improved communication about everyday dilemmas seem to be needed in order to improve the basic conditions for practicing leadership in human service organisations and may be as good an investment as the development of individual leaders’ competences if the turnover of leaders seems high...|$|R
