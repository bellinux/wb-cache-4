60|$|But it happened, unfortunately, {{that the}} rules for the {{interpretation}} of auguries and omens, were far too indefinite and vague to answer the purpose {{for which they were}} now appealed to. The most unequivocal distinctness and directness in giving its responses is a very essential requisite in any tribunal that is called upon as an umpire, to settle disputes; while the ancient auguries and oracles were always susceptible of a great variety of interpretations. When Remus and Romulus commenced their watch no vultures were to be seen from either hill. They waited till evening, still none appeared. They continued to watch through the night. In the morning a messenger came over from the Palatine hill to Remus on the Aventine, informing him that vultures had appeared to Romulus. Remus did not believe it. At last, however, the birds really came into view; a flock of six were seen by Remus, and afterward one of twelve by Romulus. The observations were then suspended, and the parties came together to confer in respect to the result; but the dispute instead of being settled, was found to be in a worse condition than ever. The point now to be determined was whether six vultures seen first, or twelve seen afterward, were the better omen, that is whether numbers, or <b>simple</b> <b>priority</b> of appearance, should decide the question. In contending in respect to this nice point the brothers became more angry with each other than ever. Their respective partisans took sides in the contest, which resulted finally in an open and violent collision. Romulus and Remus themselves seem to have commenced the affray by attacking one another. Faustulus, their foster-father, who, from having had the care of them from their earliest infancy, felt for them an almost parental affection, rushed between them to prevent them from shedding each other's blood. He was struck down and killed on the spot, by some unknown hand. A brother of Faustulus too, named Plistinus, who had lived near to him, and had known the boys from their infancy, and had often assisted in taking care of them, was killed in the endeavor to aid his brother to appease the tumult.|$|E

30|$|Most of the {{previous}} research on supporting H. 264 video transmission over wireless environments was focused on general or cellular wireless networks and {{did not address the}} specific issues of WLANs [7 – 9]. Few notable solutions that address WLANs ignore the complexities of the MAC layer operation [10, 11]. One noteworthy solution is described in [10]. This work presents a way of mapping 802.11 e MAC priorities to different types (partitions) of H. 264 frames for improving the quality of video transmitted over WLAN. This method, however, ignores the large overhead of the PHY and MAC layers and the sensitivity of the MAC layer operation to traffic pattern characteristics such as packet sizes. Moreover, the use of contention-based mechanisms and <b>simple</b> <b>priorities</b> results in a very inefficient operation, as is later shown in this paper.|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates low {{overhead}} {{solutions to}} the problem of scheduling instability in non-preemptive static priority list scheduling. Non-preemptive priority list scheduling is vulnerable to several multiprocessor anomalies. For example, in precedence constrained task systems, real-time deadlines can be missed due to a reduction in the duration of one or more tasks. A system displaying this behavior is called unstable. Several inherently stable run-time dispatchers of varying complexity are presented and their performance is investigated. These algorithms are less restrictive than previous stabilization methods and are based on an Extended Scheduling model that includes phantom tasks as a mechanism to model non-transparent overhead and events external to the processor. The dispatchers presented range from the <b>simplest</b> <b>priority</b> sequence enforcing dispatcher, up to a minimally stable algorithm based on the conditions necessary and sufficient for instability to occur. Extensive simulation {{on a wide range of}} task systems, including real-world workloads, shows that very simple low-overhead dispatchers have near-optimal average performance. Thus, real-time system developers are supplied with simple run-time dispatching algorithms that make complicated stabilization methods unnecessary. ...|$|R

50|$|Any {{priority}} queue {{that can handle}} non-monotone extraction operations can also handle monotone extractions, but some {{priority queue}}s are specialized to work only for monotone extractions or work better when the extractions are monotone.For instance, the bucket queue is a <b>simple</b> <b>priority</b> queue data structure consisting of an array indexed by priority, where each array cell contains a bucket of items with that priority. An extract-min operation performs a sequential search for the first non-empty bucket and chooses an arbitrary item in that bucket. For non-monotone extractions, each extract-min operation takes time (in the worst case) proportional to the array length (the number of distinct priorities).However, when used as a monotone priority queue, {{the search for the}} next non-empty bucket can begin at the priority of the most recent previous extract-min operation rather than {{at the start of the}} array. This optimization causes the total time for a sequence of operations to be proportional to the sum of the number of operations and the length of the array, rather than (as in the non-monotonic case) the product of these two quantities.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor maximum {{efficiency}} in a multiprocessor system the load should be shared evenly over all processors; that is, {{there should be}} no idle processors when tasks are available. The delay in a load-sharing algorithm is the larger of the maximum time that any processor can be idle before a task is assigned to it, and the maximum time that it must wait to be relieved of an excess task. A <b>simple</b> parallel <b>priority</b> queue architecture for load sharing in a p-processor multiprocessor system is proposed.

40|$|The CAN (Controller Area Network) {{protocol}} provides {{one of the}} cost-effective {{methods to}} network current generations of distributed embedded systems. Although it is a robust protocol with short messages and <b>simple</b> <b>priorities,</b> it is largely thought of as only being suitable for soft real-time, event-triggered systems. Safety critical applications require highly predictable behaviour with strict bounds on worst-case message transmission times; the next-generation mechatronic systems also requires {{a high level of}} information throughput. In its current form, CAN lacks most of these requirements principally due to its medium access scheme and physical-layer design. This thesis presents a frame work which aims to enhance the capabilities of CAN, in order to push the boundaries of the protocol’s current operation. In particular, the main research question to be addressed is the exploration {{of the extent to which}} low-level modifications can enhance CAN suitability for use in the next generation of critical systems. In order to answer this question, it is first necessary to develop a flexible and robust platform to implement these modifications using a novel facility made up from custom soft-core CAN controllers. This novel facility was then employed to implement and experimentally investigate three small but conceptually significant protocol modifications as follows: Increasing the effective data rate from 1 to 10 Mbps whilst doubling the effective payload from 8 to 16 bytes; Reduction of unwanted transmission jitter by compensating for bit stuffing; Enabling a windowed transmission scheme to provide optimal trade-off’s between transmission reliability and real-time behaviour in noisy environments. The thesis describes the results obtained from these experiments and summarizes the main pros and cons that appear. The thesis then concludes with observation that the modified CAN protocol may be suitable for use with certain classes, of the next generation time-critical distributed embedded systems...|$|R

Secondly, they are regarded as a FIFO queue, which they improve with a mechanism called random early discard with in/out buffer management. In the same way, service differentiation in stateless wireless ad hoc networks[11] also theoretically employs a priority queue but confines the amount of real-time traffic for protecting the lower-priority traffic from starvation[12].|$|E
