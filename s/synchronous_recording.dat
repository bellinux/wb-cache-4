40|$|On {{the basis}} of the optimization-based {{approach}} to the analysis of massive ordered data sets, a new method is proposed for computer-aided interpretation of seismic exploratory data from the so-called crystalline basement of the Earth mantle, which underlies the relatively thin sedimentary cover having been, up to now, the almost exceptional object of seismic explorations. The seismic exploratory data sets, seismic sections and cubes, are a class of, respectively, two- and three-dimensional data arrays, which are analyzed in the course of gas and oil reserves prospecting with the purpose of studying the structure of the underground rock mass. The seismic data sets consist of <b>synchronous</b> <b>records</b> of reflected seismic signals registered by a large number of geophones (seismic sensors) placed along a straight line or in the nodes of a rectangular lattice on the earth surface.

40|$|Palaeoenvironmental {{analyses}} of an exposed sequence of interbedded sand and peat overlying glacial till on Stronsay, Orkney, has revealed evidence of dynamic landscape change during the Holocene. AMS radiocarbon and OSL dating {{are used to}} identify periods of minerogenic and organic sediment accumulation. A lengthy period of stability during the early Holocene is inferred from {{the development of a}} deeply weathered till surface with pollen and soil micromorphological evidence suggesting prolonged woodland cover. During the mid to late Holocene phases of wind-blown sand that inundated the landscape are defined from the sedimentary record and are interpreted as periods of increased storminess between c. 3400 - 3100 cal. BP and c. 2800 - 2260 cal. BP. The palaeoecological evidence points to continuity of human exploitation, despite the phases of increased storminess during the Bronze Age and into the Iron Age. Rising sea levels and a severe storm event at c. 650 years BP inundated the site with massive sands and truncated the record. These storm events recorded on Stronsay are part of a regionally <b>synchronous</b> <b>record</b> for periods of increased storminess across the North Atlantic region during the Holocene...|$|R

50|$|When recording, audio {{engineers}} can select which track (or tracks) on the device {{will be used}} for each instrument, voice, or other input and can even blend one track with two instruments to vary the music and sound options available. At any given point on the tape, any of the tracks on the recording device can be recording or playing back using sel-sync or Selective <b>Synchronous</b> <b>recording.</b> This allows an artist to be able to record onto track 2 and, simultaneously, listen to track 1, 3 and 7, allowing them to sing or to play an accompaniment to the performance already recorded on these tracks. They might then record an alternate version on track 4 while listening to the other tracks. All the tracks can then be played back in perfect synchrony, as if they had originally been played and recorded together. This can be repeated until all of the available tracks have been used, or in some cases, reused. During mix down a separate set of playback heads with higher fidelity are used.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} in multitrack recording came in 1953, when musician Les Paul devised {{the concept of}} 8-track recording; this was commercially developed by the Ampex corporation, which launched its first [...] "Sel-Sync" [...] (Selective <b>Synchronous)</b> <b>recording</b> system in 1955, but for the next 35 years, multitrack audio recording technology was largely confined to specialist radio, TV and music recording studios, primarily because multitrack tape machines were both very large and very expensive - the first Ampex 8-track recorder, installed in Les Paul's home studio in 1957, cost a princely US$10,000 - roughly three times the US average yearly income in 1957, and equivalent to around $90,000 in 2016. However, this situation changed radically in 1979 {{with the introduction of}} the TASCAM Portastudio, which used the inexpensive compact audio cassette as the recording medium, making good-quality 4-track (and later 8-track) multitrack recording available to the average consumer for the first time. Ironically, by the time the Portastudio had become popular, electronics companies were already introducing digital audio recording systems, and by the 1990s, computer-based digital multitrack recording systems such as Pro Tools and Cubase were being adopted by the recording industry, and soon became standard. By the early 2000s, rapid advances in home computing and digital audio software were making digital multitrack audio recording systems available to the average consumer, and high-quality digital multitrack recording systems like GarageBand were being included as a standard feature on home computers.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} Nuance, a software application for <b>recording</b> <b>synchronous</b> data streams from modern musical systems that involve audio and gesture signals. Nuance currently supports recording {{data from a}} number of input sources including real-time audio, and any sensor system, musical interface, or instrument which outputs serial, Open Sound Control (OSC), or MIDI. Nuance is unique in that it is a highly customizable to the user and unknown musical systems for music information retrieval (MIR), allowing virtually any multimodal input to be recorded with minimal effort. Targeted toward musicians working with MIR researchers, Nuance considerably minimizes the set-up and running times of MIR data acquisition scenarios. Nuance attempts to eliminate most of the software programming required to gather data from custom multimodal systems, and provides an easy drag-and-drop user interface for setting up, configuring, and <b>recording</b> <b>synchronous</b> multimodal data streams. 1...|$|R

40|$|Four cores {{from the}} Antarctic {{continental}} margin located between 50 and 200 km from the present-day ice shelf edge, {{were selected for}} sedimentological and mass spectrometer analysis. The first stable isotope records of the Southern Polar Ocean can be correlated in detail with global isotope stratigraphy. Together with magnetostratigraphic, sedi¬mentological and micropaleontological data, the record provides stratigraphic and paleoceanographic information back to the Jaramillo subchron (910 kyr). Although the isotope values have been altered by diagenetic processes in the sediments, which are poor in carbonate, an interpretation is possible via correlation with the sedimentological parameters. Oxygen isotope data give indications for a meltwater spike {{at the beginning of}} interglacials, when large scale melting of parts of the ice shelves took place. The <b>synchronous</b> <b>record</b> of the benthic and planktonic d 13 C-signals reflect continuous bottom water formation also during glacials. Primary productivity was strictly reduced during glacials due to continuous ice coverage in the Weddell Sea. The climatic improvement at the beginning of an interglacial is associated with peak values in biologic activity lasting for about 15 kyr. During one climatic cycle, mean sedimentation rates at the continental margin decrease with increasing distance from the continent from 5. 2 to 1. 3 cm/kyr. Maximum sedimentation rates of 25 cm/kyr at the beginning of an interglacial down to 0. 6 cm/kyr during glacial periods have been calculated. The rate is mainly controlled by movements of the ice shelf edge and ice rafting...|$|R

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of carotid-to-femoral pulse transit time (PTT) {{is required to}} estimate the carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, a parameter considered as {{the gold standard for}} the quantification of large artery stiffness. In this study we propose a novel, non contact laser-based technique (laser class II w laser pen), named optical Vibrocardiography (VCG), for evaluating PTT from <b>synchronous</b> <b>recorded</b> vibrations of the skin at the carotid and femoral artery site. It has been demonstrated that these skin vibrations are directly related to the radial displacement of the underlying arteries, and are hence related to the passage of the pressure pulse. In this feasibility study, measurements were performed on 14 young male healthy subjects (25. 3 +/- 0. 8) using 2 commercially available vibrometers (Polytec Gmbh, Waldbronn, Germany). The obtained PTT values (74. 86 +/- 8. 63 ms) were compared with PTT evaluated on the same subjects by means of applanation tonometry applied simultaneously on the same locations (75. 85 +/- 8. 61 ms). The two techniques were very well correlated (r² 0. 89, P< 0. 001, Spearman rho 0. 88) and values were not statistically different (p = 0. 377). Our preliminary results demonstrate that laser-based non-contact measurement of pulse transit time is feasible in young healthy volunteers, and yields values that are equivalent to those measured using arterial applanation tonometry. Clinical application of this appealing non-invasive method can overcome practical and technical limitations inherent to currently used methods such as arterial applanation tonometry, ultrasound, plethysmography, requiring physical contact of the probe with the patient...|$|R

Lower registers share doublet and triplet waveform patterns, but differ significantly in jitter and shimmer rates (j < 0. 1; sh < 0. 15 for ThS). Other findings are a narrowed bandwidth of a dominant F 2 and an ostinato formant between F 3 and F 4, which are remarkable for all throat singing styles. 1...|$|E
40|$|A large {{amplitude}} {{blood pressure}} oscillation occurs during social defeat in a territorial fight between male rats, {{and during the}} application of a psychosocial stimulus associated with this defeat. <b>Synchronous</b> <b>recording</b> of blood pressure, intrathoracic pressure and diaphragm activity shows that the blood pressure oscillation coincides with a typical respiratory pattern called 'pressure breathing', during which a strongly positive intrathoracic pressure with expiration can be observed. The expiration was relatively prolonged and accompanied by a rise in blood pressure and a decrease in heart frequency. These alterations outlast the applied social respectively psychosocial stimulations. The {{results of this study suggest}} that behaviorally induced pressure breathing is of importance to attentional processes during social stimulation.

40|$|Here {{we report}} the resting {{metabolic}} rate in barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) and provide evidence for the significant energetic effect of posture. Under laboratory conditions flow-through respirometry together with <b>synchronous</b> <b>recording</b> of behaviour enabled a calculation of how metabolic rate varies with posture. Our principal finding is that standing bipedally incurs a 25 % increase in metabolic rate compared to birds sitting on the ground. In addition to the expected decrease in energy consumption of hindlimb postural muscles when sitting, we hypothesise that a change in breathing mechanics represents one potential mechanism for {{at least part of}} the observed difference in energetic cost. Due to the significant effect of posture, future studies of {{resting metabolic rate}}s need to take into account and/or report differences in posture...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{clinical and}} EMG findings in three patients with {{an inability to}} reopen the eyes after voluntary closure of the eyelids. <b>Synchronous</b> EMG <b>recording</b> from the levator palpebrae (LP) and orbicularis oculi (OrbOc) muscles revealed that after voluntary closure of the eyelids and upon the command to open the eyes, all three patients were unable to inhibit the "voluntary" contraction of the OrbOc muscles, while on clinical examination {{there was no evidence}} of ongoing OrbOc muscle contraction. This "motor persistence" was restricted predominantly to the pretarsal portion of the OrbOc. In one patient, it occurred as an isolated abnormality of the eyelid movement and was recorded as an additional EMG abnormality in two patients with blepharospasm and involuntary LP inhibition. Clinical examination alone cannot differentiate this type of disorder of supranuclear control of eyelid movement from involuntary LP inhibition; simultaneous EMG recording from the LP and OrbOc muscles is required.

40|$|Optical {{instruments}} for measuring surface-wave characteristics {{provide a better}} spatial and temporal resolution than other methods, but they face difficulties while converting the results of indirect measurements into absolute levels of the waves.

40|$|Subject of Research. A {{stereoscopic}} {{method of}} technical vision is proposed for recording the kinematic {{characteristics of the}} dynamic indentation process in determining the physico-mechanical properties of materials. The proposed method {{makes it possible to}} determine the values of the indenter motion speed with high accuracy. Method. The method is based on the use of two high-speed video cameras immovably fixed on one flat platform. Cameras allow for <b>synchronous</b> <b>recording</b> of the indentation process. The objectives and orientation of cameras in the stereo system provide intersection of the visual fields and the required depth of the image space field. Measurement of the movement speed is performed by triangulation method. The distance between the conjugate points of the recorded object on the stereo images is inversely proportional to the distance between the pair of cameras and the corresponding point of the object in the three-dimensional space. Based on the analysis of images obtained by spatially separated cameras, the coordinates of the object point are determined. Main Results. The experimental setup consisted of two high-speed monochrome camcorders Evercam 4000 - 32 -M, rigidly fixed through stereo. <b>Synchronous</b> <b>recording</b> was kept at a speed of 4000 frames/s with a resolution of 1280 × 860 pixels. The indenter was made {{in the form of a}} steel ball with a mass of 230 g with a diameter of 38 mm and fell onto an aluminum disk 10 mm thick from a height of 310 mm. Video images from cameras were transferred to a personal computer for processing. The analysis of the obtained data was carried out in the MATLAB system with the help of a specially written software module. The sensitivity of the proposed method made it possible to determine confidently the values of the maximum approach speed of a steel ball equal to 2. 39 m/s and a rebound velocity of 1. 2 m/s. The random component of the method error did not exceed 2. 5 %. Practical Relevance. The development of this approach will enable to create high-precision sensors of dynamic indentation.

40|$|Air-break {{disconnectors}} (DS) in a high-voltage network can interrupt small capacitive currents (e. g., occurring when disconnecting short unloaded transmission lines, current transformers, and so forth). The {{performance of}} a device with high-velocity opening auxiliary contacts attached to the DS enhancing the interrupting capability is presented. A series of laboratory experiments is carried out with the interrupted current range between 5 and 27 A. The experimental observations include voltage and current characteristics of the DS, and <b>synchronous</b> optical <b>recording</b> of the arc with a high-speed camera. Electrical and optical data are studied for fail and successful interruptions. The results show: 1) The short arcing time by the fast opening contacts limits the energy input into the arc, enhancing the probability of arc extinction; 2) the contribution to the arc energy mainly comes from the oscillations upon restrike. The energy input to the arc increases with higher breakdown voltage, larger air gap, and higher interrupted current; 3) the arc brightness is synchronous with arc current. With higher interrupted current, the overall arc is brighter and its remnants decay slower. Based on the results, potential successful approaches to increase the interruption capability are discussed...|$|R
