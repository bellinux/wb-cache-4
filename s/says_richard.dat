2500|$|Ducati had an {{important}} place in early Superbike racing history in the United States and vice versa: In 1977, Cycle magazine editors Cook Neilson and Phil Schilling took a Ducati 750SS to first place at Daytona in the second-ever season of AMA Superbike racing. [...] "Neilson retired from racing {{at the end of}} the year, but the bike he and Schilling built — nicknamed Old Blue for its blue livery — became a legend," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Richard</b> Backus from Motorcycle Classics: [...] "How big a legend? Big enough for Ducati to team with Italian specialty builder NCR to craft a limited-edition update, New Blue, based on the 2007 Sport 1000S, and big enough to inspire the crew at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum (see Barber Motorsports Park), arguably one of the most important motorcycle museums in the world, to commission Ducati specialist Rich Lambrechts to craft a bolt-by-bolt replica for its collection. The finished bike's name? Deja Blue." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. And {{therefore}} {{to describe the}} action correctly, we should not <b>say</b> <b>Richard</b> robbed a boy of his sled, but that he robbed him of his sled for a time, or he robbed him {{of the use of}} his sled. Still, in respect to the nature and the guilt of it, it was robbery." ...|$|R

"I am {{perfectly}} aware, Mr. Vholes," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Richard,</b> more familiarly and good-humouredly, [...] "that you are {{the most}} reliable fellow in the world and that to have to do with you is to have to do with a man of business who is not to be hoodwinked. But put yourself in my case, dragging on this dislocated life, sinking deeper and deeper into difficulty every day, continually hoping and continually disappointed, conscious of change upon change for the worse in myself, and of no change for the better in anything else, and you will find it a dark-looking case sometimes, as I do." ...|$|E

[...] "We mistake men's diseases," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Richard</b> Baxter, [...] "when we think there needeth nothing to cure them of their errors but the evidence of truth. Alas! there are many distempers of mind to be removed before they receive that evidence." [...] Nevertheless, when it is fully laid before them, my duty will be done. Conviction will follow in due time. I do not consider myself as in any way addressing, or having to do with, the ordinary critics of the press. Their writings are not the guide, but the expression, of public opinion. A writer for a newspaper naturally and necessarily endeavors to meet, as nearly as he can, {{the feelings of the}} majority of his readers; his bread depends on his doing so. Precluded by the nature of his occupations from gaining any knowledge of art, he is sure that he can gain credit for it by expressing the opinions of his readers. He mocks the picture which the public pass, and bespatters with praise the canvas which a crowd concealed from him.|$|E

And indeed, Dawkins has done a marvelous job of popularizing Darwinism. But Dawkins' basic theory of the gene being the object of evolution is totally non-Darwinian.

5000|$|The work {{remains a}} rare UK {{example of a}} large scale {{experiment}} in the synthesis of art and architecture. [...] "It stands today," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Richard</b> Cork, [...] "as a fascinating example of how contemporary artists can translate their concerns into wholly architectural terms, and how even the restricted budget of a new town is able, given the necessary degree of commitment, to yield funding for a purely imaginative feat." ...|$|E

In December 2008, Martin and former co-host Ed Kavalee {{released}} a special tribute podcast on Triple M which featured selected clips of Marsland's contributions to Get This. Martin also dedicated his 2009 book A Nest of Occasionals to Richard.|$|R

Munch leads a search of the surrounding apartments, but fails to turn up any leads. Morales suggests Richard could have spoofed Garcia’s phone number, making the task of tracing the call harder. When questioned further, Maria <b>says</b> <b>Richard</b> buys her food from [...] "Felipe’s Burgers", which is 20 blocks away from the search area. Fin goes to the location and learns it burned down three months prior. Benson then instructs Maria not to lie to her, and Maria hangs up.|$|E

50|$|Analysts {{attribute}} this blunder more to General Sultan’s lack {{of understanding}} of diplomatic norms and to the language barrier. “While it would be unjust to accuse General Shaukat Sultan of lying, {{the fact of the matter}} is that he was not clear what he is uttering” <b>says</b> <b>Richard</b> Nicole - who heads South Asia desk among the American think tank. “Let's hope he misunderstood the original question”, concludes The Indepundit. “My point being that Gen. Sultan is not announcing Pakistan's policy in the matter. He's telling people what the practical reality is based on the operations of the actual authority in the region”, noted the Hindu site.|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} opinion places Punt in Northeastern Africa, {{based on the}} fact that the products of Punt (as depicted in the Hatshepsut illustrations) were abundantly found in the Horn of Africa but were less common or sometimes absent in Arabia. These products included gold and aromatic resins such as myrrh, frankincense, and ebony; the wild animals depicted in Punt included giraffes, baboons, hippopotami, and leopards. <b>Says</b> <b>Richard</b> Pankhurst: [...] "Punt has been identified with territory on both the Arabian and the Horn of Africa coasts. Consideration of the articles that the Egyptians obtained from Punt, notably gold and ivory, suggests, however, that these were primarily of African origin. ... This leads us to suppose that the term Punt probably applied more to African than Arabian territory." ...|$|E

He has written a network television theme song, a Presidential campaign song, a national sports anthem, show tunes, gospel songs, comic numbers and a Billboard Country Single of the Year. Working {{with a variety of}} collaborators, he has been responsible for such unforgettable hits as “Sold,” “Only on Days That End in Y,” “I Miss You a Little,” “Overnight Male” and “Be My Baby Tonight.” Albums containing Fagan songs have sold more than 25 million copies. “God has always given me a pot of gold,” <b>says</b> <b>Richard</b> Fagan. “I think there’s a reason for it all.

5000|$|This is a {{reference}} to the fact that very low doses of radiation have only marginal impacts on individual health outcomes. It is therefore difficult to detect the 'signal' of decreased or increased morbidity and mortality due to low-level radiation exposure in the 'noise' of other effects. The notion of radiation hormesis has been rejected by the National Research Council's (part of the National Academy of Sciences) 16-year-long study on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation. [...] "The scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial. The health risks - particularly the development of solid cancers in organs - rise proportionally with exposure" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Richard</b> R.

Even the quaint little shoes she wore were embroidered with silver thread and had large rosettes on them. After removing the handkerchief from her face, she continued silent and with eyes cast down, looking very pale and troubled.|$|R
