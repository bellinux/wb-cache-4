40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of <b>banning</b> <b>soft</b> drinks in schools on {{purchases}} outside of school. We utilize unique household-level and store-level data sources in combination with time-series and cross-sectional variation of state-level regulations in a difference-in-differences (DD) approach. We detect {{a decrease in the}} overall trend in sales, but observe this downward trend in households with and without children, as well as in states with and without regulation. Controlling for advertising allows us to further reject that leading brands intensify their advertising efforts and target children to potentially offset their reduced presence at schools. Finally, we find no evidence of substitution effects among possible beverage product alternatives. Our analysis therefore suggests that <b>soft</b> drink <b>bans</b> at school reduce overall soft drink consumption as school age children do not compensate for this limited availability at home. <b>Soft</b> drink <b>bans,</b> <b>soft</b> drink consumption, scanner data, schools, regulation, difference-in-differences, Agricultural and Food Policy, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Food Security and Poverty, Health Economics and Policy, D 12, D 18, L 51, C 93,...|$|R

40|$|Sarah Conly defends paternalistic {{public health}} policies, such as New York City’s <b>soft</b> drink <b>ban,</b> {{on the grounds}} that they promote values that people accept but have {{difficulty}} realizing, owing to their cognitive biases. In this commentary, I criticize Conly’s defense of the <b>soft</b> drink <b>ban</b> and offer my own view of the justification for paternalistic food and beverage policies. I propose that paternalistic government restrictions on food and beverage choices should address a significant health problem pertaining to a specific type or class of food or beverage. There should also be substantial evidence that the restrictions are likely to be effective at dealing with the problem and that alternative ways of dealing with it, which do not involve coercion, are likely to be ineffective...|$|R
40|$|This essay evaluates two {{provisions}} in the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) : raising contribution limits and <b>banning</b> <b>soft</b> money. The model {{highlights the importance of}} marginal cost ratios for candidates and their parties. The results suggest that raising contribution limits protects incumbents. Importantly, this generates efficiency gains that {{come at the expense of}} electoral competitiveness. When a party has an advantage in a large number of districts, the <b>soft</b> money <b>ban</b> may also reduce rent-seeking effort while exacerbating existing advantages. Ultimately, the two provisions underscore an "equity-efficiency" trade-off. While restricting rent-seeking effort, they probably lead to less competitive elections.

40|$|McCain-style {{campaign}} finance regulation {{is the new}} campaign reality. But what exactly will this reformist utopia look like? Assessing the "reformed" campaign of the future against the stated desires and expectations of the principal {{campaign finance}} regulators and their media supporters, this paper predicts the most important changes in political campaigning, changes that will be experienced {{for the first time}} during the 2003 - 04 electoral cycle. Those changes include the following: The <b>ban</b> on <b>soft</b> money fundraising by the national parties will make our elections significantly less competitive. The federal <b>soft</b> money <b>ban</b> will reduce voter turnout by approximately 2 percent As a result of the <b>soft</b> money <b>ban,</b> both the parties and their candidates will lose influence over their own campaigns. The prescribed channeling of third-party advertising through political action committees (PACs), paid for only in hard money donations, will increase the number of PACs and the proliferation of PAC-run microcampaigns. The severe restrictions on independent advertising will inadvertently produce both longer and more negative campaigns. Overall, the allegedly reformed campaign of the future will be less competitive, less controlled by candidates and their parties, and more influenced by the mainstream media and will involve fewer voters than the typical campaign of today. Most Americans support real campaign finance reform, but clearly this is not the future promised to them by the self-described reformers...|$|R

5000|$|The Act was amended {{again in}} 1976, in {{response}} to the provisions ruled unconstitutional by Buckley v.

In 1979, the FEC ruled that political parties could spend unregulated or [...] "soft" [...] money for non-federal administrative and party building activities. Later, this money was used for candidate-related issue ads, which led to a substantial increase in soft money contributions and expenditures in elections. This in turn led to passage of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 ("BCRA"), effective on January 1, 2003, <b>banning</b> <b>soft</b> money expenditure by parties.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{different}} steps {{taken during the}} past 20 years for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in the Seychelles.

Decreasing smoking prevalence is evidence of success, but the raising so-called diabesity epidemic calls for an integrated multi-sector policy to mould an environment conducive to healthy behaviors.

40|$|Few {{recently}} passed laws have attracted {{as much attention}} as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), which <b>banned</b> <b>soft</b> money contributions to political candidates and prohibited corporate and union advertising in {{the weeks leading up to}} an election. One of the BCRA 2 ̆ 7 s most important and novel sections, however-§ 311, Clarity Standards for Identification of Sponsors of Election-Related Advertising-has largely escaped comment, both when the bill was passed and when its constitutionality was adjudicated in the courts. Section 311 makes two major changes to existing law on the disclosure of the sponsor of campaign communication. First, it expands the categories of campaign communication for which it must be disclosed who funded and authorized the communication. Previously, only communications 2 ̆ 2 expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate 2 ̆ 2 or soliciting contributions were required to reveal their sponsors.

40|$|Campaign finance is a {{topic of}} {{contemporary}} importance in the American political system. Many citizens feel they have no voice in a political system controlled by special interests with deep pockets. Senator John McCain in the 2000 presidential primary season placed campaign finance reform {{as the centerpiece of}} his campaign. In his speech on September 27, 1999 in Nashua New Hampshire to announce his candidacy for president McCain stated: “If we are {{to meet the challenges of}} our time, we must take the corrupting influence of special interest out of politics. ” McCain has continued to serve as the primary spokesperson for campaign finance reform and has been the key actor in the recent passage of campaign finance reform with its centerpiece of <b>banning</b> <b>soft</b> money.

[...] In that year, Time magazine named McCain as one of the [...] "25 Most Influential People in America". [...] McCain used his chairmanship to challenge the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns and reduce the number of teenage smokers, increase research money on health studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. [...] The industry spent some $40–50million in national advertising in response; while McCain's bill had the support of the Clinton administration and many public health groups, most Republican senators opposed it, stating it would create an unwieldy new bureaucracy. The bill failed to gain cloture twice and was seen as a bad political defeat for McCain. [...] During 1998 a revised version of the McCain-Feingold Act came up for Senate consideration; in addition to <b>banning</b> <b>soft</b> money, it sought to restrict [...] "issue ads" [...] run by independent groups within 60 days of an election.
