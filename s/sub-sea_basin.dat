40|$|Independent of Indochina extrusion, the South China Sea {{experienced}} a process from passive continental rifting to marginal sea drifting. According to the fault {{patterns in the}} Beibu Gulf basin and the Pearl River Mouth basin, the continental rifting and early spreading stage from 32 to 26 Ma were controlled by extensional stress field, which shifted clockwise from southeastward to south southeastward. From 24 Ma on, the sea spread in NW-SE direction and ceased spreading at around 15. 5 Ma. Integrated geological information {{with the assumption that}} the South China Sea developed along a pre-Cenozoic weakness zone, we did analogue experiments on the South China Sea evolution. Experiments revealed that the pre-existing weakness zone goes roughly along the uplift zone between the present Zhu- 1 and Zhu- 2 depression. The pre-existing weakness zone is composed of three segments trending NNE, roughly EW and NEE, respectively. The early opening of the South China Sea is accompanied with roughly 150 clockwise rotation, while the SE <b>sub-sea</b> <b>basin</b> opened with SE extension. Tinjar fault was the western boundary of the Nansha block (Dangerous Ground), while Lupar fault was the eastern boundary of the Indochina, NW-trending rift belt known as Zengmu basin developed between above two faults due to block divergent of Indochina from Nansha. In the experiment, transtensional flower structures along NW-trending faults are seen, and slight inversion occurs along some NE-dipping faults. The existence of rigid massifs changed the orientations of some faults and rift belt, and also led to deformation concentrate around the massifs. The rifting and drifting of the South China Sea might be caused by slab pull from the proto South China Sea subducting toward Borneo and/or mantle flow caused by India-Asia collision...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the major}} {{assumptions}} underlying the science of geothermics over the last 100 years has been that heat istransported through the Earth's crust only by conduction, except {{in the immediate vicinity}} of active volcanoes. In old shields this assumption may be justifiable, but in sedimentary basins the ability of water to move through permeable aquifers provides a means of heat ransport that may under certain conditions be as effective as conduction. The thermal history of a basin depends on its tectonic origin and the circumstances of its development. The dissipation of excess heat associated with basin formation and the transfer of the continuous heat supply from the basement depend on the thermal properties of the strata nd their water content. In some basins widespread contrasts of heat flow are observed, both laterally and vertically, suggesting forced convection by water migration. In basins where part of the surface is above sea-level a hydrological drive may be inferred from the topographic surface. In <b>sub-sea</b> <b>basins</b> this drive is not available in the same form. Nevertheless, patterns of heat-flow variation have been observed for which some form of water flow seems to be the most probable xplanation...|$|R
5000|$|In 1877 the Scottish {{entrepreneur}} and abolitionist Donald Mackenzie was {{the first}} to propose the creation of a Sahara Sea. Mackenzie's idea was to cut a channel from one of the sand-barred lagoons north of Cape Juby, south to a large plain which Arab traders had identified to him as El Djouf. Mackenzie believed this vast region was up to 61 m below sea level and that flooding it would create an inland sea of 155400 km2 suited to commercial navigation and even agriculture. He further believed that geological evidence suggested this basin had once been connected to the Atlantic via a channel near the Saguia el-Hamra. He proposed that this inland sea, if augmented with a canal, could provide access to the Niger River and the markets and rich resources of West Africa.There are several small depressions in the vicinity of Cape Juby; at 55m below sea level, the Sebkha Tah [...] is the lowest and largest. But it covers less than 250 km² and is 500km north of the geographical area identified as El Djouf (also known as the Majabat al-Koubra [...] ) which has an average elevation of 320m.Mackenzie never travelled in this area but had read of other <b>sub-sea</b> level desert <b>basins</b> in present-day Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt similar to those found near Cape Juby.
