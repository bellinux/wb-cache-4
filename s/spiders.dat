5|$|Almost all jumping <b>spiders</b> are predators, mostly {{preying on}} insects, on other <b>spiders,</b> {{and on other}} arthropods. The most common {{procedure}} is sighting the prey, stalking, fastening a silk safety line to the surface, using the two pairs of back legs {{to jump on the}} victim, and finally biting the prey. Most jumping <b>spiders</b> walk throughout the day, so that they maximize their chances of a catch.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>spiders</b> {{are widely}} feared, {{only a few}} species are {{dangerous}} to people. <b>Spiders</b> will only bite humans in self-defense, and few produce worse effects than a mosquito bite or bee-sting. Most of those with medically serious bites, such as recluse <b>spiders</b> and widow <b>spiders,</b> would rather flee and bite only when trapped, although this can easily arise by accident. Funnel web spiders' defensive tactics include fang display and their venom, although they rarely inject much, has resulted in 13 known human deaths over 50 years. They have been deemed to be the world's most dangerous <b>spiders</b> on clinical and venom toxicity grounds, though this claim has also been attributed to the Brazilian wandering spider, due to much more frequent accidents.|$|E

5|$|Anatomically, <b>spiders</b> {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, <b>spiders</b> do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, <b>spiders</b> have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, <b>spiders</b> have no extensor muscles in their limbs and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Like most <b>spiders,</b> Trogloraptor possess venom glands. However, {{the venom}} {{is not known}} to be harmful to humans. The <b>spiders</b> {{themselves}} are very shy and unaggressive. They immediately flee illumination.|$|E

5|$|Mud dauber wasps, which {{capture and}} paralyze <b>spiders</b> {{as a source}} of food for their larvae, have been shown to prey on both male and female Z. sexpunctatus <b>spiders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some <b>spiders</b> have a cribellum, a {{modified}} spinneret {{with up to}} 40,000 spigots, each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the cribellum, and combined into a composite woolly thread that is very effective in snagging the bristles of insects. The earliest <b>spiders</b> had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before <b>spiders</b> developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of <b>spiders</b> have lost the cribellum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spiders</b> {{can also}} be the prey of {{aggressive}} mimics. The assassin bug Stenolemus bituberus preys on <b>spiders,</b> entering their web and plucking its silk threads until the spider approaches. This vibrational aggressive mimicry matches a general pattern of vibrations which <b>spiders</b> treat as prey, having a similar temporal structure and amplitude to leg and body movements of typical prey caught in the web.|$|E

5|$|<b>Spiders</b> have {{developed}} several different respiratory anatomies, based on book lungs, a tracheal system, or both. Mygalomorph and Mesothelae <b>spiders</b> have {{two pairs of}} book lungs filled with haemolymph, where openings on the ventral surface of the abdomen allow air to enter and diffuse oxygen. This {{is also the case}} for some basal araneomorph <b>spiders,</b> like the family Hypochilidae, but the remaining members of this group have just the anterior pair of book lungs intact while the posterior pair of breathing organs are partly or fully modified into tracheae, through which oxygen is diffused into the haemolymph or directly to the tissue and organs. The trachea system has most likely evolved in small ancestors to help resist desiccation. The trachea were originally connected to the surroundings through a pair of openings called spiracles, but in the majority of <b>spiders</b> this pair of spiracles has fused into a single one in the middle, and moved backwards close to the spinnerets. <b>Spiders</b> that have tracheae generally have higher metabolic rates and better water conservation. <b>Spiders</b> are ectotherms, so environmental temperatures affect their activity.|$|E

5|$|The redback and its {{relatives}} in the genus Latrodectus are considered dangerous, alongside funnel-web <b>spiders</b> (Atrax and Hadronyche), mouse <b>spiders</b> (Missulena), banana <b>spiders</b> (Phoneutria) and recluse <b>spiders</b> (Loxosceles). Venom is produced by holocrine glands in the spider's chelicerae (mouth parts). Venom accumulates in the lumen of the glands and passes through paired ducts into the spider's two hollow fangs. The venom of the redback spider {{is thought to be}} {{similar to that of the}} other Latrodectus <b>spiders.</b> It contains a complex mixture of cellular constituents, enzymes and a number of high-molecular-weight toxins, including insect toxins and a vertebrate neurotoxin called alpha-latrotoxin, which causes intense pain in humans.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consistent}} {{relationship between}} the classification of <b>spiders</b> {{and the types of}} web they build: species in the same genus may build very similar or significantly different webs. Nor is there much correspondence between spiders' classification and the chemical composition of their silks. Convergent evolution in web construction, in other words use of similar techniques by remotely related species, is rampant. Orb web designs and the spinning behaviors that produce them are the best understood. The basic radial-then-spiral sequence visible in orb webs and the sense of direction required to build them may have been inherited from the common ancestors of most spider groups. However, the majority of <b>spiders</b> build non-orb webs. It used to be thought that the sticky orb web was an evolutionary innovation resulting in the diversification of the Orbiculariae. Now, however, it appears that non-orb <b>spiders</b> are a sub-group that evolved from orb-web <b>spiders,</b> and non-orb <b>spiders</b> have over 40% more species and are four times as abundant as orb-web <b>spiders.</b> Their greater success may be because sphecid wasps, which are often the dominant predators of <b>spiders,</b> much prefer to attack <b>spiders</b> that have flat webs.|$|E
5|$|While {{almost all}} jumping <b>spiders</b> are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other <b>spiders,</b> {{and on other}} arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most jumping <b>spiders</b> walk {{throughout}} the day, so that they maximise their chances of a catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most jumping <b>spiders,</b> Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away.|$|E

5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping <b>spiders</b> and web <b>spiders</b> than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping <b>spiders</b> than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web <b>spiders</b> up to twice P. labiataâ€²s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiataâ€²s size when the insect is stuck in a non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiataâ€²s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata very seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiataâ€²s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and <b>spiders.</b> They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of <b>spiders</b> and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web <b>spiders</b> (on rare occasions kinglets have been found stuck in a spider web, either unable to move or dead).|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, spiders' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, <b>spiders</b> and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae. Pedipalps carry {{a large number of}} such setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air-borne smells, such as female pheromones. <b>Spiders</b> also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building <b>spiders,</b> all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes, while the eyes are most important to <b>spiders</b> that hunt actively.|$|E
