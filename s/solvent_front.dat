40|$|Lipid vesicles can be {{connected}} by membrane nanotubes to build networks with promising bioanalytical properties. Here we characterize electrophoretic transport in such membrane tubes, {{with a particular}} eye to how their soft-material nature influences the intratube migration. In the absence of field, the tube radius is 110 +/- 26 nm, and it remains in this range during electrophoresis even though the applied electric field causes a slight decrease in the tube radius (similar to 6 - 11 %). The electrophoretic velocity of the membrane wall (labeled with quantum dots) varies linearly with the field strength. Intratube migration is studied with latex spheres of radii 15, 50, 100, and 250 nm. The largest particle size does not enter the tube at fields strengths lower than 1250 V/m because the energy cost for expanding the tube around the particles is too high. The smaller particles migrate with essentially the same velocity as the membrane at low fields. Above 250 V/cm, the 15 nm particles exhibit an upward deviation from linear behavior and in fact migrate faster than in free solution whereas the 100 nm particles deviate downward. We propose that these nonlinear effects arise because of lipid adsorption to the particles (dominating for 15 nm particles) and a pistonlike compression of the <b>solvent</b> in <b>front</b> of the particles (dominating for 100 nm). As expected from such complexities, existing theories for a sphere migrating in a rigid-wall cylinder cannot explain our velocity results in lipid nanotubes...|$|R
40|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} (PVC) {{is commonly}} used for drinking water pipes. Although PVC is resistant to natural environmental conditions, organic solvents may attack the pipe wall causing swelling, softening, water lines failure and drinking water pollution. Permeation is linked to underground storage tanks and random accidental spills of organic solvents or fuel derivates. Although rare, several cases have been reported. This thesis was developed {{with the idea of}} increasing the understanding of permeation process, developing new laboratory methods for permeation testing, and helping pipe companies in assess about pipe selection in zones of high risk. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRs) was selected as the methodology. NIR is already used in both organic solvents and polymer fields for discriminative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds. The objective of the first study was to track the permeation of PVC pipes by two major organic solvents (toluene and benzene) at different concentrations. The development of principal least squares (PLS) calibrations with NIR spectra and reference data provided by the Civil Engineering lab in Iowa State University gave accurate models with the following statistic values: R 2 above 90, Relative performance determinant (RPD) higher than 3, and standard errors of prediction (SEP) values similar to the standard error of the laboratory (SEL). These models could predict the permeation state of studied pipes in mm of <b>solvent</b> moving <b>front,</b> weight gain or days under permeation. The second study lead to the correlation of the pipe permeation susceptibility in pure toluene in mm/h 1 / 2 to the pipe spectra. Spectra differences from several pipe brands and sizes were modeled with locally weighted regression (LWR) and resulted in several models which can predict with accuracy (RPD above 5) the pipe susceptibility to permeation. In summary, NIR is a suitable tool for permeation studies and may contribute to the better understanding of permeation...|$|R

The binding of trans-[{PtCl(NH 3) 2 } 2 (µ-NH 2 (CH 2) 8 NH 2) ] 2 + (CT 008) and [{Ru(phen) 2 } 2 (µ-bb 5) ] 4 + {phen = 1, 10 -phenanthroline; bb 5 = 1, 5 -bis[4 (4 -methyl- 2, 2 -bipyridyl) ]pentane} (Rubb 5) to Q[10] was studied by 1 H NMR and luminescence spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and molecular modelling. The 1 H NMR resonances of the methylene protons in the bridging ligands of CT 008 and Rubb 5 exhibited large upfield chemical shift changes upon addition of Q[10]. These shifts are indicative of encapsulation of the bridging ligand within the Q[10] cavity, with the metal centres positioned outside the portals. 1 H NMR-based kinetics experiments with Rubb 5 show the presence of a portal-bound intermediate which progresses to a completely encapsulated inclusion complex only after many hours. The large metal centres of Rubb 5 provide a restriction to the movement of the complex {{in and out of the}} cavity and result in binding kinetics that are slow on both the 1 H NMR and biological timescales. This result was consistent with molecular modelling simulations. Cyclic voltammetry showed that the Ru(III/II) couple of free Rubb 5 appeared at + 1. 058 V (vs Ag/AgCl), with the first ligand reduction observed as a shoulder (- 1. 38 V) on the edge of the <b>solvent</b> (water) <b>front.</b> The Q[10]-bound complex exhibited an anodic shift of 48 mV compared to the free metal complex. Luminescence spectroscopy of the binding of Rubb 5 to Q[10] yielded an approximate binding constant of 1. 9 × 109 M- 1. Although CT 008 was encapsulated within Q[10], the inclusion complex was not soluble in several buffers at pH 7. 0. These results indicate that Q[10] is not an effective delivery vehicle for dinuclear platinum(II) anti-cancer drugs; however, due to the strong binding affinity and slow exchange rates, Q[10] does show considerable promise as a delivery mechanism for controlled slow release of large dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes...|$|R
