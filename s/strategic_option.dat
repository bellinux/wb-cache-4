5|$|Halo 4 {{takes place}} in a futuristic science fiction setting in the year 2557, four years after the events of Halo 3. Backstory details that {{hundreds}} of thousands of years before the modern era, humans were one of several interstellar civilizations. Following a war with the parasitic Flood, the humans came into conflict with the Forerunners, a powerful race that upheld a policy of benevolent shepherding of other races known as the Mantle of Responsibility. Humanity had begun an aggressive campaign of destroying any Flood infestations on a planet, which was misinterpreted as a desire for conquest. After centuries of war the Forerunners defeated the humans, ancestors of the contemporary human race, and stripped them of their technology and empire. The Forerunners soon fought the Flood themselves; after exhausting every other <b>strategic</b> <b>option</b> available to them, the Forerunners activated weapons of mass destruction known as the Halo Array. The Array's firing killed all sentient life in the galaxy to deprive the Flood of their food. Life that the Forerunners cataloged was then reseeded throughout the galaxy.|$|E

5000|$|Yossi Alpher, a {{political}} consultant and writer and former senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in November 2008 that: [...] "The initiative {{is unique in}} terms of the comprehensive “payoff” it offers Israel and, with regard to refugees, both the absence of any direct mention of the right of return and the recognition that Israel's agreement to a solution must be solicited. It represents huge progress from the days in 1967". On November 12, 2008, President Shimon Peres reiterated his support for the initiative at the UN General Assembly Meeting on Inter-Faith Dialogue: The Arab peace initiative states that: [...] "A military solution to the conflict will not achieve peace or provide security for the parties." [...] Israel agrees with that assumption. Further on, the initiative states that: [...] "A just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East is the <b>strategic</b> <b>option</b> of the Arab countries." [...] This is Israel's strategy as well. It continues that its goals are to: [...] "...consider the Arab-Israeli conflict ended, and enter into a peace agreement with Israel, and provide security for all the states in the region. Establish normal relations with Israel in the context of comprehensive peace. Stop the further shedding of blood, enabling the Arab countries and Israel to live in peace and good neighborliness, and provide future generations with security, stability and prosperity." [...] These expressions in the Arab peace initiative are inspirational and promising - a serious opening for real progress.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the global}} climate change {{discussion}} and drastic challenges within the external operational environment, many traditional {{pulp and paper industry}} (PPI) companies are forced to search for new value creating business opportunities. This paper discusses this development in the PPI and offers some illustrative examples to demonstrate the vital need for opening up new <b>strategic</b> <b>options.</b> To address these challenges, we launch a dynamic strategic framework for a PPI firm. This dynamic capabilities- and strategic options-based framework comprises of (i) sensing the weak signals of the operational environment, (ii) formulating them as <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> in order to capture their upside potential, (iii) hedging against the downside risks of the options, (iv) exercising these options in often thin (i. e., imperfect) intangible knowledge assets markets, and (v) reconfiguring the existing knowledge base and capabilities to sustain competitive advantage obtained. The framework will be illustrated with <b>strategic</b> <b>options</b> possible for the PPI the main focus being on the interface between the PPI and energy industry by means of a forest biorefinery case.
