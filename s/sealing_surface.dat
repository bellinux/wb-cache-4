2500|$|A band mask is a {{heavy duty}} {{full-face}} mask {{with many of the}} characteristics of a lightweight demand helmet. In structure it is the front section of a lightweight helmet from above the faceplate to below the demand valve and exhaust ports, including the bailout block and communications connections on the sides. This rigid frame is attached to a neoprene hood by a metal clamping band, hence the name. It is provided with a padded <b>sealing</b> <b>surface</b> around the frame edge which is held firmly against the diver's face by a rubber [...] "spider", a multiple strap arrangement with a pad behind the diver's head, and usually five straps which hook onto pins on the band. The straps have several holes so the tension can be adjusted to get a comfortable seal.

5000|$|A {{new type}} of Mason jar known as a [...] "bead" [...] jar was {{introduced}} around 1910 to 1915. These continuous screw-thread jars were designed with a bead between the screw threads and the shoulder as a <b>sealing</b> <b>surface.</b> The Ball Perfect Mason jar, {{one of the most}} common jars of this style, was introduced around 1913 and produced until the mid-twentieth century. It had several variations, including a square-shaped jar. During the twentieth century, bead jars were sealed with two-piece metal lids.

A hydrodynamic analysis is presented for the fully flooded contact zone of a smooth shaft surface running against a rough <b>seal</b> <b>surface.</b> Four roughness structures are considered: one-dimensional sinusoidal and two-dimensional sinusoidal seal roughness structures both without and with a tangential <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> displacement. The tangential <b>seal</b> <b>surface</b> displacement is chosen asymmetric with the axial position in the contact.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{inspection system}} has been developed to inspect the o-ring <b>sealing</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the Space Shuttle reusable solid rocket motor (RSRM) case segment joints.

This paper describes both the hardware and the software used to gather data as well as the methods developed to analyze the data. The RSRM is assembled from four casting segments.

40|$|The {{expansion}} of urban areas {{has a negative}} impact on the environment. The increase of impervious or <b>sealed</b> <b>surfaces</b> is directly proportional to this expansion. The estimation of <b>sealed</b> <b>surfaces</b> has often been executed using remote sensing imagery, although only on a local to regional scale, using medium and recently available high resolution images like LANDSAT TM and IKONOS. In order to develop a global policy and strategy on urban expansion matters, consistent time series of area statistics on urban land use on a national and global level will become indispensable. This research explores the possibilities of SPOT VEGETATION imagery, with a spatial resolution of 1 km, for urban monitoring in order to generate statistics of <b>sealed</b> <b>surfaces</b> over larger zones. While low resolution imagery offers the advantage of covering a large area in small temporal intervals, its spatial resolution is too coarse to monitor most urban objects. In order to tackle this problem, a sub-pixel classification was applied and unmixed <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> area statistics were produced. Endmember selection is a key element in the sub-pixel classification process in which the spectrally complex <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> class should be distinguished from other general classes. To find the most favourable temporal interval or period for endmember selection, several datasets were developed and explored. SPOT-VEGETATION images were acquired in summer and winter for Flanders (Belgium). This region is characterised by a highly fragmented urban land-cover and large availability of reference data. Spectral unmixing of the multitemporal datasets illustrates that the endmember spectra differs for three different endmember selection techniques, affecting the quality of the final sub-pixel classification.

5000|$|De Quillfeldt {{used the}} term [...] "Lightning" [...] {{to refer to the}} sealing method, but the closure's popular use on fruit jars led to the name, Lightning fruit jar.

A rubber gasket between the shelf and the bottom surface of the lid formed a secure seal when the wire closure was tightened. Although Lightning jars were popular for home canning use from the early 1880s to the early 1900s, they were not as common as screw-thread Mason jars.

5000|$|In {{horizontal}} decanter centrifuges, {{as shown}} in figure 1, the rotating assembly is mounted horizontally with bearings on each end to a rigid frame, which provides a good <b>sealing</b> <b>surface</b> for high-pressure applications.

Capacities range up to 40000 lb of solids per hour with liquid feed rates of up to 300 gal per minute. The horizontal machine is arranged in a way that slurry can be introduced at the centre of a rotating horizontal cylindrical bowl. The scroll discharge screw forces the solids to one end of the bowl as it is collected on the walls. This orientation is the most common design implemented in industry.|$|E

50|$|Uneven {{pressure}} {{can be caused}} by a variety of factors. First is the human factor: asymmetric application of the bolt preload, this can cause uneven pressure. Theoretically when the flanges are pressed, the <b>sealing</b> <b>surfaces</b> are absolutely parallel, in practice however, the centerline of a pipeline cannot be absolutely concentric, and tightening the bolts on the flange moment makes the flange a discontinuity. With asymmetric connections, the <b>seal</b> <b>surfaces</b> will be more or less deformed and the pressure reduced, the running load, prone to leakage. Third, the density of bolt arrangement has an obvious impact on the pressure distribution, the closer the bolts, the more uniform the pressure.|$|R
50|$|Tighten {{the bolts}} on the flange. Due to vibration, {{temperature}} changes, {{and other factors}} such as spiral wound gasket stress relaxation, the bolt tension will gradually decrease, resulting in loss of torque, causing a leak. In general longer bolts and smaller diameters of bolt are better at preventing the loss of torque. A long thin bolt is {{an effective way to}} prevent torque loss. Heating for {{a certain period of time}} to stretch the bolt, and then maintaining a given torque, is very effective in preventing the loss of torque. When the gasket is thinner and smaller there will be a greater loss of torque. In addition, prevent strong vibration of the machine and the pipe itself, and isolate them from adjacent equipment vibration. Impacts on the <b>sealing</b> <b>surface</b> are not meaningless. Not impacting the tightened bolts can prevent the loss of torque.|$|E

40|$|Land use {{and changes}} in the spatial {{distribution}} of population are spatially and temporally linked and have an obvious impact on the urban environment. For instance, they influence the mobility and accessibility and {{play an important role in}} waste water management. This forecasting of the spatial distribution of population is thus a critical issue in planning. In order to allow this forecasting we have adjusted a multiple regression model to estimate the population distribution in function of land-use. The originality in our modeling strategy is the use of <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> proportion maps as weighting factor assuming that <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> proportion is a proxy of population density. The data exploited to adjust the parameters of the model are three time-series of landuse maps from the EU-MOLAND, census data and medium and high resolution remotely sensed images. We made use of these images in a spectral unmixing procedure that provides the <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> proportion maps. In the model, the population was normalized in order to get a model that is independent of time and space. This is required for prediction and spatial extrapolation which assumes a temporally and spatially stable relationship between land use, imperviousness and population density. We validated the model by means of a population disaggregation/re-aggregation procedures and tested its robustness regarding the resolution because predicted <b>sealed</b> <b>surface</b> proportion and predicted landuse maps using the calibrated EU-MOLAND model are generated at lower resolution (200 m) than the resolution used in the model adjustment.
