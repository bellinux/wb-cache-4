30|$|Early {{studies have}} {{reported}} that the overall crystal structure of perovskite-type oxides is not affected by the synthesis method [68, 69]. However, changes in the crystal structure of perovskite-type oxides have been observed due to compositional variations, such as substituting the mean A-site ionic radius or the B-site [59]. Moreover, changes in the grain size have been observed depending on the synthesis route [68]. In this sense, the sol–gel method results in smaller grain sizes than the <b>solid-state</b> <b>reaction</b> method. In fact, the Pechini method is known for delivering homogeneous solutions with a great control of composition and production of ultrafine nanometric oxides [70, 71], which makes this method very attractive for recent developments and future trends {{in the field of}} Ni/MH batteries (see “Drawbacks and future challenges”). Compared with the <b>solid-state</b> <b>reaction,</b> the glycine-nitrate <b>route</b> and the sol–gel technique require lower calcination temperatures and reduced calcination times to yield pure crystals of perovskite-type oxides.
