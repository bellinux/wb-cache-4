40|$|Following Becker (1962), an information-theoretical thought {{experiment}} is developed {{to investigate whether}} the equilibrium properties of an exchange economy depend on the rational behaviour of agents. Transactions are logged through a communication channel into an external observer's dataset, represented by Google. At some point this data connection fails and Google no longer receives the updates encoding the transactions. It is shown that Google can nevertheless make sharp predictions concerning {{the state of the}} economy. In particular, a stable long run distribution of endowments is expected, as well as a set of price-like variables. By construction this prediction does not rest on the rationality of agents, because the information-theoretical <b>setting</b> <b>forces</b> Google to treat the missed updates as random variables...|$|E
40|$|The mobile <b>setting</b> <b>forces</b> {{designers}} {{to consider the}} context where a system will be used. While {{it is important to}} make the system context aware, it is equally important to make the user aware of the physical, social and digital context as mediated by the system. MobiTip is a social mobile service that makes the hybrid space in which it operates observable to the user. The service uses Bluetooth to support the exchange of opinions among co-located users. In an explorative study, we observed users becoming aware of the possibilities and limitations of the Bluetooth technology and exploring the digitally mediated presence of others. Users also communicated with others by entering their own opinions and by commenting on the opinions of others, thereby actively co-constructing the content of the service. We conclude that by making context information observable to users they will engage in exploring the hybrid domain consisting of physically, socially and digitally mediated context.

40|$|Abstract. An {{increasing}} number of applications is being written for mobile hosts, such as laptop computers, mobile phones, PDAs etc. These applications are usually monolithic, featuring very limited interoperability and context-awareness and are usually difficult to deploy and update. Application engineers {{have to deal with}} a very dynamic set of environments that these applications are in contact with and it is becoming increasingly difficult to design an application that will be able to cater to all the user’s needs in those environments. This new <b>setting</b> <b>forces</b> a shift from design-time to run-time effort in developing software systems. To solve these problems and to allow a new class of ubiquitous and adaptable applications to be built, we have designed and implemented satin, a middleware system that allows the flexible use of logical mobility techniques by applications running on mobile hosts which are connected to very different networks. In this paper we describe our approach and show how satin can be used to deploy and update applications on mobile devices easily and efficiently. ...|$|E

We show that both the definability (and, in fact, even the amenability) of the forcing relation and the truth lemma can fail for class forcing. In addition to these negative results, we show that the forcing theorem {{is equivalent to the}} existence of a (certain kind of) Boolean completion, and we introduce a weak combinatorial property (approachability by projections) that implies the forcing theorem to hold. Finally, we show that unlike for <b>set</b> <b>forcing,</b> Boolean completions need not be unique for class forcing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe weak type (1, 1) {{boundedness}} of singular integrals {{acting on}} matrix-valued functions has remained open since the 1980 s, mainly because the methods {{provided by the}} vector-valued theory are not strong enough. In fact, we can also consider the action of generalized Calderón–Zygmund operators on functions taking values in any other von Neumann algebra. Our main tools for its solution are two. First, the lack of some classical inequalities in the noncommutative <b>setting</b> <b>forces</b> to have a deeper knowledge of how fast a singular integral decreases—L 2 sense—outside of {{the support of the}} function on which it acts. This gives rise to a pseudo-localization principle which is of independent interest, even in the classical theory. Second, we construct a noncommutative form of Calderón–Zygmund decomposition by means of the recent theory of noncommutative martingales. This is a corner stone in the theory. As application, we obtain the sharp asymptotic behavior of the constants for the strong Lp inequalities, also unknown up to now. Our methods settle some basics for a systematic study of a noncommutative Calderón–Zygmund theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} {{longwall}} mining can largely {{be traced to}} the development of powered roof support systems. The most significant improvement in powered support design has been the shield support, which improved kinematic stability and promoted the application of longwall mining in difficult-to- control caving conditions where chock and frame supports were inadequate. The most obvious trend in shield design has been an increase in shield size and capacity. This U. S. Bureau of Mines report examines shield design and operation practices and their consequences for the utilization of high-capacity shield support systems. An optimization goal is to minimize support loading by selecting an active shield setting force that is compatible with strata behavior and shield loading characteristics. Shield stiffness is an important design parameter that is often overlooked. A consequence of increasing shield capacity by incorporating larger diameter leg cylinders is a proportional increase in shield stiffness. <b>Setting</b> <b>forces</b> have also increased in direct proportion to the increase in shield capacity. The increased stiffness and higher setting force cause the available capacity to be consumed more quickly, severely limiting the ability of high-capacity supports to last longer and provide reserve capacity for difficult mining conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{carbonate}} reservoir, {{the flow}} patterns are conditioned {{by the degree}} of karsification of the main conduit networks and by the lower permeability microfractured blocks. To quantify patterns and nature of discontinuities in the rock mass is the main goal in the fluid circulation researches. Indeed fractures such as joint and bedding planes control infiltration, percolation and migration of groundwater into a reservoir. In the Umbria-Marche Apennine the Lower Jurassic limestones represents the basal reservoir where the larger hydrogeological structures are locate. The stratigraphic and structural <b>setting</b> <b>forces</b> a parallel-to-the ridge circulation of groundwaters, and the ridge itself {{can be considered as}} an isolated hydrogeological system. A quantitative fractures analysis was been considerate through the whole anticline, from the gently deep SW limb, in the weakly deformed hinge zone to the subvertical and much more deformed NE external side. The prevalent joint systems are oriented N 55 and N 295, located in the fold limbs and in the hinge zone. Besides, N 15 and N 345 joint systems are predominant only in western and eastern limbs of the anticline. In the hinge zone the fractures seem to be linked to a normal faults oriented at NW and SE, in correspondence of the crestal area; possibly these shear structures are responsible both for new systems development and for pre-existent sets partial reorientation. Dip discontinuities distribution gave remarkable about water process once infiltration inside the system. The high dips strongly contributed to increase groundwater percolation velocity coming both from direct infiltration areas in the upper hydrogeological complexes. Finally, spacing and frequency fracturation analysis identify rock mass properties from a quantitative point of view; these structural parameters allowed to obtained important considerations about both mechanical and hydrogeological features of a reservoir. The Giordano karst spring drains the SW limb of the M. Nerone anticline with an average discharge of more than 0, 1 m 3 /sec and with a catchment area of about 4 km 2. A deterministic approach for the hydrostructural characterization of the spring was adopted using discharge, temperature and water conductivity. The analysis of the hydrographs show that the base flow represent only the 30 % and in the recession curve the discharge is controlled by the karst conduits drainage. The recession curves show different steps with a depletion constant of about 10 - 3 day- 1, while the water temperature and electrical conductivity show variations where prevails the conduits drainage respect the fractured matrix. The complex variability and heterogeneity of the karst reservoir seems to be controlled by the larger karst conduits, which are related to the main fracture patterns...|$|E
