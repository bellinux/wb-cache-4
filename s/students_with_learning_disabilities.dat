5|$|Carre's is a state-run {{selective}} grammar school. It {{converted to}} an Academy and reopened on 1 August 2011; it {{is governed by}} Carre's Grammar School Academy Trust and converted without sponsorship. As of 2015, the student body {{is made up of}} 815 pupils aged 11–18. The school admits boys on a selective basis for years 7–11 and has a co-educational Sixth Form; there are 60 girls on roll as of 2015. The majority of pupils come from White British backgrounds and very few pupils speak English as an additional language. The number of pupils supported through allowances, including those eligible for free school meals (2.3%), is below average, as is the number of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Pupils are allocated into houses based on their forms. The first house system at Carre's consisted of four sets: scarlet, maroon, green and blue. They became houses in 1933 as Carre, Bristol, Lafford and Welby, named respectively after its founder, the Earls of Bristol, an old name for Sleaford, and Richard Welby, who owned the Gedney lands purchased by Carre.|$|E

It operates the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (a private day school for K-12 students and day care), the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School (a residential treatment program for those with behavioral and emotional problems), and a public charter school with four campuses on the South Side of Chicago administered by the university's Urban Education Institute. In addition, the Hyde Park Day School, a school for <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disabilities,</b> maintains a location on the University of Chicago campus. Since 1983, the University of Chicago has maintained the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project, a mathematics program used in urban primary and secondary schools. The university runs a program called the Council on Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences, which administers interdisciplinary workshops to provide a forum for graduate students, faculty, and visiting scholars to present scholarly work in progress.|$|E

The population included all male <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> who were studying in two <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> centers of Hamedan City from 3 rd grade to 5 th grade. The participants included of 40 male <b>students</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability</b> who were selected through convenience sampling method and were placed in control group and experimental group (20 students in each group). The verbal Self-instructional Package was held for 8 sessions in a month (2 sessions per week) for experimental group. To collect data, the pre-test and post-test scores of Social Competence Questionnaire were used. Results: The findings of multivariate analysis of covariance showed that Verbal Self-instructional Package significantly affects social competence and it’s components; cognitive skills and abilities, behavioral skills, emotional competence and set of motivations and expectations in <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability.</b> Discussion: Using verbal self-instruction can enhance the social competence of <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>learning</b> <b>disability,</b> Thus it is recommended to use this adjusted package in schools and psychological clinics for these students...|$|R
