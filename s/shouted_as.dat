5|$|Once {{posted to}} France in December 1914, the Rhodesian Platoon almost {{immediately}} began suffering regular heavy casualties. Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict, so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches, but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often {{took a few}} months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength. A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and then gradually built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action. When the KRRC's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives, they were easily recognised by a distinctive battle cry that their men <b>shouted</b> <b>as</b> they went over the top. Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of Shona and Sindebele (two African languages) instead of English.|$|E
5|$|Squads of Special Forces {{and combat}} police {{flattened}} the gates and smashed {{their way into}} the pagoda at around 00:20 on 21 August as Xá Lợi's brass gong was struck to signal the attack. Nhu's men were armed with pistols, submachine guns, carbines, shotguns, grenades and tear gas. The red-bereted Special Forces were joined by truckloads of steel-helmeted combat police in army camouflage uniforms. Two of Nhu's senior aides were seen outside Xá Lợi directing the operation, while Nhu and his wife, Madame Nhu, watched the action from a nearby tank. Monks and nuns who barricaded themselves behind wooden shields were attacked with rifle butts and bayonets. The sound of the pagoda's gong was largely masked by that of automatic weapons fire, exploding grenades, battering rams, shattering glass and human screaming. The military personnel <b>shouted</b> <b>as</b> they attacked, as did the occupants, in fear.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Trowbridge {{returned}} from the school {{to say that the}} only hope for safety to any Americans seemed to be to return to the school, staying there alone, separated from the Armenians. He declared that we were powerless to save the Armenians. It seems that after we left the school, Miss Wallace, Mr. Chambers, and a young Armenian preacher attempted to cross the street from Miss Wallace's to the school. Just at this time a mob rushed around the corner. The infuriated Turks recognized the preacher as an Armenian, and although Mr. Chambers threw his arms about him and did all in his power to save the man's life, they shot him dead. Not a single Armenian would they leave alive, the assassins <b>shouted,</b> <b>as</b> Mr. Chambers dragged the murdered preacher into the building.|$|E

60|$|He was {{no longer}} in the hall. He was marching along a gallery {{overhanging}} one of the great streets of the moving platforms that traversed the city. Before him and behind him tramped his guards. The whole concave of the moving ways below was a congested mass of people marching, tramping to the left, shouting, waving hands and arms, pouring along a huge vista, <b>shouting</b> <b>as</b> they came into view, <b>shouting</b> <b>as</b> they passed, <b>shouting</b> <b>as</b> they receded, until the globes of electric light receding in perspective dropped down it seemed and hid the swarming bare heads. Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp.|$|R

500|$|Mohammed M'Barek {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} the French authorities that had kept him [...] "in prison for two-and-a-half years for nothing". He {{thought it was an}} outrage that the French regarded the dumping of an inconveniently dead body in a ravine as a crime. He {{even went so far as}} to appeal to the new French president Nicolas Sarkozy for justice. On the third day of the trial, the courtroom descended into chaos as Monsieur M'Barek burst into tears then jumped to his feet pointing at Shaftesbury's family. He attempted to blame the Ashley-Cooper family for the peer's death, claiming that they were the guilty ones. [...] "You're the guilty ones, you the rich, who want to take his inheritance!" [...] he <b>shouted</b> <b>as</b> police wrestled with him in the dock. After refusing requests from his lawyer and the judge to sit down and be quiet, M'Barek was taken down to the cells and the hearing temporarily adjourned.|$|E
500|$|Together, {{the family}} sailed on La Peyrouse {{to the port}} of Pointe des Galets, a site twenty {{kilometers}} (12.5 miles) from the capital of St. Denis, to secure a discreet arrival. Despite this effort, a crowd of French onlookers jeered and <b>shouted</b> <b>as</b> the boat docked, angry at the queen {{for the loss of}} French lives incurred during France's campaign to occupy Madagascar. After waiting for the crowd to disperse, the captain escorted the queen and her party into a horse-drawn buggy, the first Ranavalona had ever seen, and drove to the Hotel de l'Europe in St. Denis. Young Razafinandriamanitra, suffering from the emotional and physical strains of the journey into exile, went into labor shortly after reaching the hotel. She gave birth to a little girl on her second day in Réunion, but could not recover her strength and died five days later. The infant was named Marie-Louise and was baptised a Catholic to avoid antagonizing the French. [...] Marie-Louise, who could have become heir-apparent according to the traditional rules of succession, was adopted by Ranavalona as her own daughter.|$|E
2500|$|The French had {{all gone}} mad; there were such noise and such shouts that they {{themselves}} were astonished at being so carried away.... In a word, my dear Florimo, it was an unheard of thing, and since Saturday, Paris has spoken of it in amazement.... I showed myself to the audience, which <b>shouted</b> <b>as</b> if insane.... How satisfied I am! : [...] "Lablache sang like a god, Grisi like a little angel, Rubini and Tamburini the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|On the {{day before}} Little Christmas, {{especially}} in south-eastern Serbia, {{a group of young}} unmarried men went through the streets of their village and chased away demons by making a deafening noise. Sirovari, as these men were called, <b>shouted</b> <b>as</b> loud as possible two words, [...] "Sirovo burovo!" [...] accompanied by the noise made with bells, ratchets, and horseshoes strung on a rope. The group consisted of seven, nine or eleven members; it was said that if there were an even number of sirovari, one of them would die within a year. Moving through the village, they tried to make it impossible for anyone to count them. They constantly changed positions in the group, hid and suddenly reappeared. Villagers were glad to receive them in their homes, and treated them with food and drink.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the origins}} of the word [...] "emo" [...] are uncertain, it dates back to at least 1985. According to Andy Greenwald, author of , [...] "The origins of the term 'emo' are {{shrouded}} in mystery... but it first came into common practice in 1985. If Minor Threat was hardcore, then Rites of Spring, with its altered focus, was emotional hardcore or emocore." [...] Michael Azerrad, author of Our Band Could Be Your Life, also traces the word's origins to the mid-1980s: [...] "The style was soon dubbed 'emo-core,' a term everyone involved bitterly detested, although the term and the approach thrived for at least another fifteen years, spawning countless bands." [...] MacKaye traces it to 1985, attributing it to an article in Thrasher magazine referring to Embrace and other Washington, D.C. bands as [...] "emo-core" [...] (which he called [...] "the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard in my entire life"). Other accounts attribute the word to an audience member at an Embrace show, who <b>shouted</b> <b>as</b> an insult that the band was [...] "emocore". Others have said that MacKaye coined the word when he used it self-mockingly in a magazine, or that it originated with Rites of Spring.|$|E
