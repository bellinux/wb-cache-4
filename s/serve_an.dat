5|$|Four {{weeks after}} his {{discharge}} from the Air Force, Waters married Gladys Saunders, {{with whom he had}} six children. He worked as an automotive mechanic, but was forced to cease by union rules, which required him to <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> apprenticeship. Waters was then briefly employed by a local council in Queensland as a road worker, before returning to shearing, which took him away from his family to properties stretching from North Queensland to Victoria. He personally estimated that he sheared a million sheep during his life.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{governors}} of Wisconsin served for two-year terms, but in 1967 {{the state constitution}} was amended to change this to four. Jeremiah McLain Rusk served one three-year term in the 1880s as the constitution was amended during his first term to move elections from odd to even years, and all officers were allowed to <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> extra year, rather than have their terms cut a year short. Patrick Lucey, elected in the 1970 election, was the first governor to serve a four-year term. Governors of Wisconsin are not term limited.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} {{of the purpose of}} whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E

5|$|The ban on English {{clubs in}} European {{competitions}} ultimately lasted for five years, {{and even when}} the ban was lifted in 1990, Liverpool were not re-admitted; they had to <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> extra year. The ban prevented them qualifying for the European Cup in 1986 (as league champions and FA Cup winners), the UEFA Cup in 1987 (as league runners-up), the European Cup in 1988 (as league champions), the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1989 (as FA Cup winners) and the European Cup in 1990 (as league champions).|$|E

5|$|Arrington's father {{offered to}} pay for Arrington {{to serve as an}} LDS missionary, but not for a {{university}} education. Arrington did not <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{finished}} the 1984–85 Football League {{in second place}} 13 points behind local rivals Everton. They also reached {{the final of the}} 1984–85 European Cup, which they lost 1–0 to Juventus. However the events of the match were overshadowed for the disaster that occurred before kick-off. Liverpool fans breached a fence separating the two groups of supporters and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall to collapse, killing 39 people and injuring hundreds. English clubs were banned indefinitely from European competition, with a condition that when the ban was lifted, Liverpool would <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> extra three-year ban. The ban eventually lasted for five years, clubs returning to European competition in the 1990–91 season.|$|E
5|$|One {{proposed}} {{explanation for}} the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account is that they serve more of a discursive and pragmatic function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation, or to foreground important information and objects by making them bigger and more salient. In this way, count-classifiers might not <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> abstract grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.|$|E

5|$|The vegetal diet of the Sumatran {{rhinoceros}} is high {{in fiber}} and only moderate in protein. Salt licks {{are very important to}} the nutrition of the rhino. These licks can be small hot springs, seepages of salty water, or mud-volcanoes. The salt licks also <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> important social purpose for the rhinos—males visit the licks to pick up the scent of females in oestrus. Some Sumatran rhinos, however, live in areas where salt licks are not readily available, or the rhinos have not been observed using the licks. These rhinos may get their necessary mineral requirements by consuming plants rich in minerals.|$|E
5|$|This {{incident}} arose after Earp {{learned that}} one of his prize horses, stolen more than a year before, was in the possession of Ike Clanton and his brother Billy. Earp and Holliday rode to the Clanton ranch near Charleston to recover the horse. On the way, they overtook Behan, who was riding in a wagon. Behan was also heading to the ranch to <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> election-hearing subpoena on Ike Clanton. Accounts differ as to what happened next. Earp later testified that {{when he arrived at the}} Clanton ranch, Billy Clanton gave up the horse even before being presented with ownership papers. According to Behan's testimony, however, Earp had told the Clantons that Behan was on his way to arrest them for horse theft. After the incident, which embarrassed both the Clantons and Behan, Behan testified that he did not want to work with Earp and chose Woods instead.|$|E
5|$|Many {{factors have}} {{influenced}} the construction of dams along the Snake River. A total of fifteen dams have been constructed along the Snake River for a multitude of different purposes, from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its mouth on Lake Wallula, a slackwater reservoir formed behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River. Dams on the Snake can be grouped into three major categories. From its headwaters {{to the beginning of}} Hells Canyon, many small dams block the Snake to provide irrigation water. Between here and Hells Canyon, the first dam on the Snake, Swan Falls Dam, was built in 1901. In Hells Canyon, a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from the river's lofty decrease in elevation over a comparatively small distance. Finally, a third cascade of dams, from Hells Canyon to the mouth, facilitates navigation. Many different government and private agencies have worked to build dams on the Snake River, which now <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> important purpose for people living in the Snake's drainage basin and trade of agricultural products to Pacific seaports.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{construction}} has several stages, including making and shaping of the drum body (or shell), preparing the drum skin, and tuning {{the skin to}} the drumhead. Variations in the construction process often occur in the latter two parts of this process. Historically, byō-uchi-daiko were crafted from trunks of the Japanese zelkova tree that were dried out over years, using techniques to prevent splitting. A master carpenter then carved out the rough shape of the drum body with a chisel; {{the texture of the}} wood after carving softened the tone of the drum. In contemporary times, taiko are carved out on a large lathe using wood staves or logs that can be shaped to fit drum bodies of various sizes. Drumheads can be left to air-dry over a period of years, but some companies use large, smoke-filled warehouses to hasten the drying process. After drying is complete, the inside of the drum is worked with a deep-grooved chisel and sanded. Lastly, handles are placed onto the drum. These are used to carry smaller drums and they <b>serve</b> <b>an</b> ornamental purpose for larger drums.|$|E
