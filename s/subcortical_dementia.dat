Patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type were more impaired than patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) on the memory subtest, whereas patients with HD and PSP were more impaired on the initiation/perseveration subtest.

There have been many studies done comparing the mental deterioration of Binswanger patients and Alzheimer patients. It has been found in the Graphical Sequence Test that Binswanger patients have hyperkinetic perseveration errors which cause the patients to repeat motion even when not asked whereas Alzheimer patients have semantic perseveration because when asked to write a word they will instead draw the object of the word.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Dementia {{studies has}} {{primarily}} focused on disorders of the cerebral cortex and subcortical gray matter, what originated {{the concepts of}} cortical and <b>subcortical</b> <b>dementias</b> respectively.

Besides that, recent clinical and scientific literature on white matter dementia was reviewed. The composition of exuberant psychiatric symptoms and personality changes (mainly apathy, but also desinhibition) with neurological signs (pyramidal alone or associated with extrapyramidal signs, ataxia and urinary incontinence) and with specific cognitive impairment (mentioned above), should rise strongly the possibility of a white-matter dementia, instead of a cortical or <b>subcortical</b> form of <b>dementia...</b>|$|R

Twelve individuals with early-stage relapsing-remitting MS underwent serial imaging, neurological examination, and neuropsychological assessment at both baseline and 6 month follow-up. Results revealed mild deterioration in functioning with respect to all four aspects of the <b>subcortical</b> <b>dementia</b> profile (i. e., attention and information processing speed, memory, executive functioning, and affective disturbance). Although no significant correlation was found between pathology and ratings of disability, pathology was found to correlate with cognitive functioning.

Total lesion load was not significantly related to affective disturbance. No significant changes took place over time with respect to pathology, attention, memory, or affect.

Ltd., Singapore Abstract: Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} clinical benefits of sustained cholinesterase inhibition with rivastigmine in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD). Unlike donepezil and galantamine that selectively inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE; EC 3. 1. 1. 7), rivastigmine is a unique cholinesterase inhibitor with both AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE; EC 3. 1. 1. 8) inhibitory activity. Rivastigmine is also available as transdermal patch that has {{been approved by the}} US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of mild, moderate, and severe AD as well as mild-to-moderate PDD. In this review, we explore the role of BuChE inhibition in addition to AChE inhibition with rivastigmine in the outcomes of cognition, global function, behavioral symptoms, and activities of daily living. Additionally, we review the evidence supporting the use of dual AChE-BuChE inhibitory activity of rivastigmine as a therapeutic strategy in the treatment of neurological disorders, with a focus on the role of rivastigmine in <b>subcortical</b> <b>dementias</b> such as vascular dementia (VaD) and PDD. Toward this objective, we performed a literature search in PubMed and Ovid with limits to articles published in the English language before June 2016. The available evidence from the literature suggests that the dual inhibition of AChE and BuChE may afford additional therapeutic potential of rivastigmine in <b>subcortical</b> <b>dementias</b> (<b>subcortical</b> VaD and PDD) with benefits on cognition and behavioral symptoms. Rivastigmine was found to specifically benefit executive dysfunction frequently observed in subcortical dementias; however, large randomized clinical studies are warranted to support these observations.

Discussion: There are no treatments licensed for vascular dementia. The most common subtype is <b>subcortical</b> ischaemic vascular <b>dementia</b> (SIVD). This study is designed to investigate whether amlodipine can produce benefits compared to placebo in established SIVD. It is estimated that the numbers of people with VaD and SIVD will increase globally in the future and {{the results of this study}} should inform important treatment decisions.
