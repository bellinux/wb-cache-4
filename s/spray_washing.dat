5000|$|Mulesing is a {{controversial}} practice. The National Farmers Federation of Australia says that [...] "mulesing {{remains the most}} effective practical way to eliminate the risk of 'flystrike' in sheep" [...] and that [...] "without mulesing up to 3,000,000 sheep a year could die a slow and agonising death from flystrike". The Australian Veterinary Association (AVA) [...] "recognises the welfare implications of mulesing of sheep. However, {{in the absence of}} more humane alternatives for preventing breech strike, the AVA accepts that the practice of mulesing should continue as a sheep husbandry procedure". The AVA also supports the use of analgesics and the accreditation of mulesing practitioners. The Australian Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals accepts mulesing when the risk of flystrike is very high, when it is done properly, and even then only as a last resort. The animal rights organisation PETA strongly opposes mulesing, says the practice is cruel and painful, and that more humane alternatives exist, and claim that sheep can be spared maggot infestation through more humane methods, including special diets and <b>spray</b> <b>washing.</b>|$|E

The ship had an overall length of 745 ft, a beam of 112 ft and a draught of 34 ft. She displaced 38,031 tons at normal load and 42,237 tons at full load. After her refit in 1944, she displaced 39,100 tonnes at standard load, and 44,460 tons at full load. She could carry 3,918 tons of fuel oil, 192 tons of diesel oil, 256 tons of reserve feed water and 444 tons of freshwater. Based on the designed fuel consumption, range was: 4000 nmi km at 25 kn, 10,250 nmi km at 15 kn and 14,400 nmi km at 10 kn. However, in practice fuel consumption was much higher, and at 16 kn the actual range was about 6300 nmi km with a five percent reserve allowance.Designed within the tight 35,000 ton limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, wartime service necessitated increases over the design displacement, seriously reducing freeboard and affecting seaworthiness.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that pre-slaughter stress of cattle reduces beef quality because of its effect on post mortem muscle pH. <b>Spray</b> <b>washing</b> in the cattle yard is a hygiene requirement of the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) {{in order to reduce the}} contamination of carcasses. However, the washing stresses the animal. This study investigated the effect of spray-washing cattle on beef quality. <b>Spray</b> <b>washing</b> of cattle resulted in considerably more variation in the ultimate pH (pHu) of the meat (5. 52 to 6. 48) compared to meat from dry animals (5. 50 to 5. 79). The increased variability in pHu was reflected in the meat shear force values from the spray-washed animals, which ranged from 5. 2 to 14. 5 kgF, while that from the dry animals ranged between 4. 8 and 8. 6 kgF. There was a tendency for meat from spray-washed animals to be tougher than meat from dry animals (p = 0. 089). The effect of <b>spray</b> <b>washing</b> on calpain I autolysis, desmin and troponin T degradation during post mortem period was determined. Results showed that <b>spray</b> <b>washing</b> tended to cause an increase (p = 0. 07) in post mortem degradation of desmin but had no significant effect on troponin T degradation or calpain I autolysis. The second part of the research investigated the effect of post-slaughter processing conditions on turkey breast meat tenderness, and the biochemical basis for the toughening of turkey breast meat. Anecdotal evidence showed that consumers perceived turkey breast meat as being tough. The preliminary results of this research indicated that the tenderness of turkey breast meat was variable and the mean shear force was higher than would be acceptable to consumers. The observed toughening of turkey breast meat may be a result of post-slaughter treatments of turkey carcasses, such as the rate of carcass cooling, stunning method and carcass deboning time. The effect of these factors on turkey breast meat tenderness were investigated in this research. Post-slaughter temperature and pH of turkey breast muscle was measured at different times. The carcass temperature ranged from 32 °C to 36 °C at 15 minutes post slaughter. Immersion chilling (1 st water bath and 2 nd ice slush bath) rapidly reduced the internal breast muscle temperature to about 10 °C by 75 min after stunning. In all three experiments (2, 3 & 4), cold blast treatment significantly decreased the internal breast muscle temperature compared to the breast muscle that was chilled only. The breast muscle temperature immediately after a cold blast treatment (about six hours post-slaughter) ranged from 2 - 6 °C. In this study, the mean pH of turkey breast muscle at 15 min post-slaughter was 6. 52, indicating that turkey breast muscle exhibited accelerated rigor mortis compared to lamb or beef. The pH of turkey breast muscle at six hours post-slaughter was close to the ultimate pH, which ranged from 5. 80 to 5. 96. Results of this research showed that turkey processing conditions have a toughening effect on the resulting breast meat. Deboning of turkey breast muscle three hours post-slaughter caused between a 80 % and 90 % increase in toughness of the meat compared to muscle aged on the bone for 24 hours. The use of a blast freezer to rapidly cool the breast also toughened the meat by an average of 30 %. The mechanisms responsible for the meat toughening were both muscle contraction and a reduction of proteolysis. The sarcomere length of muscles deboned three hours post mortem was significantly shorter than muscles deboned at 24 hours post mortem. The myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), which is a measure of proteolysis, was significantly higher for muscles aged on bone for at least 24 hours compared to muscles deboned three hours post-slaughter. It is known that meat tenderness improves during post mortem ageing. Results of experiment 4 showed that six days extended ageing of pre-rigor or post-rigor deboned turkey breast muscle significantly improved the meat tenderness. In both muscles deboned at 3 hand 24 h post mortem, there was a 25 % decrease in the shear force values after the 6 -day ageing period. During the ageing period, MFI increased significantly both for muscles deboned at three hours post-slaughter (p = 0. 025) and for the muscles aged on bone for 24 hours prior to deboning (p = 0. 018). Activities of calpain I, II and calpastatin were measured at three different times during post-slaughter ageing (0, 3 and 24 hours) in muscles aged on bone for 24 hours and muscles deboned three hours post-slaughter and then, aged for 24 hours. The activity of calpain I rapidly declined with increasing post mortem time to the extent that only trace levels were detected at three hours, and no calpain activity was detected at 24 hours post mortem. In contrast, there was no loss in calpain II activity over the post mortem period. Calpastatin retained only 35 % of its at-death activity in turkey breast muscle at three hours post-slaughter and there was no calpastatin activity at 24 hours post-slaughter. Furthermore, deboning time had no significant effect on the activity of calpain I, II and calpastatin at 24 hours post mortem. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the observed toughening of turkey breast meat originates from the rapid cooling of turkey carcasses and the three hours post slaughter deboning time. The mechanism of the toughening of turkey breast muscle deboned three hours post mortem is likely to be a direct result of cold shortening rather than reduced calpain activity. This suggests that the reduced proteolysis as measured by MFI is a result of reduced accessibility of the cal pain to myofibrillar protein because of the shortened sarcomere length of muscles deboned at three hours post slaughter and then aged for 24 hours...|$|E

40|$|Plans are {{to remove}} the {{residual}} waste from the annulus of High-Level Waste Tank 16, located in the H-Area Tank Farm, in 1998. The interior of the tank is virtually clean. In the late 1970 `s, the waste {{was removed from the}} interior of the tank by several campaigns of waste removal with slurry pumps, <b>spray</b> <b>washing,</b> and oxalic acid cleaning. The annulus of the tank at one time had several thousand gallons of waste salt, which had leaked from the tank interior. Some of this salt was removed by adding water to the annulus and circulating, but much of the salt remains in the annulus. In order to confirm the source term used for fate and transport modeling, samples of the tank interior and annulus will be obtained and analyzed. If the results of the analyses indicate that the data used for the initial modeling is bounding then no changes will be made to the model. However, if the results indicate that the source term is higher than that assumed in the initial modeling, thus not bounding, additional modeling will be performed. The purpose of this Plan is to outline the approach to sampling the annulus and interior of Tank 16 as a prerequisite to salt removal in the annulus and closure of the entire tank system. The sampling and analysis of this tank system must be robust to reasonably ensure the actual tank residual is within the bounds of analysis error...|$|E
40|$|Wood-plasticlumber is {{promoted}} as a low-maintenance high-durability product. After weathering, however, wood-plasticcomposites (WPCs) often fide and lose mechanical properties. In {{the first part}} ofthis study, 50 % wood-flour-filled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) composite samples were injection molded or extruded. Composites were exposed to two accelerated weathering cycles in a xenon-arc type weathering apparatus; either ultraviolet (UV) light only or UV light and water spray. The composites lightened less when they were exposed to only UV light compared with exposure to UV light and water spray. The change in modulus of elasticity (MOE) and strength was also much less when the composites were exposed to UV light only. The {{second part of the}} study involved stabilizing the WPCs with an ultraviolet absorber and or pigment. The stabilized composites were also exposed to the two weathering cycles. Again the amount of lightening and loss in mechanical properties was less when the composites were exposed to UV light only compared with exposure to UV light and water spray. The pigment was more effective than the ultraviolet absorber retaining composite properties. The pigment had a larger impact on property retention when the composites were exposed to UV light and water spray. The results of this study demonstrate that exposing WPCs to water spray in combination with UV light is more severe than exposing WPCs to only UV light. This is likely a result of the water <b>spray</b> <b>washing</b> away the degraded layer and wood extractives during weathering, as well as causing the wood-plastic interface to be compromised through dimensional changes in the wood particles...|$|E
40|$|Chemical Cleaning is {{currently}} in progress for Tanks 5 and 6 at the Savannah River Site. The Chemical Cleaning process is being utilized to remove the residual waste heel remaining after completion of Mechanical Sludge Removal. This work is required to prepare the tanks for closure. Tanks 5 and 6 are 1950 s vintage carbon steel waste tanks that do not meet current containment standards. These tanks are 22. 9 meters (75 feet) in diameter, 7. 5 meters (24. 5 feet) in height, and have a capacity of 2. 84 E+ 6 liters (750, 000 gallons). Chemical Cleaning adds 8 wt % oxalic acid to the carbon steel tank to dissolve the remaining sludge heel. The resulting acidic waste solution is transferred to Tank 7 where it is pH adjusted to minimize corrosion of the carbon steel tank. The Chemical Cleaning flowsheet includes multiple strikes of acid in each tank. Acid is delivered by tanker truck and {{is added to the}} tanks through a hose assembly connected to a pipe penetration through the tank top. The flowsheet also includes <b>spray</b> <b>washing</b> with acid and water. This paper includes an overview of the configuration required for Chemical Cleaning, the planned flowsheet, and an overview of technical concerns associated with the process. In addition, the current status of the Chemical Cleaning process in Tanks 5 and 6, lessons learned from the execution of the process, and the path forward for completion of cleaning in Tanks 5 and 6 will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|An {{all-metal}} High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter {{has been}} recently developed {{as an alternative}} to traditional HEPA filters fabricated with conventional glass fibers. This metal filter was developed utilizing sintered porous metal media fabricated from nickel metal powder. One specific application is the potential for replacement of glass fiber HEPA filters currently used in High Level Waste (HLW) tank ventilation systems at various Department of Energy (DOE) nuclear waste storage sites in the US. The glass filters are subject to a shortened life span due to their deterioration from moisture condensation and therefore must be disposed of when spent. The disposal process is costly, creates solid waste, and is hazardous since the site personnel are at risk of exposure to radiation. Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) began investigating the use of porous metal as a HEPA filter material in 1996. This effort subsequently lead to a DOE funded development. This project, under DOE funding, developed novel technology to replace the glass fiber HEPA filters with a regenerable and more durable filter. A cylindrical nickel sintered porous metal filter element was developed for this application. The nickel filter is cleaned by washing the dirty surface with an in situ <b>spray</b> <b>wash.</b> Temperature, humidity, moisture, and other factors associated with the HLW tanks do no...|$|R
