5|$|The {{museum is}} home to a large <b>scientific</b> <b>library</b> open to the public. Its oldest books were printed in 17th-century Italy, and {{includes}} works by Ulisse Aldrovandi, Niccolò Gualtieri and Carl Linné. The library was founded in 1868 by a newly appointed museum director, Spiridon Brusina. Starting from a meager corpus acquired from the National Library, including only three books on zoology, Brusina traveled throughout then-Austria-Hungary in order to acquire books. In 1875, the museum acquired the large library and natural history collection of Francesco Lanza, a physician and archaeologist from Split, Croatia. Brusina retired in 1901, reporting a collection 1,800 works in 3,948 volumes three years earlier. In 1928, it was recorded that the library held 5,838 books in 9,901 volumes. As the library was not professionally maintained during the Croatian War of Independence or inventoried since, it is not known how many titles it holds. A 1999 estimate is 30,000 volumes and 13,100 monographs.|$|E

40|$|Summary. In {{this article}} we give {{a survey of the}} current {{practice}} and state-of-theart of recommender services in <b>scientific</b> digital <b>libraries.</b> With the notable exception of amazon. com and CiteSeer which do not qualify as proper <b>scientific</b> <b>libraries</b> our survey revealed that in <b>scientific</b> <b>libraries</b> recommender services are still not in wide use – despite the considerable benefits they offer for students and scientists. This fact can at least partially be explained by mechanism design problems which exist for the basic types of recommender systems and decreased funding for <b>scientific</b> <b>libraries.</b> Next, we present the principles of four recommender services developed at the Universität Karlsruhe (TH), namely the explicit review and rating service of the library of the Universität Karlsruhe (TH), the implicit basic “Others also searched [...] . ” service (BibTip) of the library of the Universität Karlsruhe (TH), the prototypes of its small sample and its adaptive variant.

Such systems could significantly reduce the search and evaluation costs of information products for students and scientists. This holds for pure digital libraries {{as well as for}} traditional <b>scientific</b> <b>libraries</b> with online public access catalogs (OPAC). In this contribution we first outline different types of recommendation services for <b>scientific</b> <b>libraries</b> and their general integration strategies. Then we focus on a recommender system based on log file analysis that is fully operational within the legacy library system of the Universität Karlsruhe (TH) since June 2002. Its underlying mathematical model, the implementation within the OPAC, as well as the first user evaluation is presented. ...|$|R

60|$|To {{dispel the}} tedium {{of the hours}} which her husband found it {{necessary}} to devote to the processes of combination and analysis, Georgiana turned over the volumes of his <b>scientific</b> <b>library.</b> In many dark old tomes she met with chapters full of romance and poetry. They were the works of philosophers of the middle ages, such as Albertus Magnus, Cornelius Agrippa, Paracelsus, and the famous friar who created the prophetic Brazen Head. All these antique naturalists stood in advance of their centuries, yet were imbued with some of their credulity, and therefore were believed, and perhaps imagined themselves to have acquired from the investigation of Nature a power above Nature, and from physics a sway over the spiritual world. Hardly less curious and imaginative were the early volumes of the Transactions of the Royal Society, in which the members, knowing little of the limits of natural possibility, were continually recording wonders or proposing methods whereby wonders might be wrought.|$|E

60|$|The {{first thing}} I came upon {{consisted}} of piles and heaps of Battersea tram tickets. There {{were enough to}} equip a paper chase. They shook down in showers like confetti. Primarily, of course, they touched my patriotic emotions, and brought tears to my eyes; also they provided me with the printed matter I required, for I found {{on the back of}} them some short but striking little scientific essays about some kind of pill. Comparatively speaking, in my then destitution, those tickets might be regarded as a small but well-chosen <b>scientific</b> <b>library.</b> Should my railway journey continue (which seemed likely at the time) for a few months longer, I could imagine myself throwing myself into the controversial aspects of the pill, composing replies and rejoinders pro and con upon the data furnished to me. But after all it was the symbolic quality of the tickets that moved me most. For as certainly as the cross of St. George means English patriotism, those scraps of paper meant all that municipal patriotism which is now, perhaps, the greatest hope of England.|$|E
60|$|Above the {{basement}} of the observatory were rooms for bachelors, a smoking- room, a billiard-room, and a <b>scientific</b> <b>library.</b> The wireless telegraphy machine (looking like two boxes, one {{on the top of the}} other, to the eye of ignorance) was installed in the smoking-room, and a wire to Mr. Macrae's own rooms informed him, by ringing a bell (it also rang in the smoking-room), when the machine began to spread itself out in tape conveying the latest news. The machine communicated with another in the establishment of its vendors, Messrs. Gianesi, Giambresi & Co., in Oxford Street. Thus the millionaire, though residing nearly fifty miles from the nearest station at Lairg, was as well and promptly informed as if he dwelt in Fleet Street, and he could issue, without a moment's procrastination, his commands to sell and buy, and to do such other things as pertain to the nature of millionaires. When we add that a steam yacht of great size and comfort, doing an incredible number of knots an hour on the turbine system, lay at anchor in the sea loch, we have indicated the main peculiarities of Mr. Macrae's rural establishment. Wealth, though Merton thought so poorly of it, had supplied these potentialities of enjoyment; but, alas! disease had 'decimated' the grouse on the moors (of course to decimate now means almost to extirpate), and the crofters had increased the pleasures of stalking by making the stags excessively shy, thus adding to the arduous enjoyment of the true sportsman.|$|E
