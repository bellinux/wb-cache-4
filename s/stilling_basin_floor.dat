The experimental study was carried out for three Froude numbers namely 3. 85, 2. 85 and 1. 85 for non-circular pipe outlet. Performance index (PI) {{has been used to}} evaluate the performance of stilling basin models tested using same sand base material and test run time. The scour pattern was measured for each test run and flow pattern was also observed. After 15 tests runs, it was found that scour process were reduced for a specific geometry of intermediate sill having saquare shape of the height 1 d at a particular location on <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> <b>floor</b> combined with end sill of particular size and shape.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the determination of}} weir dimensions and its applications based on the equations derived specifically for an irrigation weir and introduced in the standard design manual entitled “KKU- 2527 Weir”. The manual was used nationwide as a guideline {{for the construction of}} weirs. However, due to technical constraints that probably {{have a significant impact on}} weir design such as on-site conditions and budget constraints, among others, the main objective of this study is to determine the weir dimensions that best captures the hydraulic characteristics of flow over a weir and remedy the aforementioned technical constraints. According to the numerical solution of related equations in this study, it was found that weir dimensions are interchangeable. For example, with the significant limitations in deepening a river channel, a higher <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> <b>floor</b> elevation can be compensated by increasing the weir width. In brief, such design flexibility can be very useful for on-site weir design modifications in dealing with construction problems and dealing with the financial constraints of local administrative organizations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- There are {{relatively}} few investigations for computing the required stilling basin length for broad weirs structures. This length is mainly {{divided into two}} parts, {{the first one is}} the length at which the falling nappe strikes the basin floor “Drop Length”, and the second part is the hydraulic jump length. This research work deals mainly with the determination of the drop length and some characteristics of free-nappe in case of broad crested weirs. Theoretical and experimental studies were carried out for smooth horizontal rectangular channel having subcritical approaching flow condition. The experiments for different models were carried out using different values of discharge per unit width (q) in Lit. /sec. /m to determine the brink depth (he) in cm, the average pool depth beneath the nappe (hp) in cm, the upstream water depth over the upstream channel bed (ho) in cm, the horizontal length of lower nappe profile (LL) in cm, the horizontal length of upper profile (Lu) in cm, and the upper nappe angle with the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> <b>floor</b> () in degrees.

The main contributions are reviewd and a comparative analysis of different methods for computing hydrodynamic forces is performed. Air entrainment occurs in most of the spillways upstream of hydraulic jump stilling basins. So, the influence of this phenomena in the pressure field {{on the bottom of the}} basin is also investigated. The length, the longitudinal profile of hydraulic jump and the mean pressure distribution on the bottom of the stilling basin were measured and anlysed.

40|$|Criterion {{have been}} {{developed}} in this study for designing a stilling basin {{to serve as a}} transition from pipe flow to open channel flow. The purpose of the structure is to prevent erosion in an open channel. The unsteadiness, or smoothness, of the water surface in the model basin was used as the criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of the structure for energy dissipation. The introduction of a short-pipe energy dissipater in the stilling basin has proven effective in dissipating energy. The stilling basin was designed for a fully submerged pipe outlet. The inflow pipe and the dissipator pipe were designed to be located on the same center line, at Y 1 /D 1 = 1. 5 above the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> <b>floor.</b> The slit-width ratio, W/D 1, yielding the smoothest water surface was 0. 5 (W/D 1 = 0. 5). An optimum dissipator pipe diameter ratio of 2. 0 was established (D 2 /D 1 = 2. 0), while the optimum dissipator pipe length ratio was determined to be 1. 0 (L/D 1 = 1. 0). Three diameters of inlet pipe were used to determine scale effects. Within the accuracy of the measurements used in this study, no scale effects were detected. The expanding characteristics of a submerged jet were used in establishing the length of the stilling basin. Based on the dissipator pipe diameter ratio of 2. 0 (D 2 /D 1 = 2. 0) the stilling basin length ratio is 3. 5 (Lb/D 1 = 3. 5). Relations among the tailwater depth (dt), the outlet flume floor elevation (Y 2), the height of boils in the stilling basin (hb), the width of the stilling basin (Wb),and the amount of freeboard, fb, have been studied.

The correct assessment of their effects on the river system {{in which they are}} located is depending on several factors. Among others, the most relevant are: the hydraulic and geometric parameters characterizing the river branch and the geometry of the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin.</b> In particular, this last aspect is of fundamental importance as the downstream <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> has a significant role both for the structure stability and for the dissipative process. Nevertheless, the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> geometry is a key parameter for scour morphology characteristics. The aim of the present paper is to compare the morphological characteristics of the scour hole in basins characterized by different geometries downstream of block ramps. Namely, the analysis of scour hole profiles and characteristics were conducted for <b>stilling</b> <b>basins</b> with the same width of the upstream ramp and compared with those occurring in symmetrically and asymmetrically enlarged basins, in order to highlight similitudes and differences. The comparison of scour typologies occurring under different <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> configurations was discussed and analyzed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the generalized design rules for a new <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> for use with the straight drop spillway. This generalized <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> design was developed because experience in the field had shown that there was no satisfactory <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> for the straight drop spillway. However, limited field experience indicates that this new design will adequately protect the downstream channel from scour. Water falling over the spillway crest falls onto a flat apron. The nappe is broken up by floor blocks, which also prevent damaging scour of the downstream channel banks. Scour of the downstream channel bed is prevented by an end still. Flaring wingwalls, triangular in elevation, prevent erosion of the dam fill. For proper operation of the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin,</b> the contraction of the flow at the ends of the spillway opening must be partially suppressed. The <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> can be used {{for a wide range of}} discharge, head on the crest, crest length, height of drop, and downstream tailwater level. An important finding is that the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> length computed for the minimum tailwater levels. Dangerous scour of the downstream channel may occur if the nappe is supported sufficiently by high tailwater so that it lands beyond the end of the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin.</b> A method of computing the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> length for all tailwater levels is presented.

Total twenty one test runs of one hour duration each were performed. The performance of the models was compared by performance number (PN) to evaluate the performance. The study indicated that, for the given Froude number range, the triangular end sill of height 1 d with width 1 d (slope 1 V: 1 H), is performing better in comparison to other shapes of the end sill for the given flow conditions. The study also confirmed that there is a significant effect of the shape of the end sill geometry {{on the performance of}} the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> models...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} paper, the flow characteristics downstream the radial {{gate of the}} New Naga Hammadi Barrages physical model were investigated. These characteristics include the main parameters of the submerged hydraulic jump, the vertical velocity distribution along the bed, the velocity decay, and the stability of bed protection downstream the apron of the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin.</b> Various configuration of the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> were proposed and tested. The physical model was built at the Hydraulics Research Institute, Delta Barrages, Egypt. The used flume has 1. 0 m wide, 26. 0 m long and 1. 20 m deep. The flume side walls were made of glass with steel-frames to allow visual investigation of the flow patterns and stability of bed protection. Three designs of <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> were tested with 36 different flow conditions for every proposed design. The output of this extensive investigation recommended the <b>stilling</b> <b>basin</b> design of horizontal floor. The criteria for such selection was shortest length of submerged hydraulic jump, faster decay of near bed velocity, shortest length from {{the gate to the}} section where the velocity distribution is fully developed, and minimum scour dimensions D. S. the basin and hence the highest stability of bed protection...|$|R
