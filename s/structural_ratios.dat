5000|$|Restricted rocket staging {{is based}} on the {{simplified}} assumption that each of the stages of the rocket system have the same specific impulse, structural ratio, and payload ratio, the only difference being the total mass of each increasing stage is less than that of the previous stage. Although this assumption may not be the ideal approach to yielding an efficient or optimal system, it greatly simplifies the equations for determining the burnout velocities, burnout times, burnout altitudes, and mass of each stage. This would make for a better approach to a conceptual design in a situation where a basic understanding of the system behavior is preferential to a detailed, accurate design. One important concept to understand when undergoing restricted rocket staging, is how the burnout velocity is affected by the number of stages that split up the rocket system. Increasing the number of stages for a rocket while keeping the specific impulse, payload ratios and <b>structural</b> <b>ratios</b> constant will always yield a higher burnout velocity than the same systems that use fewer stages. However, the law of diminishing returns is evident in that each increment in number of stages gives less of an improvement in burnout velocity than the previous increment. The burnout velocity gradually converges towards an asymptotic value as the number of stages increases towards a very high number, as shown in the figure below. [...] In addition to diminishing returns in burnout velocity improvement, the main reason why real world rockets seldom use more than three stages is because of increase of weight and complexity in the system for each added stage, ultimately yielding a higher cost for deployment.|$|E

The going concern ability is expressed through the survival time to insolvency/bankruptcy.

40|$|Producer-consumer (predator-prey) {{systems have}} been studied {{for many years in}} terms of energy flow or mass balance of the system. In recent years related models have been {{adjusted}} to take into account not only food quantity, but also food quality. In other words, the nutrient content, or equivalently, the stoichiometric ratio of nutrient to biomass, as well as the biomass, is of interest. In this paper we start from a version of the Rosenzweig-MacArthur [11] model of a producer-consumer system and modify it by introducing stoichiometry. The model considered here includes a sediment class in addition to the producer and consumer classes. The model is open for both carbon and the nutrient. It sets “target ” <b>structural</b> <b>ratios</b> for both the producer and consumer, who eliminate carbon or nutrient, whichever appears in excess. This introduction of stoichiometry allows for different bifurcation sequences and corresponding dynamics than those that appear in the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. The stoichiometric mechanisms we use are also in contrast to those presented in the Loladze, Kuang, Elser model [9] which has become a standard starting point for stoichiometric models.

In that case explanations of economic growth {{are based on the}} logic of the used mathematical ratios often including the ideas about aggregated values change and factors change a priori. The idea of assessment of factor productivity is the fundamental one among modern {{theories of}} economic growth. Nevertheless, structural parameters of economic system, institutions and technological changes are practically not considered within known approaches, though the latter is reflected in the changing parameters of production function. At the same time, on the one hand, the ratio of structural elements determines the future value of the total productivity of the factors and, on the other hand, strongly influences the rate of economic growth and its mode of innovative dynamics.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{characterization}} of both electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) and inter-coupled split-ring resonator (SRR) structures utilized in microwave frequencies were proposed and studied. A new double-stopband EBG structure with a passband region of 14 to 18 GHz was initially constructed by determining the critical <b>structural</b> <b>ratios.</b> To {{reduce the size}} of EBG structure, a novel tapered array pattern was introduced. The structural period, the number of slot, and the length of slot were examined and a strong correlation was found between the lowpass cutoff frequency and the center slot length. Non-linearly tapered configuration was applied to enhance the filter performance and its size was only 57 % of the conventional EBG structure. Inter-coupled SRR was also examined and utilized as a bandpass filter when it is implemented on the microstrip line for the first time. It was found that the proposed structure can provide a fractional bandwidth of over 68 % with an insertion loss of 0. 81 dB in the passband region with a device size of 15. 5 mm. Chemical bath deposited Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) thin film was applied to the microwave structures to construct switchable filters. The illumination-sensitive CdS thin film's sheet resistance has been demonstrated to be able to switch from 300 to 109 O/square. With the proposed "conductive-islands" implementation, switching of EBG structure's transmission coefficient (S 21) was achieved from 31. 3 dB to 5. 6 dB at 13 GHz. The inter-coupled SRR structure also showed a S 21 switching response from 19 dB to 1. 5 dB at 5 GHz. Therefore, optically controlled microwave filters were successfully constructed and realized. Critical contributions in the field of microwave periodic structures are the characterization and the construction of double-stopband structure, linearly and non-linearly tapered array structures, and inter-coupled SRR structures. Vital characteristics and advantages discovered include wide stopband, reduced size, and large fractional bandwidth. Chemical bath deposited CdS thin films were studied to achieve an ultra low sheet resistance and high photosensitivity.

40|$|As the {{technology}} for solar electric propulsion has been further matured in the past years, the number of current and planned electric propelled spacecraft is rising. This technology {{can be applied to}} different mission scenarios such as: Deep space probes, communication satellites (transferred from a GTO or LEO to a GEO) or even reusable Moon or Mars supply modules. Although electric propulsion requires only a relatively small portion of fuel it does demand a lot of power. For deep space probes or Moon and Mars supply modules constant power supply with some hundred kW and up to 1 MW are realistic. State-of-the art solar array concepts could be adapted to such dimensions but the question needs to be asked if these architectures are the most suited for very huge arrays. Moreover, the availability and constant maturing of flexible photovoltaic cells raises the question if membrane based, gossamer structures could be a more weight efficient alternative. Based on current DLR technologies for deployable space structures two concepts for large solar arrays are examined. The analysis is done for a power spectrum of 2 : 5 kW to 500 kW and two types of solar cell technologies: thin-film solar cells (TF) applied to a thin membrane substrate and state-of-the-art high performance multi-junction cells (MJ). The first concept is based on the DLR GOSSAMER solar sail architecture while the second is a flexible blanket design similar to the ISS. To evaluate conceptual design changes several sub-configurations are examined as well by use of parametric finite element models. The configurations are analysed regarding their performance parameters specific power (power per array mass), stowage volume efficiency (power per stowed volume) and <b>structural</b> mass <b>ratio</b> (<b>structural,</b> mechanism and residual mass divided by photovoltaic blanket mass). For all configurations a partially dramatic decrease in performance with increasing power and size is observed. While in the small to medium power region (2 : 5 [...] 100 kW) good performance is achieved for both configurations, in the high power region (100 [...] 500 kW) especially stowage volume efficiency and stowed dimensions become a critical factor. The impact of array size can be observed when comparing both cell technologies. To compensate for the loss in cell efficiency, TF arrays are significantly larger. While in the small power regions performance values to MJ arrays show small differences this diverges strongly with increasing array power and thereby size. In case of <b>structural</b> mass <b>ratio</b> a difference up to a factor of 3 and in stowage volume up to a factor of 5 is observed. Comparing the concepts among each other the flexible blanket design outperforms the solar sail structure. Typical values for a 100 kW-array of the best performing sub-configurations using MJ cells are 184 W=kg specific mass, <b>structural</b> mass <b>ratio</b> of 0 : 5 and stowage volume efficiency of 35 kW=m 3 in case of the solar sail configuration. For the flexible blanket design 273 W=kg in specific mass, a <b>structural</b> mass <b>ratio</b> of 0 : 2 and a stowage volume efficiency of 110 kW=m 3 is achieved.
