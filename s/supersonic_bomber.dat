5|$|Scherger became Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (COSC), {{the senior}} Australian {{military}} {{position at the}} time, in May 1961, taking over from Vice Admiral Sir Roy Dowling. Keen as ever to see a <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber</b> replace the Canberra, he visited Britain in April 1963 to investigate progress of the TSR-2. Using back-channel sources of information, he satisfied himself that the RAF's pronouncements on the bomber's development were overly optimistic, and later that year began supporting selection of the F-111 as the aircraft best suited to supplant the Canberra.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 1965, {{following}} on {{from the}} cancellation of the BAC TSR-2 <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber,</b> the British and French governments announced the signing {{of a pair of}} agreements to cover the two joint projects; one based on the Breguet Aviation Br.121 ECAT ("Tactical Combat Support Trainer") proposal; this would later evolve, after the cancellation of the AFVG, to become the SEPECAT Jaguar. The other was the AFVG, a larger, variable geometry carrier-capable fighter aircraft for the French Navy (Aéronavale) as well as fulfilling interceptor, tactical strike and reconnaissance roles for the RAF. The AFVG was to be jointly developed by BAC and Dassault Aviation, the proposed M45G turbofan engine to power the aircraft was to also be jointly developed by SNECMA/Bristol Siddeley.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, McCauley again became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff. In 1947 he was {{promoted}} to air vice marshal and appointed Chief of Staff at British Commonwealth Occupation Force Headquarters in Japan. Returning to Australia in June 1949, he served as the last Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Eastern Area and the inaugural AOC Home Command (now Air Command). Raised to air marshal, he took up the position of Chief of the Air Staff in January 1954, and was knighted a year later. During his tenure in the RAAF's senior role, McCauley focused on potential deployments to Southeast Asia—particularly Vietnam—and threats from the north, commencing redevelopment of RAAF Base Darwin and recommending purchase of a light <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber</b> to replace the Air Force's English Electric Canberra. After retiring from military life in March 1957, he chaired various community and welfare organisations, serving as Federal President of the Air Force Association for ten years. He died in Sydney in 1989, aged 89.|$|E
5|$|Jabara {{returned}} to the United States in July 1953, and was assigned as commander of the 4750th Training Squadron at Yuma Air Force Base (later renamed Vincent AFB), Arizona. By January 1957 Jabara was at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida to join the 3243rd Test Group to test Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. He was first reassigned to Headquarters of the 32d Air Division at Syracuse, New York, then assumed command of the 337th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron at Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts. In 1958, Jabara flew combat missions over Taiwan in the F-104 Starfighter. From July 1960 to June 1961, he attended and graduated from the Air War College in Montgomery, Alabama. At Carswell Air Force Base, Texas, Jabara piloted the first <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber,</b> the Convair B-58 Hustler {{as part of the}} 43d Bomb Wing. Jabara also helped train NATO pilots on the F-104 Starfighter in July 1964, when he was stationed at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona and he wrote of the aircraft's significant technological improvement over the F-86 Sabre.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after {{returning}} to Australia. The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly manoeuvrable. It had been procured partly for its capacity to deliver nuclear weapons, an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium-to-high-altitude area bombing but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics. No.1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959–60 and 1960–61. As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers. The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the General Dynamics F-111C <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber,</b> which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its swing-wing technology. In September 1970, as an interim measure while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No.1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms, which it operated until June 1973. Although the Phantom had a multi-role capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile. One of No.1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews.|$|E

5000|$|Even {{before the}} first flights of the Tu-16 and Tu-20/Tu-95, Tupolev was working on <b>supersonic</b> <b>bombers,</b> {{culminating}} in the unsuccessful Tu-98.

Intended as a counterpart to the Convair B-58 Hustler, the Tu-22 proved rather less capable, although it remained in service much longer than the American aircraft. Meanwhile, the [...] "K" [...] Department was formed in the Design Bureau, with the task of designing unmanned aircraft such as the Tu-139 and the Tu-143 unmanned reconnaissance aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The {{cold war}} brought {{the threat of}} {{intercontinental}} <b>supersonic</b> <b>bombers.</b> This {{led to the development}} of integrated air defense systems such as Uragan-1 where search and acquisition radars at great distance from strategic areas detect inbound threats, integrate that data into an attack or intercept solution, then engage the target with interceptor aircraft or anti-aircraft artillery as the intruder progresses into several layers of weapon systems.|$|R
500|$|The {{resulting}} design {{went through}} considerable evolution, owing to both its cutting-edge technology and continual redefinition of the USAF requirements. Early revisions prominently featured canards, with {{a span of}} 19ft 10in (6.04 m), and a wing of 53.5° sweep. The aircraft in this configuration {{would have had a}} maximum takeoff weight of 99,400lb (45,088kg) with a 72,550 feet (22,113 m) operational ceiling. In addition to the F-108's interceptor role, North American proposed it as an escort fighter for its own B-70 Valkyrie <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber</b> prototype. Commonality between the B-70 bomber and the F-108 included the escape capsule and General Electric YJ93 engines. Another role considered was for the F-108 to be [...] "gap-fillers" [...] for the Distant Early Warning (DEW) system; because of its great speed, the F-108 could have scanned up to [...] per hour.|$|E
500|$|During the mid 1950s, {{multiple}} British aircraft manufacturers {{had become}} interested in harnessing variable geometry wings in their proposed designs. Amongst these design studies were a supersonic-capable derivative of the Folland Gnat, and a project by Vickers to design a large variable geometry strike aircraft in response to Specification GOR.339 for a nuclear-armed <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber.</b> In 1964, the newly formed British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) decided to harness Vicker's earlier variable geometry work on a new design study, designated as the BAC P.45. The conceptual BAC P.45 {{was designed as a}} 'light strike' and two-seat trainer aircraft. BAC had strongly advocated for a government order for the type to equip the Royal Air Force (RAF), being {{one of a number of}} proposed designs that were produced by several rival manufacturers to meet Specification AST.362. According to aviation author Derek Wood, in spite the P.45 design being [...] "the obvious choice", the Secretary of State for Defence Denis Healey dismissed it in favour of a prospective cooperative arrangement with France for a joint-project based on the Br.121 ECAT ("Tactical Combat Support Trainer") proposal from Breguet Aviation instead.|$|E
500|$|A {{major reason}} for GE's {{interest}} in the collaboration, rather than building a 10-ton engine on their own, was that the SNECMA project was {{the only source of}} development funds for an engine in this class at this particular time. GE was initially considering only contributing technology from its CF6 engine rather than its much more advanced F101 engine, developed for the B-1 Lancer <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber.</b> The company was faced with a dilemma when the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its Advanced Medium STOL Transport (AMST) project in 1972 which included funding {{for the development of a}} 10-ton engine – either to build a [...] "limited" [...] technology 10-ton engine with SNECMA, or a similar engine with [...] "advanced" [...] technology on their own. Concerned that the company would be left with only the [...] "limited" [...] engine in its portfolio if it did not win the Air Force contract (for which it was competing with Pratt & Whitney and a General Motors division with its [...] "advanced" [...] engine), GE decided to apply for an export license for the F101 core technology.|$|E
50|$|Encapsulated Seat egress {{systems were}} {{developed}} {{for use in}} the B-58 Hustler and B-70 Valkyrie <b>supersonic</b> <b>bombers.</b> These seats were enclosed in an air-operated clamshell, which permitted the aircrew to escape at airspeeds and altitudes high enough to otherwise cause bodily harm. These seats were designed to allow the pilot to control the plane even with the clamshell closed, and the capsule would float in case of water landings.|$|R

2500|$|During the 1950s, France {{embarked}} on an extensive military program to produce nuclear weapons; however, it was acknowledged that existing French aircraft were unsuitable for the task of delivering the weapons. Thus, {{the development of a}} <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber</b> designed to carry out the delivery mission started in 1956 {{as a part of the}} wider development of France's independent nuclear deterrent. In May 1956, the Guy Mollet government drew up a specification for an aerially-refuelable <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber</b> capable of carrying a 3-metric-ton, 5.2-meter-long nuclear bomb 2,000km (without aerial refuelling). According to aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist, the specification's inclusion of supersonic speed was [...] "surprising" [...] to many at the time.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resulting}} B-58 {{design was}} the first [...] "true" [...] USAF <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber</b> program. The Convair design {{was based on a}} delta wing with a leading-edge sweep of 60° with four General Electric J79-GE-1 turbojet engines, capable of flying at twice the speed of sound. Although its large wing made for relatively low wing loading, it proved to be surprisingly well suited for low-altitude, high-speed flight. It seated three (pilot, bombardier/navigator, and defensive systems operator) in separated tandem cockpits. Later versions gave each crew member a novel ejection capsule that made it possible to eject at an altitude of 70,000ft (21,000m) at speeds up to Mach 2 (1,320mph/2,450km/h). Unlike standard ejection seats of the period, a protective clamshell would enclose the seat and the control stick with an attached oxygen cylinder, allowing the pilot to continue to fly even [...] "turtled up" [...] and ready for immediate egress. The capsule would float, and the crewmember could open the clamshell, using it as a life raft. In an unusual test program, live bears and chimpanzees were successfully used to test the ejection system. The XB-70 would use a similar system (though using capsules of a different design).|$|E
50|$|The AIM-152 {{originated}} in a U.S. Navy requirement for an advanced air-to-air missile {{to replace the}} AIM-54 Phoenix. By the mid-1980s the Phoenix was seen to be no longer cutting edge, and the Navy wanted a long range missile to counter the Soviet Tu-22M Backfire and Tu-160 Blackjack long-range <b>supersonic</b> <b>bombers.</b> The goal was to produce a weapon which was smaller and lighter than the Phoenix, with equal or better range and a flight speed of Mach 3 or more.|$|R

2500|$|After World War II, {{the major}} powers built heavy {{strategic}} bombers to carry nuclear weapons. By the 1960s, however, advances in ground-based radar, guided missiles, radar-guided anti-aircraft guns, and fighter planes greatly decreased the odds that bombers could reach their targets, whether they used the traditional high-altitude or newer low-altitude approach. One 1964 study of British V bombers estimated that a bomber that did not use chaff or other countermeasures would encounter an average of six missiles, each with a 75 percent chance of destroying its target. The study thus stated that [...] "the bomber will not always get through", and advocated Britain emphasize the Polaris submarine missile instead. For similar reasons, the United States Navy deployed Polaris submarines during that decade. At that time, it shifted aircraft carriers away from delivering strategic nuclear weapons to a role suited for both general nuclear and limited non-nuclear wars. The United States Air Force found converting its large fleet of manned bombers to non-nuclear roles more difficult. It attempted to redesign the B-70 Valkyrie high-altitude <b>supersonic</b> <b>bomber</b> project as a platform for reconnaissance and launch of standoff missiles such as the Skybolt; however, Skybolt was cancelled in 1962 after testing failures. A 1963 study stated [...] "Long-range technical considerations, of course, militate against the perpetuation of the manned bomber".|$|E
