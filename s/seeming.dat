Spinks competed in (but did not win) a December 3 open tournament.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Fischer was {{predictable}} in his use of openings {{and variations}} of those openings. Despite this <b>seeming</b> disadvantage, {{it was very difficult}} for opponents to exploit this limitation, because Fischer's knowledge of the openings and variations that he used was extensive.|$|E
5|$|And the {{impressive}} personal {{qualities of the}} Communist leaders, their <b>seeming</b> sincerity, and the coherence and logical nature of their program leads me, at least, toward general acceptance of the first explanation – that the Communists base their policy toward the Kuomintang on a real desire for democracy in China under which there can be orderly economic growth through a stage of private enterprise to eventual socialism without the need of violent social upheaval and revolution.|$|E

To rescue The <b>Seems,</b> Freck reveals he is a double agent for The <b>Seems</b> and gets {{the help of the}} Glitches in exchange for a place to live. The Glitches succeed in destroying The Tide and recapture The <b>Seems,</b> but the Unthinkable is about to occur. All the extra Thought was used during the siege to The <b>Seems.</b>|$|R

5|$|Beginning in late 1933 and {{escalating}} {{throughout the}} first half of 1934, American Roman Catholics launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema. This, plus a potential government takeover of film censorship and social research <b>seeming</b> to indicate that movies which were seen to be immoral could promote bad behavior, was enough pressure to force the studios to capitulate to greater oversight.|$|E
5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids <b>seeming</b> to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
5|$|It first {{aired in}} the United States on October 14, 2008 on the Fox network, and {{was seen by}} an {{estimated}} 9.157 million American viewers, the network's second highest rated show for the week. Critical reactions of the episode ranged from mixed to positive, as many believed the series was finally finding its footing. Others however critiqued the episode for <b>seeming</b> too ordinary for a science fiction series.|$|E

40|$|The English verb <b>seem</b> {{can take}} {{several types of}} complements, in two classes; full clauses, which can be either finite CPs or non-finite IPs (in which case, the subject raises out of the IP to matrix subject position) : 1. It <b>seems</b> that Santa Claus is stuck in the chimney. 2. Santa Claus <b>seems</b> to be stuck in the chimney. And small clauses, which can have either an AP, PP or DP {{predicate}} (which also exhibit subject raising) : 3. Santa Claus <b>seems</b> jolly. (AP) 4. Santa Claus <b>seems</b> at home. (PP) 5. Santa Claus <b>seems</b> a decent man. (DP) In addition to the clausal complement, <b>seem</b> also optionally takes a dative experiencer...|$|R

In the description of the banknotes, the date in parentheses indicates the individual’s first appearance on a given note type and denomination. When multiple banknotes are listed, the order, though <b>seeming</b> random, is in accordance with the Friedberg Number, in ascending Friedberg order. The engraved portraits are from a virtual exhibit of bank notes which are part of the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E
5|$|Shazam, having {{defeated}} his arch-enemy Black Adam, journeys to Kahndaq to bury him, inadvertently risking {{a diplomatic}} incident. Superman and the Justice League attempt to stop Shazam, which escalates into a fight. Amanda Waller decides {{it is the}} perfect opportunity for the Justice League of America to confront the Justice League, and dispatches them. During the conflict, it appears as though Superman murders the JLA's newest recruit, Doctor Light. <b>Seeming</b> to have lost control of his powers, Superman surrenders himself to A.R.G.U.S.|$|E
5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, <b>seeming</b> happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E

5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used her right hand to avoid <b>seeming</b> unusual (due to years of using her right hand, it renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's diaper and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink {{just in time to}} stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding contempt toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer agree that they had a great date night.|$|E
5|$|Astana {{participated in}} the Volta a Catalunya in May, while the Giro d'Italia was ongoing. The team did not win any stage, but Haimar Zubeldia took third overall in the event, and the team won the teams classification. In the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré in June, Contador {{was thought to be}} a {{favorite}} for victory, but he did not seem to try his hardest to win, not attacking or taking any pulls on the mountainous Stage 5 and <b>seeming</b> to work for Alejandro Valverde on the race's last two days. The team next took part in the Tour de Suisse, with Klöden in fourth their highest-placed rider.|$|E
5|$|At the {{cemetery}} in Sampul (Chinese: 山普拉), ~14km from the archaeological site of Khotan in Lop County, Xinjiang, China, where the aforementioned Sampul tapestry was found, the local inhabitants buried their dead there from roughly 217 BC to 283 AD. Mitochondrial DNA {{analysis of the}} human remains has revealed genetic affinities to peoples from the Caucasus, specifically a maternal lineage linked to Ossetians and Iranians, {{as well as an}} Eastern-Mediterranean paternal lineage. <b>Seeming</b> to confirm this link, from historical accounts it is known that Alexander the Great, who married a Sogdian woman from Bactria named Roxana, encouraged his soldiers and generals to marry local women; consequentially the later kings of the Seleucid Empire and Greco-Bactrian Kingdom had a mixed Persian-Greek ethnic background.|$|E

5|$|Building on {{his late}} 1950s {{drawings}} of comic strips characters, Look Mickey marks Lichtenstein's first full employment of painterly techniques to reproduce almost faithful representations {{of pop culture}} and so satirize and comment upon the then developing process of mass production of visual imagery. In this, Lichtenstein pioneered a motif that became influential not only in 1960s pop art but continuing {{to the work of}} artists today. Lichtenstein borrows from a Donald Duck illustrated story book, showing Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck during a fishing mishap. However, he makes significant alterations to the original source, including modifying the color scheme and perspective, while <b>seeming</b> to make statements about himself.|$|E
5|$|Ending A: The group {{arrive in}} the Promised Land and Legna prepares to enact the prophecy, but Nowe instead chooses {{to find a new}} Goddess. Legna calls the Holy Dragons to battle, but Seere leads an army of Golems against them. With {{everything}} <b>seeming</b> lost, Manah and Nowe share a final kiss, which triggers Nowe's transformation into the New Breed. Nowe and Legna do battle, and Legna is killed. Eris then reveals that she is to become the new Goddess. Eris is initiated, and although the world is restored, Nowe and Manah feel sad that no other solution could be found.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of {{the work}} survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes note {{of the work}} in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely {{accepted}} as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods <b>seeming</b> to back this up.|$|E

5|$|Historians have divided {{views on}} Stefansson's {{decision}} to leave the ship. Some of the voyage's survivors were critical of his <b>seeming</b> indifference to their ordeal {{and the loss of}} their comrades. He escaped official censure, and was publicly honoured for his later work on the expedition despite the Canadian government's reservations about its overall management. Although Bartlett was criticised by an admiralty commission for taking Karluk into the ice, he was hailed as a hero by the public and by his former Karluk shipmates.|$|E
5|$|In their Bounty histories, both Hough and Alexander {{maintain}} that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny, however sorry they were to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always <b>seeming</b> to {{bear the brunt of}} the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all of the}} hospital's doctors, House is {{required}} to treat patients in the facility's walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series' comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after <b>seeming</b> to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Analogies {{with some of the}} simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team's case.|$|E
