40|$|This {{is taken}} from [SZ 04, Chap. 5]. It {{is the first of}} three {{applications}} they develop based on their review of timeseries techniques in the first four chapters. 1. Data streams are unending sequences of data arriving rapidly and needing to be processed. For example, quotations and transactions arriving every second for fifty thousand stocks would constitute a data stream of fifty thousand sequences. Or the <b>Space</b> Shuttle <b>telemeters</b> readings each second for twenty thousand sensors to Houston. The kind of analyses discussed in chapter 5 of [SZ 04] include single-stream statistics such as average, standard deviation and best-fit slope, pairwise statistics such as correlation and “beta”, and lagged statistics such as autocorrelation for single streams or cross correlation for pairs of streams. We should start with a review. We write an arbitrary timeseries with capital letters, X or X 1,X 2, [...] ,Xn. Often we normalize the timeseries so that its average is 0 and its standard deviation is the the square root of its length, √ n. We write a normalized series with small letters, x or x 1,x 2, [...] ,xn. xi = Xi − avg(X) std(X) where and n∑ avg(X) = Xi/n i= 1 (std(X)) 2 n∑ = (Xi − avg(X)) i= 1 2 /n The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between series X and Y is corr(X,Y) = avg(X. ∗ Y) − avg(X) avg(Y) std(X) std(Y...|$|R

40|$|The need to {{increase}} data-rate capabilities of the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) has prompted NASA to investigate bandwidth-efficient modulation schemes. Based upon current technology the most promising scheme is Trellis-Coded Modulation (TCM) operating with Octal Phase Shift Keying (8 PSK). In conjunction with NASA, New Mexico State University 2 ̆ 7 s Manuel Lujan Jr. Center for <b>Space</b> <b>Telemetering</b> and Telecommunications Systems has constructed a system to test this new candidate TDRSS modulation scheme, TCM 8 PSK. This system was tested through the TDRSS channel to demonstrate that this coding scheme operates as well over the actual channel {{as it has in}} lab experiments and simulations. Two interchangeable codecs, implementing separate TCM techniques, were tested. The results of this experiment and subsequent data analysis are presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} effects of the High Power Amplifier (HPA) and the filters over a {{satellite}} or telemetry channel. The Volterra series expression is presented for the nonlinear channel with memory, and the algorithm is based on the finite-state machine model. A RAM-based algorithm operating on the receiver side, Pre-cursor Enhanced RAM-FSE Canceler (PERC) is developed. A high order modulation scheme, 16 -QAM is used for simulation, the results show that PERC provides an efficient and reliable method to transmit data on the bandlimited nonlinear channel. The contribution of PERC algorithm is that it includes both pre-cursors and post-cursors as the RAM address lines, and suggests a new way to make decision on the pre-addresses. Compared with the RAM-DFE structure that only includes post- addresses, the BER versus Eb/NO performance of PERC is substantially enhanced. Experiments are performed for PERC algorithms with different parameters on AWGN channels, and the results are compared and analyzed. The investigation of this thesis includes software simulation and hardware verification. Hardware is setup to collect actual TWT data. Simulation on both the software-generated data and the real-world data are performed. Practical limitations are considered for the hardware collected data. Simulation results verified the reliability of the PERC algorithm.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} a study performed under the sponsorship of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) made as a grant to the Center for <b>Space</b> <b>Telemetering</b> and Telecommunication Systems at New Mexico State University. The purpose of this phase of the grant is to increase user access to the Space Network (SN) run by NASA for supplying space-to-ground communications for satellites and associated control centers. The identified need is to bring more users into the community of those accessing the SN, especially those in the small satellite class of users. The initial phase of the study concerned the potential for modifications to the standard transponder used in the SN. The results of that investigation are summarized in Section 4. As the hardware modifications were being investigated, a second option was developed, namely to consider changes to the operational mode for the small satellites. This operational concept was to use a single, fixed-pointing antenna in a spin-stabilized satellite and let the antenna pattern sweep past the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRS) in the SN. The question to be answered by this phase of the study was twofold: could enough contact time per day be made available using this simple operating mode and could the data rate be high enough to allow for sufficient data throughput to satisfy the user community using existing components. Section 2 outlines the methodology and simulation results to answer these questions. Section 3 contains a summary of an operational simulation of a simple satellite payload using these contact scenarios. The simulation is not all inclusive but shows how a payload simulation could be configured to utilize variable contact times. The answer to both of the questions desired to be answered is affirmative. By carefully choosing the correct system transmission power and antenna pattern, the system will allow support to the 50 th percentile of expected systems. It is recommended that based on this initial study, further work be done to quantify the exact parameters for transmission through the space network and to optimize usage of the contact time to maximize throughput...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} how VLBI might be pursued in space {{began in the late}} 1970 's, when it was {{realized}} that the size of the earth was a serious limitation to the study of compact radio sources. By going to space, achieving angular resolution at radio wavelengths that could not be obtained with VLBI systems that were limited {{by the size of the}} earth, important tests could not be made of quasar models. The technology appeared to be within reach, and an early space VLBI concept, QUASAT, emerged as a joint project, involving both US and European scientists. In 1984, a workshop was held in Gross Enzerdorf, Austria, under joint sponsorship of NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). The principal conclusion of the workshop was that a VLBI station in <b>space,</b> <b>telemetering</b> its data to ground data stations, working in connection with ground-based radio telescopes, would give the opportunity to achieve angular resolution of a few tens of micro-arc-seconds, and could develop high-quality radio maps of many classes of radio sources. The ground telemetry stations would also function as the source of a stable local oscillator for the spacecraft, which needs a highly stable frequency reference. The Deep Space Network of NASA could play a vital role in both the frequency-locking system and data acquisition. One outcome of the Gross Enzerdorf workshop was the convening, by COSPAR, of an ad hoc Committee on Space VLBI, to review and recommend procedures by which international collaboration on VLBI in space might be coordinated and promoted. In October 1985, the committee met in Budapest and recommended that the Inter-Agency Consultative Group (IACG) would be an appropriate body to coordinate VLBI activities in space. At the same time ESA convened a committee to explore the technical aspects of coordinating ground and space VLBI activities. At this stage both NASA and ESA were supporting preliminary studies of the QUASAT mission, with effective coordination between the two groups. The Soviet Union had also begun planning a mission with the clear intent to fly it as soon as the could; the mission was designated RadioAstron. In December 1985, the Soviets formed an international study team for the RadioAstron mission, holding the first meeting in Moscow. Subsequent meetings of this international committee were held in Budapest in May 1986 and in Moscow in December 1986. Thus, in 1986 there were three VLBI mission concepts under study: the NASA QUASAT mission, an ESA counterpart, and the Soviet RadioAstron mission...|$|E
