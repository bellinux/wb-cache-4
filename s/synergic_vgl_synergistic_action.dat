40|$|Resistance to {{ampicillin}} in Escherichia coli is due {{generally to}} the presence of a β-lactamase (penicillinase). Resistant strains have been found to fall into two groups: those with high-level resistance (1, 000 μg/ml or greater) and those with low-level resistance (8 to 250 μg/ml). Most of the high-level resistant organisms posses β-lactamases whose synthesis is episomally mediated. These strains release penicillinase from the cell when they are subjected to osmotic shock. Low-level resistant strains do not release the enzyme with osmotic shock. High-level resistant strains are not susceptible to the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of a penicillinase-resistant penicillin with ampicillin. Seventy eight per cent of low-level resistant strains are susceptible to the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of ampicillin and oxacillin. The two types of β-lactamases are similar in regard to most properties; both enzymes are subject to competitive inhibition by penicillinase-resistant penicillins.

40|$|Estrogen and {{progesterone}} or {{estrogen and}} glucocorticoid receptors functionally cooperate in gene activation if their cognate binding sites {{are close to}} one another. These interactions {{have been described as}} synergism of action of the steroid receptors. The mechanism by which synergism is achieved is not clear, although protein-protein interaction of the receptors is one of the favorite models. In transfection experiments with receptor expression vectors and a reporter gene containing estrogen and progesterone-glucocorticoid receptor binding sites, we have examined the effects that different portions of the various receptors have on synergism. N-terminal domains of the chicken progesterone and human glucocorticoid receptors, when deleted, abolished the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of these receptors with the estrogen receptor. Deletion of the carboxy-terminal amino acids 341 to 595 of the estrogen receptor produced a mutant receptor that could not trans-activate on its own. This mutant receptor did not affect the action of the glucocorticoid receptor but functioned synergistically with the progesterone receptor. We therefore conclude that the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of the receptors for estrogen and progesterone is mechanistically different from the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of the receptors for estrogen and glucocorticoid...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> {{of carbon dioxide}} and nisin on Listeria monocytogenes Scott A wild-type and nisin-resistant (Nisr) cells grown in broth at 4 °C. Carbon dioxide extended the lag phase and decreased the specific growth rate of both strains, but to a greater degree in the Nisr cells. Wild-type cells grown in 100 % CO 2 were two to five times longer than cells grown in air. Nisin (2. 5 mg/ml) did not decrease the viability of Nisr cells but for wild-type cells caused an immediate 2 -log reduction of viability when they were grown in air and a 4 -log reduction when they were grown in 100 % CO 2. There was a quantifiable <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> between nisin and CO 2 in the wild-type strain. The MIC of nisin for the wild-type strain grown in the presence of 2. 5 mg of nisin per ml increased from 3. 1 to 12. 5 mg/ml over 35 days, but this increase was markedly delayed for cultures in CO 2. This synergism between nisin and CO 2 was examined mechanistically by following the leakage of carboxyfluorescein (CF) from listerial liposomes. Carbon dioxide enhanced nisin-induced CF leakage, indicating that the <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of CO 2 and nisin occurs at the cytoplasmic membrane. Lipo-somes made from cells grown in a CO 2 atmosphere were even more sensitive to nisin action. Liposomes made from cells grown at 4 °C were dramatically more nisin sensitive than were liposomes derived from cells grown at 30 °C. Cells grown in the presence of 100 % CO 2 and those grown at 4 °C had a greater proportion of short-chain fatty acids. The <b>synergistic</b> <b>action</b> of nisin and CO 2 is consistent with a model where membran...|$|R

The synergistic inhibition of cell growth by ATST and gamma-TT was demonstrated by 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and isobologram analysis. delta-TT exhibited a similar inhibitory action {{when combined with}} ATST. Mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate eliminated most of the growth inhibitory effect of ATST, but only marginally decreased that of gamma-TT; whereas farnesyl pyrophosphate and squalene exhibited {{little effect on the}} inhibitory action of ATST and gamma-TT, indicating protein geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation are involved in the inhibition of colon cancer cell growth. Both mevalonate and squalene restored the cellular cholesterol level that was reduced by ATST treatment, but only mevalonate eliminated the cell growth inhibitory effect, suggesting that the cholesterol level in cells does not play an essential role in inhibiting cancer cell growth. Protein level of HMG-CoA reductase increased after ATST treatment, and the presence of gamma-TT attenuated the elevated level of HMG-CoA reductase. ATST also decreased membrane-bound RhoA, possibly due to a reduced level of protein geranylgeranylation; addition of gamma-TT enhanced this effect.
