5|$|In the 13th century, Roger Bacon {{argued that}} {{the speed of light}} in air was not infinite, using {{philosophical}} arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle. In the 1270s, Witelo considered the possibility of light travelling at infinite <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> vacuum, but slowing down in denser bodies.|$|E
5|$|Lightfoot Sis showed classic short <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> her pedigree, {{although}} she was unraced due to an injury as a filly that left her blind in one eye. Her sire was the Thoroughbred stallion Very Wise, and her dam was a Quarter Horse mare named Clear Track.|$|E

5|$|As {{the column}} {{approached}} Villers-Bocage, an Sd.Kfz. 231 armoured car crew observed the British advance and escaped. At 08:30, having covered , the 22nd Armoured Brigade group entered {{the town to}} be greeted by celebrating residents; two German soldiers were spotted leaving at high <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> a Volkswagen KÃ¼belwagen. The two Hussar regiments made contact with German forces {{on either side of}} the 22nd Brigade group route and the 8th Hussars engaged German eight-wheeler armoured cars. The Hussars reported German tanks heading towards Villers-Bocage, but Lieutenant Charles Pearce, of 4th CLY, thought that these were probably self-propelled guns.|$|E
5|$|Body adaptations, {{especially}} a paddle-like tail, help banded sea kraits to swim. These adaptations {{are also found}} in more distantly related sea snakes (Hydrophiinae) because of convergent evolution. However, because {{of the differences in}} motion between crawling and swimming, these same adaptations impede the snake's terrestrial motion. On dry land, a banded sea krait can still move, but, on average, at only slightly more than a fifth of its swimming <b>speed.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, most other non-Laticauda sea snakes are virtually stranded on dry land.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1969, {{airworthiness}} {{standards for}} civil {{aircraft in the}} United States Federal Aviation Regulations specified that distances were to be in statute miles, and <b>speeds</b> <b>in</b> miles per hour. In 1969, these standards were progressively amended to specify that distances were to be in nautical miles, and <b>speeds</b> <b>in</b> knots.|$|R

5|$|Following several tyre {{failures}} {{before the}} race, most spectacularly on Ralf Schumacher's Toyota during Friday practice and by Ricardo Zonta {{in the other}} Toyota, Michelin advised its seven customer teams that without a reduction in <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> Turn 13, the tyres provided for the race would only be safe for 10 laps. Michelin had been providing working tyres for the race since 2001. The situation was worsened by the 2005 Formula One rules, which forbade tyre changes during the race.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E
5|$|Helium is {{the second}} least {{reactive}} noble gas after neon, and thus the second least reactive of all elements. It is chemically inert and monatomic in all standard conditions. Because of helium's relatively low molar (atomic) mass, its thermal conductivity, specific heat, and sound <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> the gas phase are all greater than any other gas except hydrogen. For these reasons and {{the small size of}} helium monatomic molecules, helium diffuses through solids at a rate three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's {{character}} Salviati, {{widely regarded}} as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> a vacuum. But this had previously been proposed by Lucretius and Simon Stevin. Cristiano Banti's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar.|$|E
5|$|Meteor {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Germaniawerft {{shipyard}} in Kiel in 1888, and launched on 20 January 1890. Fitting-out work then commenced, and was completed by 19 May 1891, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Meteor served with the fleet only briefly; {{this was due to}} her poor handling and excessive vibration at high <b>speed.</b> <b>In</b> 1893, she was assigned as the dispatch vessel for the I Division of the Maneuver Squadron, which was composed of the four s.|$|E
5|$|Musashi {{was built}} with a Type 0 {{hydrophone}} system in her bow. It was only usable while stationary or at low <b>speed.</b> <b>In</b> September 1942 a Type 21 air-search radar was {{installed on the}} roof of the 15-metre rangefinder at the top of the forward superstructure. Two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943. During repairs in April 1944, the Type 21 radar was replaced by a more modern version and a Type 13 early-warning radar was fitted.|$|E

Due to the need to {{demonstrate}} the Genesis' technological prowess, the game underwent extensive testing and redesign, a process taking over six months. The developers' efforts were rewarded; and according to Naka, the game had the fastest-ever character <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that had been considered impossible on the console.|$|E
5|$|Swimming animals {{including}} fish such as herrings, {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, and ichthyosaurs (of the Mesozoic) all {{converged on the}} same streamlined shape. The fusiform bodyshape (a tube tapered at both ends) adopted by many aquatic animals is an adaptation {{to enable them to}} travel at high <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> a high drag environment. Similar body shapes are found in the earless seals and the eared seals: they still have four legs, but these are strongly modified for swimming.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed D-21 was an American {{reconnaissance}} drone with maximum <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> {{excess of}} Mach3.3 (2,215mph; 3,564km/h). The D-21 was initially {{designed to be}} launched {{from the back of}} a M-21 carrier aircraft, a variant of the Lockheed A-12 aircraft. Development began in October 1962. Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, the drone was intended for reconnaissance deep in enemy airspace.|$|E

50|$|Except for {{deceleration}} at each end, the A 555 did {{not have}} a <b>speed</b> limit, resulting <b>in</b> about 15 km of mostly straight three-lane-road on flat terrain, enabling motorists to drive their vehicles at top speed. Especially at night, <b>speeds</b> <b>in</b> excess of 200 km/h were not unusual. In 2004, however, a speed limit was introduced around Wesseling for reasons of noise reduction, effectively cutting the area for legal <b>speeding</b> <b>in</b> half.|$|R
5|$|The Pendolino is {{designed}} as a premium facility train. The seats are fitted with audio sockets for radio and music channels; however the radio service was dropped in 2010 due to low usage. All seats have electricity sockets for laptops and mobile phones. All Sm3 trains offer a free onboard Wi-Fi Internet access since 2010. The passenger information monitors over the aisle in the carriages show a clock and the train's current <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> addition to VR's marketing material and station information. They are also used to convey passenger information for the deaf. The train is accessible for wheelchairs, contains pet spaces and seats for allergic passengers.|$|E
5|$|The {{athletics}} {{competition at}} the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long jumpers typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride {{to allow them to}} take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum <b>speed.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.|$|E
5|$|The underpowered engines {{made the}} fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis {{were not as}} {{successful}} as hoped; they created violent vibration during takeoff and landing, despite the shock-absorbing oleo legs they were extended on. Work on the skis and legs improved this situation somewhat, but {{they were unable to}} resolve the sluggish performance. The Sea Dart proved incapable of supersonic <b>speed</b> <b>in</b> level flight with the J34 engines; not helping was its pre-area rule shape, which meant higher transonic drag.|$|E
50|$|In {{line with}} EU directives, most new {{vehicles}} in the UK weighing over 3.5 t must be equipped with a speed limiter.
