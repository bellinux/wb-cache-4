The goods vans used the same underframe, and were fitted with double sliding doors on each side.|$|R

40|$|Unlike {{cold climate}} regions, where natural {{ventilation}} is not preferred during winter, natural ventilation is always preferred in Hong Kong for cooling {{because of the}} subtropical climate. It also provides better indoor environment quality and energy conservation. Natural ventilation performance of a residential unit is affected by internal as well as external factors. External factors are often subject to constraints {{beyond the control of}} site planners and architects. Internal factors include opening configurations and window types, which site planners and architects are free to design the way they deem proper. However, little information is available about their precise impact. An earlier study by the authors on opening configurations identified the best and the worst out of twelve configurations. The best was with cross ventilation and the worst was with single-sided ventilation. In this study, {{the focus is on the}} influence of window types. CFD simulations were performed based on the best and worst opening configurations, different building orientations, and varying wind conditions, to evaluate the influence of different window types on natural ventilation performance using the mean age of air (MAA) as the criteria. Four window types were studied: <b>side</b> <b>hung,</b> top hung, full end-slider, and half end-slider windows. Evaluation results indicate that for cross-opening configurations natural ventilation performance was better with full end slider and <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> type windows. For single-sided opening configurations, <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> windows performed much better than the other three types. It can be concluded that better natural ventilation performance can be achieved by the use of <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> windows. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
5000|$|A tilt {{and turn}} window can both tilt inwards at the top or open inwards from hinges at the side. This {{is the most common}} type of window in Germany, its country of origin. It is also {{widespread}} in many other European countries. In Europe it is usual for these to be of the [...] "turn first" [...] type. i.e. when the handle is turned to 90 degrees the window opens in the <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> mode. With the handle turned to 180 degrees the window opens in bottom hung mode. Most usually in the UK the windows will be [...] "tilt first" [...] i.e. bottom hung at 90 degrees for ventilation and <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> at 180 degrees for cleaning the outer face of the glass from inside the building.|$|R

60|$|He was a man-at-arms, {{and at his}} <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> a sword.

25|$|In October 1960, a new model, The Frisky Prince {{was shown}} at the Earls Court Motor Show. This was {{basically}} a re-bodied Family Three with front <b>hung</b> <b>doors.</b> Around the same time, a deal was done with a company called Middlesbrough Motorcraft and kits to build your own Frisky became available from them. Anthony Brindle, who had become joint managing director of Frisky Cars {{took part in a}} publicity run attempting to visit five European capitals, Paris, Luxembourg, Brussels, Amsterdam and London not spending more than £5 on fuel.|$|R
60|$|At his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> {{a pocket}} pouch {{taken from the}} body of one of the {{numerous}} black warriors he had slain. Into this pouch he put a handful of the new playthings, thinking to polish them at his leisure; then he replaced the box beneath the bed, and finding nothing more to amuse him, left the cabin and started back {{in the direction of the}} tribe.|$|R
60|$|On {{either side}} of the {{ammunition}} pouch, behind, was strapped a new boot; so placed that it in no way interfered with the bearer getting at the pouch. Next was fastened the tin box; the lid of which forms a plate, the bottom a saucepan or frying pan. On one <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> the bayonet; upon the other a hatchet, a pick, or a short-handled shovel--each company having ten of each implement.|$|R

5000|$|The Salón de Reinos is {{rectangular}} in plan, {{with narrow}} {{doors on the}} two longer sides. On its north and south <b>sides</b> <b>hung</b> twelve paintings (one now lost) {{on the theme of}} the major battles won by the armies of Philip IV {{in the early years of}} his reign. Between these paintings, and above the Salón's windows, were ten paintings by Zurbarán showing the labours of Hercules, comparing the exploits of the demi-god Hercules (then considered as the ancestor of the House of Habsburg) with those of the king.|$|R

6000|$|Now it {{happened}} {{about this time}} that Robin Hood {{was going through the}} forest to Fosse Way, to see what was to be seen there, for the moon was full and the night gave promise of being bright. In his hand he carried his stout oaken staff, and at his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> his bugle horn. As thus he walked up a forest path, whistling, down another path came the Tinker, muttering to himself and shaking his head like an angry bull; and so, at a sudden bend, they met sharply face to face.

At his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> his pouch of medicines, and in his hand he held no spear, but a wand of ivory, whereof the top was roughly carved so as to resemble the head of a cobra reared up to strike.|$|R

60|$|Here the {{greatest}} difficulty confronted Clayton, {{for he had}} no means whereby to hang his massive door {{now that he had}} built it.

60|$|Upon the {{threshold}} stood Mr. Cullen, {{and by his}} side a lady {{who might have been}} anywhere between fifty and sixty years old. She was dressed in a particularly unattractive checked traveling suit, with a little satchel suspended from a shiny black leather band round her waist. She wore a small hat that was much too juvenile for her; and from the back of it a blue veil, which she had pushed on one <b>side,</b> <b>hung</b> nearly to the floor. Her complexion was very yellow; she had a square jaw; and through her spectacles her eyes glittered in a most unpleasant fashion. Her greeting was scarcely conciliatory.|$|R
60|$|Then, lo and behold! {{who should}} she see, gliding {{here and there}} among the crowd of other people, but the little man in green whom she had seen a year ago. She opened her eyes mightily wide, for she {{saw that he was}} doing a strange thing. By his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> a little {{earthenware}} pot, and in his hand he held a little wooden scraper, which he passed over the rolls of butter, afterwards putting that which he scraped from the rolls into the pot that hung beside him. Dame Margery peeped into the pot, {{and saw that it was}} half full; then she could contain herself no longer.|$|R
50|$|The gable is a {{projecting}} one extending further east {{than the}} wall below and the finish {{is also one}} of tile-hanging (matching that of the adjacent cottage). The tiles are clay and are decorative fish-scale type of probable 19th century origin. At the gable the cladding is embellished by pierced white painted timber barge-boards. A single two light casement window lights the interior of the garrets. The window has a moulded timber frame with a central mullion that is hollow-chamfered on the exterior and plain chamfered on the interior. The leaded lights have diamond quarrels and each light is <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> on pintles fixed to the timber frame.|$|R

60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} lived a poor widow who had one little boy. At first sight {{you would not have}} thought that he was {{different}} from a thousand other little boys; but then you noticed that by his <b>side</b> <b>hung</b> the scabbard of a sword, and as the boy grew bigger the scabbard grew bigger too. The sword which belonged to the scabbard was found by the little boy sticking out of the ground in the garden, and every day he pulled it up to see if it would go into the scabbard. But though it was plainly becoming longer and longer, it was some time before the two would fit.|$|R
