Moreover, the organizational advantage means that the firm without fundamental technology is not restricted by organizational inertia and cognitive restraint, and exercises the characteristic strength. firm without fundamental technology, <b>economic</b> <b>advantage,</b> organizational advantage, game machine industry, Nintendo...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We use {{recently}} developed procedures to decompose German Lorenz curves for post-government incomes among East Germans, West Germans, and foreign guest workers after German unification. The decomposed Lorenz ordinates {{permit us to}} construct interdistributional Lorenz curves, which in turn allow dominance comparisons of changes in <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> in different years. Using interdistributional Gini indices to capture the magnitude of these changes, {{we find that the}} <b>economic</b> <b>advantage</b> of West Germans over East Germans diminished by more than one-third between 1992 and 1996. Over the same period the advantage of West Germans over guest workers increased by about one-fourth, while the advantage of guest workers over East Germans virtually vanished.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of a {{comprehensive}} research project on the economics of pair programming. The purpose of the overall research is to thoroughly examine the <b>economic</b> <b>advantages</b> pair programming could gain over solo programming, identify situations where pair programming does not have <b>economic</b> <b>advantages,</b> and scenarios where solo programming is more cost effective than pair programming. This paper, due to space limitation, only reports results from one of the several studies we conducted. This paper focuses on one major previous publication, thoroughly examines its methodology and findings, and provides extensions we believe to be more robust and comprehensive. Our analysis results demonstrate pair programming and solo programming both have their own <b>economic</b> <b>advantages</b> and those advantages are dependent of a variety of factors...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{multi-step}} approach to evaluating {{the environmental and}} economic aspects of a thermal treatment plant with an energy-recovery configuration. In order to validate the proposed approach, the Turin incineration plant was analyzed, and {{the potential of the}} incinerator and several different possible connections to the district heating network were then considered. Both local and global environmental balances were defined. The global-scale results provided information on carbon dioxide emissions, while the local-scale results were used as reference values for the implementation of a Gaussian model that could evaluate the actual concentrations of pollutants released into the atmosphere. The economic aspects were then analyzed, and a correspondence between the environmental and <b>economic</b> <b>advantages</b> defined. The results showed a high energy efficiency for the combined production of heat and electricity, and the opportunity to minimize environmental impacts by including cogeneration in a district heating scheme. This scheme showed an environmental advantage, whereas the electricity-only configuration showed an <b>economic</b> <b>advantage.</b> A change in the thermal energy price (specifically, to 40 €/MWh), however, would make it possible to obtain both environmental and <b>economic</b> <b>advantages...</b>|$|R
