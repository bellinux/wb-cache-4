In order to retrieve a fast, accurate and an effective similarity of images from the large data set. The pre-processing step is extraction of brain. It removes the unwanted non-brain areas like scalp, skull, neck, eyes, ear etc from the MRI Head scan images. After removing the unwanted areas of non-brain region, it is very effective to retrieve the similar images. In this paper it is proposed a brain extraction technique using fuzzy morphological operators. For the experimental results 1200 MRI images are taken from <b>scan</b> <b>centre</b> and some brain images are collected from web and these have been implemented with popular brain extraction algorithm of Graph-Cut Algorithm (GCUT) and Expectation Maximization algorithm (EMA). The experiment result shows that the proposed algorithm fuzzy morphological operator algorithm (FMOA) is prompting the best promising results. Using this FMOA result retrieved the brain image from the large collection of databases using Gabor-Wavelet Transform.

40|$|Background: Hip {{fracture}} is {{a severe}} health burden {{in the elderly}} population. In order to prevent, it is to evaluate the bone strength by establishing the relation between bone mineral density (BMD), neck strength, and geometry. Materials and Methods: The subjects under study were 100 postmenopausal women who visited bone clinic of Bharat <b>Scan</b> <b>Centre.</b> After recording general profile such as age, body mass index (BMI), geometric measures such as hip axis length (HAL), neck shaft angle (NSA), and neck width (NW) were measured from digital X-ray. For the same individuals, BMD was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan. From the DXA print out neck strength was calculated using the formula = sectional modulus/HAL. Results: The correlation test was analyzed among BMD, neck strength, anthropometric, and geometric factors using Statistical packages for social services (SPSS) software. BMD is inversely related with age and positively correlated with height, weight, and BMI. HAL, NSA, and NW had a weaker association with BMD. Age, BMD, and NSA had a negative relation with neck strength. HAL and NW had a positive relation with neck strength. Conclusion: Noninvasive means of associating neck strength with BMD and geometry will provide improved estimates for fracture risk beyond any other invasive method of assessing bone mineral properties...|$|E

Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the proportion of primigravidae who want prenatal gender disclosure and the reasons for it. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study of randomly selected primigravidae seen at Enugu <b>Scan</b> <b>Centre.</b> The women were randomly selected using a table of random numbers. Results: Ninety percent (225 / 250) of 250 primigravidae who fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this study wanted to know the gender of their unborn baby, while 10 % (25 / 250) declined gender disclosure. Furthermore, 62 % (155 / 250) of primigravidae had preference for male children. There was statistically significant desire for male gender (P= 0. 0001). Statistically significant number of primigravidae who wanted gender disclosure did so to plan for the new baby (P= 0. 0001), and those that declined gender disclosure “leave it to the will of GOD” (P= 0. 014).

40|$|The {{art works}} shown in 'Arresting' were {{multidisciplinary}} involving the collaboration of art, science and technology. For 'Centred' (1 and 2) {{the research team}} comprised technologists, engineers, medical specialists (Prof David Wimpenny, Bob Borrel of DMU, Dr Richard Wellings and Dr Sarah Wayte of Coventry Walsgrave Hospital) and Cattrell who both directed the project and was the scanned subject. The collaboration was funded by an AHRC and Arts Council (ACE) Arts and Science Research Fellowship. The research aimed to make the human living (moving) heart visible in plastic three dimensional form. The project therefore posed specific technical and conceptual questions which challenged both art and science. Firstly can MRI scan data (when combined in three dimensions) fully reflect {{the inner and outer}} workings of the human heart? Secondly, can the MRI data be used to create sculptures which explore the felt but unseen within the living human? Thirdly can this novel combination of approaches (medical, technical and artistic) add to the overall understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the living heart? Using a variety of rigorous experimental new MRI sequences of the artist’s heart, the unique data was edited and combined digitally to build 3 D rapid prototyped sculptures. The digital voxals (volumetric pixels) from the MRI body scans were combined and modelled in three dimensions allowing a new physical rendering of the living heart. This data was then rapid prototyped into SLA and SLA sculptures. 'Arresting' contributed to an invitation for Cattrell to propose a permanent sculpture for the Royal Institution of Great Britain, and to being selected to make a new artwork for the Sculpture Trail at Forest of Dean.

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 98 - 101). This thesis {{has been designed to}} validate a professional finding for the Third sector while the researcher worked in BRAC as Head of Procurement from 2007 to 2014. The proposal is to carry out an inquisition whether a mixed structure of centralized and decentralized procurement i. e. hybrid structure could be ideal for a large Third sector organization like that of BRAC. In line with this inquiry, the literature review has been carried out first to see what really is meant by the Third Sector. After determining the same, the researcher has delved into the arena of literature review where he has tried to determine which structures are currently being applied and what the current practices of procurement for all three sectors were. Furthermore, the researcher has elaborated various facets of centralized, decentralized and mixed or hybrid procurement structures with specific reference to the Third Sector. In the hybrid segment the four available types, such as Strategically Controlled Action Network (<b>SCAN),</b> <b>Centre</b> Led Action Network (CLAN), Devolved procurement e. g. the Lead Buyer System and Partnering, have also been focused. It is deduced from the review that hybrid structure {{depending on the type of}} purchases could be ideal for a large Third Sector Organization like BRAC that is spread over continents. To further validate the finding, the researcher also carried out surveys though primary data collection. A population of 50 highly qualified procurement professionals was selected from the three sectors for responding to the questionnaire out of which 44 professionals responded. The professionals have the experience of working mostly in the upper level of the procurement function and have risen to their respective positions from the functional level to the strategic level having grasp of the issues involved with designing or streamlining the structure of all three sectors including the Third Sector. As many as 27 questions were framed ranging from the demographic data of the respondents to centralized/decentralized structure and then the hybrid structure. In the survey, Strategically Controlled Action Network (SCAN) hybrid system obtained overwhelming support from 61. 4 % respondents, Centre Led Action Network (CLAN) hybrid system got 25 %, the partnering 11. 4 % and the Lead Buyer System secured no following. It speaks volumes in support of the thesis that SCAN hybrid system would be ideal for a dispersed organization like BRAC and to a lesser degree CLAN system could be applicable to the Third Sector Organizations where devolvement to the division level is required for meeting the local requirement.

Material and Methods 22 patients (mean age: 75. 9 &# 177; 6. 1 years; 14 women) with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer‘s disease and 22 sex-matched healthy patients were examined. We compared the use of visual evoked potentials and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness using latest high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography with eye-tracking capabilities for optimised peripapillary <b>scan</b> <b>centring</b> {{for the first time in}} Alzheimer‘s disease patients. ResultsThe mean MMSE score was 22. 59 &# 177; 5. 47 in the Alzheimer‘s disease group, and did not significantly correlate with the visual evoked potentials latencies. We found no significant difference between the visual evoked potentials latencies of the Alzheimer‘s disease patients and those of the control patients. No peripapillary sector of the retina had a retinal nerve fibre layer thickness significantly correlated with the visual evoked potentials latencies. DiscussionWe demonstrated that pattern visual evoked potentials did not show any significant correlation despite subtle loss in retinal nerve fibre layer thickness.

A careful examination of the line <b>scans</b> <b>centred</b> on the [OI] 63. 18 microns fine-structure line unveiled a line at 63. 32 micron in some of these spectra. We identify this line with a transition of ortho-water. It is detected confidently (i. e., > 3 sigma) in eight sources, i. e., 24 % of the sub-sample with gas-rich discs. Several statistical tests were used to search for correlations with other disc and stellar parameters such as line fluxes of [OI] 6300 Armstrong and 63. 18 microns; X-ray luminosity and continuum levels at 63 microns and 850 microns. Correlations are found between the water line fluxes and the [OI] 63. 18 microns line luminosity, the dust continuum, and possibly with the stellar X-ray luminosity.

This study investigated the effect of suppression of blood vessel artifacts with and without retinal hyperaemia. Spectral domain OCT <b>scans,</b> <b>centred</b> on the optic nerve head, were performed in 46 healthy subjects (92 eyes). Baseline scans were made during rest, while for the follow-up scan, 23 subjects (50 %) performed strenuous physical exercise. Systemic and retinal hyperaemia were quantified. Quantification of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness was performed with and without suppression of retinal blood vessel artifacts. The potential systematic effect on RNFL thickness measurements was analysed using Bland-Altman plots. At baseline (no retinal hyperaemia), there was a systematic difference in RNFL thickness (3. 4 μm, limits of agreement - 0. 9 to 7. 7) with higher values if blood vessel artifacts were not suppressed. There was significant retinal hyperaemia in the exercise group (p < 0. 0001). Baseline thickness increased from 93. 18 to 93. 83 μm (p < 0. 05) in the exercise group using the algorithm with blood vessel artifact suppression, but no significant changes were observed using the algorithm without blood vessel artifact suppression. Retinal hyperaemia leads to blood vessel artifacts which are relevant to the precision of OCT layer segmentation algorithms. The two algorithms investigated in this study can not be used interchangeably. The algorithm with blood vessel artifact suppression was more sensitive in detecting small changes in RNFL thickness. This may be relevant for the use of OCT in a range of neurodegenerative diseases were only a small degree of retinal layer atrophy have been found so far. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the legal {{provisions}} to prevent female infanticide and foetiside, it continues to occur {{in many parts of}} the country. While infanticide was first known to be recorded in British rule, in some States like Tamil Nadu, it is essentially a post-Independence occurrence. Data from Bihar shows that it started among the high castes and now cuts across all castes and classes. In Tamil Nadu also, there are indications that the practice cuts across social groups, and also, that there has been a core area of occurrence, from where it is slowly spreading to the surrounding areas. Female infanticide is supported by sanctions and pressures from the family. It is fueled by the evil of the dowry system, which places demands on the girl's family. Sometimes, mothers kill their female babies to save them from abuse and violence later in life. Birth order also is an important factor- after two girls are born, the next girl is at high risk, according to a study from Tamil Nadu. It is believed also that killing a girl child increases the probability of a male child born in the family. Female infanticide is reported to occur also due to a lack of <b>scanning</b> <b>centres,</b> as an alternative to foeticide. Another factor implicated infanticide is the decline in the status of women due to the modernisation of agriculture. The new agricultural technology makes the traditional agricultural knowledge of women redundant, and due to the constraints on their free movement in the public space, it is the men who visit government offices to get loans and information on new varieties of seeds, pesticides and so on.

It is unclear if {{this is due to}} neurodegeneration of local dopamine-dependent retinal cells, a result of central nervous degeneration including the optic nerve or retinal small vessel disease. This study aimed to detect changes of the retinal vasculature in PD patients compared to controls. We examined 49 PD patients and 49 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) with a circular <b>scan</b> <b>centred</b> at the optic disc. Vessels within the retinal nerve fibre layer were identified by an automated algorithm and thereafter manually labelled as artery or vein. Layer segmentation, vessel lumen and direct surrounding tissue were marked automatically with a grey value and the contrast between both values in relation to the surrounding tissue was calculated. The differences in these grey value ratios among subjects were determined and used as an indicator for differences in vessel morphology. Furthermore, the diameters of the veins and arteries were measured and then compared between the groups. The contrast of retinal veins was significantly lower in PD patients compared to controls, which indicates changes in vessel morphology in PD. The contrast of arteries was not significantly different. Disease duration, disease stage according to Hoehn and Yahr or age did not influence the grey value ratios in PD patients. Vessel diameter in either veins or arteries did not differ between subject groups. The contrast of retinal veins contralateral to the clinically predominant and first affected side was significantly lower compared to the ipsilateral side. Our data show a potential difference of the retinal vasculature in PD patients compared to controls. Vascular changes in the retina of PD patients might contribute to vision-related complaints in PD...|$|R
40|$|Considering {{the limited}} {{measurement}} {{range of a}} machine vision method for the three-dimensional (3 D) surface measurement of large-scale components, a noncontact and flexible global measurement method combining a multiple field of view (FOV) is proposed in this paper. The measurement system consists of two theodolites and a binocular vision system with a transfer mark. The process of multiple FOV combinations is described, and a new global calibration method is proposed to solve the coordinate system unification issue of different instruments in the measurement system. In addition, a high-precision image acquisition method, {{which is based on}} laser stripe <b>scanning</b> and <b>centre</b> line extraction, is discussed to guarantee the measurement efficiency. With the measured 3 D data, surface reconstruction of large-scale components is accomplished by data integration. Experiments are also conducted to verify the precision and effectiveness of the global measurement method...|$|R
40|$|Student {{disengagement}} is {{a growing}} societal concern and responses to this concern have included a proliferation of re-engagement programs (REPs) across Australia. Evaluations by the Brotherhood of St Laurence (BSL) and anecdotal feedback have suggested that teachers find it extremely difficult to adapt to REP settings and cater for ‘high needs’ students. This prompted a Research and Policy <b>Centre</b> <b>scan</b> {{of the extent to}} which teacher training programs prepare teachers to work in more flexible learning environments. This scan provides a glimpse of whether disjunctures exist between policy, training programs and needs, and whether these can be resolved...|$|R
50|$|Radar {{operates}} {{by sending}} out very short pulses {{of a radio}} signal from a transmitter, then turning the transmitter off and listening for echoes in a receiver. The output of the receiver is sent to an oscilloscope's brightness input, so strong echoes cause {{a spot on the}} screen to light up. To make the spots correspond to locations in space, the oscilloscope quickly <b>scans</b> from the <b>centre</b> to the outside of the display; echoes that return later in time are produced further out on the display, indicating further distance from the aircraft. The times are synchronized by using the transmission pulse to trigger the scan.|$|R
