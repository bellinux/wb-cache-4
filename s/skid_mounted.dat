25|$|The basic {{configuration}} {{was similar to}} earlier gliders such as the Stamer Lippisch Zögling and the Grunau IX, but the SG 38 was an entirely new design. Improvements included enlarged tail surfaces for better stability, a separate <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> on shock-absorbing springs, and an updated seat for the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The V.1's {{fuselage}} was rectangular in cross-section, {{with the}} engine partially enclosed by a helmet shaped cowling open at the bottom. [...] The open, single seat cockpit was over the wing trailing edge. [...] The tailplane, carrying separate elevators, was mounted {{on the top of}} the fuselage and wire-braced to the fin; the rounded rudder extended to the keel. [...] The V.1 had a fixed, conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a single axle supported by two V-form pairs of struts, originally curved but straight by May 1917. There was a small tail <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> forward of the elevator.|$|E
2500|$|The Dyott was a single-seat, mid-wing {{monoplane}} {{of clean}} appearance for its day. [...] The fuselage was built up around four longerons. [...] These were of ash in the stressed region from wing spars to engine, spruce {{at the rear}} and internally wire braced. [...] Stringers behind the cockpit formed a smooth rounded decking under the overall fabric covering. The forward fuselage, including the cockpit was aluminium clad, with a neat nose piece over the 7-cylinder, 50hp (37kW) Gnome rotary engine, more to protect the pilot from oil than for streamlining. Steel tubing was used in several places: the empennage was steel framed, as was [...] the pilot's seat, and steel tubes formed the vertical undercarriage members. [...] There were four of the latter, each pair mounting a short wooden skid with steel cross bracing and a single axle on shock absorbers carrying a pair of wheels. [...] The undercarriage was initially completed with a long sprung tail skid, later replaced by a shorter cane <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> further aft. At the same time, Dyott made some changes to the transverse bracing of the main undercarriage.|$|E
50|$|The NiD 940 had {{tricycle}} landing gear, {{with its}} mainwheels on V-struts hinged {{from the lower}} fuselage and with vertical shock absorber legs to the wings. Wingtips were protected by <b>skids</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the bottom of}} the fins. The nosewheel was large and well forward.|$|R
2500|$|The M6 {{system was}} one of the first systems to make use of the XM156/M156 {{universal}} mount, providing two M60C 7.62×51mm machine guns on either side of the helicopter. [...] This system would later be expanded upon, but initially gave the UH-1 increased firepower and an improved offensive system over the <b>skid</b> <b>mounts</b> originally used.|$|R

50|$|The {{fuselage}} had flat, parallel sides which tapered {{in depth}} aft of the wings. The single-seat cockpit was {{just behind the}} wing leading edge; with the pilot in place, a rear-hinged, rectangular piece with an aperture for his head folded forward to complete the upper wing surface. In front, the flat fuselage sides curved inwards and were rounded at the nose. The glider sat {{on a pair of}} <b>skids</b> <b>mounted</b> on the lower fuselage longerons, with the wings protected by wire loops reaching from the main spar below the wing to the leading edge. It also had a small tailskid.|$|R
50|$|The low {{aspect ratio}} wings were {{parallel}} edged and almost square tipped, with the thin airfoil section {{typical of the}} time. They were built around two spars, each a spruce-ash-spruce sandwich, and the profile was formed with mixed spruce and ash ribs. Both spars fitted into sockets formed by two transverse fuselage struts, but the rear socket was made oversize and the spar attached with a bolt and split pin to allow movement, as the Dyott was laterally controlled by wing warping. The main in-flight aerodynamic forces on each wing were carried by pairs of cables to the front spar from the forward <b>skid</b> <b>mounting</b> point, an arrangement that caused some concern over the transfer of landing loads to the wing. Each wing was braced from above with four wires, two to each spar, from an inverted V steel pylon {{just in front of}} the cockpit. A short vertical steel post below the rear of the cockpit carried pairs of wing warping wires to the rear spar.|$|R
25|$|The Brikken had a Farman style fixed undercarriage, {{with two}} wheels {{on each side}} on short axles {{attached}} {{at right angles to}} skids, upturned at the front.

5000|$|The Type Bordeaux was a two-bay equal span pusher {{configuration}} biplane {{powered by}} a Gnome Omega 7 cylinder rotary engine driving an aluminium bladed Voisin propeller mounted {{at the rear of}} the uncovered wooden nacelle. The tail surfaces, carried on four wire-braced steel booms, consisted of a horizontal stabiliser and elevator mounted between the upper pair of booms with a single centrally mounted rudder beneath it. The structure made extensive use of steel tubing and the flying surfaces were covered with [...] "Continental" [...] brand rubberised fabric. Lateral control was effected by large D-shaped ailerons mounted on the upper wing: these were controlled by foot pedals. The rudder and elevator were activated by a control wheel which was turned to control the rudder and moved forwards and backwards to control the elevator. It had a tricycle undercarriage consisting of a pair of mainwheels mounted on sprung steel struts below the wing and a nosewheel below the front of the nacelle, although the aircraft at rest rested on the two mainwheels and <b>skids</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the rear of the}} lower pair of tailbooms.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the general}} {{arrangement}} of the aircraft was conventional for the time, being a pusher biplane with a front-mounted elevator and a rear-mounted horizontal stabiliser and rudder, it {{had a number of}} extremely unorthodox constructional details. [...] The most obvious was the construction of the wings, which had a single spar forming the leading edges of the wings which was an exposed warren truss of a type designed and patented by Fabre. [...] The ribs were cantilevered from this spar, each rib being enclosed in a pocket in the covering, which was laced to the leading edge and attached to the trailing edge end of each rib by a spring clip. [...] The other flying surfaces were similar. [...] The wings were connected by four single interplane struts, the central pair attached to booms (also Fabre girders) bearing the forward-mounted elevator and a rear-mounted rudder mounted in front of an adjustable horizontal stabilising surface. [...] The aluminium-covered nacelle, in which the pilot and passenger were seated side by side) in front of the [...] Gnome Omega rotary engine, was suspended between the wings by steel cables which were attached {{to the ends of the}} central pair of interplane struts. [...] The undercarriage consisted of a pair of long <b>skids</b> <b>mounted</b> on extensions of the inner interplane struts and connected to the forward extremities of the fuselage booms, each bearing a pair of wheels on a short axle. A tailskid which could be moved by the pilot to act as a brake was carried on the lower end of the rudder mounting.|$|R
50|$|The DFS 228 was {{designed}} by Felix Kracht and a first prototype was completed in March 1944 and was undergoing gliding tests by August, carried aloft piggyback, strut-mounted atop a Dornier Do 217. The aircraft was of conventional sailplane design, with long, slender wings, and intended to land on a retractable <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> on its belly. The nose of the aircraft could be separated in an emergency, and formed a self-contained, pressurised escape capsule for the pilot. Because of problems with the cabin pressurisation system, the second prototype accommodated the pilot in a prone position.|$|E
50|$|The V.1's {{fuselage}} was rectangular in cross-section, {{with the}} engine partially enclosed by a helmet shaped cowling open at the bottom.

50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} from Kevlar-reinforced fibreglass with steel tube reinforcement {{in the cockpit}} area. The seating is for pilot and passenger in side-by-side configuration, sharing a centre-mounted control stick. The landing gear is of tricycle configuration, with curved main gear legs made from fibreglass and a nosewheel mounted on steel tubes with rubber puck shock absorbing. There is also a shock-absorbing tail <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> under the fin. While the fin is fibreglass the horizontal stabilizer, elevator and adjustable trim tab mounted as a T-tail are all aluminum.|$|E

50|$|In Farman types {{the pilot}} sat over the wing, {{completely}} exposed, with the 37 kW (50 hp) seven cylinder Gnome Omega rotary engine {{behind him in}} pusher configuration; Koolhoven added a pod or gondola, its flat sides curving together to a sharp edge at the front. The undercarriage consisted {{on each side of}} a pair of wheels on either side of a skid, curved up at the front. Each <b>skid</b> was <b>mounted</b> on two vertical struts attached below the wing at the bases of the innermost interplane struts and laterally braced with an inner diagonal strut to the wing underside. A long, curved tailskid was fixed just ahead of {{the leading edge of the}} tailplane.|$|R
50|$|A {{custom-built}} recumbent trike {{called the}} Polar Cycle made by Inspired Cycle Engineering (ICE) helped Maria secure her record, while her rivals chose the standard upright bike and took almost 4 weeks longer than Leijerstam {{to reach the}} summit.

5000|$|Skid {{units in}} their {{simplest}} form {{consist of a}} tank, pump and hose mounted on a self-contained platform. Most skid units are designed to fit in the bed area of a standard pickup truck. Skid units can be configured to hold as little as 50 gal to over 1500 gal of water. For specialized applications, foam cells of various capacities can be included as well as foam injection systems integrated to deliver Class [...] "A" [...] and / or [...] "B" [...] foam concentrates. Twin Agent <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> units are also used in high hazard class B areas in industrial sites.|$|E
5000|$|The SCR-197 {{mobile station}} {{consisted}} of the BC-325 radio transmitter with a frequency coverage of 1.5 to 18 Mhz and an RF power output of 400 watts. Radio receivers consisted of three BC-342 and one Hallicrafters S-20R [...] "Sky Champion". Also provisioned was a BC-119 control box. The complete set was housed in a K-18 truck and K-19 trailer combination. A 45 foot vertical antenna was used for sending and a 15 foot whip used for receiving. Power could be optionally supplied by power mains or portable generator units: one PTO driven GN-42-A generator for the transmitter and two small PE-75 <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> units for the receivers. The SCR-197 set was later replaced by the SCR-299.|$|E
50|$|The EF 009 was {{designed}} as a point defense interceptor, to be positioned around vital locations then launched when they were in trouble. The plane was to be powered by ten jet engines clustered around its nose and was expected to sustain flight for six minutes. It would then land unpowered on a central <b>skid</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the front of the}} plane. To cope with g-forces during takeoff, the pilot would lie in a prone position. Takeoff would most likely be from a specially-designed cart, or vertically like a rocket. Armament was to consist of two MG 151/20 20 mm cannons or two MK 108 30 mm cannon. Aircraft design advances made this project obsolete almost before the plans were even complete.|$|E
25|$|Its {{fuselage}} was {{a simple}} rectangular cross section wooden structure skinned with plywood. The single seat, open, unscreened cockpit was immediately below the leading edge. The landing <b>skid</b> was <b>mounted</b> {{on the front end}} of a curved, deep, covered frame on the fuselage underside, separating from it aft and rubber sprung well clear towards its end. The fuselage tapered rearwards, where there was a small tail bumper. The tail was {{different from that of the}} BS.16; although the same triangular tailplane and parallel chord, cropped tipped elevators were used, they were mounted on top of a low, straight edged fin. A new, large, balanced, angular rudder, hinged at the extreme tail extended down to the keel, operated in a cut-out between the elevators.|$|R
50|$|A test {{separator}} {{is used to}} separate and to meter the well fluids. The {{test separator}} {{can be referred to}} as a well tester or well checker. Test separators can be vertical, horizontal, or spherical. They can be two-phase or three-phase. They can be permanently installed or portable (<b>skid</b> or trailer <b>mounted).</b> Test separators can be equipped with various types of meters for measuring the oil, gas, and/or water for potential tests, periodic production tests, marginal well tests, etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage is {{made from}} welded steel tubing, with all surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. Its 43 ft span wing is mounted above the rear seat and supported by parallel lift struts. The tail is cable-braced. The cockpit is open, without a windshield. The landing gear is a conventional arrangement for fixed wing powered aircraft, rather than the more common central monowheel used on gliders. A wooden <b>skid</b> is also <b>mounted</b> on the fuselage center line. In addition to the main landing gear the aircraft has a tail skid and wing tip skids {{in the form of}} tubular loops.|$|R
