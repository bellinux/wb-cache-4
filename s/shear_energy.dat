30|$|<b>Shearing</b> <b>energy</b> {{is easily}} quantifiable, {{and it is}} {{therefore}} tempting {{to use it as}} measure of suitable tool clearance. There was a slight minimum of the required <b>shearing</b> <b>energy</b> when <b>shearing</b> with parallel tools (Fig. 11). Most likely, shearing with rake angles also has an energy minimum; the energies decreases toward 0.20 h clearance, but 0.20 h was not large enough to show the increase in energy that likely follows at some larger clearance. The reliability of the data point at 0.20 h in the curve for 1 ° rake angle is questionable because of the stepwise fracture and unstable clearance for that combination of shearing parameters. Redundant experiments on that parameter combination showed a variation in <b>shearing</b> <b>energy</b> that was not seen for other combinations. <b>Shearing</b> <b>energy</b> is a blunt tool to select a suitable clearance, but at least clearances outside of the relatively wide clearance range with an energy minimum may be excluded as suitable clearances. A low energy is, however, not necessarily always beneficial: shearing with two clamps required more energy compared to one clamp, and Gustafsson et al. (2016) showed that two clamps resulted in better sheared surface characteristics.|$|R

50|$|An SKS wave {{is a type}} of seismic wave, {{with the}} three letters {{denoting}} the type of wave-motion through the mantle and outer core. The first S indicates that the wave travels as a shear or s-wave through the mantle, the K shows that the wave travels as a compressional or p-wave though the outer core, and the final S indicates an s-wave, returning through the mantle. As shear waves cannot be transmitted through the liquid Outer core, some of the s-wave energy is converted to p-wave energy as the wave hits the Core-mantle boundary. When the wave hits the core-mantle boundary as it leaves the core, some energy is converted back to <b>shear</b> <b>energy</b> before the wave travels through the mantle.

40|$|Crude oil is {{generally}} produced with water, {{and the water}} cut produced by oil wells is increasingly common over their lifetime, so it is inevitable to create emulsions during oil production. However, the formation of emulsions presents a costly problem in surface process particularly, {{both in terms of}} transportation energy consumption and separation efficiency. To deal with the production and operational problems which are related to crude oil emulsions, especially to ensure the separation and transportation of crude oil-water systems, it is necessary to better understand the emulsification mechanism of crude oil under different conditions from the aspects of bulk and interfacial properties. The concept of <b>shearing</b> <b>energy</b> was introduced in this study to reveal the driving force for emulsification. The relationship between shearing stress in the flow field and interfacial tension (IFT) was established, and the correlation between <b>shearing</b> <b>energy</b> and interfacial Gibbs free energy was developed. The potential of the developed correlation model was validated using the experimental and field data on emulsification behavior. It was also shown how droplet deformation could be predicted from a random deformation degree and orientation angle. The results indicated that <b>shearing</b> <b>energy</b> as the <b>energy</b> produced by <b>shearing</b> stress working in the flow field is the driving force activating the emulsification behavior. The deformation degree and orientation angle of dispersed phase droplet are associated with the interfacial properties, rheological properties and the experienced turbulence degree. The correlation between shearing stress and IFT can be quantified if droplet deformation degree vs. droplet orientation angle data is available. When the water cut is close to the inversion point of waxy crude oil emulsion, the interfacial Gibbs free energy change decreased and the <b>shearing</b> <b>energy</b> increased. This feature is also presented in the special regions where the suddenly changed flow field can be formed. Hence, the <b>shearing</b> <b>energy</b> is an effective form that can show the contribution of kinetic energy for the oil-water mixtures to interfacial Gibbs free energy in emulsification process, and the emulsification mechanism of waxy crude oil-water emulsions was further explained from the theoretical level...|$|R
40|$|We numerically {{study the}} phase {{structure}} of {{two types of}} triangulated spherical surface models, which includes an in-plane <b>shear</b> <b>energy</b> in the Hamiltonian, {{and we found that}} the phase structure of the models is considerably influenced by the presence of the in-plane shear elasticity. The models undergo a first-order collapsing transition and a first-order (or second-order) transition of surface fluctuations; the latter transition was reported to be of second-order in the first model without the in-plane <b>shear</b> <b>energy.</b> This leads us to conclude that the in-plane elasticity strengthens the transition of surface fluctuations. We also found that the in-plane elasticity decreases the variety of phases in the second model without the in-plane energy. The Hamiltonian of the first model is given by a linear combination of the Gaussian bond potential, a one-dimensional bending energy, and the in-plane <b>shear</b> <b>energy.</b> The second model is obtained from the first model by replacing the Gaussian bond potential with the Nambu-Goto potential, which is defined by the summation over the area of triangles.

40|$|Summary. Measurements of Q for {{modes of}} free {{oscillation}} {{provide the most}} accurate information about the anelastic properties of the whole Earth in the period range from 100 to 3000 s. We have obtained more than 230 Q measurements, by using two different techniques. Individual LaCoste-Romberg gravimeter recordings of three large earthquakes were used to observe the time rate of decay of spectral peaks corresponding to different modes. This method provided measurements of Q for 37 different modes. By stacking 21 1 WWSSN recordings of two deep earthquakes, {{we were able to}} measure Q for 197 modes, including many overtones which cannot be analysed using the spectra of individual recordings. We inverted these data to obtain models of the distribution of Q in the mantle. Inversion in the data space can provide smooth models of the variation of Q in the mantle, without being subject to the bias of pre-conceived model parameterization. The data-space inversion experiments gave no indication of large variations of Q in the lower mantle, and provided an indication of the resolution attained by our data. We show that the data are consistent with very simple Q models of the mantle. The data for modes dominated by <b>shear</b> <b>energy</b> can be satisfied by models with constant Q;' (attenuation of <b>shear</b> <b>energy)</b> in two regions: the upper mantle in which Q, is about 110, and the lower mantle below 670 km, in which Q, is a little below 400. The average Q, of the mantle is about 210. Models in which only <b>shear</b> <b>energy</b> is dissipated do not satisfy our observations of Q for radial modes.

Pre-treatments were carried out with calcium, low methoxyl pectin, a combined solution, and results compared with untreated control fruits. Kramer shear, back extrusion, compression, and multiple penetration tests were used to measure rheological behavior. One-hundred mM CaCl 2 reduced the long and short-term frozen storage induced loss of firmness. For long-term storage at - 18 °C, a softening of the tissue became evident between 3 and 12 months and at each date test the stored fruits were firmer than those without storage. For short-term storage with fluctuations, the loss of firmness was evident between 0 and 24 days, and at all the testing dates the stored fruits were softer than those without storage. Results evidenced a higher cell damage in the short-term frozen storage. Coefficients of softening per day suffering fluctuation were determined, the highest values being given by Kramer <b>shear</b> <b>energy</b> and back extrusion maximum force (> 1 %). Short-term frozen storage affected physical and physico-chemical characteristics, increasing the saturation (r) and the anthocyanins and decreasing the ascorbic acid of the raspberries.

Textural properties of poultry breast meat were predicted by near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy.

Optical NDE (Nondestructive Evaluation) {{techniques}} such as ESPI (Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometer) and shearography that are non-contact and real-time method are used to detect the defects in material. However, ESPI measurement is affected by disturbance such as rigid body motion, and has difficulty in recognizing the real shape {{and size of the}} defect. Shearography also involves several problems like it needs several operator-dependent factors including the amount of shearing and shearing direction for the quantitative analysis of internal defect, and it does not show the exact shape of the defect. In order to overcome these problems and evaluate the internal defect quantitatively in this study, the imaging of the inner defect based on the ESPI technique is proposed. In this method, the external perturbative load such as thermal load is induced to the specimen, and the deformation distribution of the specimen is measured by ESPI. Then the distribution of the <b>shear</b> strain <b>energy</b> is obtained by the strain analysis of the ESPI measurement result. On the edge of the defect, the <b>shear</b> strain <b>energy</b> is concentrated, so we can obtain the outline of the internal defect by following the peak point of the <b>shear</b> strain <b>energy</b> distribution.
