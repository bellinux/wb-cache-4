5|$|A further {{source of}} {{difference}} between Anne and James was the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the Anglican communion at her English coronation.

5|$|Archbishop Laurence of Canterbury persuaded Eadbald {{to accept}} Christianity {{and give up}} his wife. He then remarried, and his second wife, {{according}} to Kentish tradition recorded in the 'Kentish Royal Legend', was a woman named Ymme of Frankish royal blood, though recently {{it has been suggested}} that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> have instead been the daughter of Erchinoald, mayor of the palace in Neustria, the western part of Francia.|$|E

5|$|By tradition, Anna {{is said to}} {{have had}} a fourth daughter, Wihtburh, an abbess at Dereham (or {{possibly}} West Dereham), where there was a royal double monastery. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> never have existed: Bede fails to mention her and she first appears in a calendar in the late 10th century Bosworth Psalter. <b>She</b> <b>may</b> have been a character specifically created by the religious community at Ely, where her remains were supposed to have been taken after being stolen from Dereham and subsequently used as visual proof of the incorruptibility of a saint's body, a substitute for her sister Æthelthryth, whose body had to remain unexamined in her tomb. Manuscript F of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which dates from about 1100, mentions Wihtburh's death when it records that her body was found uncorrupted in 798, 55 years after she died. The resulting date for her death of 743 is too far too late for her to have been a sister of Æthelthryth, who was born in 636.|$|E

Though she was reported to have been a Protestant {{at the time of her}} death, evidence suggests that <b>she</b> <b>may</b> have converted to Catholicism sometime in her life.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the anti-Semitic passages in her memoir were intended to be used as evidence that she was not Jewish; alternatively, <b>she</b> <b>may</b> have been influenced by Ezra Pound's anti-Semitic radio broadcasts.

By {{the end of the war}} her sympathies had again changed, and she saw the Allies as liberators.|$|E
