5|$|From 1910 {{until his}} death from typhoid fever in 1912, Wilbur took the {{leading role in the}} patent struggle, {{traveling}} incessantly to consult with lawyers and testify in what he felt was a moral cause, particularly against Curtiss, who was creating a large company to manufacture aircraft. The Wrights' preoccupation with the legal issue stifled their work on new designs, and by 1911 Wright airplanes were considered inferior to those of European makers. Indeed, aviation development in the U.S. was suppressed {{to such an extent that}} when the U.S. entered World War I no acceptable American-designed airplanes were available, and U.S. forces were compelled to use French machines. Orville and Katharine Wright believed Curtiss was partly responsible for Wilbur's premature death, which occurred in the wake of his exhausting travels and the <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal battle.|$|E
5|$|In St. Tammany Parish, the storm's {{effects were}} mainly limited to wind damage: gusts reached 48mph (77km/h), {{knocking}} down trees and power lines. A storm surge of 4.3ft (1.3m) flooded 20 {{homes in the}} parish. Winds in Jefferson Parish gusted up to 55mph (88km/h), causing minor roof damage and power outages. In Orleans Parish, a storm surge of 5.81ft (1.77m) destroyed 85 fishing camps constructed on wooden pilings. Winds gusting up to 68mph (109km/h) left 80,000 residences without power in the parish. Throughout the state, a total of 160,000 homes and businesses lost power due to the hurricane. Georges is blamed for three indirect fatalities; two men collapsed and died due to medical conditions aggravated by the <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evacuation, and another died {{as the result of}} a house fire sparked by an emergency candle that was tipped over. Damages from the storm totaled approximately $30.1million.|$|E
5|$|In {{the true}} ending, Junpei learns that the {{previous}} Nonary Game consisted of nine pairs of kidnapped siblings separated onto the ocean-bound Gigantic and in a mock-up in Building Q in the Nevada desert. The game was designed to explore morphic fields; the research anticipated that the <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game would activate the fields between siblings, allowing solutions solved by one to be sent via these fields to their counterpart at the other location. This research was to help Ace cure his prosopagnosia. This Nonary Game went awry: Akane and her brother Santa were placed at the same location instead of being separated, and Seven discovered the kidnappings and rescued the children from the ship. Ace grabbed Akane before they could escape, and forced her into the incinerator room where she faced a sudoku puzzle {{that she could not}} solve, and apparently died.|$|E

Tom Quinn (Matthew Macfadyen) questions him in hospital, learning that the mullah is recruiting suicide bombers, however the <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> questioning results in a cerebral hemorrhage. Superior Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) pressures Tom to find another agent.

She is surprised and thrilled when he returns home with his prison sentence lifted, but Homer feels guilt for Fat Tony's death and bitterness toward the government over being used to bring him down. Homer visits Fat Tony's grave to apologize, but is kidnapped by his cousin Fit Tony, who plans to kill him for revenge. However, Fit Tony spares his life after Homer tells {{of the time he}} and Fat Tony spent together, seeing that Fat Tony lives on in Homer's memories.

5|$|The {{following}} month, Babe begins blackmailing Les anonymously. Les' wife, Pam Coker (Lin Blakley), realises Babe is the blackmailer, but is too {{ashamed to}} report it so Babe continues to increase the blackmail amount. Babe later threatens to reveal photos of Les crossdressing, causing Pam to humiliate herself while the <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blackmail causes Les to suffer a heart attack. When Babe discovers that Abi and Lee had sex and that Abi has passed on an STI to Lee's pregnant girlfriend, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Babe badly burns Abi's hand. After the fling is exposed, Abi informs the Carter family about Babe's involvement and the family subsequently disown her. At a low ebb, Babe begins blackmailing the Cokers again, despite the recent death of their grandson, Paul, as well as threatening Abi. Pam eventually confides in Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas) about the blackmail and she threatens Babe to stop it.|$|E
5|$|The {{trust the}} Archduke placed in Schmitt was briefly {{interrupted}} in 1799 {{when he was}} connected, by rumor, to the 29 April assassination of the French delegates to the Congress of Rastatt. The assassination occurred as the delegation was leaving the city. The official investigation into the assassination placed enormous pressure on Schmitt, {{to such an extent}} that he briefly resigned as Charles' Chief of Staff, but he was quickly reinstated. On 1 March 1800, Schmitt was promoted to Feldmarschallleutnant, but later in that year, the Archduke was himself replaced as commander-in-chief by Field Marshal Pál Kray. Although Schmitt remained on Kray's staff, he again requested retirement, claiming he was tired and could no longer cope with the <b>stress</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> job. In reality, he and Kray's Quartermaster General, Generalmajor Johann Gabriel Chasteler de Courcelles, seldom saw eye-to-eye on any of the main issues facing the army and Kray relied more on Chasteler than on Schmitt. His request was initially refused, but on 19 August 1800, Emperor Francis II approved the petition when Kray seconded it. Schmitt went first to Vienna and then Hostitz at Kromeriz, near Brno. There he lived with his old friend Ferdinand Ritter von Geißlern until 1805.|$|E

40|$|Before {{going into}} {{acoustic}} harmonic generation, I should bring to your attention <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> internal <b>stresses</b> {{which was made}} about 40 years ago. Basically, we have to distinguish between two kinds <b>of</b> internal <b>stresses.</b> Internal <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first kind are those which spread out over macroscopic distances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> millimeters. Applying x-rays, one obtains a line shift in the Bragg reflection due to a lattice parameter change. A simple example <b>of</b> internal <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first kind is shown in Fig. 1, top: in bending a piece of material elastically, a line shift in the Bragg reflection will {{be found on the}} upper and lower surface. Internal <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second kind are restricted to much, much smaller dimensions, say <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> 1 um or below. Bragg reflection does not show a line shift, but merely a line broadeninq. A typical example is shown in Fig. 1, bottom. Assume dislocations are distributed in a material. The· variation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elastic <b>stress</b> field surrounding the dislocations is assumed to be sinusoidal and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periodicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dislocation arrangement. If another dislocation is pushed against this chain of dislocations, it will see <b>the</b> <b>stress</b> field <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dislocation arrangement. In work hardening theories, this model is used to calculate the work hardening coefficient. The present paper will be concerned mainly with <b>the</b> internal <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second kind...|$|R

40|$|Micro {{residual}} <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{second and}} third order {{play an important role}} in the fracture mechanical analysis of thermally-cycled materials, and thus in lifetime analysis of such effected components. For example, forming rollers in a rolling plant made of white cast iron can develop cracking due to stress risers caused by thermal-induced residual stresses. After long-term service exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low-alloy, heat-resistant ferritic steels damage was observed during operation, caused by <b>the</b> precipitation <b>of</b> copper particles ranging from 1 to 3 nm in size which are surrounded by coherent residual microstresses of third order. In multi-phase materials can exist two kind of micro residual stresses: thermal-induced residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second order and coherent residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> third order. In multi-phase materials, thermal-induced <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second order appear when individual material phases exhibit different thermal expansion coefficients. Such differences in temperature-related expansion coefficients of cementite and ferrite in steel and white cast iron promote <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> these types <b>of</b> residual <b>stresses.</b> These differences below <b>the</b> Curie point <b>of</b> cementite grow with decreasing temperature and therefore, <b>the</b> largest variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residual <b>stresses</b> can be assumed at ambient temperatures. In multi-phase materials, coherent residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third order appear when <b>the</b> lattice parameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second phase particles embedded coherently in the matrix and <b>the</b> lattice parameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix are different. Such differences in the ferritic Cu containing materials between <b>the</b> lattice parameters <b>of</b> coherent Cu particles and <b>the</b> lattice parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> matrix yield to distortion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lattice around the Cu particles that causes <b>the</b> coherent residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> third order. <b>The</b> main objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> here discussed research was to develop a micro-magnetic non-destructive method for quantitative characterisation and separation <b>of</b> microscopic residual <b>stresses</b> <b>of</b> {{second and third}} order in multi-phase, iron-based material...|$|R
