50|$|Some weaverbirds, e.g. the black-throated weaver (Ploceus benghalensis) and the <b>streaked</b> <b>weaver</b> (P. manyar), highly value Lantana {{flowers for}} decorating their nests. An ability to procure {{spectacular}} and innovative decorations {{appears to be}} desired by females, and consequently is {{an indicator of the}} males' fitness.|$|E
50|$|The <b>streaked</b> <b>weaver</b> (Ploceus manyar) is {{a species}} of weaver bird found in South Asia and South-east Asia in the {{countries}} of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam and also introduced in Qatar and United Arab Emirates (UAE). These are not as common as the baya weaver but are similar looking but have streaked underparts.|$|E
5000|$|Nest: Similar to the {{streaked}} weaver; somewhat {{smaller and}} normally with shorter entrance tubes. Built in reed-beds in marsh, often moonj or kans (Saccharum spontaneum), {{with some of}} the growing reeds incorporated into the dome as support. Entrance tube is somewhat shorter than Baya weavers (up to about 25 cm). At the 'helmet' stage of construction a quantity of wet mud or cowdung is daubed thickly along the edge, with bright coloured scarlet or orange flowers or flower petals (Lantana, Lagerstroemia) incorporated; observations suggest that {{this is part of the}} courtship rituals and exercise a direct influence on the reactions of the visiting female, both for this species and the <b>streaked</b> <b>weaver.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Behaviour: Polygynous; colonial; on {{the whole}} {{similar to those of}} the Baya and <b>streaked</b> <b>weavers.</b>|$|R
