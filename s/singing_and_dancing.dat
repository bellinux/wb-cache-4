5|$|By {{incorporating}} R infused beats in {{the music}} and not including her image on the cover artwork, marketing for the song {{gave the impression of}} Madonna as a black artist.

The low-budget video directed by Ed Steinberg showed Madonna and her friends in a club <b>singing</b> <b>and</b> <b>dancing</b> to the song. The video helped to further promote the song and Madonna as an artist.|$|E
