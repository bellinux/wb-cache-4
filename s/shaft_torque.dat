Therefore {{it is necessary}} to study the reliability of the <b>torque</b> <b>shaft.</b> First, the parameterized <b>torque</b> <b>shaft</b> model was built on Inventor and simple parametric analysis of the <b>torque</b> <b>shaft</b> was done by its finite element analysis module. The unloading groove depth 5. 079 mm met the overload protection requirements. Then the model was imported into professional finite element analysis software Algor to verify the results. Linear statics analysis in Algor showed that when unloading groove depth valued 5. 479 mm the <b>torque</b> <b>shaft</b> would be broken once the shearer overload.

40|$|With the {{projected}} growth of wind {{energy in the}} United States expected to account for 20 % of the energy portfolio by 2030, it can be expected that wind turbines will not only increase in number, but also in size. This increase in size implies that internal components, such as the gearbox, will also increase to handle the higher loads. And given the high failure rates for gearbox components already in existence, one could expect more failure if nothing is done to improve reliability. It {{is well known that}} wind loading is not constant, rather it is random and ultimately causes fatigue loading. This thesis is concerned with studying what the effects of dynamic loading are on a smaller gear system. It is assumed {{the findings of this study}} can be scaled to a larger wind turbine system. A simple spur gear pair is first simulated at constant loading to establish a baseline and then run with a sinusoidal input with differing amplitudes and frequencies. The hypothesis is that by varying the amplitude and frequency, the responses for gear contact force and input and output <b>shaft</b> <b>torques</b> will also vary. And if these variations are noted, then conclusions may be drawn as how the frequency and amplitude influence the system. After which, it may then be correlated to a wind turbine system. Knowing what affects the frequency and amplitude have on a smaller system may help to establish guidelines. For this model, mechanical simulation software is used to build a multibody dynamics model of a spur gear system with flexible shafts. Using known wind data obtained near Amarillo, TX, a matrix of possible frequencies and amplitudes for a sinusoidal input are implemented and the solutions compared to those at constant loading. It was found that the system responded similarly regardless of input, showing RMS values for accelerations of approximately 50 m/s 2, gear contact forces of 520 N, input <b>shaft</b> <b>torques</b> of 42 Nm, and output <b>shaft</b> <b>torques</b> of 78 Nm.

A shaft that can torque easily is less forgiving of off-center shots as it will allow the head to twist, causing pulls and pushes. Low-torque shafts resist twisting for more forgiving behavior, but tend to be stiffer and require more power for proper distance. The latest generation of driver shafts combine a flexible shaft with a stiff tip, giving the golfer the required flex to [...] "whip" [...] into the ball while reducing clubhead twisting.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the dynamic {{response}} of the induction machine to low-frequency perturbations in the <b>shaft</b> <b>torque,</b> supply voltage and supply frequency. Also the response of a two-machine group connected to a weak grid is investigated. The results predicted by various induction machine models are compared with measurements performed on a laboratory set-up. Furthermore, the influence of machine and grid parameters, machine temperature, phase-compensating capacitors, skin effect, saturation level and operating points is studied. The results predicted by the fifth-order non-linear Park model agree well with the measured induction machine responses to <b>shaft</b> <b>torque,</b> supply frequency and voltage magnitude perturbations. To determine the electric power response to very low-frequency perturbations in {{the magnitude of the}} supply voltage, the Park model must be modified to take varying iron losses into account. The temperature and supply frequency affect the low-frequency dynamics of the induction machine significantly while the influence of saturation, phase-compensating capacitors, skin effect and static <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> is of less importance to an ordinary industrial machine. The static <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> is, however, of importance for determining the responses to voltage magnitude perturbations. The performance of reduced-order induction machine models depends on the type of induction machine investigated. Best suited to be represented by reduced-order models are high-slip machines as well as machines that have a low ratio between the stator resistance and leakage reactances. A first-order model can predict the rotor speed, electrodynamic torque and electric power responses to <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> and supply frequency perturbations up to a perturbation frequency of at least 1 Hz.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} implementation of a <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> measurement system for the Oxford Turbine Research Facility (formerly the Turbine Test Facility (TTF) at QinetiQ, Farnborough), or OTRF. As part of the recent EU TATEF II programme, the facility was upgraded to allow turbine efficiency measurements to be performed. A <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> measurement system was developed as part of this upgrade. The system is unique in that, to the authors' knowledge, it provided the first direct measurement of <b>shaft</b> <b>torque</b> in a transient turbine facility although the system has wider applicability to rotating test facilities in which power measurement is a requirement. The adopted approach removes the requirement to quantify bearing friction, which can be difficult to accurately calibrate under representative operating conditions. The OTRF is a short duration (approximately 0. 4 s run time) isentropic light-piston facility capable of matching all of the non-dimensional parameters important for aerodynamic and heat studies, namely Mach number, Reynolds number, non-dimensional speed, stage pressure ratio and gas-to-wall temperature ratio. The single-stage MT 1 turbine used for this study is a highly loaded unshrouded design, and as such is relevant to modern military, or future civil aero-engine design. <b>Shaft</b> <b>torque</b> was measured directly using a custom-built strain gauge-based torque measurement system in the rotating frame of reference.
