50|$|The {{three main}} {{elements}} of a typical planetary roller screw are the <b>screw</b> shaft, <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> planetary roller. The screw, a shaft with a multi-start V-shaped thread, provides a helical raceway for multiple rollers radially arrayed around the <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> encapsulated by a threaded nut. The thread of the screw is typically identical to the internal thread of the nut. The rollers spin in contact with, and serve as low-friction <b>transmission</b> elements between <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut.</b> The rollers typically have a single-start thread with convex flanks that limit friction at the rollers' contacts with <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut.</b> The rollers typically orbit the screw as they spin (in the manner of planet gears to sun gear), and are thus known as planetary, or satellite, rollers. As with a lead screw or ball screw, rotation of the nut results in <b>screw</b> travel, <b>and</b> rotation of the screw results in nut travel.|$|R

40|$|Toggle jacks {{are simple}} {{mechanisms}} {{used to drive}} large loads short distances and to lift the heavy loads. It also have the advanced feature of rotating the parts about their axis where {{there is not enough}} space to move the load. The power screw design of a common Toggle jack reduces the amount of force required by the user to drive the mechanism. Most of the Toggle jacks are similar in design, consisting of eight main members out of whom four are driven by a power <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> rest of four by loading condition. In this report, a unique design of a Toggle jack is used to lift the heavy loads at the stable state with the unique condition. In toggle jack <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut</b> are main components. A screw is moving part <b>and</b> <b>nut</b> is a stationary part. Both the parts always work in meshing condition. Therefore there are stresses like shear and tensile stresses induced in materials which are responsible for failure of screw. While a nut has bearing stress. Different materials of <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut</b> can induce different magnitude of stresses so it is necessary to select a pair of material combination {{in such a way that}} a pair gives induced stress within safe limit. Here we have taken different material combinations of <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut</b> & based on that analytical design is done for on different loading condition from 1 KN to 5 KN. It is also assumed that the nominal diameter of <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> material for link are same for all loads...|$|R

5000|$|Older designs use {{two main}} principles: the worm and sector design <b>and</b> the <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut.</b> Both types were {{enhanced}} {{by reducing the}} friction; for <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut</b> it is the recirculating ball mechanism, which is still found on trucks and utility vehicles. The steering column turns a large screw which meshes with nut by recirculating balls. The nut moves a sector of a gear, causing it to rotate about its axis as the screw is turned; an arm attached to the axis of the sector moves the Pitman arm, which {{is connected to the}} steering linkage and thus steers the wheels. The recirculating ball version of this apparatus reduces the considerable friction by placing large ball bearings between the <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> the nut; {{at either end of the}} apparatus the balls exit from between the two pieces into a channel internal to the box which connects them with the other end of the apparatus, thus they are [...] "recirculated".|$|R
50|$|The {{circulating}} balls travel {{inside the}} thread {{form of the}} <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut,</b> <b>and</b> balls are recirculated through various types of return mechanisms. If the ball nut {{did not have a}} return mechanism the balls would fall out {{of the end of the}} ball nut when they reached the end of the nut. For this reason several different recirculation methods have been developed.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{ball screw}} {{frequently}} {{used to drive}} or translate the parts on the precision machine, such as machine tool and motorized stage. Therefore they were most frequently used on the precision machine, semiconductor equipment, medical instrument and aero industry. The main parts of ball screw are <b>screw,</b> ball <b>and</b> <b>nut.</b> The contact angle between the <b>screw,</b> ball <b>and</b> <b>nut</b> will affect the performance (include loading and noise) and lifecycle of a ball screw. If the actual contact angle and the designed contact angle are not the same, the friction between the ball, <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut</b> will increase <b>and</b> it {{will result in the}} thermal increase and lifecycle decrease. This paper combines the traditional profile projector and commercial digital camera to build an imaging based and noncontact measurements system. It can implement the contact angle measurement quickly and accurately. Three different pitch angles of ball screws were completed tests in this paper. The angle resolution of this measurement system is about 0. 001 degree and its accuracy is about 0. 05 degree...|$|R

This is the case when the flanks of the threads come into intimate contact with one another, before the roots and crests do, if at all.|$|R
50|$|In this {{mechanism}} the reversing rod {{is controlled by}} a <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut,</b> worked by a wheel in the cab. The nut either operates on the reversing rod directly or through a lever, as above. The <b>screw</b> <b>and</b> <b>nut</b> may be cut with a double thread and a coarse pitch to move the mechanism as quickly as possible. The wheel is fitted with a locking lever to prevent creep {{and there is an}} indicator to show the percentage of cutoff in use. This method of altering the cutoff offers finer control than the sector lever, but it has the disadvantage of slow operation. It is most suitable for long-distance passenger engines where frequent changes of cutoff are not required and where fine adjustments offer the most benefit. On locomotives fitted with Westinghouse air brake equipment and Stephenson valve gear, it was common to use the screw housing as an air cylinder, with the nut extended to form a piston. Compressed air from the brake reservoirs was applied {{to one side of the}} piston to reduce the effort required to lift the heavy expansion link, with gravity assisting in the opposite direction.|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{workbenches}} where the wooden screw in the vise {{is out of}} order {{after many years of}} use. To make new <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts</b> you need two tools, a screwbox to make the external threads and a tap to make the internal threads in the nut. The screwbox is a nut with internal threads where a v-shaped cutter has been placed in a precise position so that the external threads will go with the internal threads. In this essay details of great importance to obtain a well function screw are examined. Yellow birch has been used for the <b>screws</b> <b>and</b> <b>nuts.</b> Screwboxes with only one cutter has been examined and used. Details concerning the features of the tap have not been examined further. Ten screws of different age and eleven old screwboxes have been examined. The screwboxes have been drawn in scale 1 : 1. A test showing what importance the wood of the screw has to the result of the screw has been made. One old screwbox has been renovated and one has been made from pieces of birch and with a v-cutter from an old screwbox in order to detect details that affect the result of the screw.
