5000|$|Due to its low cost, {{most large}} cargo vessels are powered by bunker fuel {{also known as}} Heavy Fuel Oil which {{contains}} higher sulphur levels than diesel. [...] This level of pollution is accelerating: with bunker fuel consumption at 278 million tonnes per year in 2001, it is projected to be at 500 million tonnes per year in 2020.

Among some of the solutions offered is changing over the fuel intake to clean diesel or marine gas oil, while in restricted waters and Cold Ironing the ship while it is in port. The process of removing sulphur from the fuel impacts the viscosity and lubricity of the marine gas oil though, which could cause damage in the engine fuel pump. The fuel viscosity can be raised by cooling the fuel down.

This allows starting and stopping engines depending on power demand and improves the fuel efficiency as the engines can run at their nominal power. The service speed of the vessel is 27 kn.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} metal manipulation {{was probably}} hammering (Craddock 1995, 1999), where copper ore was pounded into thin sheets. Beneficiation, or {{the process of}} ’making better’ could be carried out on the ore (if there were large enough pieces of metal separate from mineral) or after melting, where the prills of metal could be hand picked from the cooled slag. Melting beneficiated metal also allowed early metallurgists to use moulds and casts to form shapes of molten metal (Craddock 1995). Many of the metallurgical skills developed in the Bronze Age were still in use during the Roman times. Melting—the process of using heat to separate slag and metal, Smelting—using a reduced oxygen heated environment to separate metal oxides into metal and carbon dioxide, Roasting—process of using an oxygen rich environment to isolate <b>sulphur</b> <b>oxide</b> from metal oxide which can then be smelted, Casting—pouring liquid metal into a mould to make an object, Hammering—using blunt force to make a thin sheet which can be annealed or shaped, and Cupellation—separating metal alloys to isolate a specific metal—were all techniques which were well understood (Zwicker 1985, Tylecote 1962, Craddock 1995). However, the Romans provided few new technological advances other than the use of iron and the cupellation and granulation in the separation of gold alloys (Tylecote 1962).|$|E

Dual fuel engines are fueled by either marine grade diesel, heavy fuel oil, or liquefied natural gas (LNG). A Marine LNG Engine has multiple fuel options, allowing vessels to transit without relying on one type of fuel. Studies show that LNG is the most efficient of fuels, although limited access to LNG fueling stations limits the production of such engines. Vessels providing services in the LNG industry have been retrofitted with dual-fuel engines, and have been proved to be extremely effective. Benefits of dual-fuel engines include fuel and operational flexibility, high efficiency, low emissions, and operational cost advantages.Liquefied natural gas engines offer the marine transportation industry with an environmentally friendly alternative to provide power to vessels. In 2010, STX Finland and Viking Line signed an agreement to begin construction on what would be the largest environmentally friendly cruise ferry. Construction of NB 1376 will be completed in 2013. According to Viking Line, vessel NB 1376 will primarily be fueled by liquefied natural gas. Vessel NB 1376 nitrogen oxide emissions will be almost zero, and <b>sulphur</b> <b>oxide</b> emissions will be at least 80% below the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) standards.Company profits from tax cuts and operational cost advantages has led to the gradual growth of LNG fuel use in engines.|$|E

Consequently, prices on low sulphur fuels are expected to increase drastically compared to those of heavy fuel oil, giving ship owners a strong incentive to find alternative ways of complying with the legislations. In addition, IMO regulations on carbon dioxide emissions and high fuel prices provide incentives for improving the efficiency of the machinery system. The wet sulphuric acid process has shown to be an effective way of removing <b>sulphur</b> <b>oxides</b> from flue gas of land-based coal fired power plants. Moreover, organic Rankine cycles are suitable for heat to power conversion for low temperature heat sources. This paper is aimed at designing and modelling a highly efficient machinery system which includes the removal of exhaust gas <b>sulphur</b> <b>oxides.</b> Numerical simulations are carried out using an open source software developed at Technical University of Denmark called Dynamic Network Analysis (DNA). The machinery system suggested in this paper consists of a two-stroke diesel engine, the wet sulphuric process for sulphur removal and an advanced waste heat recovery system including a conventional steam Rankine cycle and an organic Rankine cycle. The results are compared with those of a state-of-the-art machinery system featuring a two-stroke diesel engine and a conventional waste heat recovery system. The results suggest that an organic Rankine cycle placed after the conventional waste heat recovery system is able to extract the sulphuric acid from the exhaust gas, {{while at the same time}} increase power generation from waste heat by 32. 9 % and the combined cycle thermal efficiency by 2. 6 %.

40|$|The {{realisation}} of coal based oxyfuel processes requires – as {{any other}} process based on a sulphur containing fuel – an efficient flue gas desulphurisation. Especially for the highly efficient membrane based process variants with hot flue gas recirculation {{as well as for}} fluidised bed combustions (independent of the kind of oxygen supply) direct desulphurisation with lime based sorbents is an interesting option. However, due to the increased partial pressure of carbon dioxide sorbents behave differently than in air fired processes. Therefore at first the theoretical determination of the conditions, which can be expected in oxyfuel furnaces, is deducted extensively. Subsequently, the experimental results are presented, which have been acquired by measurements in a fluidised bed reactor, which operates with synthetic flue gas. The influence of the following parameters on the direct desulphurisation in oxyfuel flue gases has been investigated: kind of sorbent, water content, sorbent particle size, temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, oxygen concentration and <b>sulphur</b> <b>oxide</b> concentration. Calcium carbonate, calcium hydroxide and calcium oxide have been used as sorbents. The sorbent particle diameter has been varied between < 50 µm and 355 µm, the temperature between 850 °C and 975 °C. Carbon dioxide and oxygen percentages from 50 vol% to 80 vol% and from 0. 75 vol% to 4. 5 vol%, respectively, have been studied. <b>Sulphur</b> <b>oxide</b> concentrations have been set between 250 ppm and 600 ppm. The influence of water vapour in the flue gas has been investigated by comparing measurements in dry and wet conditions.
