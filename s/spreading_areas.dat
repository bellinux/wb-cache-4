40|$|AbstractMechanical cues can {{influence}} {{the manner in which}} cells generate traction forces and form focal adhesions. The stiffness of a cell’s substrate and the available area on which it can spread {{can influence}} its generation of traction forces, but to what extent these factors are intertwined is unclear. In this study, we used microcontact printing and micropost arrays to control cell spreading, substrate stiffness, and post density to assess their effect on traction forces and focal adhesions. We find that both the <b>spread</b> <b>area</b> and the substrate stiffness influence traction forces in an independent manner, but these factors have opposite effects: cells on stiffer substrates produce higher average forces, whereas cells with larger <b>spread</b> <b>areas</b> generate lower average forces. We show that post density influences the generation of traction forces {{in a manner that is}} more dominant than the effect of <b>spread</b> <b>area.</b> Additionally, we observe that focal adhesions respond to <b>spread</b> <b>area,</b> substrate stiffness, and post density in a manner that closely matches the trends seen for traction forces. This work supports the notion that traction forces and focal adhesions have a close relationship in their response to mechanical cues...|$|R

Modifications of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces are employed to alter the mechanical stimuli applied to the cells. Flat substrates are first studied and then micropillared substrates are designed, fabricated, and tested as a method to alter the mechanical properties of the PDMS surfaces. Molds with micro-pillars are designed then fabricated from silicon using deep reactive ion etching. From these molds, a negative then a positive replicate is made using PDMS. The pillared PDMS substrates are fabricated in 10 geometries and used for experiments. A 549 cells are cultured on these surfaces then analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fluorescence microscopy images processed by ImageJ software measure the cell <b>spreading</b> <b>area</b> (m 2) while AFM quantifies the cell stiffness (kPa).

40|$|The {{migration}} of radionuclides and volatile chemicals through a thick sequence of unsaturated basalts and sedimentary interbeds has been documented in the Subsurface Disposal Area (SDA) at the Radioactive Waste Management Complex (RWMC) of the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL). The three mechanisms by which this migration may have occurred are seasonal infiltration from the ground surface within the SDA; flood events in 1962, 1969, and 1982; and the lateral movement {{of water from the}} <b>spreading</b> <b>areas</b> located nearby. It is currently thought that the contaminants migrated through the unsaturated sediments and basalt flows during the three flood events. Transducers were used to monitor water level changes in seven wells: Two completed in a perched zone associated with an interbed at 110 feet (34 meters), and five completed in a perched zone associated with an interbed at 240 feet (73 meters). The data suggest that one of the wells completed in the perched zone associated with the interbed at 110 feet receives recharge from seasonal infiltration at the ground surface. This recharge occurs primarily from February to May. Snowmelt is the major source of water for infiltration. One water sample was taken from this well, one water sample was taken from snowmelt at the surface within the SDA, and one water sample was taken from the Big Lost River, which is the source of water diverted into the <b>spreading</b> <b>areas.</b> The three water samples were analyzed for major ions, minor ions, and trace constituents. The water sample from the well was more similar chemically to the water sample from the snowmelt than to the water sample from the Big Lost River. The chemical data support the conclusion that the snowmelt is the source of recharge to the perched zone associated with the interbed at 110 feet. The transducer data from the five wells completed in the perched zone associated with the interbed at 240 feet indicate that one well is dry, and one well has standing water that showed virtually no change in water level. Two of the remaining wells showed seasonal recharge, probably from precipitation. These two wells, and the remaining well, showed rapid water-level rises, and declines, shortly after 157 acre-feet (194, 000 m 3) of water were diverted into the <b>spreading</b> <b>areas.</b> The perched water body associated with the interbed at 240 feet probably receives recharge from both precipitation and from water diverted into the <b>spreading</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|E

40|$|There {{are around}} 600 riding schools in Sweden {{and the horse}} manure must be managed in some way. To see {{the extent to which}} the {{handling}} of horse manure can be regarded as a problem both for the environment and for the riding school the purpose of this study has been to investigate how riding schools handle horse manure that is produced, the factors that influence the choice of handling option, and the businesses’ satisfaction with the chosen handling option. A mixed design using both quantitative and qualitative methods was used in order to answer the research questions. Data was collected through interviews and the content of the interviews was subject to analysis and interpretation. Most riding schools argued that the selection of handling options was either based on environmental/recycling aspects, or economic aspects. However, the availability of <b>spreading</b> <b>areas</b> was found to be the underlying factor that determined the handling of horse manure. The results revealed that about half of the riding schools did not have access to their own <b>spreading</b> <b>areas.</b> These riding schools were mainly large businesses located in urban areas. They showed a tendency to be dissatisfied with handing over horse manure to farmers and/or entrepreneurs, and were interested in alternative solutions.

40|$|Recent {{concentration}} of indoor livestock farming in the Highlands of the Reunion Island generates environmental risks. Livestock effluent management {{is often difficult}} {{due to the lack}} of suitable <b>spreading</b> <b>areas</b> close to the farms. However, crop farms in the Lowlands are demanding organic matter to maintain soil fertility. This is the case of the locality of Grand-Het where pig and poultry effluents are intensively produced that should be exported towards the coastal zone where large areas of sugar-cane are available. This paper presents how we are supporting Grand-Ilet stakeholders to devise territorial management strategies of their wastes. To this end, a stepwise approach is being tested. First, the supply of animal wastes and the manage ment by farmers are characterized through farm surveys and agronomic expertise. Then, the crop demand is determined by using a GIS considering a large zone surrounding Grand-Ilet onto which several constraints are applied to eliminate unsuitable <b>spreading</b> <b>areas.</b> Comparing supply and demand enables one to draw gen-eral conclusions about the strategic choices to be considered. In the case of Grand-Ilet, distances between livestock farms and crop locations, and amounts of liquid manure to be processed, led one to consider implementing a treatment plant collectively managed by farmers. To devise sustainable management strategies for such a trade-off, we are developing a participatory approach based on several simulation models (spread-sheet, hybrid dynamical system, agent-based). These models, developed in our team, aim at tackling several decision-making issues: (i) Which treatment process should be chosen? (ii) How to supply it with raw wastes? (iii) How to best organise organic material fluxes amongst farms at the district level? Together with the description of those tools, each step of the approach is exemplified and the way of integrating the use of simulation models within the stakeholders' decision process is outlined...|$|E

40|$|Corrosion {{behaviour}} of composite refractories {{obtained from}} the addition of various amount of ZrSiO 4 into MgO-spinel was examined. Density and porosity values were measured. Corrosion tests of refractories had been carried out statically under standard conditions using cylindrical and square shaped samples in terms of determining the interaction with cement clinker. Corrosion resistance was determined by measuring penetration and <b>spreading</b> <b>areas</b> of the corroded regions of refractories. The influence of corrosion resistance based on the microstructural changes occurred {{as a result of}} solubilities of constituents in the interface of clinker-refractory for various regions was examined using SEM and the results were evaluated using EDX analysis. The incorporation of ZrSiO 4 into MgO-spinel increased the density values significantly due to the decrease in porosity. On the basis of microstructural characterisation carried out in the interface of clinker-refractory, the following observations were determined: i) the formation of ZrO 2 and Mg 2 SiO 4 phases among the MgO grains after sintering, ii) the formation of CaZrO 3 phase during penetration, iii) prevention of penetration by making a barrier effect against to clinker with the improvement in densification, and iv) the decrease in the amount of CaO and the increase in the quantity of MgO based on the EDX analysis made from clinker to refractory in a corroded region. As a result of those reasons indicated, the addition of ZrSiO 4 reduced the values of penetration and <b>spreading</b> <b>areas</b> of the corroded regions of refractories and improved the corrosion resistance.
